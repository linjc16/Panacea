Specifically, the model has assumed that the patient does not have any chronic diseases that may render them a poor risk for surgery or chemotherapy, when the eligibility criteria clearly state that patients will be excluded if they have \"Chronic disease such as heart, lung, liver, kidney, blood or metabolic disorders which may render the patient a poor risk for surgery or chemotherapy.\"\n\nThe patient note indicates that the patient has metastatic lesions on CXR, which would likely be considered a chronic disease that could render the patient a poor risk for surgery or chemotherapy.
