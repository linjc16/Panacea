Adults involved should include ECEs and staff for their insights on implementing the outdoor play practices. Children aged 2.5 to 6 years enrolled in these ELCCs, with obtained parental consent, are the primary participants. Data collection should integrate with daily routines, using observational methods for children and engaging staff and parents through non-disruptive feedback mechanisms. This comprehensive approach ensures the study is both effective and respectful of the participants' daily lives.",
