By including a placebo arm, researchers can control for the placebo effect and ensure that any observed effects are due to the active drug rather than other factors.\n\n2. Experimental: Dupilumab 300 mg Q2W\n- Participant Group/Arm: Participants who received dupilumab treatment.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Participants received dupilumab injections at a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1 followed by dupilumab injections of 300 mg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, along with background therapy of TCS/TCI at a stable dose.\nReasoning: This arm is the experimental group where the investigational drug, dupilumab, is administered to evaluate its efficacy and safety in treating prurigo nodularis. By comparing the outcomes in this arm to the placebo arm, researchers can determine the effectiveness of dupilumab in improving itch response, skin lesions, and quality of life in patients with inadequately controlled PN.

Aflibercept targets the VEGF pathway and is expected to inhibit angiogenesis more effectively than bevacizumab, which was used in the first-line therapy. FOLFIRI is a standard chemotherapy regimen for colorectal cancer. By combining these two treatments, the goal is to identify biomarkers predictive of clinical response to aflibercept in patients who have failed first-line therapy. This arm is essential for evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment and identifying potential biomarkers. |",

Sham Comparator: Macular Laser Photocoagulation Treatment (Control)\n- Participants will receive macular laser treatment at Baseline and then according to laser re-treatment criteria up to week 24. Participants will receive treatment with Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI) starting at week 24 if they met rescue criteria. Treatment with IAI once initiated was 3 initial monthly doses followed by Q8 week dosing.\n\n2. Experimental: Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI;EYLEA\u00ae;BAY86-5321) 2Q4\n- Participants will receive 2 milligrams (mg) Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection (IAI) every 4 weeks (2Q4) through week 24 followed by injections every 8 weeks (2Q8) through week 48. Participants in this group may receive laser rescue at week 36.",
