If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask. \n\nOutput full outcome measures:\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Adverse events (AEs) [including serious adverse events (SAEs) and ocular AEs, especially AEs due to intravitreal injection procedure] and adverse drug reactions (ADRs): This outcome measure is crucial in assessing the safety of the drug Aflibercept in real-world clinical practice. Since this is a post-marketing surveillance study, it is important to monitor and report any adverse events that may occur during the treatment period. By collecting data on AEs and ADRs, researchers can evaluate the safety profile of the drug and make any necessary adjustments to ensure patient safety. The 4-month time frame allows for a reasonable period to capture any immediate adverse events that may occur after treatment initiation.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measure:\n- Measurement of BCVA (prior to injection and performing other ocular assessments) by eye chart: Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) is a key measure of visual function and is essential in evaluating the efficacy of treatment for macular degeneration. By measuring BCVA before and after treatment, researchers can assess any improvements or changes in visual acuity in patients receiving Aflibercept. The 4-month or 8-month time frame allows for multiple assessments to track changes in BCVA over time.\n- Central retinal thickness by OCT with or without: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed information about the retinal structure, including central retinal thickness. Monitoring changes in central retinal thickness can help evaluate the response to treatment and assess disease progression. The 4-month or 8-month time frame allows for repeated measurements to track changes in retinal thickness over time.\n- Findings of FAG and/or ICAG: Fluorescein Angiography (FAG) and Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICAG) are imaging techniques used to assess retinal blood flow and detect abnormalities in the retina. These tests can provide valuable information about disease activity and response to treatment. By evaluating findings from FAG and/or ICAG, researchers can better understand the impact of Aflibercept on retinal health. The 4-month or 8-month time frame allows for multiple assessments to track changes in retinal blood flow and detect any abnormalities.\n- IOP (if performed, before/after injection): Intraocular Pressure (IOP) is an important measure in assessing the risk of glaucoma, a potential complication of intravitreal injections. Monitoring IOP before and after injection can help identify any changes that may occur as a result of treatment with Aflibercept. The 4-month or 8-month time frame allows for repeated measurements to track changes in IOP over time.\n- Measurement of fundus lesion by fundoscopy: Funduscopy is a visual examination of the back of the eye, including the retina and optic nerve. By measuring fundus lesions, researchers can assess the structural changes in the retina and monitor disease progression. The 4-month or 8-month time frame allows for repeated assessments to track changes in fundus lesions over time.\n- Adverse events (AEs) [including serious adverse events (SAEs) and ocular AEs, especially AEs due to intravitreal injection procedure] and adverse drug reactions (ADRs): This outcome measure is included again at the 8-month time point to ensure continued monitoring of safety throughout the study period. By collecting data on AEs and ADRs at multiple time points, researchers can assess the long-term safety profile of Aflibercept in real-world clinical practice.",

Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE): This outcome measure is crucial in assessing the safety and tolerability of the study drug, REGN7508. By monitoring and documenting any adverse events that occur during the study period, researchers can evaluate the potential risks associated with the drug and make informed decisions about its safety profile. The time frame of up to 36 days allows for a comprehensive assessment of any adverse events that may occur following administration of the drug.\n\n2. Severity of TEAE: This outcome measure provides additional information on the nature and severity of any treatment-emergent adverse events that occur during the study. By categorizing the severity of adverse events, researchers can better understand the impact of the drug on participants and determine the level of risk associated with its use. Monitoring the severity of adverse events throughout the 36-day time frame allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the safety profile of REGN7508.\n\nSecond Outcome Measure:\n1. Change from baseline in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): Monitoring changes in aPTT levels allows researchers to assess the impact of REGN7508 on the coagulation pathway. This measure is important in understanding the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug and its potential influence on blood clotting mechanisms. The 36-day time frame enables researchers to evaluate any changes in aPTT levels over time following administration of the drug.\n\n2. Change from baseline in prothrombin time (PT): Similar to aPTT, monitoring changes in PT levels provides valuable information on the impact of REGN7508 on the coagulation pathway. By assessing changes in PT levels, researchers can gain insights into the drug's effects on blood clotting mechanisms and overall coagulation function. The 36-day time frame allows for a comprehensive evaluation of any changes in PT levels following drug administration.\n\n3. Concentrations of total REGN7508 in serum: Measuring the concentrations of total REGN7508 in serum helps researchers understand the pharmacokinetics of the drug, including its distribution and elimination from the body. This information is essential for determining the appropriate dosing regimen and assessing the drug's overall exposure in the body. Monitoring total REGN7508 concentrations over the 36-day time frame allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the drug's pharmacokinetic profile.\n\n4. Concentrations of functional REGN7508 in plasma: Assessing the concentrations of functional REGN7508 in plasma provides insights into the drug's activity and effectiveness in the body. By measuring functional REGN7508 levels, researchers can evaluate the drug's pharmacodynamic effects and its ability to target Factor XI. Monitoring these concentrations over the 36-day time frame allows for a comprehensive assessment of the drug's activity in the body.\n\n5. Absolute concentration and change from baseline in total Factor XI (FXI) concentrations: Measuring the absolute concentration and change from baseline in total FXI concentrations helps researchers understand the drug's impact on Factor XI levels in the body. This information is essential for evaluating the drug's mechanism of action and its ability to target Factor XI. Monitoring these concentrations over the 36-day time frame allows for a comprehensive assessment of the drug's effects on FXI levels.\n\n6. Absolute concentration and change from baseline in free FXI concentrations: Similar to total FXI concentrations, measuring the absolute concentration and change from baseline in free FXI concentrations provides insights into the drug's impact on free Factor XI levels in the body. This measure helps researchers understand the drug's mechanism of action and its ability to target free FXI. Monitoring these concentrations over the 36-day time frame allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the drug's effects on free FXI levels.\n\n7. Incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) to REGN7508 over time: Monitoring the incidence of ADAs to REGN7508 is important for assessing the potential development of immune responses to the drug. The presence of ADAs can impact the drug's efficacy and safety, so monitoring their incidence over time is crucial for evaluating the drug's immunogenicity. The 36-day time frame allows for a comprehensive assessment of ADA development following drug administration.",

Time Frame: From the first randomization until the end of the study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years).\n\n- Secondary Outcome Measures:\n  - Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] Criteria: PFS was the time interval from the date of registration to the date of progression, or death from any cause if it occurs before tumor progression is documented. Tumor progression was assessed using RECIST criteria, by which progression was a pre-defined increase in the size of existing tumors or appearance of one or more new tumors. Median PFS time was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Plots. Time Frame: From the first randomization until the end of the study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years).\n  - Objective Response Rate (ORR) Assessed by the Investigators According to RECIST Criteria: Objective response (OR) included complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]. OR was to be assessed by the Investigators according to RECIST criteria, and confirmed by repeating tumor imaging at least 4 weeks after the first radiological documentation of response. However, OR analysis was not performed, as the study was terminated due to futility. Time Frame: From the first randomization until the end of the study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years).\n  - Clinical Benefit: Clinical benefit was to be assessed in all participants by time to symptom worsening (TTSW), evaluated from the time of randomization to symptom worsening, as well as by improvement in tumor related symptoms. However, this analysis was not performed, as the study was terminated due to futility. Time Frame: From the first randomization until the end of the study data cutoff date (approximately 2 years).\n  - Safety-Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE): All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatment, spanning from the signature of informed consent until 30 days after the last administration of study treatment, were recorded. The number of participants with all treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), serious adverse events (SAE), TEAE leading to death, and TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation are reported. Time Frame: Up to 30 days after treatment discontinuation. SAEs and related AEs were followed till resolved or stabilized.\n  - Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies: Anti-drug antibodies in the participants blood sample were detected using a validated immunoassay. The validated lower limit of detection (LLOD) for the assay was about 5.4 ng/mL in the absence of aflibercept and about 25.2 ng/mL in the presence of 20 \u03bcg/mL of aflibercept.

If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask. \n\nOutput Full Outcome Measures:\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs): Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and does not necessary have to have a causal relationship with treatment. All adverse events that occurred from the first dose of the study drug administration up to 60 days after the end of treatment visit were considered as TEAEs. Serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly or a medically important event. A summary of SAEs, all other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, are reported in AE section. Time Frame: Up to 211 days\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28): DAS28 is a composite score that includes the number of tender and swollen joints, patient's global assessment of disease activity, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. This measure provides a standardized assessment of disease activity in RA patients. Changes from baseline in DAS28 can indicate the effectiveness of the treatment in reducing disease activity. Time Frame: Baseline, Week 12, Week 24\n\n- Number of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) Response: ACR20 response criteria require at least a 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts, as well as at least a 20% improvement in three of the following five criteria: patient's assessment of pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity, physician's global assessment of disease activity, patient's assessment of physical function, and acute phase reactant (either ESR or CRP). This measure assesses the proportion of participants achieving a clinically meaningful improvement in RA symptoms. Time Frame: Week 24\n\n- Number of Participants Achieving Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) Remission: DAS28 remission is defined as a DAS28 score less than 2.6, indicating low disease activity. This measure evaluates the proportion of participants who achieve a state of low disease activity or remission, which is an important treatment goal in RA management. Time Frame: Week 24",

Here are the full outcome measures we have designed for the clinical trial:\n- Primary Outcome Measure:\n  - Overall Survival (OS): OS was time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. If death was not observed during the study, overall survival time was censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, or the study cutoff date, whichever was earlier. The cut-off date for the OS was the date when 687 deaths were observed. OS was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Curves.\n- Secondary Outcome Measures:\n  - Progression Free Survival (PFS): PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the time of occurrence of the first radiological tumor progression detected by a computer tomography (CT) scan and /or by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); or death due to any cause; whichever was earlier. Participants without disease progression were censored at the earliest date between their last valid tumor assessment and the data cutoff date. PFS was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Curves.\n  - Overall Response (OR) Rate as Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) Criteria: Participants with OR were those who had a confirmed complete response [CR] or a confirmed partial response [PR], based on RECIST criteria. OR was CR + PR. The response rate was the percent of participants with a response. To determine a response, tumors were assessed by the investigators using Computerized Tomography (CT) scans or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans; and an observed response was confirmed by repeated imaging after 4 - 6 weeks.\n  - Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) Assessed by the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS): HRQL assessments were performed by participants using a self-administered LCSS questionnaire. LCSS is a 9-item questionnaire, six measuring major symptoms for lung malignancies, and 3 summation items related to total symptomatic distress, activity status, and overall quality of life. Participant responses were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) with 100-mm lines. The LCSS total score was defined as the mean of the 9 items of the scale, each scored between 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome).\n  - Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) Assessed by the Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI): HRQL assessments were performed by participants using a self-administered LCSS questionnaire. ABSI was the mean score for the six major lung cancer symptoms, each scored between 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome).",
