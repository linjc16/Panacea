Interactions between vessel wall constituents and platelets initiate recruitment of further cells and may contribute to the thrombotic process by stimulating migration of bloodborne cells. We have investigated factors promoting migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and platelets across type I collagen using an in vitro transwell migration system and have determined the mechanisms for migration involving the collagen matrix. In this system, endothelial cell migration appeared to occur by two mechanisms: a membrane\u2010initiated route through fibrous type I collagen matrix and an integrin\u2010mediated mechanism involving platelet\u2013collagen interactions. Platelets also migrated through type I collagen but independently of platelet\u2013collagen interactions. Endothelial cells, but not platelets, exhibited dose\u2010dependent migration across a thick fibrous collagen gel without attachment to the bottom of the well. We determined that this occurred within 30\u201345\u2009min and appeared to be rapid enough not to require matrix degradation to be completed. Inhibition of endothelial cell migration across fibrous type I collagen was achieved using neutralizing anti\u2010\u03b1",

The time frame of your second outcome measure is appropriate for the duration between when the drug is administered and when the closure of the ductus arteriosus is observed. This is important to minimize the risk of adverse events associated with the drug. Fatty acids profile and phytochemical content in leaves of the three Cypriot Salvia species.\n\nSalvia is a genus of the Lamiaceae family with great economic value all over the world which is used for many health applications. In this study, we compared the fatty acids composition and phytochemical content, in four different growth stages of the three Cypriot Salvia species, Salvia fruticosa subsp. syriaca, Salvia cryptantha, and Salvia glutinosa. During the plant life cycle we found that S. fruticosa subsp. syriaca revealed a higher content of most fatty acid and phytochemical species, 17 times for \u03b1-pinene, 14 times for camphor, 6 times for oleic acid, 4 times for palmitic acid, and twice for phytol, than S. cryptantha. S. fruticosa subsp. syriaca showed a higher content of most fatty acid and phytochemical species, 12-14 times for most of the species (with \u03b1-pinene, camphor, caryopicrin, eucalyptol, and thymol); 6-18 times for \u03b3-amino butyric acid, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), palmitic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, and oleic acid) than S. fruticosa subsp. fruticosa. S. fruticosa subsp. fruticosa showed a higher content of most fatty acid and phytochemical species than S. glutinosa. These results showed a significant effect of species and plant age in most compounds in each species where the differences can be used to develop a nutraceutical product for human consumption with various properties.\n\n# Introduction\nSalvia L.",
            "OK, so we have three outcome measures: primary, secondary, and exploratory. The primary outcome measure is the number of children who have a closure of the ductus arteriosus under the effect of betamethasone treatment, measured by M-Mode cardiac ultrasound or Echocardiogram at the 6-week stage of preterm delivery. The secondary outcome measures are (a) the number of children who have a closure of the ductus arteriosus under the effect of betamethasone treatment, measured by M-Mode cardiac ultrasound or Echocardiogram at the 6-week stage of preterm delivery; (b) the number of children who have a closure of the ductus arteriosus under the effect of betamethasone treatment, measured by M-Mode cardiac ultrasound or Echocardiogram at the 3-month stage of preterm delivery; and (c) the number of children with congestive heart failure under the effect of betamethasone treatment, measured by M-Mode cardiac ultrasound or Echocardiogram at the 6-week stage of preterm delivery. The exploratory outcome measures are the number of children with cardiac arrest under the effect of betamethasone treatment, measured by M-Mode cardiac ultrasound or Echocardiogram at the 6-week stage of preterm delivery, and the number of children with seizures under the effect of betamethasone treatment, measured by M-Mode cardiac ultrasound or Echocardiogram at the 6-week stage of preterm delivery. Effect of adrenergic blockade on human cerebral haemodynamics and metabolism during hypobaric hypoxia.\nHypocapnia and systemic hypoxaemia elicit cerebral vasoconstriction and increase regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) through activation of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. These receptors are present at different concentration on the wall of cerebral vessels. Accordingly, the effects of beta-blockade on cerebral haemodynamics and metabolism induced by hypocapnia and hypoventilation are not known. We therefore studied the effects of a"
