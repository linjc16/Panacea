We can monitor and compare the rate, type, and severity of side-effects in Group B (with Lactobacillus Reuteri probiotic) and Group A (without Lactobacillus Reuteri probiotic) with a score system of mild to severe symptoms. This information is crucial for patient safety and treatment tolerability. What do you think?",
