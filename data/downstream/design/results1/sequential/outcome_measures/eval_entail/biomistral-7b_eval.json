The average RCSQ score across the three days of assessment will allow us to assess whether the efficacy of each intervention is sustained during their post-surgical hospital stay.",
            "To complement the subjective measures of sleep, it would be valuable to include Actigraphy as a method to measure active sleep. Actigraphy is a non-invasive method for measuring motor activity and has been used as a tool to assess sleep-wake activity . With actigraphy, sleep quality can be assessed based on the amount of active sleep, the number of sleep awakenings, and total sleep time. There are various ways to measure sleep quality with actigraphy, depending on the data collected and analyzed . The gold standard of sleep assessment is polysomnography, and this is the most comprehensive objective measure of sleep quality. It is considered the diagnostic \"gold standard\" for sleep disorders and provides information on changes in sleep EEG activity and the electrical activity of the heart at different stages of sleep . However, it is time-consuming and expensive, so it is not suitable for all clinical settings.",

Measuring objective sleep quality throughout the perioperative period will provide valuable data on the effects of the intervention on sleep over the extended period.",
            "To assess acute pain intensity, we can use patient self-reported measures such as the visual analog scale (VAS) or the numerical rating scale (NRS). The VAS requires the patient to rate pain intensity on a 10-point scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). The NRS is a simpler measure that presents the options as numbers, typically from zero (no pain) to ten (severe pain).",
            "We should assess the intensity of acute pain in the early morning of the day after surgery (i.e., on the first morning after surgery). This is an important time point, as pain often peaks early in the morning. Measuring pain at this time ensures we capture the peak pain levels experienced by the patients.",
            "For the subjective sleep quality evaluation at 30 days post-surgery, we can use the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). Given that this measure had already been used at multiple time points throughout the perioperative period, using it at 30 days after surgery will provide a consistent, longitudinal assessment of subjective sleep quality.",
            "We can assess subjective sleep quality at 30 days post-surgery by sending the patients the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire via mail or email at 30 days post-surgery. This will provide valuable insights into patients' perioperative experiences and their impact on longer-term sleep quality."
