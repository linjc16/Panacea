            "Implant stability can be measured through several measures, such as the incidence of early and midterm postoperative instability, radiographic evidence of subsidence, and loosening of the femoral component at the time of latest follow-up. However, for our purposes, an intraoperative measurement of the radiolucency ratio would be most appropriate. A low radiolucency ratio can indicate better implant stability. We need to discuss whether we can also include patient-reported outcomes in our measurement, like the Harris hip score. Would that be useful? \u00a9 2019 The Author(s).

            "As the trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of TQH2929 in psoriasis, I think we should clearly state the psoriasis area severity index (PASI) as the primary endpoint. This is a validated scale that assesses the severity of psoriasis and is widely used in clinical practice and in clinical trials. It measures the extent, redness, and thickness of psoriatic plaques, as well as the number of scaling lesions and erythema. This scale also assesses the participant's global assessment of the disease. We may also consider including the improvement in the score on the modified (m) PASI as an efficacy endpoint. It's a modified version of the original scale that takes into account treatment responders. What about the clinical global impression (CGI) scale? Can you provide more details on it? The CGI scale is a subjective measure of disease improvement. Each answer on the scale ranges from 1 to 7, with a higher score indicating a greater improvement in disease status. We may also consider including the quality of life (QoL) assessment as a secondary endpoint. This can be assessed using tools such as the dermatology life quality index (DLQI) or the psoriasis module of the short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Are there any other secondary outcome measures that you think we should include?",

Lastly, let's consider the primary efficacy measure. What do you suggest?  [INTEK] Since the goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the drug in psoriasis, we should consider measures that reflect changes in skin lesions. Two good options are Psoriasis Erythema Area and Severity Score (PGASS) and Psoriasis Physician's Global Assessment (PGA). Both measures have been extensively used in clinical trials and are widely accepted as markers of disease severity. [/INTEK] That's a great suggestion.

            "Is it important that the RCTs are blinded to the group assignment? If the investigator knows which patients received the treatment and which received the control, they could unconsciously modify their behavior or alter the treatment plan. By double blinding the trial, the investigator doesn't know which subjects received the treatment and which received the control, ensuring the results are unaltered by any unconscious bias or treatment differences. [01:56] In a parallel assignment design, once the subjects are randomized, everyone in the group is assigned the same treatment. [02:01] Can you explain why the RCT design is important for dentin hypersensitivity? [02:08] I'm glad you asked! The RCT allows for a more reliable assessment of the treatments effects. [02:16] For example, if we compare hypersensitivity before and after treatment, the treatment could be perceived as working even if there was a pre-existing change or decrease in hypersensitivity due to other factors such as time or a natural recovery. This is called Type 1 error. [02:35] If we use a randomized control design, we can minimize this bias. [02:40] The RCT randomly assigns subjects to either the treatment or control, thus eliminating unintended changes in the control group that might be due to factors other than the treatment. [02:54] If we don't use a randomized control design, we have what is known as Type 2 error. [03:02] Type 2 error occurs when the treatment really doesn't work, but we falsely conclude that it does. [03:09] For example, if we don't use the RCT design, the placebo effect could inflate our results, making the treatment seem more effective than it really is. [03:20] By using the RCT design, we can greatly reduce these errors and produce more reliable and accurate results. [03:30] Let's quickly compare that to the crossover design, used in some dentin hypersensitivity studies. [03:38] In the crossover design, each subject receive both treatments.

The AEF measures dentin hypersensitivity by delivering a constant volume of air through a dental probing tip at different maximum working currents. The resulting AEF score gives us a numerical value reflecting the degree of dentin hypersensitivity. This allows us to compare the two treatment groups and see whether one treatment is more effective than the other. What are your thoughts on this measure? ]",

It includes progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DoR). PSA response rate (PSAR) is the proportion of participants with a decrease in PSA by more than 50% from the baseline value. Overall survival (OS) is the time from randomization to death from any cause. Pharmacokinetics include measurement of the amount of YL201 in the bloodstream over time.

This measure reflects the sustainability of treatment efficacy. The time frame for assessing DoR is also approximately within 36 months.\n\nTime to objective response (TTR) measures the duration from the start of treatment to the first objective response. This provides insights into the speed of response to YL201. The time frame for assessing TTR is approximately within 36 months.\n\nThere are also other secondary outcome measures related to PSA response, overall survival, and pharmacokinetics.

Just to recap, the primary outcome measure is to assess the potency of LRRK2 inhibitors using a target engagement biomarker in cohort B participants. The secondary outcome measure focuses on developing novel analytical methods for biomarkers using the collected biological samples. These measures will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the inhibitors and advance biomarker research for Parkinson's Disease."

However, please note that we need to keep the number of primary outcome measures to a minimum to ensure that the study remains feasible. I would suggest that you remove other related measures from the list and focus on the core measures. What do you think?",
            "That's an excellent question. The secondary outcome measure for bone quality evaluation is the micro-CT. Using micro-CT technology we are able to accurately measure the volume of bone formed at the surgical site and assess the quality of the bone regenerated. This will help us understand the overall improvements in bone biology.",

It will help us determine if the screw tent pole technique provides better bone gain than the autogenous bone block technique in the atrophied anterior maxilla. The time frame of 6 months is reasonable for assessing bone gain as it allows for sufficient healing and bone remodeling post-surgery. This duration also aligns with the typical timeline for assessing bone augmentation procedures in the maxilla.",
            "The secondary outcome measure involves evaluating the bone quality through bone core biopsy using a trephine bur in the two techniques after 6 months post-operative. Assessing bone quality is crucial as it provides additional information on the success and long-term stability of the bone augmentation procedures. Different techniques may result in varying bone qualities, which can impact the success of subsequent implant placement.",

Now, let me summarize all the outcome measures we have discussed.\n\n[Output]\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Outcome Measure: Infectious complication after cystectomy\n- Measure Description: This outcome measure is crucial as it directly assesses the impact of preoperative immunonutrition on post-operative infectious complications, which are common and significant risks associated with cystectomy procedures. By evaluating the rate of infectious complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, sepsis, and shock, the study can determine the effectiveness of immunonutrition in reducing these complications.\n- Time Frame: The time frame of 30 days after surgery is appropriate as it allows for the assessment of short-term outcomes related to infectious complications, providing valuable information on the immediate impact of immunonutrition on post-operative morbidity.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Outcome Measure: Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)\n- Measure Description: The CCI is a comprehensive measure that takes into account all post-operative complications, providing a more holistic view of the patient's overall complication burden. By assessing the CCI at 30 and 90 days after surgery, the study can evaluate the long-term impact of immunonutrition on complications beyond infectious outcomes.\n- Time Frame: The time frames of 30 and 90 days after surgery allow for the assessment of both short-term and medium-term outcomes, providing a more thorough evaluation of the effects of immunonutrition on post-operative complications over time.\n\n- Outcome Measure: Mortality rate\n- Measure Description: Assessing the mortality rate at 30 and 90 days after surgery is essential for understanding the impact of immunonutrition on patient survival following cystectomy. By evaluating mortality outcomes, the study can determine if immunonutrition has any effect on reducing the risk of death post-operatively.\n- Time Frame: The time frames of 30 and 90 days after surgery are appropriate for assessing short-term and medium-term mortality outcomes, providing valuable information on the potential benefits of immunonutrition in improving patient survival.\n\n- Outcome Measure: Complication-free survival rate\n- Measure Description: This outcome measure evaluates the rate of post-operative complication-free survival, providing valuable information on the overall success of the surgical procedure and the impact of immunonutrition on patient outcomes. By assessing complication-free survival at 90 days after surgery, the study can determine the long-term effects of immunonutrition on patient recovery.\n- Time Frame: The time frame of 90 days after surgery allows for a comprehensive evaluation of complication-free survival, capturing both short-term and medium-term outcomes related to post-operative recovery.\n\n- Outcome Measure: Treatment compliance rate\n- Measure Description: Assessing serum arginine levels before and after intake of the allocated nutrition provides insight into patient adherence to the prescribed immunonutrition regimen. Monitoring treatment compliance is essential for interpreting the study results accurately and ensuring that the intervention is being implemented as intended.\n- Time Frame: The time frames of between Day -30 and Day -10 for baseline assessment and at preoperative admission after intake of the allocated nutrition (Day -1) allow for the evaluation of treatment compliance at key time points in the study timeline, ensuring that patients are receiving the intervention as planned."

Here are the full outcome measures for your trial:\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Outcome Measure: Evaluate the incidence of IELN invasion by ovarian cancer\n- Measure Description: This outcome measure aims to determine the rate of invasion of inferior epigastric lymph nodes (IELN) by ovarian cancer. Histopathological analysis of the lymph nodes will provide concrete evidence of metastatic disease presence in the IELN basin, supporting the hypothesis of this study.\n- Time Frame: 2 years\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n1. Outcome Measure: Evaluation of the proportion of invaded IELN\n- Measure Description: This measure assesses the extent of involvement of IELN with metastatic ovarian cancer. It correlates the proportion of invaded IELN with the patient's peritoneal cancer index (PCI) and the specific peritoneal zones affected by the disease, providing insights into the pattern of metastatic spread.\n- Time Frame: 2 years\n\n2. Outcome Measure: In cases of IELN positivity, review thoroughly preoperative scans and MRIs\n- Measure Description: This measure aims to identify any radiological features on preoperative imaging that could indicate the positivity of IELN prior to pathological analysis. By comparing the imaged IELN with the pathological findings, the accuracy of preoperative imaging in detecting IELN involvement can be determined.\n- Time Frame: 2 years",

This measure would assess the safety of the drug and its dosage levels. To clarify, a DLT is a treatment-related adverse event that results in a dose reduction or permanent discontinuation of therapy. DLTs would likely be assessed by examination of the laboratory values, such as CBCs or other blood tests. In order to measure this outcome, we may need to pre-determine a list of defined dosage levels or schedule options and record the number of subjects that experience DLTs.

Objective response based on investigator assessment includes determining the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by International Response Criteria. An independent committee will assess all participants who achieve CR or PR and determine if the response is ongoing, mixed, or lost to follow-up (http://ctdotrial.org/static/05_02_02.php). It is possible that a response in the CR or PR category will be maintained for 2 years without ongoing treatment. Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks.\n\"Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment\" is defined as the time between the first dose of odronextamab and the date of initiation of the first dose of treatment for progression or another indication. Treatment for progression would consist of resumption of the same dose and duration of odronextamab or a 10% decrease in the dose if toxicity is found to be unacceptable. Treatment for another indication would be the administration of chemotherapy for unrelated disease based on the investigator's judgment. We plan to assess and follow participants for treatment for progression or other indication for up to a maximum of 3 years following the last odronextamab dose. Time to next anti-lymphoma treatment is likely to be a semiquantitative endpoint. The primary analysis will be the composite of overall survival and PFS using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by ECOG performance status, age, and gender. Given that this is a trial primarily designed to evaluate OS, a prespecified interim OS analysis will not be conducted.

One important thing to consider when launching a trial, though, is enrollment timelines. In our sample script, we have set a 2-week period for enrollment, which may be challenging to meet with enough participants. This will also need to take into account the time it takes to recruit participants, including the enrollment meeting, the Informed Consent Form (ICF) process, HIPAA process, and study-specific exams and assessments, as well as timely follow-up with each participant throughout the course of the study. \nAlthough the total number of years of follow-up for our study is 90 days (30 days post-randomization + 60 days of follow-up), it is likely that our enrollment time will be longer than that, and I would encourage you to run some scenarios with longer time periods in case we need to adjust the length of our study. What we should aim for is a 2:1 (or 3:1) ratio of treatment to control groups at each site. This means that, if we anticipate enrolling 50 participants at each site, then we need to have 100 participants on each arm. \nIf our site is running smoothly at the 0.5:1 ratio, meaning we are signing up participants at twice the rate of the control group, we should consider extending our timeline by 1.5x the time, or 3 months, to reach the 2:1 ratio. If our site starts slow and we are behind at the 2.5:1 mark (treatment enrollment 3/5 control group enrollment), we double our time to reach our target. Another way to look at is: if we start at the 2:1 ratio, we need 1.5x our target number of participants at that point, and if we are behind, we need 2x the number. In our sample script, your timeline is outlined for the 2-week enrollment period and the follow-up period.\nI also want to make you aware of the requirements of Federal Regulations when performing studies that impact human subjects.

There are some pre-defined key points, such as number of patients (1,500 participants), the duration of observation (54 weeks), and adverse event reporting (8-week safety follow-up). However, there are still open points to be discussed, such as inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization method, and blinding methods. We should also consider the types of outcomes, such as incidence and prevalence, and the follow-up time for each outcome. Then, I propose the following key points for the trial design: - The duration of treatment for the vedolizumab group is 52 weeks (54 weeks duration, but 2 weeks washout period) - Randomization ratio is 1:1 - The sham procedure is intramuscular injection of 1mL of 0.9% saline - Allocation concealment is by serially numbered, opaque, sealed, and sequentially numbered envelopes - Blinding of the outcome assessor is impossible - The primary endpoint is clinical remission, which is evaluated by the CDAI score (change from baseline).

Here are the full outcome measures:\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Proportion of participants who are in clinical remission at Week 24: Clinical remission by modified Mayo score is defined as a modified Mayo score of \u22642 with a stool frequency score \u22641, a rectal bleeding score = 0, AND a Mayo endoscopic subscore \u22641 with absence of friability. The modified Mayo score consists of 3 subscores; a patient-reported subscore for rectal bleeding, a patient-reported subscore for stool frequency, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore. Each subscore ranges 0-3 with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. The total modified Mayo score ranges 0-9 with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. This measure will be evaluated at Week 24.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Proportion of participants achieving clinical response by modified Mayo score at Week 8, Week 24, and Week 52: Clinical response by modified Mayo score is defined as a decrease from baseline in the modified Mayo score of \u22652 points and at least a 30% reduction from baseline, and a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of \u22651 OR an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. The modified Mayo score consists of 3 subscores; a patient-reported subscore for rectal bleeding, a patient-reported subscore for stool frequency, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore. Each subscore ranges 0-3 with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. The total modified Mayo score ranges 0-9 with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.

The procedure is called MDASI-GI, or minimally invasive distal anastomosis versus subtotal gastrectomy. Potential participants for the study include patients with stage I or II gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with a normal resection margin. Interested and eligible participants will be screened with a physical examination, endoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, CT scan or MRI, upper GI series with contrast, and blood and urine tests to assess for the safety and eligibility of the study. MDASI-GI will be studied in comparison to minimally invasive total gastrectomy, with or without chemotherapy. Participants will be screened for certain characteristics or medical conditions, such as the presence of metastases, comorbidities, previous surgery or chemotherapy for any cancer, or other significant medical conditions. Women of childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy and screened for other factors that might make them ineligible. Additionally, current or previous smokers will be asked to quit for a certain period before and after the surgery. Other potential participants with certain predisposing factors, such as chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure, will be screened for their ability to tolerate the procedure. The study is double blinded to preserve the validity of the results. Participants will be randomly assigned to the study groups. Compliance to the study will be monitored throughout, and outcomes will be assessed at regular intervals. All participants will be required to sign the consent form prior to procedure.

Moving along, what about the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study population? \nOne important element of study design is the population to be included in the study. We first need to decide the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the population to participate in the clinical trial. The inclusion and exclusion criteria help to select a population that's most likely to benefit from the intervention. The inclusion criteria define the population to be studied, while the exclusion criteria define the population to be excluded from the study.\nThe inclusion criteria help identify a population that will likely benefit from the treatment under investigation, while the exclusion criteria identify a population that should not be included in the study. We can't test a treatment on a population that's not likely to benefit from it, so having strict inclusion and exclusion criteria is important. To get a clear picture of how these criteria are handled, we'll use an example of bladder cancer patients considering a TURBT.\nThe inclusion criteria for the clinical trial could be that patients have a solitary tumor located in the bladder dome (no invasion of the fatty tissue or muscle) at the papillary or caudal margin. Importantly, the exclusion criteria state the following: patients with any of the following: any more than one tumor, tumors located distal to the suprapapillary ureter, any grade 3 tumor, tumors infiltrating the fatty tissue or muscle, or tumor size greater than 3 centimeters in the bladder dome. Why exclude patients that have multiple tumors or tumors located distally? Multiple tumors would indicate an advanced tumor that's probably more difficult to treat, so this population is unlikely to respond to the treatment under investigation. As noted, tumors located distally involve higher-grade tumor and are more likely to have invaded the fatty tissue or muscle, which means there's a higher risk of postoperative complications.\nWith these criteria in place, the study population that remains would likely be best suited for treatment with the therapy under investigation. We must always be sure to allow for enough subjects to have enough subjects to find a treatment effect or lack thereof, while limiting the number",

With our proposed time frames established for each of the secondary outcome measures, we're ready to move on to consider risk adjustment. \u200bLet's begin by discussing the basics. \u200b\nRisk adjustment refers to the process of adjusting for patient characteristics that may confound survival outcomes. For example, we might adjust for known risk factors for poor prognosis, such as age, performance status, and comorbidities. We use the adjusted, or risk-adjusted survival estimates to better compare treatments or groups of patients on the basis of their intrinsic treatment or patient-level effectiveness, rather than the hazard of patients experiencing a poor outcome. \u200bThe adjusted survival measures are commonly presented as hazard ratios for the treatment groups. \u200bFor example, a hazard ratio of 1.72 indicates that treatment A prolongs survival by 72% compared to treatment B. \u200bRisk adjustment improves upon clinical trial reporting by accounting for patient characteristics that may be associated with a poor prognosis, resulting in more clinically meaningful survival fairy meaningful clinically relevant measures of survival outcome of outcome measures of the prognosis statistical testing are measuremeasures of survival for of the of survival the a trial measures to be measured outcome measures the of the prognosis outcome measures of surgical of the the survival test measures measures of the survival outcome measures of the outcome measures of the prognosis study the of treatment\n1.

Once subjects are enrolled, we'll use CGM technology to continuously monitor their glucose levels from the time they come to the clinic for enrollment up until 24 hours after surgery. Before surgery, subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual diabetes management regimen as usual. At each clinical visit, a healthcare provider will obtain a fingerstick blood glucose value to compare with the CGM values. After surgery, we'll obtain a blood glucose value from the intraoperative blood gas sample and compare it to the CGM values. Subjects will be asked to complete a postoperative symptom survey.

            "Sure, in healthy individuals, the proprioception is best at detecting movements over 0-30 cm and it gradually decreases beyond that threshold. This means that for each joint, we can define a critical range for it (in this case, 0-30 cm). For the knee joint, this means that if your subject can only detect the position of their leg within 0-30 cm range around its own midline, then they would indicate with high probability that it has been moved. The movement detection performance of people also depends on the angle of the joint and the presence of noise. Thus, this definition needs to be adapted accordingly for each joint to be used in the study. For instance, the detection threshold can be defined as the distance at which the subject can detect a displacement with an accuracy of 50%, or the median detection threshold. The critical range can also be defined as the distance at which the sensitivity is 50%, so that if the distance is shorter than this, the sensitivity will be equal to 0%.  You can also use a combination of these definitions. I recommend that you use a test protocol that is standardized and has been validated in a previous study so that you can compare your results with those obtained in similar studies.  After defining the critical range, you can assess the proprioceptive ability of each joint by asking the subject to indicate: The range in which they can feel their limb moving more accurately (the critical range). The average/median distance at which the subject can accurately detect a movement. The ability of the subject to detect the movement with their eyes closed. To measure these parameters, you can use a device that displays a grid divided into equal blocks. Have the subject sit or stand so that their legs are in a natural position and ask them to move their leg so that the cursor on the grid lines appears at the edge of the critical range. To measure the average, hold the device still for a few seconds and ask the subject to indicate the cursor location. Have the subject sit or stand with their leg bent at 90 degrees, and ask them to move it until the cursor appears in the critical range in the horizontal direction. For the vertical direction, hold the device upright and ask the subject to move their leg so that the cursor appears within the range. You can also ask the subject to move their leg so that the cursor appears between -30 and +30 cm from the reference",

Correlation between different degrees of knee proprioception deficits and gait speed (m/s): This measure will help understand how proprioception deficit affects the overall speed of gait in stroke patients. We can use the inertial sensor (Pablo device) and knee proprioception deficit robot (Luna EMG) to assess the degrees of deficit and its correlation with gait speed. The time frame for this measure is September 2024.\n2. Correlation between different stages of knee proprioception deficits and gait speed (m/s): This measure helps understand how knee proprioception deficits affect the gait speed in stroke patients at different recovery stages. We can use the inertial sensor (Pablo device) and the knee proprioception deficit robot (Luna EMG) to assess the degrees of knee deficits and correlation with gait speed.

            "Sure:\n1. Knee proprioception deficit: This can be measured using a clinical test, where the patients are asked to stand on one leg and reach with their hands for as high as they can while balancing on the other leg. A goniometer can be used to measure the angles of trunk and hips. An inability to increase angle of trunk and hip indicates reduced knee proprioception.\n2. Gait parameters: These can be measured using a Walk-A-Meter. This will help in analyzing the symmetry and consistency of patients' steps along with their velocity, stride length, stride width, and cadence.\n3. Balance: This can be assessed using Romberg test, tandem-heel walking, standing one-leg-take-off test, and Berg balance scale.\n4. Functional status: This can be assessed by standardized assessment tools such as Barthel and Modified Rankin Scale. \nThese measures will help you in understanding the impact of knee proprioception on the gait pattern, balance, and functional status of stroke patients.

As the research progresses, the researcher must be flexible and open to modifications in the research plans. Our project had to undergo a few minor modifications to ensure feasibility and to address some areas of improvement.\nThe first minor adjustment was related to the primary outcome measure. The original measure of analyzing DeadSpace using EIT was not feasible due to logistical challenges, so we have decided to use helium dilution as the primary outcomes measure instead. Secondly, because proning may cause slight changes in ventilation, it is important to include measures that assess the changes in ventilation. Therefore, measures such as Shunt, Vt and VQ will be collected to assess the changes in ventilation.\nDead space assessment using EIT was not feasible for several reasons. First, the apparatus used for ventilation are very loud and complicated, preventing us from performing EIT. Secondly, the measurements are very time-consuming, which hinders our ability to collect data needed for analysis. Lastly, DeadSpace has never been previously measured in proning studies, so we have no way to validate the accuracy of this measurement. These reasons motivated us to use Helium dilution as the primary outcome measure.\nShunt, Vt, and VQ are also important measures to assess the ventilation changes during proning. Shunt is used to measure the amount of ventilation that bypasses the alveoli, and changes in shunt can provide important in information into ventilation. Vt is the ventilation time, and changes in Vt can signify changes in the efficiency of the ventilation. VQ is the ventilation-perfusion match, and changes in VQ can signify changes in ventilation and perfusion. Both the changes in Vt and VQ are important in defining the efficiency of the ventilation.\nThirdly, we have also decided to collect the Vt and VQ in order to assess the changes in ventilation. The changes in ventilation will help us understand the efficacy of proning in improving the ventilation in patients with ARDS.\nA second minor adjustment to the protocol is making the changes in the ventilation a secondary outcome measure, instead of primary outcome measure. The changes in ventilation may be secondary to other mechanisms of proning and it will be interesting"

It seems you had a long pause, you can continue where ever you left in your question. You had mentioned measures of neurological recovery after treatment for intracerebral hemorrhage such as disability, cognitive function, quality of life, and adverse events as secondary outcome measures. Measures of neurological recovery after therapeutic treatment are very essential to assess effect of treatment. Disability can be assessed by modified Rankin scale at the beginning of the treatment and follow up. Cognitive function can be assessed by mini-mental state examination. Quality of life can be assessed by modified health assessment questionaire 88. Adverse events occur commonly with any treatment and can be recorded in detail in a predefined format. These questions should be asked to avoid recall bias in the future. I hope you find this information useful. If you have any more queries, I will be happy to help you.",

And lastly, we can use urine output and respiratory rate to assess the pulmonary toxic effects of the fluid infusion. [IN] Excellent choices. It's good to see that you are putting a lot of thought into the details of this trial. Now, do you have any questions or suggestions before we move on? \u270e What else should we discuss for the intraoperative fluids? [IN] Yes. What are some common intraoperative fluids and what are their characteristics/purposes? \u270e As you mentioned, the main purpose of intraoperative fluids is to maintain tissue perfusion and prevent the development of hypothermia and shock. Commonly used fluids include normal saline solution, balanced crystalloid (5% dextrose or lactated Ringer's solution), albuminated crystalloids (3% hydroxyethyl starches), hydroxyethyl starch (6% or 9%), IV furosemide, and in severe cases, IV hypertonic crystalloids (3% and 5%) or IV colloids (starches or dextrans). Do you have any other questions? \u270e No, that's all for now. But thanks for the detailed information. I have a better understanding of the important aspects of intraoperative fluids. [IN] You're welcome. I'm glad to have helped you.",

The time to do this is recorded with a stopwatch after walking over the top of each step, and repeated 2 more times. The time for the best 2 walks is recorded as the score. The Bell-Norton Physical Functional Impairment Scale (PFI) Item: Timed, weighted arm curls; right arm. The task is to curl a barbell weighing as much as possible in 30 seconds, with good form, without dropping it or resting it on the sides. For women, the protocol is to curl bars weighing 2 pound weights for 30 seconds. For men, one-pound weights are used if necessary, so that men are still able to apply the same degree of effort without exhausting too quickly. The bar is held with an overhand grip, arms fully extended, and with the elbows locked, just touching the ribs. The curls are done by contracting the biceps and lowering the bar until it touches or just below the biceps. The procedure for measuring the curls, with good form, is best left to personal trainer to explain. To ensure good timing, a timing system such as an iPad or stopwatch is used. The time is recorded to the tenth of a second. Test administration: administer the test with and without the 2-lb weight and record the time. Perform 3 trials and record the best time. For the first trial, start with light loads to get the feel of the weight, and use as much weight as possible for the remaining trials. Women score 0 points for curls with the 2-lb weight, and 1 point for men for the test with the appropriate weight. If the weight is too heavy, the test is stopped and the person can try again without the weight. If they are able to get 1 point, it is recorded as such for the test with the 2-lb weight.

            "Thank you for sharing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Now, let's discuss the design details of the study. What is the primary purpose of the study?",
            "Got it. And what can you tell me about the intervention model?",
            "Thank you for that information. Now, let's focus on designing the outcome measures. We'll start with the primary outcome measure. Based on the study's objectives, I suggest considering the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Questionnaire (NPI-Q). It assesses various neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly observed in patients with serious mental illness, such as delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, and more. The questionnaire is completed by caregivers, providing valuable insight into the severity of symptoms and the emotional burden on the caregiver. Does this measure align with your study objectives?",
            "Certainly! The NPI-Q was developed and validated in 2000 and translated into Dutch in 2002. It contains 12 domains that can be used to map neuropsychiatric symptoms. These domains include delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, fear, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibited behavior, irritability/lability, aimless repetitive behavior, night restlessness/sleep disorder, and appetite/eating behavior change. The questionnaire assesses the presence and severity of each symptom, as well as the emotional burden on the caregiver. It will be assessed before the start of treatment as usual (TAU), before the CoMBI-SMI training, and after 4 weeks of CoMBI-SMI training. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of changes in symptoms over time.",
            "For the second outcome measure, I recommend considering the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). This comprehensive questionnaire assesses psychological and physical symptoms in patients. It covers various domains such as somatic complaints, cognitive problems, interpersonal sensitivity, and more. The BSI provides a detailed overview of the patient's symptoms and their severity. It is also sensitive to therapy influences, making it suitable for evaluating the impact of the CoMBI-SMI intervention. Does this measure align with your study objectives?",
            "Absolutely! The BSI is a multidimensional complaints list that assesses the extent to which the patient has experienced psychological and/or physical symptoms during the past period. It consists of 53 items scored on a scale from 0 to 4. There are 9 subscales, including somatic complaints, cognitive problems, interpersonal sensitivity, depressed mood, fear, hostility, phobic fear, paranoid thoughts, and psychoticism. The BSI will be assessed before TAU, before the CoMBI-SMI training, and after 4 weeks of CoMBI-SMI training. This allows for a thorough assessment of changes in symptoms and overall well-being.",
            "For assessing the quality of life, I suggest considering the Mental Health Quality of Life (MHQoL-7D). This standardized instrument consists of a descriptive section, the MHQoL-7D, and a visual analog scale. The MHQoL-7D covers seven dimensions, including self-esteem, independence, mood, relationships, daily activities, physical health, and future. The total score can range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The MHQoL visual analog scale measures the respondent's general psychological well-being on a scale from zero to ten. Does this measure align with your study objectives?",
            "Certainly! The MHQoL-7D measures the quality of life in people with mental health problems. It consists of seven questions covering seven dimensions, each with four response levels ranging from very satisfied to very dissatisfied. The total score can range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The MHQoL visual analog scale measures the respondent's general psychological well-being on a scale from zero to ten. The MHQoL-7D will be assessed before TAU, before the CoMBI-SMI training, and after 4 weeks of CoMBI-SMI training. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of changes in quality of life over time.",

ND-003 is a radiopaque material and therefore a CT scan will be used to evaluate adverse events. Please confirm that it will be okay to use CT as the imaging modality of record. 3. With regard to the MTD assessment, please provide direction on the dosing frequency of ND-003. Will the study be conducted until 40 patients have had 28 days of treatment or until the MTD has been determined? The protocol requires treatment on Days 1 and 28 of each 28-day cycle for at least 8 patients. When would the decision be made to terminate the study, after all 40 patients have accumulated 28 days of treatment or for a dose-limiting adverse event? AREA 400 mg/m2 body surface area will be applied on an outpatient basis and patients will be monitored at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours post administration.

The assessment for MTD will also occur 4 days after a single oral administration and the first cycle of multiple administrations (28 days). What are your thoughts on including MTD as a primary outcome measure?",
            "Yes, one more primary outcome measure to consider is the assessment of adverse events (AE) using the CTCAE ver5.0. This measure involves monitoring and reporting treatment-related adverse events throughout the study. It will provide valuable information on the safety profile of ND-003. The assessment for AE will continue until the completion of the study, which is estimated to be an average of 1 year. How do you feel about including AE assessment as a primary outcome measure?",

We can also assess the time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax), which indicates the drug's onset of action. Additionally, we can measure the elimination half-life (t1/2) and clearance (CL/F) of ND-003, which provide information on the drug's elimination rate and systemic exposure. Assessments for these parameters will be conducted at various time points up to 72 hours after a single dose administration.",

We can also measure progression-free survival (PFS), which evaluates the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death. Lastly, we can measure overall survival (OS), which assesses the overall survival of patients from randomization until death from any cause. These measures will help evaluate the drug's impact on disease progression and overall survival. Assessments for ORR, PFS, and OS will occur from baseline through up to 6 cycles or until disease progression.",

            "That's a great suggestion! Assessing the number of patients amendable to curative surgical interventions is indeed a crucial outcome measure. It provides a clear indication of the effectiveness of the combined therapy in making patients eligible for potentially curative procedures such as resection, transplantation, or ablation.

We can start with the overall response rate (ORR) measured by mRECIST criteria. What are your thoughts on including this measure?",
            "I completely agree. The overall response rate (ORR) is a standard measure of treatment response in oncology trials. By using the mRECIST criteria, which are specifically designed for assessing treatment response in hepatocellular carcinoma, we can accurately evaluate the treatment's impact on tumor regression. We can measure ORR from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST, with an assessment period of up to 3 years. How does that sound?",
            "Great! Now let's continue with the other secondary outcome measures. We have options such as time to progression (TTP), time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), incidence of study-related adverse events, pathological response, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response, and quality of life (QoL) after treatment. Which measures would you like to include?",
            "That's an excellent choice! Including all of those measures will give us a comprehensive understanding of the treatment's effectiveness and impact on different aspects of patient outcomes. We can measure time to progression (TTP), time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression or death from any cause. Incidence of study-related adverse events can be measured from the date of first treatment to 90 days after the last treatment. Pathological response can be assessed from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression or death from any cause, with an assessment period of up to 5 years. Disease control rate (DCR) can be measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented response according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years. Duration of response can be defined as the time from first documented evidence of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the first documented sign of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause. Lastly, quality of life (QoL) after treatment can be assessed from the date of first follow-up to radiographically documented progression or death from any cause, up to 3 years.

            "Excellent. Now, let's continue with the second outcome measures. We could start by measuring the concentrations of odronextamab in serum when administered with chemotherapy. This will help us understand the pharmacokinetics of the drug. What do you think?",
            "Good suggestion. Another measure we can consider is the incidence of anti-odronextamab antibodies (ADAs). This will help us evaluate the immunogenicity of the drug. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's move on to the next measure. We can measure the best overall response (BOR) as assessed by the investigator. This will provide insights into the treatment efficacy and disease control achieved with odronextamab combined with chemotherapy. What do you think?",
            "Great suggestion. Lastly, we should consider measuring the progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by independent central review (ICR). This will give us insights into the long-term efficacy of the treatment in preventing disease progression. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "Excellent. Now we have a comprehensive set of primary and secondary outcome measures for the clinical trial. Here is the full list:\n\nPrimary Outcome Measures:\n1. Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) for odronextamab in combination with chemotherapy - Part 1, DLT period, up to 35 days.\n2. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of odronextamab in combination with chemotherapy - Part 1, Treatment period, up to 2 years.\n3. Severity of TEAEs of odronextamab in combination with chemotherapy - Part 1, Treatment period, up to 2 years.\n4. Complete Response rate at 30 months (CR30) assessed by independent central review (ICR) - Part 2, up to 30 months.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n1. Odronextamab concentrations in serum when administered with chemotherapy - Part 1, Maintenance period and Part 2, Induction period, up to 30 months.\n2. Incidence of anti-odronextamab antibodies (ADAs) - Part 1 and Part 2, up to 30 months.\n3. Titers of ADAs to odronextamab - Part 1 and Part 2, up to 30 months.\n4. Incidence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to odronextamab - Part 1 and Part 2, up to 30 months.\n5. Best overall response (BOR) as assessed by the investigator - Part 1, end of Induction period and end of Maintenance period, up to 30 months.\n6. Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by ICR - Part 2, up to 5 years.\n7. CR30 as assessed by local investigator - Part 2, up to 30 months.\n8. Change from baseline in patient-reported physical functioning scale scores on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Cancer-30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) - Part 2, up to 5 years.",

            "Certainly! The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is a brief and validated measure of fatigue in individuals with MS. It consists of ten items rated on a scale from 0 to 4. The scores range from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue impact. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a non-diagnostic screening tool for sleep disturbances in the general population. The scale consists of 19 items that assess seven components of sleep quality over the previous 7 days: sleep duration, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, current sleep state at wakeup, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and Daytime dysfunction. The MS-specific subscales of the University of Washington Self-Efficacy Scale (UW-SES) are used to evaluate an individual's sense of control over MS symptoms. The subscales include control over: walking and balance, hand function and movement, pain, bowel and bladder, muscle spasms, and fatigue. The Cope Inventory is a coping checklist used to evaluate how people with a chronic illness manage specific stresses. It was created to measure the helpfulness of 61 different strategies for coping with stress and how coping strategies are used. Benefit-finding in Multiple Sclerosis (BFIMS) is a short, easy-to-use, self-report questionnaire that is used to measure the level of benefit finding in individuals with MS. The scale has 18 items that measure positive (benefit) and negative (harm) consequences of the individual's illness experience. The Ryff Psychological Well-Being scales assess the level of positive and negative affectivity. The scale consists of 10 items that are grouped into two components: Autonomous and Control-Oriented.",

Here are the outcome measures we have designed for your trial:\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Sensitivity of 68-Gallium-Fibroblast Activating Protein Inhibitor-46 Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography: This measure calculates the ratio between the number of patients who test positive for FAP and the number of patients with inconclusive results from the standard imaging test. The time frame is 30 months.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Detection rate of lesions, stratified by tumor histology: This measure assesses the proportion of positive patients among the total number who underwent the imaging test, categorized based on tumor histotypes. The time frame is 30 months.\n- Detection rate of stratified lesions for different lesion sites: This measure assesses the proportion of positive patients among the total number who underwent the imaging test, categorized based on the location of the lesions. The time frame is also 30 months.\n- Assessment early response to immunotherapy: This measure evaluates changes in FAP uptake in patients undergoing immunotherapy or other therapies and correlates these changes with clinical response. The time frame is 30 months.\n- Safety (number of patients): This measure assesses the number of treated patients who experience grade 1 to 4 adverse events.

            "Excellent! Let's move on to the tertiary outcome measures. These measures will allow us to further assess the treatment's effects on smaller, yet still important, changes associated with the treatment. One important tertiary outcome measure could be changes in retinal structure. An imaging technique like optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) may be used to assess changes in macular microaneurysm (MA) volume from baseline to Week 36 and Week 64. Assessing changes in MA volume will help us evaluate the treatment's effectiveness in preventing/reducing the risk of central retinal vein occlusion. Another tertiary outcome measure could be changes in vascular tortuosity as assessed by fluorescein angiography. Tracing and quantifying changes in tortuosity over time will give us valuable insights into the treatment's impact on the treatment's ability to improve blood flow to the retina.

That completes our list of potential primary outcome measures that we will use to evaluate the effectiveness of our endovascular aortic aneurysm treatment.\nInterventional cardiology procedures, particularly percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), have become routine practice across most hospitals and communities. The decision to perform an interventional procedure is often made based on electrocardiographic triggers or objective pre -test probability estimation, which may be generated by clinical history, physical examination, noninvasive testing, and, in some instances, pre - interventional angiography. The anatomy of the disease, proximity to major epicardial vessels and distal to the vessels, as well as the technical capability of the operator and infrastructure of the hospital will play major determinants in the decision to proceed. There are few if any randomized trials comparing specific treatment options in a complex and diverse patient population. Treatment is decided by a consensus of both expert opinion and objective data. The complexity of the arterial bifurcation, extent of lesion involvement, and anatomic variation at the area of obstruction play a role in selecting optimal therapy for each patient. All patients with stable coronary artery disease are not candidates for PCI. Patients with significant left main disease, total occlusion of a major epicardial vessel, total occlusion with high-grade stenosis in an important distal branch, multiple lesions, and diffuse disease are generally not candidates for an abrupt closure strategy using a bare metal stent or a balloon. Patients at moderate or high risk of having unstable angina are generally subjected to a full antiplatelet and antithrombotic regimen with unfractionated heparin or a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor to provide a stabile base for subsequent intervention with an added advantage of preventing late arterial spasm. Patients with total occlusion of a vessel that will not be grafted also usually receive a short or moderate infusion of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor under continued antiplatelet regimen and under fluoroscopic guidance are re-canalized using a coronary balloon or stent. The use of pre -interventional angiography is to assess a patient",

Peri-implant tissues health (Clinical) - Modified gingival index: This measure assesses the gingival health around the implant-supported prostheses. It provides a standardized method for evaluating inflammation and overall gingival health. The time frame for this measure would be 1 year to allow for long-term evaluation of gingival health. \n\n2. Peri-implant tissues health (Clinical) - Modified plaque index: This measure evaluates the accumulation of plaque around the implants. It's important to assess plaque accumulation to determine the effectiveness of the PEKK framework in maintaining oral hygiene and preventing peri-implant complications. Again, the time frame for this measure would be 1 year.",
            "Excellent question! Secondary outcome measures provide additional insights into the treatment's impact. Based on the study objectives, I would suggest the following secondary outcome measures:\n\n1. Peri-implant probing depth: This measure assesses the depth of the peri-implant pockets using a plastic periodontal probe. Increased probing depths indicate inflammation and potential peri-implantitis. Monitoring probing depth allows for early detection of changes in the peri-implant tissues. The time frame for this measure would also be 1 year.\n\n2. Peri-implant radiographic evaluation: This measure focuses on evaluating changes in marginal bone height around the implants using periapical radiographs. Marginal bone loss is a common complication in implant dentistry and can impact the long-term success of the prostheses. Monitoring bone height changes provides valuable information on implant stability and the impact of the PEKK framework on bone preservation. The time frame for this measure would also be 1 year.",

We can use this to assess whether intravenous vitamin C is actually having an effect on the tumor. We can also measure blood levels of vitamin C, which is given intravenously. However, the major problem with blood levels is that there are great variations in the absorption of intravenous vitamin C due to various factors such as acidity, hydration, etc. Thus, blood levels may not be the most reliable measure. We can assess the bioavailability of intravenous vitamin C by examining the tissues for enzyme levels, which are elevated in the presence of vitamin C. Another secondary outcome measure may be checking the red and white blood cell counts to determine for anemia and/or infection, which tend to rise in patients with cancer.",
            "Some other relevant measures would include measures of pain, functional status, and patient mental health. As far as functional status goes, we can assess it with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), a tool that assesses overall quality of life, physical well-being, and emotional functioning in cancer patients. For mental health, we may want to consider the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), a measure of mental status, mood, and anxiety in cancer patients. In addition, we may want to measure cognitive function with the National Cancer Institute of Neuro-cognitive Orientation Group (NCI-NCORG).",

It can help to know the survival rate of patients receiving intravenous ascorbic acid compared to those on normal saline. Overall survival is a hard endpoint to measure, but it can provide valuable information about the long-term impact of the intervention. It is important to note that this endpoint can take several years to mature, so we should not wait until it is mature before the trial ends.  [inst]Thank you for your suggestions!

By measuring the post-operative hematoma volume of more than 90% of the preoperative volume at follow-up, we can assess the efficacy of MMA embolization in reducing hematoma recurrence. These are the three primary outcome measures for our clinical trial. However, what about the secondary outcome measures?

We can also measure the cost of follow-up care, including the frequency of visits to specialists and hospitals. And we can measure the cost of lost productivity due to time off work or reduced work activity.

In phase 1 studies, researchers first test a new drug or treatment in a safe environment with a small group of people to evaluate how it is taken up, distributed, absorbed, and metabolized by the body, and to test for any side effects. Phase 1 studies do not test the effectiveness of a drug or treatment. The goal of a phase 1 study is to evaluate whether the drug or treatment is safe and well-tolerated at various doses.

Phase 2 studies generally investigate the drug's effectiveness in comparison to standard care or a dummy treatment (a placebo). Phase 3 studies test the drug in a larger group of people with the disease or condition, usually involving a few hundred to a few thousand people. These studies investigate the drug or treatment's effectiveness, side effects, risk-benefit ratio, and optimal dosage. The goal of Phase 3 is to confirm the drug's safety and effectiveness under conditions closely resembling what would be used in everyday practice.

This measure will evaluate the changes in visual acuity as assessed by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) eye chart up to 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the IVT dose. It will characterize the drug's effect on visual acuity and detect any changes in the participants' vision over time. Ophthalmoscopic assessment This measure will evaluate the retinal structure, vasculature, and anatomy at baseline and several time points up to 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the IVT dose using ophthalmoscopy.

Vessel tortuosity This measure will evaluate retinal vessel tortuosity at baseline and several time points up to 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the IVT dose using color fundus photography. It will characterize the effects of the intervention on blood vessels in the retina and detect any changes in vessel structure and/or function over time. Fluorescein angiography This measure will evaluate retinal vessel leakiness, including both central and peripheral leakiness, at baseline and several time points up to 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the IVT dose using fluorescein angiography.

The numeric range for visual acuity in the ETDRS study is described in Snellen equivalent ratios, where 1.0 is perfect visual acuity of 20/20 and decreasing values represent increasing reductions in visual acuity (20/50 is 0.4, 20/200 is 0.2, etc.). Each change will be reported as a decimal change from baseline. 2. \"Change in CNV area on fluorescein angiogram\": Intravenous or subtenon injections of fluorescein dye are made while taking detailed angiographic photographs using a specific high speed digital camera. Visualization of choroidal neovascularity (CNV) is done by careful analysis of the angiograms, segmenting the macula to outline the choroidal lesion, and measuring the total area of neovascularity. Central foveal neovascularity may be extrapolated to the macula periphery and then the total choroidal neovascular lesion area calculated. The area measurement and subsequent change from the fluorescein angiogram of the CNV can be recorded and calculated. This method for measuring the lesion may be repeated at each time point. Alternatively, total lesion area may be assessed at predetermined time points. \n3. \"Number of Patients Who Required Rescue Therapy\": It is anticipated that BBC 1501 may be used in combination with a rescue laser, particularly since it is a choroidal-sparing treatment. As a rescue therapy, the laser is occasionally needed to attempt additional photocoagulation around the choroidal neovascularity, which may increase both the incidence and extent of choroidal neovascularity in the treated eye that would have been resolved with BBC1501. The number of patients requiring rescue laser therapy after BBC1501 therapy is likely to be assessed"

Based on the information provided, I suggest using validated scales to measure vaccination attitude (confidence or hesitancy) for different subpopulations. This could include the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines Survey - Short Form (PACV-SF), Emory Vaccine Confidence Index (EVCI), Vaccination Confidence Scale (VCS), and Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale (VAX). These scales can be used to assess vaccine confidence over a 6-month period for caregivers of young children, caregivers of older pediatric patients, adult patients, and clinical workers/health professionals. What do you think of this suggestion?",

Based on the goals of the study, I suggest including measures related to missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs) and vaccination rates. For missed opportunities, we can analyze well visit completion rates before and after the intervention in different subpopulations such as adult patients and pediatric patients. We can also track the total number of well clinic visits at baseline and analyze changes over a 6-month period. Additionally, monitoring vaccination rates in different subpopulations over the same 6-month period will provide valuable information on the overall impact of the intervention. What are your thoughts on these secondary outcome measures?",

To summarize, the outcome measures for the clinical trial on group intervention for vaccine confidence are as follows:\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Vaccine confidence scale(s): Measured by validated scales such as PACV-SF, EVCI, VCS, and VAX. This measure will assess vaccination attitude (confidence or hesitancy) over a 6-month period for different subpopulations.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs): Analyzing well visit completion rates before and after the intervention, as well as changes in total well clinic visits over a 6-month period.\n- Vaccination rates: Monitoring vaccination rates in different subpopulations over a 6-month period.\n\nThese outcome measures will help evaluate the impact of the group intervention on vaccine confidence and vaccination outcomes.
