            "Great, thank you for confirming. Are you considering any other interventions in this trial or the other study arms? It would also be helpful if you could describe how the control group and intervention group will be offered the respective interventions.",
            "Alright, I would recommend having three study arms: 1. a control group (a no-intervention control) with patients with chronic low back pain being included, 2. a self-management intervention group (participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based self-management program for 6 weeks), and 3. a combined intervention group (participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based behavioral change counseling program, and a nurse-led evidence-based self-management program for 6 weeks) to evaluate this approach.",
            "Got it! Based on the details we've discussed, it seems like we could include a total of three study arms. We would have:"

            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Perfect! Here are the full study arms for the trial:\n\n1. No Intervention: Control\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants receive no intervention.\n\n2. Active Comparator: Self-management program (SMP)\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks.\nIntervention/Treatment: Behavioral: Self-management program\n- An evidence-based 6-week SMP led by a registered nurse. The SMP is based on the Arthritis Self-Management Program and the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program.\n\n3. Experimental: Self-management program (SMP) with Health Behavior Change Counseling (HBCC)\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks and receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing.\nIntervention/Treatment:\n- Behavioral: Health Behavior Change Counseling\n  * A telephone-based intervention employing principles and practices of motivational interviewing.\n- Behavioral: Self-management program\n  * An evidence-based 6-week SMP led by a registered nurse. The SMP is based on the Arthritis Self-Management Program and the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or if you have any other questions related to the clinical trial design."
