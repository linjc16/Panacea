            "Effect of pH and temperature on the bioavailability of chlordane in cattle feed supplement.\nAbstract A bioassay method was used to determine at which temperature and over which pH range chlordane will remain in solution after being added to cattle feed. Chlordane at a concentration of 0.0337 gm. per kg. was added to a commercial 2% Vitamin D supplement. The Vitamin D supplements were adjusted to either an acid, an alkaline or no adjustment pH, and then packed in 170 lbs. per sq. inch, 7 \u03bc air-tight bags. A known quantity of chlordane was added to bags of feed with a high protein content or a low protein content. As an additional control feed, corn grits were prepared to contain chlordane at the same level used in the high protein feed. The feed and control feed were stored in the dark in metal containers at 25, 35, 45, 55, 65 and 75 C. Samples of each feed were taken at intervals, and the chlordane concentration was determined. In the higher protein ration, all the chlordane was retained in solution until the pH was allowed to become slightly basic. In the low protein feed, there was a slow loss in the concentration of chlordane and at the end of 56 days, 0.178 mg. of chlordane remained, corresponding to 53.7% of the original concentration present. .\nThe number of immunosuppressed patients has been growing in recent years. It has been found that some medicines used in organ transplantations can trigger autoimmune diseases. The article presents two cases of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis under cyclosporin treatment which developed during organ transplantation. .\nIn a multicenter study of 204 patients with the following criteria: age between 55 and 85 years, a documented clinically relevant coronary insufficiency, class III to IV NYHA according to NYHA and EF <40%, the effects of continuous or intermittent cardiac pacing on exercise- and heart rate response was evaluated.

            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Perfect! Here are the full study arms for the trial:\n\n1. No Intervention: Control\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants receive no intervention.\n\n2. Active Comparator: Self-management program (SMP)\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks.\nIntervention/Treatment: Behavioral: Self-management program\n- An evidence-based 6-week SMP led by a registered nurse. The SMP is based on the Arthritis Self-Management Program and the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program.\n\n3.
