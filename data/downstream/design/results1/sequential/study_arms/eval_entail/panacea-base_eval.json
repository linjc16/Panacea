What do you think? \nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that tests the feasibility of the intervention being delivered to participants in the primary care setting compared to a group-based virtual setting. Participants will be older adults with chronic low back pain with a primary care referral. Participants will be randomized to either an arm that receives behavioral health behavior change counseling or an arm that receives the nurse-led self-management program. The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility of the procedures of conducting a fully powered study to address these important questions in a larger setting.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to assess the effectiveness of behavioral health behavior change (BHBC) intervention delivered through a nurse-led self-management group in comparison to a nurse-delivered self-management group on reducing disability and pain in older adults with chronic low back pain. This pilot RCT is a two-arm study with a control and treatment group. All participants will receive the nurse self-management program (MSMP) based on the Stanford-OHSU Chronic Disease Self-Management Program. Participants in arm 1 will receive the MSMP plus behavioral health interventions (BH BC) delivered by a trained behavioral health provider in a one-on-one setting. We will use an intention-to-treat analysis to determine pre-post changes in PROMIS Pain, Global Self-Assessment, and the Pain Self-Efficacy questionnaire.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nBehavioral Health Behavior ChangE Intervention Delivered via Nurse-led Self-Management Program on ReductIon of Disability and Pain in Older Adults With Chronic Low Back Pain\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nChronic Low Back Pain\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Behavioral Health Behavior Change Intervention\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: 18 years or older Primary",

The study consists of 3 study arms/groups: an experimental arm with 3 PB\u2010D918 dose levels and a placebo arm. A total of 24 subjects will be randomized into the experimental arm. Of this, six will be randomized to 3 sequential dose cohorts and receive SC PB\u2010D918 or a matched placebo once a week for 12 treatment weeks. The placebo arm will receive SC placebo for 12 treatment weeks. The placebo dose level will be assigned at random, blinded, and in sequence. The study design will follow a 3+3 dose\u2010escalation scheme. A total of 12 subjects will be randomized into the placebo arm (four subjects per dose cohort). Participant enrollment will begin with the lowest dose level cohort and escalate sequentially through each dose level cohort until approximately 4 subjects have completed the study per dose level and been followed for at least 7 weeks following the last study dose. PB\u2010D918 injection will not be administered to subjects until dose\u2010confirmation cohorts have demonstrated safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in at least 24 participants.

What is the study measuring? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Echocardiography plays an essential role in the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction (DD) caused by left ventricular (LV) relaxation abnormality, but is operator dependent. The Tissue Doppler Imaging derived S' wave is a reliable measure of LV systolic function and a surrogate of left ventricular relaxation (LV\u2010R). This study investigated the reproducibility of the Tissue Doppler Imaging derived S' wave for the diagnosis of DD.METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of studies of the efficacy and safety of ivabradine in Chinese patients with stable coronary artery disease and DD. All the patients were required to complete Tissue Doppler IV in the post\u2010exercise echocardiographic study.RESULTS: S' wave is highly reproducible for the diagnosis of DD in post exercise IV at a reference S' waves \u226512\u2009cm/s. The re\u2010test was done at least 1 week after the initial measurement, and the reproducibility results are as below: AUC of the ROC curve to diagnose diastolic dysfunction (DD) \u22651.66; Sensitivity, 68.2%; Specificity, 77.6%; AUC for DD \u22652: Sensitivity, 64.4%; Specificity, 74.6%. The diagnostic value of DD \u22652 was similar with or without LV hypertrophy (LVMI\u2265115\u2009g/m(2)). There was no significant change in S' wave and reproductibility from baseline to the end of 18th month treatment. At the end of 12\u2010month treatment, the S' wave did not differ among the three treatment groups (P>0.05).

The UEL related to BC represents a common and severe complication for breast cancer patients after surgery. Lymphedema represents a complex pathological process and NMES provides a non-invasive technique with the dual function of exercise and pain control in the treatment of lymphedema. In this regard, the electrical stimulation of the lymphatic system has been shown to decrease the formation of edema by increasing the lymph return and the muscle/soft tissue pump function, and it has been reported that this technique may also reduce the risk of developing lymphatic dysfunction and lymphedema. Both forms of NMES (low frequency, burst or high frequency) can be effective in the treatment of lymphedema, but high frequency has been shown to be more effective in the prevention of lymphedema, according to the available literature.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nNeuromuscular Electrostimulation in the Prevention of Upper Extremity Lymphedema: High Frequency vs. Burst Mode\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nBreast Cancer, Upper Extremity Lymphedema\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Low frequency versus burst mode neuromuscular electrical stimulation\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients with history of surgery with axillary lymph node dissection surgery, unilateral breast cancer, upper extremity lymphedema.

This arm will allow us to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention in improving outcomes related to anxiety, chronic pain, opioid use, and cravings.\n\n\nIntervention type\n=================\nBehavioural\n\nPrimary outcome measure\n=================\nThe trial will be conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods, as follows: Qualitative measures:The primary qualitative measure will be a telephone interview with the participant at the end of the intervention program, which will last for approximately 20 minutes. These interviews will be used to obtain feedback on the intervention and understand the participant's experience of the program. During the interview, we will ask questions about the participant's experience of the intervention, the perceived benefits of the intervention, any challenges encountered, and any suggestions for improvement. The interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed, and the transcripts will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify common themes in the data. We will also use the qualitative data to inform the development of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol.Quantitative measures:The primary quantitative measure will be the Brief CORES measure, which assesses the level of craving for opioids and other drugs. This measure will be administered at the beginning and end of the study to assess the change in craving levels. We will also use standardized questionnaires to assess anxiety, chronic pain, and other outcomes.\n\nParticipant inclusion criteria\n=================\n1. Be 18 years of age or older in order to participate in the study.\n2. Have an existing prescription for opioid drugs.\n3. Diagnosis of one or more anxiety disorders as evaluated by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).\n4. Diagnosis of chronic pain."

Participants will be stratified by country of recruitment, sex, age (<18, 18-35, >35) and HIV status (HIV negative at screening, HIV negative by ELISA and Western Blot at screening and follow-up, previously vaccinated with BCG, BCG at screening, no BCG at screening). The investigator, medical practitioner, study participant, study sponsor, and other parties that are studying or collecting the study data will not be blinded to the treatment assignment. The laboratory staff performing the DNA or RNA extraction or gene expression analysis will be blinded.\nMinimization is a procedure that can be used to ensure comparability between groups by matching them according to particular baseline characteristics (\u201cminimal\u201d variability). The rationale for the minimisation of the number and number of cells of each individual is still in discussion\nThe M72/AS01E-4 vaccine is expected to have an immunostimulatory effect and could result in higher vaccine-induced cell counts, higher CD4 counts, and lower CD8 counts in the blood and sputum. The M71-CLIN-101, M71-CLIN-102 and M71-CLIN-103 trials are expected to have different participant compositions by gender, age and HIV status. To address these challenges, participants will be stratified by country of recruitment, sex, age (<18, 18-35, >35) and HIV status (HIV negative at screening, HIV negative by ELISA and Western Blot at screening and follow-up, previously vaccinated with BCG, BCG at screening, no BCG at screening). The minimisation algorithm will be programmed before the start of enrolment, and each individual study site is not allowed to make amendments to the site's assigned allocation schedule. The use of blocking will also ensure an even distribution across strata. It is expected that the following parameters will be evenly distributed across strata: sex",

            "to a renal replacement therapy modality because it can be started or stopped easily and allows for rapid adjustment of fluid removal while also maintaining hemodynamic control in patients with a critical illness. To achieve sufficient fluid and uremic toxin removal, it is essential to achieve adequate UF efficiency. However, insufficient UF can contribute to increased hemodynamic instability, hypervolemia, and fluid overload, leading to worsening outcomes. Furthermore, an excessively high volume of UF can cause a reduction in cardiac output, which often occurs in patients with high vascular resistance, low cardiac output, cardiac failure, and impaired contractility. While HDF therapy can be considered as an adequate choice in terms of fluid removal and uremic clearance, there are some difficulties as well. Hemolysis during HDF can cause a decrease in hematocrit, anemia, and the need for frequent blood transfusions, which can result in poor patient prognosis. Therefore, the erythrocyte reduction filter (ERF) is one of the crucial components of the extracorporeal circuit that reduces the risk of these complications by selectively removing red blood cells.\nMost ERFs used in HDF systems are a combination of a polyamide membrane filter and polysulfone membrane filter with a pore size of 1 \u03bcm or 3 \u03bcm. The smaller the pore size of the filter is, the more it reduces hemolysis and the higher the resistance to blood flow, but it also causes an increase in transmembrane pressure and a decrease in blood flow. On the contrary, a larger pore size filter can reduce pressure and can increase blood flow.\nThe Baxter 2\u2010step HDF system is composed of an 80/20% polysulfone and polyamide membrane filter for hemofiltration and an 80/20% and polysulfone membrane filter for hemodialysis. This system is connected via a single filter housing that includes an ERF with a pore size of 3 \u03bcm (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL). However, the filter is an 80/20 filter composed of polysulfone and polyamide, and the pore size is 3 \u03bcm. Although the pore size is larger",
            "That sounds like a reasonable number. Could you please provide more information about the interventions and treatments for each study arm? \nAbstract:\nFourteen days of lysine restriction (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) were compared to a control diet (n = 9), which increased free lysine in plasma and excreted more lysine in the urine. Plasma lysine concentrations were 114% higher in comparison to placebo, with similar increases in the urinary excretion of lysine and arginine. A significantly higher nitrogen balance was achieved during lysine restriction. The dietary treatment resulted in a reduction of body weight, lean body mass, and fat free mass. Appetite was not affected by the lysine restriction diet, as was shown by food intake and plasma concentrations of ghrelin and cholecystokinin concentrations. Total lipids and plasma albumin concentration were significantly reduced during lysine restriction in comparison to placebo. However, protein intake significantly decreased during lysine restriction.\n\nIntroduction\nLysine is the first nutrient the body needs to be in a positive nitrogen balance. The lysine requirement has been shown to increase with an increase in protein intake. The addition of lysine to protein-deplete diets can increase the body\u2019s nitrogen balance (1) and its nitrogen utilization efficiency (2,3). This may explain why the human diet, even when consuming foods and supplements with essential amino acids, has proven to be inadequate in certain individuals (4).\nLysine restriction has been used clinically to decrease the requirements of lysine-requiring drugs (e.g., fluconazole), increase protein synthesis while decreasing degradation (5), and reduce the plasma lysine concentration in patients with hyperlysinemia (6).\nAnimal studies have shown that the body's efficiency of protein utilization is optimal with a moderate lysine intake, although a large body of research has demonstrated that an optimal lysine intake varies according to dietary protein intake (7\u20138). This is supported by a human study, which indicates that the optimal lysine requirements are between optimal to super-optimal intake (5).\nLysine is also essential for normal",

METHODS: From January 2018 to January 2020, 54 diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this randomized, controlled, open\u2010label, parallel groups trial. Patients were randomized into two treatment categories: glyburide (1:30:30 mg) plus DH treatment group (1:30:30 mg/day) and glyburide only treatment group (1:30:30 mg/day). The control group received the same treatment as the experimental group, while the treatment group in addition underwent DH treatment for 24 weeks. The main outcome measure was change in the 24\u2010h urine albumin\u2013creatinine ratio (UACR). RESULTS: The average follow\u2010up interval in the two groups was 4\u20105 months. At week 24, the change in 24\u2010h UACR were \u221250.15 \u00b1 23.45 mg/g and \u221257.79 \u00b1 28.31 mg/g for the DH and control groups, respectively. Patients in the DH group had a significantly greater reduction in 24\u2010h UACR than did those in the control group did (P < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant difference in blood glucose (BG) control between the experimental and control groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in BG levels between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with DH plus glyburide for 24 weeks resulted in lowering of 24\u2010h UACR, whereas glyburide alone only resulted in lowering of BG levels. This approach could be a potential clinical strategy for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy complicated with dyslipidemia. Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).",

Consequently, it causes high morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Early diagnosis of BTC is vital to improve outcomes and prognosis. In early stages, BTC typically has no specific symptoms, such as unintended weight loss or abdominal pain, and often presents as advanced or metastatic BTC. The current diagnostic method of choice is Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP) with or without abdominal endosonography, followed by tissue sampling by fine needle aspiration (FNA) and biopsy. The sensitivity of this diagnostic method is limited due to BTC often being confined to the biliary system and inaccessible. A more invasive and more costly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by biopsy can be employed to obtain tissue samples, although this method is inaccessible in many countries due to its limited availability. The use of peritumoral injection combined with laparoscopic biopsy or ultrasound-guided biopsy is another method that can improve sensitivity in BTC-affected patients. In recent years, with the improvement of sequencing technology and the development of blood-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid biopsy techniques, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is increasingly becoming a hotspot in precision cancer diagnosis. However, the diagnosis rate of ctDNA from blood samples in early BTC is low. Biliary tract cancer bile may have a high cancer DNA load due to abnormal bile flow and may be a diagnostic gold standard for extraction of ctDNA. However, to date, only a few studies and cases report the possibility of extracting ctDNA from bile using massively parallel next generation sequencing (NGS). Therefore, it is the purpose of this study to determine whether bile ctDNA sequencing can be used as",

The most common reason for revision surgery is failure of implant/patellar fixation fixation. In our previous study, different fixation options, implants and drilling techniques in THA revision have been described. There has been no clinical or radiological comparison, however, between cemented screws and cementless stems in THA revision using the same implant for fixation. The goal of the present trial is, therefore, to measure the radiological outcomes of cemented and cementless stems in THA revision using the same type of femur stem for fixation.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe goal of the present prospective clinical study is to measure the radiological outcomes of cemented and cementless stems in THA revision using the same type of femur stem for fixation. In a prospective longitudinal case-control design, we will compare radiological outcomes of patients receiving revision THA with cemented or cementless stems, using a single type of cementless distal femur stem (Stryker TrioptTM) after revision for one of the following indications: periprosthetic fracture, dislocation, or inflammatory loosening after unconstrained primary or revision THA. The primary clinical and radiological outcomes of interest are the implant survivorship (a component revision has to be performed) and the femoral stem loosening/migrating (defined by a change in the stem migration of 2 mm or more at follow up). Secondary outcome measures include the Harris hip score, SF-36, EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) and quality of life questionnaire. We will include 28 patients in the study, with both treatment groups consisting of 14 patients.

Introduction Background and Rationale {6a}\nBackground\nToothbrushing is an effective measure for plaque removal, yet people may not brush their teeth regularly. Furthermore, toothbrushing is limited by its dependence on manual dexterity, particularly in the elderly who are more likely to have reduced manual dexterity .\nIn recent years, new technologies have been developed to assist people in brushing their teeth effectively and independently, especially in the light of the increasing elderly population . Toothbrush autonomy has been introduced to assist the elderly in brushing their teeth. In these cases, the toothbrush is controlled by a pressure sensor embedded in its handle . Another device, the Br\u00fcshel, combines an electric toothbrush with a software program in the form of a tablet that provides instructions on how to brush each section of teeth via visual and audio instructions . These innovative toothbrushing technologies are designed to encourage regular brushing behaviours. However, these technologies are limited by a lack of patient motivation since they are not supported by any incentive, i.e. a reward.\nIt has been shown that extrinsic reinforcement through a \u201ctangible\u201d incentive, such as a prize or a medal, can effectively motivate students to work harder than when no rewards were provided . Similarly, monetary rewards have been shown to have a stronger motivational effect on children than non-monetary rewards, such as letters of participation or praise . In addition to financial incentives, rewards can also be intangible, such as recognition by their parents . In the context of toothbrushing, the effectiveness of intrinsic reinforcement, such as a \"clean\" smile or a feeling of fresh breath, has been demonstrated .\nHowever, it is unclear whether an extrinsic motivational incentive can support new toothbrushing technologies to increase user comfort and compliance. This is important because motivational rewards could be used at all stages of the tooth brushing process: when users prepare to use the toothbrushing device, when they are using the device, or after using the device.\nStudy aims\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an intrinsic motivational technology on the toothbrushing behaviour of young adults aged 18-35 years. More specifically, this pilot study will test the effectiveness of an interactive motivational game in promoting good tooth"

Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial. This study was conducted at the 4th Department of Cardiology, Ramathibodi Hospital in the year 2022. A total of 50 patients on the 3rd day of admission with myocardial infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI) were randomly allocated into the study group and the control group. In this study, a mood assessment tool (Profile of Mood States\u2010Second edition) and the music listening intervention were conducted to patients in the Music group for 10 minutes every day for 7 consecutive days. Data collection tools included a socio\u2010demographic tool and Profile of Mood States\u2010Second edition. Analysis of the data obtained from the tool is interpreted as statistically significant at a p value of .05 (P \u2264 .05). Results: The average age of patients in this study was 59.62 years old (age ranged from 31 to 73 years), and males were 69% (n=29) . 28 (56%) of patients received the Music intervention. There are no differences in baseline mood states between the Control and Music groups. The results of the mood state evaluation show that after 7 days, both the control group and the Music group found an improvement in their mood states. However, the improvement in the Music group's mood state was more significant (the average score decreased by approximately 30% while the average Control group score decreased by approximately 15%). Conclusion: Music therapy reduces self\u2010criticism, anxiety and depression of patients with ACS in the hospital. Thus, music therapy may be an aid to improve the psychosocial aspects of the ACS patient.",

Preterm infant complications include pulmonary dysplasia, chronic lung disease of infants, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), inborn neonatal seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retardation of brain development, often requiring long-term hospitalization. The cost of long-term hospitalization is high. According to the data of Nanchang hospital, the total cost for treating one premature infant in the NICU is about 130,000 yuan. However, due to medical and economic obstacles, many premature infants in China cannot receive regular follow-up observations. There is a lack of follow-up medical management for premature infants from birth to adulthood, resulting in an increasing medical burden.

And what is the duration of the intervention/treatment component? \n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThere is great interest in the use of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to treat symptoms of addiction. Preliminary data on the effects of tDCS in methamphetamine (meth) users is promising but to date has only assessed craving. This study will aim to investigate if tDCS is well accepted, and will evaluate the effect of three doses (0mA, 1mA, 2mA) of tDCS on craving, neuropsychological measures and self-reported outcomes in recently abstinent methamphetamine use (28 days) compared to a control condition during a 2 hour single session. This study is registered with the Australian Human Research Ethics Committee (ID 2016298516).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThere has been a great deal of interest in using transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to treat symptoms of addiction. Some initial data has been produced that using tDCS in the brain region of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, BA11) in meth users reduces craving, and other data suggests that targeting areas associated with cognitive control (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) using tDCS could act as an intervention to reduce craving. However these studies have only assessed the effects of tDCS on craving levels without assessing other aspects that may influence success in recovering from addiction by reducing craving. The current study is a sham-controlled, single session experiment that aims to test three dose conditions of brain stimulation (0 mA; 1 mA; 2 mA) on various factors that may influence success in overcoming cravings that often prompt the use of methamphetamine in people with addiction. In particular, the current study aims to: assess the safety and tolerability of tDCS with the doses studied; explore whether the doses tested would reduce the severity of cravings (primary); examine any differential effect on cognitive measures and self report measures; and examine the impact of the dose of tDCS on brain activity (functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Data will be analysed",

Can you share any information on the details of the peer education? \n\nAbstract:\nObjective\n-----------------\nTo compare the effectiveness of transrectal needle biopsy performed by a urologist and an urology resident on patients with suspected prostate cancer.\nMethods\n-----------------\nMen suspected of having prostate cancer were enrolled. Prostate biopsy was performed using 29\u2010gauge, disposable 18\u2010cm needle bioptome under ultrasonography (USS) guidance by the urologist who had worked for more than five years or with the urology resident who had participated in less than five prostate biopsy procedures. The biopsy results were compared in each group.\nResults\nThe mean age of the patients was 64.1+5.4 years in the urologist\u2010 biopsy group and 64.8+4.8 years in the resident\u2010biopsy group (difference p value=0.183). The prostate volume, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and percentage of positive biopsy cores were not different between the two populations. However, when evaluating the individual results of both tests, it was observed that 9 (23.1%) of the urologists\u2010performed, 5 (13.2%) of the resident\u2010performed needle biopsies were not technically efficient. This difference was significant (p value=0.005). It has been seen that urologist\u2010performed needle biopsies are more complicated and are at least 6 times more likely to fail (p value=0.002).\nConclusion\nNeedle biopsies performed by an experienced urologist should be preferred in patients with suspected prostate cancer.\n\n1. Introduction\nSince the 1980s, many techniques have been introduced to increase the positive needle biopsy rates and to reduce side effects in prostate biopsy, one of the primary examinations performed in patients with increased suspicion of prostate cancer . In current clinical practice, transrectal needle biopsy is used with real-time ultrasound guidance. The main disadvantage of this procedure is the low positive needle biopsy rate, ranging from 40 to 52 percent . In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-gu",

In 2020, approximately 230,000 women were diagnosed with EOC worldwide, and more than 200,000 women died from it. EOC is characterized by an initial asymptomatic stage, and more than 70% of these patients are diagnosed when the disease has advanced into the advanced stage. More than 70% of patients with EOC receive cytoreductive surgery and post-operative paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy. Paclitaxel is a member of the taxoid family of drugs and is a microtubule stabilizing agent used in the treatment of various cancers. As a common first-line treatment for primary and recurrent malignancies of the ovary and fallopian tube, carboplatin and paclitaxel are considered the preferred first-line regimen for EOC. Carboplatin and paclitaxel have demonstrated superiority in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rate, and have become a widely used chemotherapy drug in clinical treatment and become the preferred treatment in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. However, the 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer is only about 30%-35%. This survival rate may be related to the patient's physiological condition before surgery, the stage of metastasis, and the amount of primary treatment tumor. Currently, the clinical research direction needs to be continued to improve the survival rate. Studies have shown that the mechanism of epithelial ovarian necrosis is related to multiple factors such as inflammation, hypoxia, and nutrition, which ultimately lead to apopt",

Postoperatively, 10\u201020 % increase of the volume of liquid volume of lymphocele up to 300 cm3; it can be followed by symptoms of compression, secondary infection, and lymphocele thrombosis. The study included 57 patients (64 lymph nodes). Transrectal technique for sclerotherapy of lymphoceles was adopted in 30 patients. The average time of surgery was 32+3 min, and the duration of hospital stay did not exceed 2 days. The success rate of sclerotherapy of the primary lymphocele was 57 %. In further 25 cases, additional ultrasonography and repeated transrectal sclerotherapy procedures were performed. Thus, it should be noted that in more than 30% of patients, the surgical technique of transrectal sclerotherapy of lymphocele is effective with a single procedure. The advantages of transrectal technique for lymphocele treatment are the availability of materials; the simplicity of the procedure itself, the absence of complications, and shorter postoperative rehabilitation period.",

Can you briefly describe the clinical trial method you will be using? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: The incidence of endometrial cancer (EC) and adenomyosis in reproductive age women is increasing. In particular, EC is the most common gynecological malignancy, and early diagnosis and early surgical intervention are important factors for improving the prognosis of patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of transvaginal transfollicular tracer\u2010guided high\u2010frequency focused ultrasound (TFUS) therapy for the treatment of EC in patients with myometrial invasion thickness \u22672.5 cm. DESIGN: Forty\u2010five patients were enrolled randomly. Transvaginal sonography was used to assess the number, size, and characteristics of follicles in patients in different stages, and the corresponding ultrasound data (diameter and number) were used as the basis of transvaginal transfollicular tracer\u2010guided (TTTG) high\u2010frequency focused ultrasound for the treatment of EC. Clinical curative effect was evaluated according to EC progression, patient's reproductive endocrine function assessment, and ultrasound dynamic observation after operation. RESULTS: The TTTG group and the operation group were compared with patients with endometrial thickness \u22672.5 cm and uterine myoma in patients with endometrial cancer. Clinical data show that the patients were comparable, and the curative effect of the two groups is 90%; the reproductive function recovery period of the TTTG group was also shorter than that of the control group. Moreover, it was found that the myometrial invasion thickness of the postoperative ultrathin slice was only 0~1.9 cm and complete remission occurred in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: It shows that transvaginal transfollicular tracer\u2010guided (TTTG) high\u2010frequency focused ultrasound is a new and effective method for the treatment of patients with EC.",

The geko\u2122 W3 or X-W3 System are minimally invasive medical devices used to promote healing by providing gentle electrical stimulation to leg muscles that aid in reducing leg swelling. The geko\u2122 W3/X-W3 Systems use adhesive pads to attach to the skin. The current hydrogel adhesive material in geko\u2122 X-W3 devices has been found to have poor skin adhesion, particularly in elderly participants in previous clinical studies. Hydrogels are a type of soft adhesive material designed to minimize stress on skin, promote healing, and avoid irritation. However, commercially available hydrogels are still suboptimal for use in medical devices like the geko\u2122 X-W3. This study aims to develop and evaluate a new hydrogel adhesive for use in medical devices like geko\u2122 X-W3. The effectiveness of the new hydrogel adhesive will be compared with the current adhesive in terms of skin adhesion and comfort, as well as patient satisfaction and device usability. The study will involve two phases. During the development phase, up to 20 participants will be recruited to share their opinions and preferences on different types of hydrogel adhesives. During the clinical phase, up to 40 participants will be recruited to test the comfort and durability of the new hydrogel adhesive during two-week wear trials. Participants will complete questionnaires and provide feedback on the efficacy and comfort of the adhesive. The new hydrogel adhesive is expected to improve skin adhesion, comfort, and device usability for patients with CVD, leading to faster and more effective wound healing.\n\nOfficial Title",

Could you please provide me with some specific details about the intervention? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if use of the Army Health mobile application in conjunction with a coaching intervention designed to improve lifestyle behaviors leads to improved health and wellness outcomes for US Army Soldiers. The Army Health application is a 4.0 Android mobile application developed specifically for and by Soldiers, with the Army Surgeon General, and in collaboration with the Soldier Centered Medical Home (SCMH) Advisory Panel. Army Health allows individuals to track their blood pressure, weight and heart rate and enables providers and users to more seamlessly and effectively share this health information. The mobile application also encourages users to take the lead to achieve their personal health and wellness goals, through features that provide reminders about daily behavioral targets, educational information, health and fitness challenges, and a user-friendly interface to engage with the content. During this study, Soldiers assigned to Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) will be randomly assigned to either the active intervention (group 1) or a control group (group 2). Soldiers in group 1 will be given a Fitbit activity tracker, allowed access to the Army Health application, and connected with their primary care provider (PCP) to develop a plan for improving their personal health and wellness goals. Soldiers in group 2 will only be given access to the Army Health mobile application. Both groups will be followed for a period of six months. The primary outcome of the study will be feasibility; it will assess whether group 1: (1) reports greater improvements in lifestyle behaviors compared to group 2; or (2) is more likely to continue using Army Health post-intervention compared to group 2. Secondary outcomes will assess changes in health and wellness outcomes over time.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nWhole Health Smartphone Application and Behavioral Coaching to Improve Health and Wellness for Active Duty US Army Soldiers: A Pilot Study\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nBehavioral Risk Factor, Lifestyle Behavior, Physical Activity, Health and Wellness Outcomes\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Behavioral: Army Health and Behavioral Coaching Intervention\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility",
            "Excellent! Could you please specify the study design in more detail? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Low back pain (LBP) remains a significant contributor to the burden of musculoskeletal disease in Australia, associated with substantial productivity loss and significant costs to the health system. Exercise\u2010based interventions are effective management strategies for LBP, and the aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of group based exercise and a remote exercise program in reducing pain and improving health and function for adults with LBP. Method: A randomized, two\u2010arm, controlled single\u2010blinded study design, evaluating an 8 week group exercise program (Beyond Back Pain\u00ae Program), and a remote self\u2010exercise program (My Back Pain\u2122 Program). Participants were recruited from four community gyms, four regional primary care facilities, and the public health system in Northern Sydney. Participants were assessed as a group at baseline and at 3 and 12 month follow up to determine changes in pain, health and function. Results: A total of 138 participants (male = 92, female = 46) completed the 8 week group program, with outcomes assessed at baseline, 3 and 12 month follow up. Significant improvements were observed at 3 months in pain (p < 0.001), disability and self\u2010efficacy (p < 0.001) for group participants. At 12 month follow up, a substantial reduction in pain was observed for both groups, with disability measures and self\u2010efficacy showing non\u2010significant changes. The group program resulted in higher levels of physical activity, which correlated with improvements in pain and health and function measures. Conclusions: Despite greater improvements in pain during the 8 week group exercise program compared to the remote self\u2010exercise program, the benefits were maintained at one year. Furthermore, a key finding is that both programs increased self\u2010reported physical activity levels.",
            "Thank you! Now, let's discuss the methodology and the planned duration of the intervention. \n\nAbstract:\nThe purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective, randomized controlled crossover trial comparing a commercially available soft contact lens (scleral) to a new contact lens with a silicone hydrogel center surrounded by a low\u2010water content soft lens (modified scleral) regarding postrefractive eye surgery outcomes and symptoms. Currently, there are limited data regarding the outcomes of patients fitted with soft contact lenses after laser refractive surgery procedures. Patients at risk for developing dry eye after elective laser refractive surgery will be enrolled in this study. Subjects will complete a baseline examination and be randomly assigned to either wear the scleral or modified scleral contact lens for a 2\u2010week period. At the end of the 2\u2010week period, subjects will crossover to the other contact lens. Outcomes measures will be compared to their baseline scores. We will evaluate the efficacy of scleral and modified scleral contact lenses at improving comfort, symptoms of dry eye disease, and vision\u2010specific quality of life in patients undergoing laser refractive surgery who are at risk of developing dry eye symptoms. In this study, we will also perform a prospective, randomized controlled crossover trial comparing the effect of a commercially available soft contact lens (scleral) to a new contact lens with a silicone hydrogel center surrounded by a low\u2010water content soft lens (modified scleral) regarding postrefractive eye surgery outcomes and symptoms. Currently, there are limited data regarding the outcomes of patients fitted with soft contact lenses after laser refractive surgery procedures. However, there has been a shift from contact lenses designed primarily to replace optical prescriptions toward those designed to address patient\u2010reported discomfort (e.g., dryness). Additionally, scleral lenses are known to be more comfortable than conventional soft contact lenses and have demonstrated benefits for patients with corneal abnormalities and dry eyes. In this study, we will evaluate the efficacy of scleral and modified scleral contact lenses at improving comfort, symptoms of dry eye disease, and vision\u2010specific quality of life in patients undergoing laser refractive surgery who are at risk of developing dry eye symptoms.

We hypothesize that the technology-enhanced approach will reduce procedure time, improve outcomes, and increase patient satisfaction compared to traditional ablation techniques. Methods: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial involving adult patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation at a single center. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the traditional ablation or technology-enhanced ablation group. The primary outcome is procedural time. Secondary outcomes include procedure success, procedure durations, and patient satisfaction with both procedures. We will also analyze the cost-effectiveness of the two approaches. Results: This study is ongoing, and the initial results will be available after enrolling 100 participants. Conclusion: This study seeks to improve the quality of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation by assessing the impact of a technology-enhanced ablation approach. We anticipate that the results will have significant implications for clinical practice and patient outcomes.\nIntroduction\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of heart arrhythmia in developed countries, affecting over 9 million people in the United States alone. Catheter ablation is recognized as the most effective treatment for symptomatic patients with drug-refractory AF. However, the procedure is time-consuming, often exceeding 4 hours. The long duration of the procedure can lead to increased risk of complications such as bleeding and infection, as well as a negative impact on patient satisfaction.\nIn recent years, advances in technology have revolutionized interventional cardiology procedures by improving procedural efficiency, reducing procedural complications, and enhancing patient outcomes. Catheter navigation systems are one such technology that has been developed to enhance the precision and efficiency of catheter ablation. Catheter navigation systems are computer-assisted systems that use image-guided mapping techniques to guide the catheter to its intended location within the heart. This",

The patients were randomized to a control group (n = 6) treated for 3 days with 5% dextrose in water (D5W) and to the treatment group (n = 6), treated for 3 days with intravenous GGT, 150 IU/kg (5\u201025 mg/kg) followed by 100 IU/kg (4\u201020 mg/kg) during the next 17 hours. GGT was extracted from human plasma with a special chromatographic purification technique. The patients were followed clinically and by laboratory assays (blood routine, serum transaminases, and lipids) to assess the efficacy of the therapy. Results: Five patients in both groups died of complications of pancreatitis. The patients in the control group did not show a clear improvement in blood samples. However, in the treatment group, the patients showed a significant decrease in the serum levels of all biochemical parameters of inflammation and an increase in the serum levels of 3\u2010hydroxy\u20103\u2010methylglutaryl\u2010CoA reductase mRNA. No serious side effects of GGT treatment were observed. Conclusions: The 24\u2010h intravenous administration of plasma\u2010derived GGT can safely attenuate the biochemical manifestations of alcoholic pancreatitis in chronic alcoholic patients.

            "For the experimental intervention, I recommend using the combination of hot EMR and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This method involves an initial submucosal injection of physiological solution, followed by 'piece-meal' resection using a 15 millimeter diathermic snare and RFA of the margins. The use of RFA in this case will be an addition to the standard hot EMR technique, as it will target any remaining areas of heat-sensitivity during the procedure. \n\nTo summarize, both the standard hot EMR technique and the experimental combination of hot EMR and RFA involve submucosal injection of physiological solution and 'piece-meal' resection using a 10 or 15 millimeter diathermic snare. The experimental arm includes RFA of the margins, which is not part of the standard hot EMR technique. \n\nOverall, this design is appropriate for a comparative study between the two techniques.

            "Excellent idea! The pre-test and post-test measurements will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention and the degree of improvement in the selected outcomes. The Descriptive Characteristics Form, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Templer Death Anxiety Scale, and Caregiver Strain Index will provide quantitative data, while the Structured Interview Forms and audio recordings will provide qualitative data, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of the participants' experiences. Overall, the combination of quantitative and qualitative data collection methods will enable us to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the Watson Human Caring Model-based psychoeducation intervention on the study outcomes.

The caregivers in the experimental group and the control group have already been recruited, and both groups have completed an intervention and assessment at the end of the intervention. Prior to beginning the intervention, the first visit was conducted to obtain a baseline measurement using the Descriptive Characteristics Form, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Templer Death Anxiety Scale, and Caregiver Burden Index. Data on the socio-demographic characteristics of the study population were also obtained at the same time. After the completion of the intervention, the final visit was conducted to collect the same data, and we will also conduct semi-structured interviews with the two participants who consented to participate. \n\nSample size\nOur study includes two groups, each consisting of a total of 9 participants.

The intervention group received face\u2010to\u2010face medication adherence health education by community nurses for 15 minutes three times within 3 weeks. Both groups received routine psychological education. The primary outcome was patients' knowledge about medication adherence, and the secondary outcome was patients' perception of self\u2010efficacy.RESULTS: The education helped reduce the difference in knowledge scores between the two groups from 19.68 (95% CI= \u20107.24, \u20102.13) at baseline to 1.51 (95% CI= \u20101.76, \u20101.26) at 2 weeks, \u20104.86 (95% CI= \u20105.69, \u20104.04) at 1 month, and 0.48 (95% CI= \u20102.51, \u20101.62) at 3 months post\u2010intervention (p = 0.038 compared to baseline).

Fifty patients with uterine fibroid scheduled for laparoscopic myomectomy were randomly divided into 2 groups\u2010control and study groups. General intravenous anesthesia was conducted by anesthesiologists. The control group was given placebo, while the study group was given ketamine and sufentanil. After the surgery, VAS and Ramsay scores were recorded. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was recorded, as well as the incidence of sedation. The time when the patient's first breath was taken was recorded. Heart rate, blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation and the level of consciousness were recorded before drug administration, and each 5 minutes during laparoscopic myomectomy, as well as 5 minutes and 30 minutes after drug administration. The time of first breath was 146\u00b122 seconds in the control group and 93\u00b119seconds in the study group (P<0.001).

            "Can an explanation of the logic behind this allocation and intervention model be provided? \n\nBackground\n=================\nIt is well known that the treatment of depression or anxiety in patients with cancer is more difficult than in the general population and more difficult than treating general depression. This has been demonstrated by 2 reviews. In addition, the response to the antidepressants is not so good, so the patients do not achieve a better response than that of the non-treated group. Therefore, it is necessary to search for new effective treatments for treating depression in these patients. The most recent of these is transcranial repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r-TMS), which has been demonstrated to be effective in adults with major depressive disorder. Previous studies in patients with breast cancer have also proven the efficacy of r-TMS therapy over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in combination with escitalopram (ESC) for 4 weeks in improving quality of life. \n \nStudy design\n=================\nNon-randomized two groups' pre-post study\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\n1.

            "The primary endpoint will be 90-day survival, and the secondary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality or liver transplant. These endpoints will help us evaluate the efficacy and safety of CytoSorb treatment in this population. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Acute\u2010on\u2010chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by acute deterioration of chronic liver disease (CLD) with concurrent development of encephalopathy and variceal bleeding. ACLF patients often require intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. Liver transplantation may be the only definitive treatment for patients with refractory ACLF who do not survive to transplantation. Cyclosporine A (CsA) has been shown to reduce mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients with ACLF in retrospective studies, but not in a randomized controlled trial. We designed this Phase III multi\u2010center trial to determine whether CsA can improve survival outcomes for patients with ACLF. Methods: 4AIM is a prospective, international, randomized controlled trial comparing CsA versus control (standard medical care without CsA) in patients with ACLF. The primary endpoint is 90\u2010day survival. Secondary endpoints include a composite of all\u2010cause mortality or liver transplant. Patients are randomly assigned either CsA dose-calibrated using the area under the concentration\u2010time curve (AUC) or a fixed total daily dose of CsA. CsA therapy is initiated immediately upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and continued until ACLF resolves, death, or ICU discharge. Survival outcomes will be compared between CsA and control groups in an intention\u2010to\u2010treat (ITT) analysis. The safety of CsA will be evaluated by assessing adverse events, such as infection and graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease. A central laboratory will analyze liver biopsies for quantitative analysis of inflammatory cytokines and other immune\u2010inflammatory biomarkers. The efficacy and safety of CsA treatment in patients with ACLF will be assessed in a phase III, randomized, and controlled fashion. This study may lead to improved outcomes for patients"

Pacemakers are artificial devices designed to control the heart rate by either stimulating the heart muscles or causing electrical blockage in specific arteries of the heart. When used together, the drugs and pacemakers aim to normalize the heart rhythm and prevent tachycardia. While drugs and pacemakers are known methods for treating tachyarrhythmia, there may be cases when a combination of the two is necessary. In our study, we intend to investigate the combination of drugs and pacemakers for the treatment of tachyarrhythmia in our study design. Our study will focus on three distinct heart rhythm abnormalities: atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. Patients will be divided into two groups: drug therapy only and drug therapy plus pacemaker. The study duration and follow-up for patients in each group will vary due to the uniqueness of each heart rhythm disorder, and individualization of treatment is essential to ensure optimal outcomes. The goal of our study is to provide an innovative and effective treatment approach for tachyarrhythmia utilizing both drugs and pacemakers, and to optimize each therapy as best as possible for the individual patient.\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\n1) Patients diagnosed with tachyarrhythmia\nMinimum age: 18 Years\nMaximum age: 80 Years\nGender: Both\n\nExclusion criteria\n=================\n1) Other concomitant disease conditions that do not allow for participation of a clinical trial to be performed\nMinimum age: 18 Years\nMaximum age: 80 Years\nGender: Both\n\nPrimary outcome\n=================\nOverall response to therapy and overall adverse events\n\nSecondary outcome\n=================\nThe incidence of adverse events and mortality at 4 years"

As for the specific intervention, I suggest a multidisciplinary program that includes non-invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. Can you provide me with further details on the program you envision, such as the frequency and duration of the electrical stimulation sessions? \n\nAbstract:\nSeventy\u2010four consecutive patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) between June 2015 and August 2020 were enrolled in this study after obtaining the approval of the hospital Ethics Committee and the written consent of the patients. There were 35 males (47.2%) and 39 females (52.8%). The mean patient age was 60.8 years (interquartile range=23\u201370 years). The most common cause of ARDS was sepsis (41 patients), followed by lung contusion (19 patients) and post-cardiothoracic surgery (18 patients). In our study, we used a multidisciplinary approach that included non\u2010invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord in addition to standard treatment. We used the Spinalon\u00ae device (Cefa srl., Italy) for electrical stimulation. This was a 12\u2010channel, transcutaneous device that was capable of generating a square pulse (pulse width=100 \u03bcs). The stimulation intensity ranged from 3 to 5 mA and was applied for 30 minutes twice daily. The stimulation was based on motor action potentials, and two sessions per day were performed using a stimulator frequency of 10 Hz. After a maximum of 10 sessions or a minimum of 8 sessions, the patient could be considered as improving. The primary outcome was the 28\u2010day mortality rate, while the secondary outcomes were the number of ventilator\u2010free days (VFDs), the length of ICU and hospital stay, and the serum biomarker levels.

A flow diagram of study participants will be developed to document the reasons for enrolling and discontinuing the intervention. Additionally, we will record parameters such as length of mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilation free days, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay.CONCLUSIONS: A randomized controlled trial comparing Transcutaneous Biopac Electrical Stimulator and usual care to prevent respiratory muscle atrophy in ARDS patients showed that the intervention was feasible.

In ED1, 222 patients were allocated to the LFA (intervention group); 24 h later ED2 was randomized to receive the same allocation. A 13\u2010step procedure was used in ED1 using nasopharyngeal swabs.

A single\u2010step procedure, similar to usual practice for rapid antigen test collection, was performed using mid\u2010turbinate sampling. The LFA was read 2 h later. The primary outcome was positive results (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA or antigen) on the LFA as measured by agreement of the ED LFA or Xpert\u00ae Xpress result with the final SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 reference result.

Firstly, they will help us assess the effectiveness of narrative group counseling compared to the control group by measuring the changes in psychological resilience over time. Secondly, they will provide valuable insights into the challenges and coping strategies used by nursing students during their training. \n\nIn conclusion, this study would be a randomized controlled trial that aims to assess the effect of narrative group counseling on psychological resilience in nursing students. The study would involve an experimental arm, which will receive narrative group counseling, and a control arm, which will undergo stress coping interviews along with their routine practices.

Therefore, in this clinical trial, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a combination therapy of dexamethasone plus aprepitant plus ondansetron in preventing the post\u2010operative emetic effect of paclitaxel. Seventy\u2010three patients hospitalized for breast conservation therapy or mastectomy for breast cancer were enrolled in a double\u2010blind, randomized, and comparative study. The patients were divided into three groups of 20 each. They received 20 mg aprepitant orally on days 2 and 3 and received 25 to 50 mg daily ondansetron for up to 3 days if they did not vomit. The first group was administered oral ondansetron 25 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 3, the second group received dexamethasone IV from Day 2 to Day 3, and the third group received aprepitant and ondansetron. Patients received a 3\u2010day course of paclitaxel from Day 1 to 3, but ondansetron was not allowed during antiemetic use.

The details of the study arms and interventions/treatments are available in our discussion section. We plan to evaluate the effectiveness of both study arms in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with spinal cord injury and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are receiving chemotherapy combined with PD-1 blockade. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Exercise\u2010induced respiratory problems in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly understood. Objectives: To assess whether a single session of high\u2010intensity interval training (HIIT) performed on a 10\u2010m incline could improve expiratory flow volume and the maximum voluntary ventilation in a 6\u2010min period of maximal exercise (MVV) in SCI patients with COPD. Methods: Six SCI patients with COPD, aged 20\u201373 years (mean age: 49 years), were included in the study. Following a baseline measurement, 3 consecutive sessions of HIIT (6 \u00d7 6\u2009min with breaks) were performed. The distance and speed performed during each interval were individually adapted for each subject. Results: After 3 consecutive HIIT sessions, flow\u2010volume curve loop analysis showed that vital flow volume was enhanced (0.94 \u00b1 0.56 L/s, P\u2009<\u20090.001), forced expiratory flow at 25% of vital capacity was improved (0.90 \u00b1 0.38, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and MVV was increased by 27% (P\u2009=\u20090.030). Conclusion: HIIT performed on a 10\u2010m incline for 60\u2009min twice a week for 4 weeks can significantly increase the expiratory flow volume of SCI patients with COPD. PMID: 35123623\n\n\n1."

The RDNs will provide nutrition care to the participants, including medical nutrition therapy, through a secure telehealth platform. This way, participants can receive the required nutrition services without physically visiting an RDN, which can improve accessibility and convenience for these individuals. \nI also wanted to point out that by providing nutrition care and meals remotely, we can reach a broader population of older adults, including those who may have transportation or mobility limitations. This study arm has significant potential to improve nutrition outcomes for this vulnerable population. \nI would also like to point out that providing nutrition care and meals via telehealth can help address the shortage of RDNs in the healthcare system. This method of delivery can expand the reach of RDNs and allow them to provide care to a larger number of patients.

Participants can be blinded to the interventions to reduce bias in outcome measurements and minimize placebo effects. \n\nAbstract:\nBuprenorphine is a partial opioid antagonist widely used for the treatment of opioid dependence. Compared to methadone, it results in fewer serious side effects, and also improves treatment retention. However, some of the patients are unwilling to accept opioid withdrawal and prefer methadone. Thus, it is essential to develop new strategies for buprenorphine treatment. We recently investigated an early buprenorphine treatment combined with dermal microdosing of methadone as a novel approach. Early treatment of heroin dependence with buprenorphine is followed by a gradual dose reduction of buprenorphine and methadone combined to achieve a controlled withdrawal period. To verify methadone effects at the end of the buprenorphine period, two different dose regimens of methadone were compared regarding the level of sedation and opioid craving. Sixteen participants with opioid dependence were randomly assigned to a high methadone concentration (10 mg daily) or to a lower concentration (1 mg daily). We found both dose regimes equally effective in terms of sedation and withdrawal symptoms. However, craving for heroin was significantly lower in the low\u2010dose group. Thus, it can be concluded that the microdosing of methadone is an effective treatment for opioid\u2010dependent patients in whom the buprenorphine treatment shows a lack of effect.",

These criteria will help us recruit the most suitable patients for the trial, which can lead to more reliable results and help us establish a clearer understanding of the potential benefits of proton GRID radiotherapy.\n\nAbstract:\nRadiation is a well\u2010recognized treatment for cancers. Prostate cancer is often treated with radiation therapy as the initial treatment option. Patients receive standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) treatment, with a high rate of disease control in the low and intermediate risk group. For a subset of patients at higher risk, post\u2010operative radiation is performed to address concerns for local disease control and reduction of local prostate recurrence (LRP). Post\u2010operative radiation also is used for patients with high risk disease who cannot undergo surgery, or in whom surgery is either associated with unacceptable morbidity or who decline the surgical option. The standard post\u2010operative radiation is generally delivered in 6\u201010 weeks using standard EBRT, which can be impractical, costly, and inconvenient. We have the resources to treat these patients with advanced, intensity modulation technology (IMRT) that allows for dose escalation and dose conformity. Post\u2010operative radiation can also be delivered with proton therapy using the same radiation planning principles as IMRT. Proton therapy for post\u2010operative radiation is a safe, well tolerated treatment option. While the majority of LRP can be surgically controlled, a subset of patients will have local recurrence (LRP) at the prostate bed due to incomplete or negative surgical margins. A randomized clinical trial is in progress with University of Michigan using IMRT post\u2010operative radiation utilizing IMRT at 7440 centigray (cGy) to the whole prostate bed in 56 fractions. This study is comparing the standard arm of 65\u201068 Gy in 28\u201030 fractions to the 7440 cGy arm, a 50% increase in dose. We hypothesize that",

Now let's move on to other sections of the protocol, such as the primary outcome measure. \n\nPrimary Outcome Measure\n=================\nThe primary outcome measure is the amount of pain at the start of the study, and 1 and 2 months after the start of the study. The Visual Analog Scale will be used to measure pain, with a value of 5-10 indicating a higher level of pain. A decrease in pain levels indicates an improvement in the condition. We will also measure secondary outcomes such as muscle strength and joint movement, but we can leave this for now. \n\nStudy Design\n=================\nI would suggest a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a controlled and experimental treatment group. For the active comparator control group, the standard treatment protocol will be used in both groups, with a control group that does not receive additional intervention. \n\n\nParticipant Selection\n=================\nParticipants aged 35-65 with shoulder impingement will be included in the study. Participants should be free of any other diseases or conditions that may affect the study results. We will also need to get informed consent from the participants. The sample size will be calculated using a previous study on the hypervolt device. \n\nParticipant Consent\n=================\nInformed consent will be obtained from each participant verbally and in writing before the start of the study. A consent form will be prepared detailing the study procedures, potential benefits, and potential risks. \n\n\nStudy Duration\n=================\nParticipants will be evaluated at the start of the study, and then monitored at 1 and 2 months. During these visits, the primary outcome measure will be evaluated. \n\nStatistical Analysis\n=================\nThe mean and standard deviation of the pain score will be calculated for both the control and experimental groups. The Chi-square test will be used to determine whether the groups are similar in age, BMI, gender, and other factors. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to evaluate the difference in pain scores between the two groups. The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to evaluate the difference in secondary outcome measures between the two groups, such as muscle strength and joint movement. The p value will be set at 0.05 to determine statistical significance. Presentation"

Previous studies have explored the use of various interventions to reduce the pain associated with subcutaneous blood tests, such as topical anesthetics. While these interventions can be effective, they can also be time-consuming and require additional medication. One potential intervention that has been shown to reduce pain and stress is the use of a stress ball during a subcutaneous blood test. Stress balls are commonly used relaxation techniques that involve squeezing a small, squishy ball to reduce stress and anxiety. \nAim\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of a stress ball in reducing pain and anxiety during a subcutaneous blood test.\nMethodology\nStudy participants will be invited to participate in the study during their appointment for a subcutaneous blood test.

A recent single\u2010arm phase II clinical trial of adaptive radiotherapy with ETHOS, a modality using integrated PET/CT and IMRT during RT, showed clinical feasibility and tolerability in breast cancer. The aims of the present study were to validate whether the outcomes of this adaptive radiotherapy using ETHOS are comparable to those of conventional intensity\u2010modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods: We recruited hypersensitive patients with localized inoperable breast cancer with a high locoregional risk that required RT. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either adaptive radiotherapy with ETHOS or conventional IMRT. As a primary endpoint, the locoregional recurrence\u2010free rates were compared between the two groups using the log\u2010rank test. Secondary endpoints included rates of acute toxicity and cosmetic outcome. Results: Between October 2020 and October 2022, 55 patients were enrolled and randomized. The first breast cancer patient was initially enrolled in this trial. 14 patients (25.5%) from the adaptive radiotherapy group and 16 patients (29.1%) from the conventional IMRT group were eligible for the protocol analysis. The median follow\u2010up was 11 months for the treatment arms. A non\u2010significant 5\u2010year locoregional recurrence rate was observed for the adaptive radiotherapy arm (2.47%) than the conventional IMRT arm (10.33%). Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the 5\u2010year freedom from severe cosmetic outcomes was higher in the adaptive radiotherapy arm"

Could you please provide me with the aims and objectives of the trial? \n\nStudy type\n=================\nInterventional\n\nCondition\n=================\nRenal and Ureteral Calculi\n\nIntervention\n=================\nIn this project, the therapeutic procedure of TULP for stone removal will be simulated. Each patient\u2019s real patient-specific data (e.g., stone location, length, number, surface texture and other factors) will be uploaded into the TULP simulator. The simulator can render the exact 3D information from the radiological data. Based on this, the treatment pathway, including robot trajectory and working positions, for all stones will be automatically generated. Furthermore, the simulator can record the pathway trajectory in terms of robot trajectory, force trajectory, power and torque of the robot\u2019s degrees of freedom, and the amount of force required to crush the stone. This project will study 12 patients with a total of 12 stones. For each stone, we will study 20 simulations with the TULP simulator.\n\nIntervention type\n=================\nDevices\n\nPrimary outcome measure\n=================\nUrethra injury/complications: The primary outcome is the injury/complications to the urethra caused by surgery, which will be evaluated based on the patient\u2019s operative reports at the end of the surgery.\n\nSecondary outcome measures\n=================\nOperation time/success rate:The operation time of surgeons and nurses will be recorded and compared between the two groups. The success rates of the two procedures will be measured.\n\nParticipant inclusion criteria\n=================\n1. All patients with ureteral stones confirmed with CT urography can be included regardless of their gender and age;\n2. Patients with ureteral stones that cannot be removed by ureteroscopy, such as huge or staghorn stones, will be considered for the study;\n3.

Moreover, cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients.\nCirrhotic patients have cardiac myopathy related to end diastolic dysfunction. However, the pathogenesis of cardiac myopathy in chronic liver disease is still unclear. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could contribute to endothelial dysfunction by inducing vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation leading to end diastolic hypertension and cardiac myopathy in cirrhotic patients.\nEfficacy and safety of a selective angiotensin receptor type I (AT1) blocker on cardiac parameters have not been fully illustrated in clinical trials.\nTherefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of a selective angiotensin receptor type I (AT1) blocker, DWJ1464, on echocardiographic findings such as pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), and clinical outcomes of chronic liver disease patients.\n\nStudy Population\n=================\nParticipant groups\nThe subjects will be patients with chronic liver disease except for patients with portal hypertension.\nThe chronic liver disease diagnoses include hepatitis B virus infection (HBV), hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic or biliary liver disease, autoimmune liver disease",

The prevalence of smoking among asylum seekers is at around 40% (Cornelius et al., 2014), and this group in particular has a high rate of smoking-related morbidity and mortality (Ajma et al., 2011; Ridgely et al., 2002; Stanton et al., 2009). Although smoking prevalence and smoking-related inequalities are also addressed in the Netherlands, studies have pointed to the persistent problem of smoking (Hoeksma et al., 2013; Van den Bergh et al., 2002; Van Kessel et al., 2007). The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of a cessation intervention in terms of the reduction of smoking for asylum seekers in the Netherlands.

            "OK, let\u2019s continue. What's the hypothesis or research question you're trying to address in this study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy versus a standard vehicle on preventing sunburn and skin aging induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In addition, it will also assess the participant's and physician's perception of UV damage. Finally, the biochemical profile and histology will be used to assess the extent of UV induced damage.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe skin is the largest and most exposed organ in the body and is considered the most fragile. It is a dynamic biological system with the capacity to maintain its function while undergoing constant repair and protection against environmental insults. This is all the more surprising when one takes into consideration that the skin undergoes frequent abuse. Ultraviolet (UV) exposure is the most common source of non-inflammatory abnormalities in the skin. Repeated exposure to sunlight throughout life accelerates skin aging by inducing wrinkles, sagging and loss of elasticity. Acute damage due to UV exposure can also be observed in the form of sunburn. Since 2025, an increase in skin cancers should be observed. Melanoma, the most lethal type of skin cancer, could rise by 52%, while cutaneous basal cell carcinoma by 56% and squamous cell carcinoma by 63%, with an estimated 1.1 million new cases in that year. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from sunlight is known to be a carcinogen (cancer causing agent) in humans. Sun exposure is the leading cause of skin aging. UVB is known as being the main cause of sunburn. It is also the main cause of skin cancer. UVA penetrates very deeply into the skin but is less potent in causing skin cancer than UVB. Chronic sun exposure causes long-term and cumulative effects - wrinkling, loss of elasticity, mottled pigmentation, and actinic dermatoses. The photoprotective potential of a sunscreen product is usually evaluated by measuring erythema (skin redness induced by sunburn) which is an immediate photoeffect, since a change in blood flow causes the skin to redden almost immediately",

Conservative treatments or surgery can be a solution to improve the symptoms and life quality. Balloon kyphoplasty is a common surgical procedure to treat the OVCFs and has been widely used in many countries in the world. But the long-term effect on osteoporosis in balloon kyphoplasty is not enough. The porous titanium cage has been used to treat the osteoporosis in hip but has not been used for other sites. Researchers want to know whether the cage implants in kyphoplasty can improve the osteoporosis in spine. The investigators will recruit OVCF subjects in balloon kyphoplasty and follow them up for 5 years. The participants will be recruited from Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Friendship Hospital and followed in our hospital for 5 years and every 6 month the bone mineral density(BMD) of the participants will be tested according to DEXA scan.

The use of both groups enables the investigators to compare the effects of porous trabecular titanium microspheres with those of calcium phosphate cement, and to see how each type of treatment affects the healing process and clinical outcomes of vertebral compression fractures.",

This group can serve as a control group, which will allow us to compare the results of the Sphereplast group with the control group. Does this sound like a good idea to you? \n\nAbstract:\nFive hundred and forty four women were randomised to receive a single 60 mg oral dose of finasteride, 40 mg desipramine, both finasteride and desipramine, or placebo one hour before urodynamic evaluation. Finasteride significantly increased outlet resistance and detrusor pressure. Combination therapy increased the number of incontinent patients in the 2 hour urodynamic follow\u2010up period, and those taking combination therapy passed more urine while having leakage with a similar rise in detrusor pressure. Desipramine, however, alone increased the number of patients who passed urine with concomitant urinary leakage while finasteride decreased this number. Combination therapy was more effective than desipramine alone in delaying urination and increasing maximal flow rate. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that finasteride is effective for the treatment of neurological bladder dysfunction. Desipramine alone in this population may increase the number of incontinent patients and should be avoided. Detection of the underlying cause of voiding disturbance is particularly important in the management of this condition.",

            "Dear Sir,\nThank you for your suggestion. It is correct that an additional analysis of outcomes after tracheal cannulation among patients from the European network would be interesting and valuable. \nCan you let me know if this is a suggestion for a separate study or if you would like to include this additional analysis in the original study proposal? In any case, I would be happy to help you with the necessary information to conduct such an analysis. \nBest regards,",
            "Thank you for asking! Our trial will have five study arms, each representing a unique tracheal cannula removal method:\n\n1. Unilateral decannulation: The cannula will be removed unilaterally (one side only) by our medical team\n2. Bilateral decannulation: The cannula will be removed bilaterally (both sides) by our medical team\n3. Self-canulation removal: Participants will be taught self-removal of the cannula, and the cannula will be removed under supervision by our medical team. This method is also known as self-canulation and tracheostomy discontinuity (SCTD)\n4. Planned spontaneous breathing trial (PSBT): Participants will be observed for three minutes (90-second window) while breathing spontaneously through the tracheostomy tube. If no difficulty is observed, the cannula will be removed\n5. Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT): Participants will be observed for thirty minutes (15-minute window) while breathing spontaneously through the tracheostomy tube. If no difficulty is observed, the cannula will be removed\n\nLet me know if we can provide any further details or clarifications.\n\n\nThank you for your input. We'll revise the inclusion criteria to include the following:\n\nParticipants should be on mechanical ventilation and have received an artificial airway (tracheotomy) at the time of enrollment. The duration of tracheotomy is not specified, as patients with spinal cord injury may have long or short durations of tracheotomy, depending on their individual needs.",
            "The participant group/arm for this arm would be tracheotomized adult in-patients with spinal cord injury. The intervention/treatment would also be the observation of tracheostomy management and the decannulation process. The reasoning behind this arm is to assess the efficacy of the decannulation interventions specifically tailored for patients with spinal cord injury, as they often require different care and management approaches from patients with other medical conditions. Additionally, this arm could provide insights into the challenges and unique aspects of decannulation in patients with spinal cord injury. \n\nOverall, both study arms aim to provide valuable data on the outcomes of tracheostomy decannulation in patients with different medical conditions, which can inform future decannulation practices and policies. The focus on spinal cord injury in one arm, in particular, highlights the importance of tailoring decannulation interventions to the specific needs of different patient populations.",
            "For arm 3, the participant group/arm would be patients who undergo tracheostomy in the Swiss Paraplegic Center during the intervention period and do not experience a decannulation. The intervention/treatment would involve observation and documentation of clinical outcomes. This arm allows a comparison of the outcomes of tracheostomy patients in the context of decannulation outcomes. \n\nIn conclusion, after this update, your study will include the following five arms:\n\nArms:\n1- Arm: Tracheostomized patient with any clinical condition\n2-  Patient decannulated at the Swiss Paraplegic Center Nottwil within the project's data collection period\n3- Patients tracheostomy in the Swiss Paraplegic Center during the study period who undergo no decannulation\n4- Patients who undergo tracheostomy in the Swiss Paraplegic Center and are decannulated in another clinic within the SIDC study period\n5- Patients who undergo tracheostomy in the Swiss Paraplegic Center and are decannulated, either in the SPC or another clinic \n\nDoes this seem accurate to you? Please let me know if you would like to make any changes or if there is any information missing. \n\n\n\nThis seems accurate! By considering patients with different medical conditions, studying those who undergo decannulation in the Swiss Paraplegic Centre, and those who undergo tracheostomy and do not require decannulation, or are managed in other centers, this study provides a holistic perspective on the management of tracheostomized patients and the outcomes of decannulation in a diverse group of patients.. This approach allows us to identify factors that may impact outcomes, such as patient characteristics, medical condition, or management approach.",
            "In the fourth study arm, the participant group/arm would be patients aged 18 and older who are treated for tracheostomy management and decannulation at the Swiss Paraplegic Center Nottwil within the project's data collection period. The intervention/treatment would involve patient assessment and documentation of tracheostomy management and decannulation outcomes. This arm ensures that patients with different age groups are included in the study, providing a range of perspectives and experiences.",
            "In the fifth and final study arm, the participant group/arm would be patients with any communication language other than German, French, Italian, or English. The intervention/treatment would be a language barrier, which would not allow for communication and data collection. This arm will enable the researchers to evaluate the impact of language barriers on the effectiveness of tracheostomy management and decannulation outcomes in a linguistically diverse patient population. \n\n### Study Design\n\nAllocation: N/A\n\n### Control Group\n\nUncontrolled\n\n### Phase\n\nNot Applicable\n\n### Study Design Allocation\n\nParallel\n\n### Intervention Control Nature\n\nOpen Label\n\n### Intervention Model Description\n\nThis is an observational study with multiple study arms, including patient populations with different communication languages and those who do not give consent to participate\n\n\n\n### Similar Study Designs\n\n=================\n\nKeywords Provided by Centre Hospitalier Valida\n-----------------\nTracheostomy management, Tracheostomy decannulation, Spinal cord injury, Swiss Paraplegic Centre Nottwil",

            "Thank you for your question. As mentioned in the intervention section, the intervention for this arm will be surgery. We recommend careful surgery and pathological examination for TD positive patients. \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of tumor deposits (TDs), a marker of intravascular tumor cell clusters (TCCs) on clinical outcomes in the neoadjuvant treatment (T) of operable HER2\u2010positive breast cancer (BC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 2013 to 2018, 191 individuals with untreated inflammatory (n = 84) or invasive infiltrating HER2\u2010positive BC underwent multimodality treatment following inclusion in one of nine clinical trials, including endocrine therapy and trastuzumab emtansine (T\u2010DM1) or lapatinib. The objective of these trials was to assess the efficacy of these treatments in the neoadjuvant setting. After pathological analysis, patients were retrospectively classified into tumor thrombi positive and negative groups, according to the presence or absence of tumor cells in blood vessels (n =\u00a023 and n = 168, respectively). The primary outcome was the inverse relationship between TDs and pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy; the secondary outcome was survival. RESULTS: Median follow\u2010up was 45.0 months. TCC status was determined in 191 lesions. Cohort characteristics at baseline are presented in Table\u00a01. After multivariate analysis that included tumor size, Ki67, lymph node status, and treatment, only the presence of TCCs was found to be an independent predictor of pCR rate. The presence of TCCs was associated with worse invasive disease\u2010free survival (p = 0.024). Median invasive disease\u2010free survival was 58.3 months for patients without TCCs and 28.4 months for patients with TCCs (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.3; P =.026). CONCLUSION: TCCs are negative prognostic factors for",
            "The participant group/arm for the non-TD cohort will be the \"non-TD cohort\". This arm will consist of patients who were determined to be TD negative by the pathologists. These are patients with tumor deposits in the peritumoral adipose tissue without any architectural residue of lymph node, but without a clear border separating tumor from normal tissue. The intervention/treatment for this arm will also be surgery. If the patients are TD positive, we recommend careful surgery and pathological examination. \n\nAbstract:\nRATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Tumor deposits (TD) are tiny nodules of metastatic mammary cancer embedded in normal mammary tissue that cannot be visualized on imaging or histologically due to the lack of desmoplastic reaction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the presence of TD in breast cancer surgery specimens and histopathologic features.METHODS: From March 2014 to August 2020, 113 patients with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy with axillary dissection were included in the retrospective study. The pathological specimen was examined for the presence of TD by H&E staining. The presence or absence of TD was compared with clinicopathologic and histopathologic factors.RESULTS: TD were detected in 51 (45.1%) of the 113 samples examined. The ratio of TD in invasive lobular carcinoma was significantly higher than that in tubular, mucinous, and medullary cancer (P = 0.027), and the mean size of TD in invasive lobular carcinoma was significantly smaller than that in tubular cancer (P = 0.012). The presence of TD was positively correlated with high nuclear grade, lymphatic invasion, axillary lymph node metastasis, and estrogen receptor positivity.CONCLUSIONS: The presence of TD affects the histopathologic features of breast cancer, indicating the importance of considering TD when analyzing microscopic sections of breast cancer specimens.\n\nIntroduction\nBreast carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor among women worldwide .

Many educational initiatives and programs have been implemented, including through community-based and school-based interventions, targeting this age group. However, we know that these benefits can be short-lived or do not generalize to pain experienced in daily life.PURPOSE:The current study aims to improve upon previous pain management interventions by incorporating an innovative delivery mechanism.

Can you go through the rational behind using this dose and frequency? \nStudies have shown that colchicine in conjunction with corticosteroids has a beneficial effect in reducing the incidence of pericarditis relapses. The starting dose is 0.5 mg tid. The dose should be escalated based on toxicities, and the maintenance dose is 0.5 to one mg daily. The dose should be adjusted to minimize the gastrointestinal side effects. This arm is the standard of care in patients with colchicine-resistant glucocorticoid-dependent idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. It will be used as a comparator arm to determine the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine in reducing the risk of recurrence. \nThat's reasonable.

What are the specific interventions or treatments in this trial? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nGastric intestinal metaplasia (IM), also known as precancerous gastric lesions, is a premalignant lesion of the digestive tract mucosa. Gastric cancer is often considered to be a malignant tumor that develops on the basis of gastric intestinal metaplasia. It is generally believed that the main pathogenesis of gastric cancer is chronic inflammation, which results in an imbalance of intestinal flora in the stomach and damages the gastric mucosa. Studies found that there is a close relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and chronic gastritis, and the occurrence and development of gastric cancer may be related to the colonization of Helicobacter pylori. This study aimed to observe the changes of intestinal flora in patients with precancerous intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori positive, to explore the relationship between different types of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric intestinal metaplasia.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nGastric mucosal flora has a significant effect on metaplasia induced by chronic atrophic gastritis. Infection or colonization of intestinal bacteria in the human stomach plays an important role in the carcinogenesis process of gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to detect and analyze the distribution of gastric helicobacter pylori strains in patients with stomach cancer. To detect and analyze the diversity of gastric flora in patients with gastric cancer. To explore the relationship between disease progression and changes in diversity of gastric flora. At present, there are no special provisions for the diagnosis, clinical treatment and pathogenic classification of Helicobacter pylori in China, and the diagnosis is often based on the diagnostic criteria issued by WHO and Maastricht IV consensus. For the purpose of diagnosis, this study uses Giemsa staining combined with biopsy, rapid urease test, DNA microarray technology, and 16s rDNA ribosomal",

The pharmacokinetics of repotrectinib will be compared between these patients and patients with hepatic impairment, allowing us to assess the impact of hepatic impairment on the drug's pharmacokinetics. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Repotrectinib is an oral multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) initially developed for the treatment of oncogene\u2010addicted non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previous studies have demonstrated that co\u2010amendment of repotrectinib with food produces significant elevation in its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) compared with fasted conditions. Based on those results, the current pharmacology, safety, and efficacy of this agent will be evaluated in this phase 1 trial (UMIN000025650) conducted under fasting conditions. Methods: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors were to be considered eligible for this trial. The primary objective was to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) following oral administration of repotrectinib (TPX\u20100005) on day 1 of each 28\u2010day cycle. The 0.56\u2010mg and 1\u2010mg cohort groups did not demonstrate any dose\u2010limiting toxicities (TLTs). The highest dose was assigned as the RP2D (2\u2010mg treatment group). The second aim was to evaluate the safety of repotrectinib administered on days 1\u201028 of each cycle. The third aim was to examine its pharmacokinetics (PKs). Conclusions: We developed a novel drug dosing method that provided safety in patients with solid tumors. We will continue to evaluate the safety and PKs of this drug and establish it as a well\u2010tolerated treatment option for the clinic.",

In addition, a mobile phone-based communication system is being used to motivate and support patients to be more physically active. Also, the use of the monitoring and follow-up functionality of the patient application is evaluated. At baseline, postal invitation and postal registration for participation in the physical activity intervention study and at three months post-registration follow-up. Baseline, three months after baseline survey and after eight months from baseline (after end of intervention phase)\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nWithin the framework of a nationwide quality improvement initiative in Rheumatic Diseases, a physical activity intervention has been developed and implemented by the Swedish Rheumatology Association (Sverok) and Region J\u00e4mtland H\u00e4rjedalen. The intervention includes a six month physical activity intervention consisting of motivational strategies aimed at increasing physical activity levels in patients with rheumatic diseases. A web-based patient registration system is used to monitor and follow up patients. The use of the monitoring and follow-ups functionality is evaluated. The study is a multicenter, randomized, parallel-arm, controlled non-inferiority design, comparing use of the monitoring and follow-up functionality with and without written instructions to patients on how to use the functionality. Patients are either randomized to receive written verbal instructions to use the monitoring and follow-up functionality of the web-based patient registration system or to receive no written verbal instructions regarding the use of the functionality. The hypothesis is that patients will improve their lifestyle and increase their levels of physical activity due to the intervention. The primary outcomes are patients self-reported change in overall physical activity in absolute kJ / day, proportion of patients achieving the guidelines for",

The aim of the study is for the researchers to compare the cardiac function changes as assessed by echocardiology and CT. Results It is anticipated that the changes in cardiac function will follow similar trend as the cardiac function with other heart failure drugs. Discussion It is well known that some heart failure drugs have a positive effect on cardiac function parameters, such as reduction of left ventricular chamber dimension, reduction of left atrial chamber dimension, and increase of global longitudinal strain.

            "Well, what is the condition you are trying to treat? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the initial number of lesions in women with breast cancer and the efficacy of radiotherapy on local control. Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated with radiotherapy on the breast after conservative surgery for breast cancer. Eligible patients included patients with histologically proven breast cancer who were treated with conservative surgery and received adjuvant radiotherapy in the 15\u201024 years after surgery. The initial number of lesions was analysed by counting the number of lesions on the operative specimen using the pathological report. Local control was defined as the time from the completion of radiotherapy to the time of local recurrence through recurrence on diagnostic imaging or pathological examination. Treatment response to radiotherapy according to the number of lesions was analysed retrospectively. The follow\u2010up period was 24\u201074 months, and the median duration was 46 months (range, 24\u201074 months). Results: The treatment response to radiotherapy was analysed in 39 patients (range in number of lesions 1\u20104). In patients with 1\u20102 lesions, in\u2010breast tumour reoccurrence occurred in 10% of patients with a median recurrence time of 19 months (range 10\u201030 months.); in those with 3\u20104 lesions, recurrences were observed in 86.7% of patients with a median recurrence time of 14 months (range 8\u201022 months). No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups [Chi\u2010square test P = .528] (Table 1). Conclusions: The results of this retrospective study suggest that women with three or more tumorous lesions in the breast treated with radiotherapy following conservative surgery have a greater chance of local in\u2010breast\n\nIntroduction\nLocal recurrence and distant metastasis are the most common treatments for early-stage breast cancer.

We also aimed to assess how imaging and clinical indicators can predict the occurrence of postoperative complications. We evaluated 102 patients undergoing myomectomy due to uterine myomas. Preoperative MRI, ultrasound (US), and intraoperative classification based on palpation findings (MRI/US\u2010p, US\u2010p alone, and preoperative/intraoperative palpation) were compared to predict the occurrence of conversion surgery and postoperative complications. Patients who underwent conversion surgery, i.e. laparoscopic surgery that could not continue, were evaluated based on preoperative MRI, preoperative/intraoperative palpation findings, and US. Postoperative complications were evaluated according to the Clavien\u2010Dindo classification. Of the 102 patients, eighty (78.4%) had conversion to laparotomy surgery. The patients who underwent conversion surgery had higher uterine volume and fibroid diameter on US, and higher total myoma volume, fibroid number, and size, and total uterine myoma volume on MRI than those who did not. On intraoperative palpation, the proportion of cases with a hard uterus, multiple fibroids, and large fibroids were higher among patients undergoing laparotomic surgery. In terms of postoperative complications, the incidence of Grade B (2.9%) and C (0.9%) complications was higher among patients who underwent open surgery. According to the multivariate analysis of risk factors, fibroid diameter on US, total uterine myoma volume on MRI, and uterine volume on US were identified as independent risk factors for conversion surgery, and a larger uterus and hard uterus were associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications. This study showed that US and MRI were more accurate than palpation in detecting myomas associated",

Can you describe the study's hypothesis and objectives? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Aspirin (ASA) has been used for the treatment of migraine for over a half century with limited evidence to support its use. Objectives: To determine the efficacy of ASA in the treatment of episodic migraine. Methods: A single\u2010center randomized double\u2010blind crossover clinical trial was used to compare two Aspirin formulations and placebo to evaluate efficacy, tolerability and patient preference. Thirty patients with migraine with aura were evaluated. Each participant used active pharmaceutical ingredients of two different ASA formulations and placebo for ten days as randomly assigned. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are in accordance with the International Headache Society (IHS) recommendation for migraine headache. Two weeks of washout period was recommended between the treatments. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and relief at 2 hours, nausea at 1, 2 and 4 hours and headache impact. Adverse events were also assessed. Participants recorded headache daily in a diary and completed questionnaires of migraine, pain, nausea and headache impact. Results: A significant reduction of pain in migraine attacks, greater headache impact and greater relief was observed with oral Aspirin formulations compared to placebo. The use of ASA in migraine attacks reduces pain, however, the use of a more effective ASA formulation can further improve therapeutic results. 13\u2010Jan\u20102016 6:25\u2010PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe first description of Aspirin as treatment for headache was published by Krafft\u2010Ebing in 1876 (Krafft\u2010Ebing, 1876).

One group (n=100/group) will use 0.1% HPMC PF study drops 4x day as needed, while the other group (n=100) will use 0.2% hyaluronic acid/ 0.1% HPMC PF eye drops 4x day as needed. Primary endpoints are changes in Likert\u2010scale pain scores (compared to Baseline) at 14 (day 0), 30, and 60 days of use and total days of use. Secondary endpoints are changes in symptom severity, conjunctival staining, and signs of ocular surface injury. The study will be carried out at multiple academic and private US practices.RESULTS: As of 08/31/2022, recruitment is expected to be complete within 3\u20106 months.DISCUSSION: The objective of this study is to verify the effectiveness of HPMC PF eye drops to help resolve CLRD in a multicenter, cohort\u2010controlled study design, assessing its effectiveness and durability as a viable option in the marketplace.CONCLUSION: This study will build upon the positive results of a prior successful pilot study. As such, Drops & Drops have the potential to be proven as an effective new treatment option for contact lens wearers with CLRD, addressing a critical and under\u2010served need in the contact lens market.",

Urine was taken at the time of admission for routine care and screened with immunological assays, which were then confirmed, when positive, by GC\u2010MS. The specimens were subsequently rerun with GC\u2010MS using the method of confirmation of positive results, either with deuterated internal standards or by the GC\u2010MS full\u2010scan method.RESULTS: The urine was positive by immunoassay for drugs of abuse in 21 of the 182 patients. The GC\u2010MS full\u2010scan method confirmed a positive result for 17 of these 21 patients, while the positive result for one patient was not confirmed either by GC\u2010MS with deuterated internal standards or using the GC\u2010MS full\u2010scan screening method. All eight positive results using GC\u2010MS with deuterated internal standards were confirmed.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the GC\u2010MS full\u2010scan method is less robust than GC\u2010MS with deuterated internal standards for the quantification of drugs of abuse in hospitalized patients.",

A total of 137 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (mean age 64 \u00b1 8 years; 93% male; mean duration of AF 5 years) were enrolled and randomised into 2 groups, 100 patients in each group. Group 1 received the standard treatment (DC cardioversion on the day), and 37 received the new treatment program (PVI and femoral sheaths 1 week before cardioversion). Patients were followed up for 1 year for AF recurrence and procedure\u2010related complications (primary endpoint) and mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE; secondary endpoints). The primary outcome was attained in 23 of the 100 patients (23%) in group 1 and 41 of the 37 patients (73%) in group 2, P =.03, and 1\u2010year AF recurrence\u2010free survival was 45% versus 79%, P <.001. There were fewer procedure\u2010related complications in the femoral sheath group, but no difference in mortality or MACE between groups. The femoral sheath group showed statistically less occurrence of persistent AF throughout the follow\u2010up, P <.01.

The stable isotopes used in the intervention will include 13C5-phenylalanine. \nDetermination of albumin catabolic rate in humans using 2H5-phenylalanine and 13C5-phenylalanine as tracers\n\nAbstract:\n1. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma, and, while some data indicate that synthesis (albB) and catabolism (albC) may not be balanced at normal fasting rates, there are few human data on net albumin synthesis rate (ASR). 2. Urinary excretion of 13CO2 provides a noninvasive method of measuring ASR. Previous studies of the clearance (C(r)) of 13CO2 from plasma by albumin have used phenylalanine as a precursor. Because 13CO2 is a minor component of phenylalanine, phenylalanine\u2010driven ASR cannot be measured precisely and the validity of the clearance rate of 13CO2 (C(r)) as a measure of ASR may be questioned. 3. We have compared the urinary excretion of 12C02 and 13C02 when 10 adult subjects were given a bolus of 13C5\u2010phenylalanine. 4. We measured both the enrichment of urinary 13C02 and 12C02 and calculated their clearance rates (C(r) (urinary)). 5. The average \u00b1 SEM C(r) (urinary) for 13C5\u2010phenylalanine was 16.4 \u00b1 5.4%/h (mean \u00b1 SD 17.16%/h, range 8.57\u201024.53%/h) and for 12C02 was 15.2 \u00b1 3.6%/h (mean \u00b1 SD 15.29%/h, range 10.01\u201018.08%/h). 6.

Secondary objectives were to determine whether high\u2010dose VDT affects serum calcium levels. Methods: We performed a single\u2010center, randomized controlled clinical trial of older adults who were vitamin D insufficient or deficient and received 10,000 IU/d to 80,000 IU/d of cholecalciferol. Participants older than 65 years were recruited from the university hospital. Results: Two hundred and eighteen subjects with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (25(OH)D: 7.0 \u00f7 21.1 ng/mL) were enrolled. 108 subjects were assigned supplementing doses as low as 10,000 IU/d and 100 subjects were assigned doses as high as 80,000 IU/d.

This design would involve two interventions that work in concert to reduce snoring. The comparison would evaluate the effect of each intervention alone and in combination. In this arm, the nasal cones would be used in addition to the myofunctional therapy exercises to reduce the width of the nasal passages and restrict airflow, leading to a reduction in snoring. The participants in this arm would be required to place the nasal cones inside their nostrils to decrease the width of the nasal passage, in addition to the same myofunctional therapy exercises as the experimental arm. The use of nasal cones would be monitored by the researcher and adjustments would be made, if necessary, to achieve an ideal airflow restriction.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of Ta or T 1 bladder cancer were enrolled in the study. On the second postoperative day after treatment for bladder cancer, the patients underwent a flexible cystoscopy and biopsy of the posterior wall mucosa. The tumor and biopsy specimens were graded according to the WHO criteria, and the biopsy specimens were then stained with an antibody against P\u2010glycoprotein. Gemcitabine was instilled into the bladder through a Foley catheter, and patients were randomized after they were given a single dose of gemcitabine: 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, or 15.0 mg. P\u2010glycoprotein expression was reevaluated after a 48\u2010h interval. All procedures were repeated the next day. The dose of gemcitabine necessary to suppress P\u2010glycoprotein expression was defined as the concentration of gemcitabine needed to suppress P\u2010glycoprotein expression in 10% or more of the population. RESULTS: In total, 40 patients were enrolled in this study. A high intraobservational variability in P\u2010glycoprotein expression was found in the posterior wall mucosa of both tumor\u2010free (73 +/\u2010 72%) and tumor\u2010bearing (63 +/\u2010 68%) areas. Gemcitabine suppressed P\u2010glycoprotein expression in the tumor\u2010free posterior wall of five patients (12.5%) and suppressed P\u2010glycoprotein expression in the tumor\u2010bearing posterior wall of six patients (15%; P = .392). A single dose of 12 mg of intravesical gemcitabine was sufficient to suppress P\u2010glycoprotein expression in 10%",

[1] The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 50 to 100 million cases of dengue fever worldwide annually, and this number is expected to increase due to the changing climate and globalization.[2] Dengue fever is caused by four closely related dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), and it can be classified as dengue fever with or without warning signs or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). [3] Dengue fever is characterized by a high fever (39\u00b0C or higher), headache, muscle and joint pain, and skin rash.[4] Patients with warning signs may develop severe complications, such as bleeding, shock, liver damage, and hemorrhagic fever. [3] Diagnostic testing for dengue fever includes detection of dengue viral RNA or antibodies, and it is important to differentiate dengue fever from other diseases with similar clinical manifestations, such as influenza, typhoid fever, and leptospirosis.[5] There is no specific treatment for dengue fever, and the management of this disease is mainly supportive. [6] The prognosis of dengue fever varies from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe complications and even death, depending on the severity of the case.[2] As such, there is a need for early diagnosis and treatment of dengue fever to prevent complications and reduce mortality rates.

The intervention focuses on teaching coping skills, healthy identity development, and collective action as ways to buffer against chronic stress. The intervention is grounded in a holistic, strengths-based approach that aims to provide children with the tools and resources they need to reduce their stress, improve their mental health, and foster personal growth and resilience.It is essential that we take several important precautions when implementing this study. First, it is crucial to ensure the safety and well-being of our study participants. Children in both groups\u2014Experimental: BaSICS Intervention group and No Intervention Control group\u2014should be provided with psychological support and mental health resources as needed. These resources may include in-person or telephone counseling, medication, referrals to other mental health providers, or other appropriate interventions, as determined by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist who is experienced in working with children. If a study participant refuses to participate in the study or drops out for any reason, it is important to maintain the relationship of trust and rapport that we have established with them. Even though they will not be able to participate in the study, they should still be offered psychological support and mental health resources as needed. Additionally, the well-being of our study participants should be our primary concern. If we suspect that a participant is at risk of harming themselves or others, or if they express suicidal ideation, we should involve a crisis hotline or other appropriate resources to ensure their safety. It is important for us to maintain the integrity of our study design and data collection process.

The patient must not have had a prior sigmoid resection performed during the preceding episode of diverticulitis, or within 30 days before the onset of symptoms of the current episode. In the case of the chronic recurrent diverticulitis cohort, patients will be eligible if all of the following criteria are satisfied: - the patient is 18 years or older - the patient has recurrent uncomplicated (perforation and fistula are not included) left-sided diverticulitis within 30 days, with more than one episode within the previous 90 days, or more than three episodes within the previous 180 days.

Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial and the subjects were selected from patients with acute liver failure (ALF). We chose 160 patients with an expected survival of more than 72 hours who applied to the ICU and were selected as the research subjects. The subjects were divided into group P and group A based on the modified method of intravenous feeding (the rate of infusion is increased by 10% every 24 hours) combined with the control group treated with the traditional intravenous feeding method. The amount of feeding that the two groups can tolerate and the nutritional status, organ function, coagulation function, and inflammatory response were compared between the two groups to evaluate the impact of modified enteral nutrition on clinical outcome in patients with acute liver failure. Results: There was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, the severity of disease, and Child\u2010Pugh score between the two groups (P>0.05). There was no difference in the percentage of patients who could tolerate feeding and who had to stop feeding (both P>0.05), but the amount of nutrition the two groups can tolerate was higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). After application, the serum ALT and AST indexes and the total bilirubin level in group A were lower than those in group P, and ALF patients in the two groups could obtain complete remission of jaundice faster than the in the control group (P<0.05). After application, the inflammatory response indexes of the two groups were reduced (P<0.05), and the coagulation function index was improved (P<0.05).

The investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing early left hemicoectomy will have lower complication rates when compared to elective left hemicolectomy. This hypothesis would be validated through the study's primary outcome which is a composite outcome of 30-day mortality, reoperation or readmission following surgery.

Now let's move on to the intervention you'll be comparing. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: To the best of our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the effectiveness of two different doses of intra\u2010articular sodium hyaluronate (20 mg versus 30 mg) in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.PURPOSE: To determine whether clinically important efficacy in daily pain and function in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee is achieved with 20\u2010mg or 30\u2010mg intra\u2010articular injections of sodium hyaluronate, and to compare the difference (if any) between the two groups of treatment.STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, double\u2010blind, prospective, RCT.METHODS: A total of 152 patients (76 per group) diagnosed with symptomatic OA of the knee were included. We used two doses of hyaluronate (20\u2010mg and 30\u2010mg doses, administered as intra\u2010articular injections once a week for three consecutive weeks) in a double\u2010blinded design. All patients were randomized to both groups in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome variable was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale at six weeks post injection; the difference between the baseline pain score and the pain score at six weeks post injection was analyzed. An intent\u2010to\u2010treat analysis was performed for the primary outcome. Analyses were based on the WOMAC pain score being the primary outcome. The secondary outcome variable was WOMAC physical function.RESULTS: The mean baseline pain scores at six weeks post injection between the two study groups did not exhibit significant difference, while the improvement in pain scores at six weeks post injection (primary outcome variable) in the low\u2010dose (20\u2010mg) group was found to be more clinically relevant than that in the high\u2010dose (30\u2010mg) group. The difference in the mean score of pain at six weeks post\u2010injection between the two groups was 0.36; the 95",

What would you like the participant group/arm and intervention/treatment to be for this arm? \n\nAbstract:\n<i>Situation</i>\u2003: Preoperative immune nutritional support has been recommended in cancer surgery to prevent postoperative complications as cancer and stress are closely related to immunosuppression. A recent study has found that preoperative oral supplementation with an immune\u2010enhanced oral nutrition could improve postoperative outcomes such as the length of hospital stay, readmission rate and the number of days of antibiotic treatment when compared with the conventional preoperative nutritional support. However, the study had several limitations including small sample size, lack of randomization, and retrospective study design. This study aims to investigate the effects of preoperative oral supplementation with an immune\u2010enhanced oral nutrition on postoperative outcomes compared to the conventional preoperative oral nutrition. <b>Methods and analysis:</b> We will carry out a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Two hundred and two patients who are scheduled for major head and neck cancer surgery will be randomized to intervention (preoperative oral supplementation for 7 days with an immune\u2010enhanced oral nutrition) or control group (conventional preoperative oral supplementation for 7 days). The primary outcome is the duration of hospitalization. The secondary outcomes include readmission rate, antimicrobial consumption, 30\u2010day mortality and complication rate, including cardiac and respiratory complications. <b>Ethics and dissemination:</b> This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative immune nutritional support in cancer surgery. Although the effect of an immunonutrient\u2010containing nutritional supplement has been reported in previous studies, there is a lack of randomized controlled studies conducted in China. This is a multicenter clinical trial that has been approved by the ethics committee of Huaian Second People's Hospital. The results of the study are expected to be published in peer\u2010reviewed journals. Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).",
            "For the control arm, the participant group/arm will consist of patients who will receive standard nutritional supplementation. The intervention/treatment for this arm will be drug: Standard nutrition.",
            "Now, let's discuss the number of participants for each arm. The study will require a total of 94 participants, with 47 in each arm.  This is an excellent sample size as it will provide us with the necessary statistical power to confirm our primary and secondary endpoints. \n\nAbstract:\nSorafenib is the standard of care in first\u2010line treatment for thyroid cancer in patients with clinically significant radioiodine refractory. In a randomized clinical trial on 135 patients, we compared the efficacy and safety of sorafenib with doxorubicin regimens. The disease control rate and disease\u2010related quality of life of patients using doxorubicin were excellent. The response rate of doxorubicin was 10% higher than that of sorafenib. Median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) in patients using doxorubicin was 6 months longer compared to that of patients receiving sorafenib (9 months vs. 3 months). Similarly, median overall survival (OS) of patients using doxorubicin was also longer than that of patients receiving sorafenib. Adverse events were rare and treatment compliance with doxorubicin regimen was good in patients with thyroid cancer."

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCurrently, there is wide disparity in the clinical and prognostic outcomes of patients with malignant glial tumors, with some patients showing an aggressive course of disease while others may have a more favorable prognosis. We aim to enroll adults with recently diagnosed World Health Organization Grade II or Grade III diffuse astrocytic glioma and wild-type IDH1/IDH2 tumors who are undergoing surgery at MD Anderson to participate in this clinical trial. Participants who agree to contribute their tumor sample will undergo sequencing to identify potential molecular biomarkers that may be useful for prognosticating patient outcomes. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to improve patient outcomes by identifying a predictive biomarker of survival.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSpecific Aim 1: To prospectively identify potential molecular biomarkers for 2-year overall survival in patients with malignant astrocytic gliomas by sequencing tumor samples obtained at surgery. This cohort will be selected based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification (Gilberts et al., 2016), molecular biology (e.g. wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase [IDH]1/2 and absence of 1p19q codeletion), and the absence of any 1p/19q codeletion-defined oligodendroglial tumors or IDH-mutant tumors since these have been previously evaluated for prognosis. Approximately 180 patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas will be identified undergoing initial resection. Genomic DNA will be isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens collected at the time of surgery, and this material will be used for exome, RNA-seq and methylation analysis. In a case-control fashion, the discovery cohort will be compared to historical cohorts of subjects with known outcomes using gene expression and DNA methylation status as putative features of the model.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Prospective Study Identifying Molecular Biomarkers of 2-year Overall Survival in Pat",

Before we begin with the inclusion/exclusion criteria, could you please summarize the aim of your study in a few sentences? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and tolerability of CK312 in combination with a chemotherapy (Taxotere and Gemcitabine). This study is the first study to explore the clinical application of CK312 and is a two-stage phase II trial. It is a monocentric, open-lable, non-randomized, multi-coohort study. The first-stage cohort will be used for PK and safety observations, and for PK analysis of the CK312 single group, and to determine the recommended doses and regimen if necessary. In the stage II, one cohort per expansion cohort will be enrolled. Two patients will be enrolled for each cohort. The first-stage cohort will receive a dose of 5 \u03bcg/kg and 6 \u03bcg/kg respectively, the second-stage cohort will receive a dose of 7 \u03bcg/kg and 8 \u03bcg/kg respectively. The treatment will be carried out every 21 days for 6 cycles. During the same period, the investigator will take safety and PK test. In case of adverse reaction, researchers can adjust the dosage or terminate the intervention according to the actual situation. This study is expected to enroll 24 lung cancer patients, including 12 chemotherapy-controlled lung cancer patients in the combination arm (treatment group) and 12 chemotherapy-controlled lung cancer patients in the single arm (control group) for the first-stage cohort. The expansion population will be further evaluated according to the efficacy of the patients in the treatment group, and whether to expand the sample size will be finally decided by the DLT group and DMC based on the results of the evaluation.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study is a phase II clinical trial, which is an open-lable, exploratory study, a monocenter, multi-cohort, sequential group design evaluation.

The starting dose will be low, and higher doses will be tested to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose. Each participant in this arm will receive QL1706H orally for 21 days, followed by a 7-day rest period (cycle). This design allows for the evaluation of various doses and schedules to determine the optimal dosing regimen. \n\n- Experimental: QL1706H Part 2 (Dose Exploration):\n\n The goal of this arm is to further understand the pharmacokinetic properties of QL1706H. In this arm, participants will receive QL1706H orally daily for 28 days. The dose and dosing schedule will be determined based on the findings from the dose-escalation stage. The aim is to assess the plasma concentration of QL1706H, its effects on tissue distribution, and the elimination of the drug from the body. This stage provides valuable information for optimizing the dosing regimen and understanding the pharmacokinetics of QL1706H. The trial stage and study arm you've described provides important preliminary data for the subsequent Phase 1b/2 stage. The outcomes from Part 1 will guide the decision-making process for Phase 1b/2.

Eighteen female athletes (18\u00a0years of age \u00b1 2) with a body mass index of 20 to 23\u00a0kg/m2 participated voluntarily in the study. They were divided into an aerobic and a control group. Aerobic group activities included an aerobic exercise (8\u2010 to 15\u2010minute walking) for 6\u00a0weeks at 55% to 85% of their target heart rate. The control group activities included routine sport activities. The blood volume ratio of subjects was measured before and after the study. The data were evaluated by the Wilcoxon test. There was a significant increase in aerobic group blood volume (before and after) compared with baseline (p=0.004). There was no significant difference in blood volume ratios in the aerobic\u2010exercise group (before and after study) compared with the baseline and control group (after study and baseline). No statistically significant differences between the two groups were found. In conclusion, the results of our study showed that an increase in blood volume due to 8\u00a0weeks of aerobic exercise does not have any significant differences compared with a nonaerobic exercise.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlood volume (BV) is one of the components of body fluid and is important in maintaining adequate circulating blood volume, thus enabling organ perfusion in the body (1). It comprises about 8% of body weight in healthy individuals. The red blood cells (RBCs) carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body and carry it back by collecting carbon dioxide and metabolic waste products. Aerobic exercise is an exercise that uses oxygen for cell and tissue energy production for a prolonged period of time, allowing it to continue the same amount of effort (2).\n\nNonpregnant women who exercise more than or equal to4\u00a0days a week at moderate to vigorous intensity for a minimum of 30 minutes per session are more likely to have high levels of physical activity, which is a form of aerobic exercise (2). Aerobic exercise is defined as an exercise that maintains more than 60% of",

            "Sure! For the second study arm, with Tapered Pro Implants, we're looking to understand the microbial status in patients receiving this type of implant. By comparing the microbial status before and after implant placement, we can investigate if there are any specific microbial changes associated with Tapered Pro Implants. This information can be valuable in improving implant surgery treatments by understanding which microbes may potentially impact bone remodeling and healing. \n\nAbstract:\nMicrobiology \u2010 Microbial status of the oral cavity is an essential factor for maintaining dental implants in the long term. The success of dental implants is primarily determined by the quality of periodontal tissues around them. Aim \u2010 The aim of the study is to analyze whether there is a difference between the diversity and composition of the oral microbiome before implant placement between healthy patients, periodontally treated patients, and patients with a history of implant failure. The comparison will also be compared between implant\u2010retained prostheses installed in different parts of the maxilla. The impact of microbial diversity on the success rate of dental implants will be evaluated. Material and methods \u2010 The study involves 35 patients aged 18\u221280 years with a minimum follow\u2010up period of one year. Mucosal samples were collected during standard dental implant placement, and the diversity and composition of the microbiome were analyzed using next\u2010generation sequencing. Results \u2010 The comparison of microbiome diversity and composition between healthy patients, periodontally treated patients, and patients with a history of implant failure showed that the diversity and composition of microbial communities in the oral cavity differ significantly depending on the overall health of patients. Further, it was found that microbial diversity does not affect implant success rates. Conclusions \u2010 This study has shown that there is a difference in the microbial status of the oral cavity depending on the health status of patients and the location of dental implants. The study also revealed that factors other than microbial diversity play a greater role in the success rate of dental implants. The results of the study can be used to improve the standard of care for dental implants and to develop targeted treatments for different types of patients.",

The first part of the study is the dose finding phase (Phase 1A), which includes 3 parts (Parts A, B and C). Phase 1A Part A will open with up to approximately 6 participants in sequential cohorts receiving escalating fixed escalating dose of BMS administered as a 60 minute intravenous (IV) infusion before kidney transplantation followed by 4 or 5 subsequent doses. Part B is designed to include 6 or 7 participants in sequential dose cohorts to further investigate BMS activity in preventing ABMR. Part C is designed to include 6 or 7 participants in sequential dose cohorts and explores BMS activity when combined with a different tacrolimus dosing strategy. Part B and C will only proceed if the safety data from the first 3 participants in Part A show no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and if the preliminary evidence of BMS efficacy for the prevention of ABMR suggests that further participants are recommended. The second part of the study is the dose expansion phase (Phase 1B), which will be conducted in accordance with a safety and efficacy analysis of data from all participants in Phase 1A. Participants who enter Phase 1B will be randomized to receive either a fixed or an optimal dose of BMS administered intravenously after kidney transplantation.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Phase 1, Randomized, Controlled, Open-Label Dose-escalation and Dose-expansion Study of BMS-986185 in the Treatment of De Novo ABMR\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAllograft Rejection, Kidney Transplant, HLA-matched Kidney Transplant, High-risk",

            "The fourth study arm could include the Experimental: Adalimumab, a drug used for treating AS patients. The intervention for this arm is administering Adalimumab, a TNF inhibitor, to AS patients. By including Adalimumab, we can compare it with 608 and assess the effectiveness of different treatments for AS. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have an increased cardiovascular risk, including hypertension. The link between cardiovascular mortality and hypertension is well\u2010established in general populations. Previous work has shown associations between hypertension and AS severity, however, the association between baseline blood pressure and long\u2010term risk of developing AS still remains unclear. Here we investigate the association between blood pressure at baseline and the risk of developing AS in the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) cohort using a prospective nested case\u2013control design. Measurement: Baseline blood pressure (N\u00a0= 1,083,113 measurements in 319 participants) was measured by general practitioners (GPs) in the Netherlands using a calibrated sphygmomanometer during a routine annual checkup or during visits for the research programs. Likelihood ratios (LR) and positive (ppV) and negative predictive values (npV) were calculated for each blood pressure range with cut\u2010offs at 90th, 75th, and 60th percentiles (high, intermediate, and normal), respectively. Results: During a median follow\u2010up of 13.8 years, 319 patients developed AS. The prevalence of baseline hypertension was 22.2%. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) from a logistic regression analysis were consistently higher for each category of higher blood pressure: for blood pressure above 140/90\u2009mmHg (vs. normal), OR 1.65 (95%CI 1.09\u20102.52), p\u00a0= 0.021, for blood pressure above 130/80\u2009mmHg (vs. normal), OR 1.47 (95%CI 1.04\u20102.05), p\u00a0= 0.032, and",
            "For the final arm, we can have the Placebo Comparator: Negative control group. This arm will consist of patients who will receive a placebo subcutaneous injection. The intervention will be receiving a placebo. By including a placebo control group, we can assess the efficacy of 608 compared to a \"no treatment\" control. This control group will help us determine if the observed improvements in AS patients are a result of the active intervention (608) or if they are due to a placebo effect.",
            "Yes, that's correct. By including different doses of 608 and a positive control group, we can evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of 608 in patients with AS.

Together, these study arms will provide valuable information on the effectiveness and safety of 608 for treating patients with AS. \n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Purpose:: Treatment\nPhase:: Phase2\nIntervention Model:: Parallel\nBlinding/Masking:: Double\nBlinded Subject:: Subject,   Investigator\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: Drug\nIntervention Description:: 608, Adalimumab, Placebo\nNumber of Arms:: 5\nTarget Number of Participant:: 170\nArm Type:: Active comparator\nArm Description:: Subjects will receive adalimumab subcutaneously, every other week for 12 weeks, followed by every week for the next 20 weeks, and every other week for the next 24 weeks.\nArm Label:: active comparator, Adalimumab subcutaneous injection, every other week for 36 weeks\nArm Type:: Experimental\nArm Description:: 608 Dose A will receive SC injections with 5mg/kg in a body weight of 14.5 mg dose (approximately 750mg for 80 kg) for 12 weeks.\nArm Label:: 608 dose A subcutaneous injections for 12 weeks\nArm Type:: Experimental\nArm Description:: 608 Dose B will receive SC injections with 15 mg/kg body weights in a dose of 190 mg (approximately 1.5 gram for 80 kg) for 12 weeks.\nArm Label:: 608 dose B subcutaneous injections for 12 weeks\nArm Type:: Experimental\nArm Description:: 608 Dose C will receive SC injections with 30 mg / kg body weights in a dose of 380 mg (approximately 3 gram for 80 kg) for 12 weeks.\nArm Label:: 608 dose"

Materials and Methods: Adults with a body mass index \u226530 kg/m2 or \u226527 kg/m2 with at least 1 weight\u2010related comorbidity and no previous significant weight loss in the past 6 months, were randomized (1:1) for once\u2010daily subcutaneous dose of liraglutide or placebo for 56 weeks. Rescue treatment with a weight\u2010loss product was allowed after 24 weeks for treatment failure (failure to lose \u22654% weight or discontinuation because of lack of weight loss). Results: Among 3,731 randomized patients, 2,546 were treated with liraglutide and 2,518 with placebo. Greater proportions of patients lost \u22655% (34.0 vs 7.8%) and \u226510% (21.2 vs 1.4%) of baseline body weight with liraglutide compared with placebo (p<0.001). Mean change in body weight at the end of the study with liraglutide (4.37 kg) and placebo (0.86 kg) was higher with liraglutide (p<0.001). The least\u2010squares mean change in glycosylated hemoglobin with liraglutide (\u20100.08) was higher than that with placebo (\u20100.01; p<0.001). A greater proportion of patients on liraglutide (3",

Tears may cause significant disability or pain, the surgical repair of which has shown to have better outcomes compared to nonsurgical management. However, the rate of re-tear after rotator cuff repair has been shown to be up to 21% and this leads to recurrent disability or pain. Despite several studies addressing the causes of insufficient rotator cuff repair, the topic of anesthesia during rotator cuff repair has remained largely unexplored. Anesthesia that could maintain patients to be quiet and comfortable would be ideal, and general anesthesia is still considered the gold standard. However, despite general anesthesia being the most popular treatment for rotator cuff repair, our results showed that arthroscopic shoulder surgery under local anesthesia alone (LA) for smaller rotator cuff tears could have advantages in terms of better pain control and faster recovery. Nevertheless, the question of whether rotator cuff repair under loco regional anesthesia (LRA) only could be considered an alternative to general anesthesia remains unanswered.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Effect Of Loco Regional Anesthesia vs Loco Regional Anesthesia Combined With General Anesthesia On The Successful Rate of Rotator Cuff Repair\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nTear of Rotator Cuff, Tendon Rupture, Musculotendinous Disease, Tendon Insufficiency, Degenerative Diseases, Rotator Cuff Diseases, Shoulder Diseases\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: loco regional anesthesia\n\n\nParticipation"

At present, its incidence rate is increasing year by year. PTB has become one of the most common infectious diseases in the world. It is most difficult to prevent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and diagnose PTB, and the diagnosis of PTB in China is mainly based on the TB diagnosis and treatment management system in 2019, so this method is easy to be interfered by other factors, and has less guiding significance for anti-TB treatment. Therefore, it is quite important to explore the new methods and strategies for detection and treatment of PTB. Interferon gamma test is one of the strategies to prevent the tuberculosis epidemic. It is hoped that it can be widely used in practice to achieve good results. The objective of this study is to compare the effect of IGRA examination on early PTB prevention and anti-tuberculosis treatment of the target population in China's health care system. Interferon gamma release test results are compared with PTB diagnosis to find out the shortcomings of the examination and the impact of these shortcomings, so",

In addition to surgery, postoperative lung function decline is the major cause of decreased Quality of Life (QOL) and increased mortality following lung resection.

Therefore, a rapid and reliable test to evaluate lung compliance after general anesthesia may lead to a decrease in postoperative complication rates and hospital expenses.

A secondary objective was to assess the level of intervention satisfaction. Methods: A total of 298 breast cancer survivors were randomized into an intervention group or usual care control group arm. The intervention group received a customized exercise program. Assessments occurred at baseline and 8 and 16 weeks. Results: A mean decrease in fatigue levels was observed with both treatment groups by the 16\u2010week assessment (mean change of \u20105.1 for the intervention and \u20105.4 for the control groups) but was not significantly different between groups.

In a first phase of the study, using a within-subject design with cross-over, the effects of a single infusion of both ketamine and the infusion of a placebo (e.g. 1 infusion of ketamine or placebo and 1 infusion of ketamine followed by placebo on a separate day) will be compared. The second phase of the study will consist of a between-subjects design, with treatment with ketamine and placebo, for seven infusions, to assess the long term effects of ketamine. Patients who demonstrate a positive effect on the primary outcome of cognitive function, will continue to another study phase during which 12 open label infusions of ketamine will be monitored. The use of EEG during drug infusions and after infusion of ketamine will provide the researchers the opportunity to examine the effect of ketamine on connectivity in the brain of veterans with PTSD. Ketamine can be used in different ways. In this pilot study the researchers are using two different ways. In the first phase the researchers will use the drug in a single infusion. In the second phase the drug will be administered in seven infusions separated two weeks apart.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within and between-subjects study design with standard therapy as a comparator (i.e., a wait-list control condition) is used to investigate the potential efficacy of seven intravenous infusions of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine combined with a single infusion as compared to a placebo to improve the cognitive function and brain network connectivity in veterans suffering from PTSD.

            "That's good to hear. Could you elaborate on this single group assignment? \n\nBackground\n=================\nLung cancer screening (LCS) by means of computed tomography (CT) is recommended for high-risk patients (60 years and older with at least 30 pack years of smoking). CT screening reduces lung cancer mortality. However, the effect is largely achieved among early-stage and current smokers, with little to no effect seen when applied to the low-risk population in primary care (PC). The reason for this is that CT screening can only be applied when high-risk patients (30+ pack years) are identified. This is the case in the PC setting, however. In 2018, half of smokers in the Netherlands were classified as low risk according to the Dutch national lung screening guidelines. The implementation of LCS in primary care thus currently faces a significant implementation barrier. This may change in the future, as the risk cut-off criterion for high risk in the lung screening guidelines may be lowered as new evidence on the effects of LCS become available. \n\nResearch questions\n=================\n1. Does the implementation of LCS in PC lead to an increase in the proportion of smokers who (self-report being) in high-risk? \n2. Does the implementation of LCS in PC lead to an increase in the proportion of smokers who (self-report being) willing to be referred for additional care by a GP, such as smoking cessation counseling?\n3. What are the attitudes of high-risk former smokers towards additional care by a GP or lung cancer nurse specialist (LCNS), and what are the perceived barriers and facilitators to accepting this care?\n\nIntervention\n=================\nPart of all patients who are already smoking 30 + pack years and still smoking, who have smoked >= 30 pack years in the past and who are referred by a general practitioner as high risk (e.g., on the basis of smoking history or lung health questionnaire) will be invited to participate in a comprehensive intervention program to help smokers prepare for LCS. Smokers and former smokers referred by their general practitioner as high risk are approached with a telephone call from a study researcher. The call is scheduled in such a way that the researcher can reach participants immediately during their (former",

Please continue describing the trial design details. \n\nAbstract:\nWe report the results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an automated feedback system for preventing inappropriate prescriptions of antibiotics and potentially harmful drugs (PHDs) among patients in hospital. Hospital medical records data from 1413 patients in 49 wards at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh were audited during a 12\u2010month period in 2007. From this we identified 1910 episodes of care, each one lasting 24 hours, that were deemed as potentially preventable with the new feedback system: 997 episodes of care involving an inappropriate antibiotic and 913 involving a potentially harmful drug. The mean daily rate of inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics was 6.4 per 100 patient\u2010days, and the mean daily rate of inappropriate prescribing of potentially harmful drugs was 5.5 per 100 patient\u2010days. We used risk adjustment and logistic regression analysis to analyze the influence of potential confounding factors on the occurrence of potentially preventable harms. Using the adjusted odds ratios, a feedback intervention group was identified which contained patients who would benefit most from the feedback system. The feedback system was then piloted in this selected group of patients only. The data collected from this feasibility study suggest that an automated feedback system targeting hospital clinicians with potentially preventable harms has the potential for preventing up to 60% of errors in medication prescribing.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn 2004, an NQE target for antimicrobial prescribing was introduced by the Scottish Department of Health, requiring a 20% increase in guideline concordant antimicrobial prescribing. In order to meet this, it is likely that strategies that improve the management of infections in hospitals will also contribute to improving the appropriate use of antibiotics. Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing and potentially harmful drug (PHD) prescriptions are significant issues in both primary and secondary care. Research findings have demonstrated that, inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is commonplace in hospitals, with up to 50% of prescriptions being either unnecessary or inappropriate. Several studies have identified the reasons for this in",

            "suitable treatment option. Palliation can be achieved by a primary resection of the obstructive lesion with or without stoma formation or colonic bypass surgery. However, patients who are treated with palliative surgery do not experience the same benefits from a primary resection as oncological patients and the palliative approach has only a minimal impact on survival. As the majority of colonic cancers are right-sided and located in the ascending colon, the mortality rates are higher for left-sided colonic cancer and this accounts for 20% of all incident colorectal cancers. Patients with obstructive left-sided colonic cancer often have a long history of symptoms due to the delay in diagnosis. Emergency surgery is usually the best option in this group of patients, which does not have a curative intent. However, the primary treatment of oncological patients involves wide tumor resection with lymphadenectomy and anastomosis. There are only a very limited number of reports of emergency surgery and these were mostly performed on left-sided colorectal cancer patients with distal obstruction. The only long term survival has been reported in stoma patients. In some cases the stapled end-to-end anastomosis fails and the patient requires an ileostomy or a permanent colostomy. As this procedure will probably cure the primary tumor (and prevent disease recurrence), these patients should be closely monitored during follow-up. This study aims to improve the overall outcome of patients with obstructive left-sided colonic malignancy through a novel approach combining right hemicolectomy en transverse derivation with an elective colostomy and postoperative chemotherapy. If this novel approach results in improved survival, surgical patients may benefit from wide left hemicolectomy, which includes tumor resection with lymphadenectomy and anastomosis. Primary Objective Primary outcome of the study is survival. The survival rate after emergency surgery of right hemicolectomy with transverse colon derivation and a palliative left hemicolectomy will be compared with the data of patients who will receive emergency resection with a stoma and chemotherapy. If no adverse effects are seen, patients will be eligible for extended surgery. At the follow-up visits, tumor recurrence and adverse effects will be assessed. Secondary",

To this end, we have added a further investigation on the outcomes and quality of life for patients with and without a diverting loop ileostomy in our methods. We have also considered the limitations of this approach, including potential variations in surgeon preferences and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, which can also affect surgical outcomes and quality of life. By including this additional investigation, we hope to provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to different surgical outcomes and improve the quality of care and support for patients with obstructive left colonic cancer.\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nIn this single center, retrospective cohort study, 1) we will report the outcomes of primary surgical tumor resection with and without anastomosis with a stoma. 2) we will compare the outcomes of primary tumoral resection with later wide colotomy after 2 weeks with palliative left hemicolectomy, which is the current standard of care. 3) we will compare the outcomes of surgery with palliative stenting. 4) we will compare outcomes of the various approaches in the following groups 1) tumor <3 cm, 2) tumor 3-5 cm in size, and 3) tumor> 5 cm, separately, using propensity matching. 5) patients with or without a primary colorectal anastomosis will receive a colonoscopy at 3, 6, and 9 months after surgery. This will provide us with the long-term, definitive follow-up data, and, importantly, these results are expected to support the development of guidelines regarding the appropriate use of diversion stoma in left colon obstruction.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nIn a single center, retrospective cohort study, patients with obstructive left colon cancer who underwent emergent surgery between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020 will be included. Patients undergoing primary surgical tumor resection with and without anastomosis with a stoma will be included, as well as patients who underwent primary tumor re",

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nEssential tremor (ET) is a common form of tremor that presents as a relatively simple clinical picture. It is recognized as the most common movement disorder after Parkinson's disease. ET is caused by the dysfunction of the neuronal network of the cerebellum and the subcortical region. Tremor is often associated with a complex postural attitude. In particular, patients often have the need to use their hands. This is known as kinetic tremor. The aim of this study is to test different methods of gait analysis to understand the gait characteristics of patients with this ET. Patients will be recruited through the Movement Disorders Research Center of the Istituto Clinico Humanitas. Patient selection will be made using a set of questionnaires including the Movement Disorder Society Rating Scale for ET, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale, the Sickness Impact Profile, the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Falls Efficacy Scale. Gait analysis will be performed according to the protocol of the Parkinson Study Group. In the first phase of the experimental session, the patient will be seated in the wheelchair with his head resting against the headrest, his arms on the arms of the wheelchair. The body position is then adjusted so that it is symmetrical on both sides. If necessary, the position in the wheelchair will be improved by adjustment of the height of the wheelchair seat and by adjustment of the position of the back and seat belts. After this initial adjustment, the patient will wear a headpiece and electrodes will be placed on the legs, at shoulder height and behind the neck, and at ankle height. A pair of inertial sensors will be placed on both feet. To record the patient's speech, two wireless microphones will be placed on him. The patient will then stand up and walk freely for 10 seconds. The patient must walk fast enough to cover about 5 meters in 10 seconds, but not so fast that he loses his balance. The therapist will then ask the patient to walk for 3 meters without turning or accelerating, at a speed determined by the patient or the examiner. After that, the therapist will ask the patient to walk slowly to the end of the floor. The therapist then asked the patient to walk",

What are the expected outcomes of this study? \n\n\nStudy type\n=================\nObservational study\n\nStudy design\n=================\nTransversal observational study\n\nDescription\n=================\nBrownish teeth are often a source of dissatisfaction in the population, even despite the existence of effective and reasonably priced tooth bleaching procedures. An alternative to this is laser light as an activating agent for the bleaching process, being efficient in bleaching yellow teeth1and reducing the sensitivity induced by such a treatment2. However, in dark teeth, there is the possibility of discoloration due to the photochemical effect of the laser, especially when the teeth have an intrinsic brownish color, and the use of a laser at an energy density that can trigger the bleaching effect without exceeding the discoloration threshold. Therefore, there is a need to find out whether a single session with a low-level diode laser could be a trigger for the bleaching in brownish teeth3. This article's goals are to assess tooth sensitivity before, immediately after, and 1 month after a low-level laser therapy before the bleaching treatment of brownish teeth and to find correlations between the bleaching process and intrinsic tooth discoloration.MethodsA case-control, clinical, pilot study, conducted at a public dental service in northern Portugal, on adults between 18 and 60 years old with brownish teeth. The sample was non-probabilistic, composed of individuals who presented with brownish teeth of at least 6 on the Vita scale. Participants will receive a single laser treatment session with an 810 nm laser at 0.5 Watts, before the bleaching treatment consisting of a 38% hydrogen peroxide gel for 20 minutes. The bleaching treatment will be applied to both the dentine and enamel of the affected teeth by the dentist. All the teeth in the oral cavity were bleached, except for teeth that, for anatomical or functional reasons, did not accept it. The intensity of sensitivity was assessed after bleaching and 1 month later using a visual analog scale (VAS). The intensity of tooth bleaching 1 month after bleaching was assessed with the Vita scale. The relationship between the color change and the intensity of sensitivity will be evaluated.\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================",

We also studied the possible relationship between the results of the BASFI questionnaire, NRS for pain, NRS for fatigue, weight, gender, and age with the intervention. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: In each group, 23 people participated in the study. The mean age of the subjects was 35.57\u00b19.65 years, and 52% were women. Comparing the groups revealed that the Pilates and isometric exercise groups were significantly better than the control group in terms of the BASFI questionnaire scores for functional outcome (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Also, these two groups had significantly lower pain (P<0.001) and fatigue (P<0.05) scores compared to the control group. There was no significant difference between the two exercise groups in terms of pain, fatigue and function (P> 0.05).Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that both Pilates and isometric exercises can reduce pain and fatigue, and improve functional disability in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In addition, there was no significant difference between Pilates and isometric exercises in terms of their effects.",

            "For the experimental arm, we are looking to enroll participants with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The intervention/treatment will involve Odronextamab in combination with CHOP chemotherapy as the primary treatment. We will use a 3+3 dose escalation design in Part 1A, followed by expansion in Part 1B. The dose optimization strategy will involve identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and optimal bi-weekly dose for Odronextamab in combination with CHOP. \n\nFor the control arm, we will enroll participants with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and they will receive Rituximab with CHOP chemotherapy. This serves as the active comparator to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Odronextamab in comparison to the current standard of care. \n\nOverall, this study aims to evaluate the safety and optimal dosing of Odronextamab in combination with chemotherapy, while also comparing it to the current standard of care in the control arm.",
            "Sure! In the control arm (Rituximab + CHOP), the participant group/arm will consist of previously untreated DLBCL patients. They will receive Rituximab intravenously, in combination with the same CHOP chemotherapy regimen as the experimental arm. The control arm will serve as the standard of care and will be used as a comparator to test the efficacy and safety of Odronextamab in comparison. \n\n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Purpose:: Treatment\nPhase:: Phase3\nIntervention Model:: Parallel\nBlinding/Masking:: Open\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: Drug\nIntervention Description:: The following descriptions refer to the experimental arm (Odronextamab + CHOP) and the control arm (Rituximab + CHOP) separately: \n* Intervention Arm: Odronextamab + CHOP\n- Previously untreated DLBCL participants will receive intravenous Odronextamab starting at a starting dose level of Odronextamab 8 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) every week for 4 weeks in Part 1A . In Part 1B , the dose may be increased for further participants if Odronextamab \u226520 mg/kg is determined to be safe at the end of Part 1A. A dose level expansion cohort will enroll to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of Odronextamab at the dose level determined to be active and safe at the end of Part 1A.\n- Within approximately 2 weeks following completion of the dosing period Odronextamab + CHOP, the participants will receive a consolidation treatment of 4 additional cycles of CHOP chemotherapy treatment. \n- A total of 18 or fewer newly diagnosed patients will be enrolled in Part 1A dose escalation. In the expansion cohort, further up to 136 patients will be enrolled. A maximum of 200 or more participants will be enrolled in the dose level expansion cohorts.\n- Approximately 185 participants will be enrolled in Part 2 of the study (RCT arm).\n* Intervention Arm: Rituximab + CHOP",
            "Of course! To evaluate the safety and optimal dosing of Odronextamab in combination with chemotherapy, an appropriate dose range needs to be determined using Part 1A of the study. The study will utilize a standard 3+3 dose-escalation technique, which involves a stepwise increase in dosage while monitoring for tolerability and adverse events. Part 1B will focus on the selected dose cohort from Part 1A, which will aim to establish the recommended starting dose (RSD) for the treatment phase (Part 1C). \n\nPart 2 will be a randomized, open-label, two-arm, one-sided crossover, controlled study. Patients randomized to the first treatment arm will receive Odronextamab + Rituximab for Cycles 1-4, followed by crossover to receive Rituximab + Chemotherapy [RCH] for Cycles 5-11. Conversely, those in the second treatment arm will receive the reverse sequence, starting with RCH for Cycles 1-4 and subsequently crossover to receive Odronextamab + [Rituximab] for Cycles 5-11.  The primary analysis will be performed using a descriptive analysis, and the key secondary endpoint, a non-inferiority analysis, will involve the determination of a CI for OS. The two-stage step-down approach will be utilized for this assessment. \n\nAs you can see, we have designed the study phases and treatment arms based on a thorough understanding of the available data and a commitment to evaluating the safety and efficacy of Odronextamab in combination with chemotherapy effectively.  The combination of Odronextamab and rituximab in Parts 1C and 2 will help us compare the efficacy of both therapies, providing critical information to advance the treatment of DLBCL patients in the future.\nUser Rating: 3 / 5\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug Odronextamab in combination with standard chemotherapy treatment in patients with a type of blood cancer called diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL",
            "Of course. The study arms are as follows:\n\nThe Phase 1A study arm will involve six to 12 patients who will participate in a sequential dose escalation to determine the tolerable dose of Odronextamab when given in combination with CHOP chemotherapy.\n\nThe Phase 1B optimized dose study arm will involve another 10 to 20 patients who will receive the Odronextamab dose determined in Phase 1A in combination with CHOP chemotherapy.\n\nThe Phase 2 comparative dose study arm will involve 262 to 326 patients who will be randomized to receive either Rituximab or Odronextamab in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. \n\nThe Phase 3 comparative dose study cohort will involve around 800 to 1000 patients who will be randomly assigned to receive either Rituximab or Odronextamab in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. \n\nCan you provide a brief explanation of the purpose of each study arm and the participant inclusion/exclusion criteria for each?"

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare chronic, progressive disease characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance in the pulmonary arteries, which in turn leads to right ventricular failure. The main cause of PH patients is congenital heart disease (PAH). Because of the lack of awareness and education on PAH, there are no relevant medical centers or specialists in the country. This study will examine the characteristics of PAH in terms of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, etiology and other related indicators, in order to provide guidance for early screening and intervention of PAH in the future. Therefore, the investigators hope to collect data for the clinical observation study, to assess some related risk factors, as well as the effect of follow-up intervention programs in PAH patients. This study is an observational study focusing on the clinical characteristics of PAH patients in China. First, the clinical characteristics of PAH patients are evaluated. For each patient, the general medical history, blood routine and urine routine, blood biochemistry, stool routine, blood coagulation function, liver and kidney function, infectious factors and antibodies, ECG, cardiac function, brain natriuretic peptide, echocardiography, lung function and chest high-resolution CT are collected. Second, the characteristics of high-risk family members are evaluated. In addition, the investigators carry out a comprehensive evaluation of patients with other factors affecting physical function, to assess their physical activity level, social resources, sleep quality, nutritional status, disease self-management level, and other issues. Thirdly, the investigators determine the specific pathogenic factor of each case, and design a case report to comprehensively summarize the medical history and treatment of all patients. The investigators will perform a retrospective analysis of 49 patients with congenital heart disease to further analyze the characteristics of patients, and at the same time further analyze and compare their short-term and long-term prognoses.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPulmonary hypertension is a rare chronic, progressive disease, characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance in the pulmonary arteries, which in turn leads to right ventricular failure.

The trial will assess the impact of the intervention using a matched\u2010pair difference\u2010in\u2010difference analytic approach. The intervention consists of three key components: 1) delivery of a 2\u2010hour health and financial literacy program by trained peer\u2010leaders, 2) access to an online resource guide that promotes evidence\u2010informed health behaviors among adults with diabetes, and 3) targeted texting reminders of health\u2010related and financial literacy messages throughout the trial. The program was first piloted with a convenience sample of patients attending health\u2010related classes at the study site. Participants will be recruited in three phases to evaluate the intervention over time. A total of fifty healthcare delivery sites (clusters) from a single large academic medical center network will be randomized in a stepped\u2010wedge fashion to implement the intervention. The intervention will be rolled out in 3 cohorts of 17 sites, with the first cohort receiving the control condition and being re\u2010exposed to the intervention in a rolling fashion during the trial. The objective of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of a health and financial literacy program on improving health and wealth behaviors among patients receiving care within an academic medical center network."

            "Yes, there are. The machined transcortical portion of the experimental arm is expected to have a better clinical and radiographic outcome compared to the roughened transcortical portion in the active comparator arm. The bone consumption procedure in both arms is expected to improve the stability of implants in thin, partially edentulous ridges. We are also interested in assessing whether the combination of the bone consumption and bone expansion procedures is superior to the bone expansion technique alone for implant placement and supporting long-term dental prostheses.\n\nStudy design\n=================\nProspective cohort study\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\nThe patients selected for this study will be those with partially edentulous implant gaps in the posterior upper and/or lower jaw and with a residual bone width of 3 to 5 mm. They should be non-smokers or non-heavy smokers, with a maximum of five cigarettes per day. They should also be 18 to 80 years old and present no contraindications to surgery or dental implants. The inclusion criteria are further detailed in the study protocol.\nWhat is the population of patients with partially edentulous implant gaps in the posterior upper and/or lower jaw who have a residual bone width of 3 to 5 mm? \nTo answer this question, we have included a population of patients with partially edentulous implant gaps in the posterior upper and/or lower jaw who have a residual bone width of 3 to 5 mm. Additionally, we have conducted a power analysis to determine the required sample size based on the difference in the implant healing index (HI) between the study arms. The inclusion criteria regarding the residual bone width were determined after considering the typical range of bone width for successful implant placement and the limitations of the bone expansion procedure.\nWhat does a non-smoker or non-heavy smoker mean in this study? \nA non-smoker or non-heavy smoker is defined as someone who has smoked fewer than five cigarettes per day. This criterion was included to minimize the risk of complications during and after surgery.\nWhat is the minimum and maximum age of the patients in this study? \nThe minimum age is 18 years and the maximum age is 80 years, which is considered the upper age limit for successful implant placement. This criterion",
            "Sure. In the experimental study arm, subjects will receive Rex implants with a machined transcortical portion, and both the bone consumption procedure and the bone expansion technique will be used for implant placement. Similarly, in the active comparator study arm, subjects will receive Rex implants with a roughened transcortical portion, and both procedures will be applied. The study arms aim to compare the effectiveness of each implant and procedure in achieving successful outcomes."

Hypofibrinolytic effects of colchicine have proven beneficial in primary prevention of VTE. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a short perioperative colchicine administration in prophylaxis against VTE after spinal surgery. Methods: The study is a double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre, randomised parallel\u2010group trial involving 690 adults undergoing elective spinal surgery. Adults undergoing elective spinal surgery or surgery of the upper extremities or neck under general anaesthesia (excluding trauma or infection) with a minimum duration of surgery time 60 minutes and a high risk of developing VTE were eligible for the study (250 patients for each group). Patients were randomly allocated to perioperative treatment with Colchicine or placebo for three days. The primary outcome is the detection of a DVT by lower limb ultrasonography within one month after surgery. A secondary outcome is the incidence of secondary bleeding after spinal surgery. Results: From October 2017 to February 2018, we included 690 patients in this study: 255 patients in the colchicine group and 256 patients in the placebo group. According to the Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis, no significant difference was found between the two groups in the incidence of DVT. The rate of postoperative DVT in the colchicine group was 7.9%, 95% confidence interval 4.6%\u20109.8%, and in the placebo group 5.9%, 95% confidence interval 2.5%\u20107.3%.

To determine the appropriate target sample size for a feasibility clinical trial to evaluate the safety and performance of the Revision LR femoral stem. Methods. The sample size was estimated based on the primary outcomes, which are the primary total hip function score (THA) at two years and one year. The THA was measured using the Harris Hip Score (HHS) scale, with a higher score indicating better outcomes. The sample size was calculated using a power analysis with a 50% effect size (ES), two\u2010tailed alpha error of 0.05, and a power of 0.80. The calculation was based on the previous study results of the primary THA scores, assuming that half of the participants would experience improvement or worsening from baseline. The primary result was divided in half, and the sample size equation was calculated. The sample size calculation was performed using a spreadsheet. The obtained sample size was rounded up to the nearest 5 or 10, taking into account potential dropouts. Results. The estimated sample size was 25 participants per study arm, based on the assumption of 25% attrition at two years and 10% attrition at one year. Conclusions. The sample size calculation was completed for this feasibility clinical trial, and the estimated sample size was 25 participants per study arm.

The disease process starts with the build-up of fatty deposits in the inner layer of the arteries, known as atherosclerosis. As the disease develops and progresses, it can lead to plaques that may become unstable, rupture and trigger a heart attack or stroke. Carotid artery imaging using ultrasound is a clinical procedure used to diagnose and confirm these atherosclerotic deposits and assess the extent of the disease. The disease process can affect both the innermost and outermost layers of the arteries but this varies by disease severity, patient and disease location. The innermost layer of the arteries consists of mostly a smooth muscle that is called the intima. The outermost layer consists of connective tissue and smooth muscle that constitute the wall of the artery and is called the media. These layers expand and contact each other as an individual ages or if disease is present. This makes it more difficult to assess the disease and the development of it without looking at the layers.This means that doctors have to rely on imaging techniques to estimate disease location, disease severity and rate of growth. In medical studies, the average increase in the size of the middle layer of the carotid artery has been suggested to be 0.1mm per year in people who are over 55. Recent research has shown that patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to produce procollagen protein in the blood. Procollagen is one of the proteins that is",

Due to the relatively high cost of topographers, the analysis of corneal topography was mainly limited to the preoperative examination of corneal refractive surgery. The costly diagnostic imaging device for corneal topography is available. Therefore, it is necessary to expand its use. In this study, we conducted a prospective and systematic study using a topographer for the management of refractive patients in a routine clinical setting. The aim of this study was to detect a progressive thinning of the cornea within a 5-yea period after the refractive status remained stable and to establish an early detection and diagnostic system of corneal thinning diseases. Methods \n\nCorneal topography was performed using the Oculus Pentacam HR device. All images were recorded at the baseline and every year for five years. Intraocular pressure, corneal pachymetry (with noncontact tonometer), and the Schirmer test were performed once a year. Clinical observation included the development of corneal stromal cysts and cataracts. A complete ocular examination was performed at all visits. Patient demographics such as age and sex were recorded. The diagnosis of progressive corneal thinning and keratoconus was made by Pentacam. The corneal topography map was also used to assess the presence of posterior elevation, which may indicate posterior elevation, corneal ectasia, or corneal ectasia. Intraocular pressure was measured using an applanation tonometer. Patients with progressive thinning were classified according to the KC staging system and the presence of posterior elevation was categorized.

            "the eye . Since CCLX can significantly slow the progression of KC and achieve excellent visual correction and refractive stability, its application in the treatment of KC has extended to various stages of KC.\nThe treatment effect of CXL is mainly due to the interaction of UV irradiation and riboflavin to strengthen the structure of corneal collagen. It also makes the cornea stiffer and more resistant to stress damage by affecting the expression of various genes and proteins . However, studies have found that the change in corneal biomechanics in the same course of progression may be different in KC . In mild KC patients (\u226447 D), the corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) increased before CXL. In advanced KC patients (KC >47 D), the corneal hysteresis in patients receiving CXL decreased significantly, while the corneal resistance factor (CRF) also decreased significantly, which was different from the change in the early stage . The degree of change in the central corneal thickness (CCT) after CXL was related to keratometry (K) and pachymetry . In patients with greater corneal stiffening, the central corneal thickness (CCT) of the treated eye decreased, while the central corneal thickness (CCT) of patients with low corneal stiffening increased. At the same time, the decrease or increase of CCT after CXL treatment was not related to the reduction or reduction of K, respectively. But these results did not take into account the influence of corneal biomechanics on the change in CCT.\nTransprismal photorefractive keratectomy (PTRK) has been effective and safe in the treatment of myopia. It has been the main treatment option for myopia less than \u20109 D . At present, in the treatment of myopia, PTRK is mainly used for the initial treatment of myopia, followed by CXL. Some studies have shown that PTRK + CXL can induce simultaneous axial changes in the eye, resulting in myopia and axial elongation reduction, myopic retardation, and astigmatism reduction, which is superior to CXL Alone .

Next, could you please provide a brief overview of your study and its purpose? \n\nAbstract:\nPurpose: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Donepezil for alleviation of delirium and in the treatment of vascular cognitive fading. Background: Delirium is a common complication of stroke and increases the rate of early death and the cost of hospitalization. It is an acute reversible condition that usually decreases within 4 weeks after onset. The incidence of post\u2010stroke delirium varies from 7.4% to 49% and varies from 18.9% to 60.6% with vascular cognitive impairment. Donepezil is an inhibitor of acetyl cholinesterase, which blocks the decomposition of acetylcholine, thus increasing its concentrations. Donepezil is used in the treatment of dementia. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 4 mg Donepezil for 10 weeks in the treatment of delirium and vascular cognitive fading. Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial in Iran. For this reason, the patients will enter the study as individuals or group according to the degree of disability based on The Modified Rankin Scale, and the same will be assigned to the experimental and control group. There will be a 10\u2010week drug administration period for the experimental group and a 10\u2010week follow\u2010up period for both groups. Participants\u2019 medical information is recorded using a medical checklist questionnaire, which includes demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and clinical features. Moreover, brain MRI and cognitive function test are used to assess baseline cognition and brain function. Donepezil and placebo are randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. Finally, the data collected will be compiled and analyzed using the SPSS software version 22. Conclusion: In Iran, few clinical trials have been done on delirium. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of delirium and cognitive fading. Findings of this study will be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of delirium and to conduct studies in delirium care.",

Can you tell me more about the trial intervention? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction/Aims: Dupilumab is a fullyhuman monoclonal antibody against the IL\u20104\u03b2/IL\u201013 signalling axis, approved for the treatment of moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma in adults and adolescents (>12 years). Dupilumab is now under investigation in patients with asthma and other paediatric indications. Methods: The 506\u2010MG\u2010LIBERTY-ASTHMATAKIDS was a double\u2010blinded, active\u2010controlled, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial which included children aged 2 to <12 years (\u226530kg). Participants were randomised 1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 300mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), dupilumab 100mg Q2W or placebo for 52 weeks. All study medications were administered by subcutaneous injection. A total of 268 participants were randomised in each group. Co\u2010primary endpoints were annualised rate of asthma exacerbations in patients aged \u22656 years and annualised rate of asthma exacerbations and/or time to first asthma exacerbation in patients aged 2\u2010<6 years. Results: Significant and clinically relevant improvements in the annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbations were observed in children/adolescents aged \u226530kg and/or \u22656 years of age treated with dupilumab 300 or 100 mg Q2W compared with placebo. Significant improvements in the annualised rate of asthma exacerbations and/or time to first asthma exacerbation were observed for children <6 years of age treated with dupilumab compared with placebo. The safety profile for Dupilumab was comparable to the placebo. Conclusions: Dupilumab treatment provided significant and sustained improvements in asthma exacerbations, demonstrating an efficacy and safety profile similar to that seen in other study populations.",

However, the optimal method of treating for pain control have not been elucidated. The study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of oral administration of pregabalin versus nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs in patients treated for perianal abscesses. Methods: This randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial with assessor blinding was conducted between February 2021, and December 2022, in the Department of Plastic Anatomy and Pediatric Surgery. A total of 106 patients aged&gt;19 years were included. They were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg pregabalin orally twice a day (experimental group) or the same volume of placebo (control group) for 4 days. The primary endpoint was pain intensity on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, and 3, assessed by the patient using a Visual Analog Scale. The secondary endpoints were analgesic use, the mean pain score per 24 hours, complications, and other adverse events. Data were analyzed by intention\u2010to\u2010treat (ITT) and completers analysis. Results: Of the 106 patients, 30 patients (28.3%) were excluded due to protocol deviations, and 76 patients were included in the ITT analysis (38 patients in the experimental group and 38 in the control group).

Once we have obtained the informed consent from the participants and their parents or other legal representatives and enrolled them in the study, we will administer the first dose of Dupilumab or placebo (subcutaneous injection). Based on the participant's previous medical history and symptoms during screening, a treatment period of 24 weeks will be defined. What happens if the participant has an adverse event related to the study treatment? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: In this study, we will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma in children aged 2 to 5 years. In this age group, it is very significant to investigate the potential benefits in terms of efficacy and safety of Dupilumab, as there are currently limited available treatment options for children in this age range with severe asthma. Moreover, previous research has shown that Dupilumab can effectively reduce inflammation in the airways and improve clinical outcomes in adults and adolescents with severe asthma. The aim of this study is to determine if the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Dupilumab in children aged 2 to 5 years is non\u2010inferior to its efficacy in adults and adolescents. It is necessary to obtain informed consent to participate in a clinical trial involving human subjects, as participants and their legal representatives need to understand the purpose of the study, the risks and benefits involved, and the rights and obligations associated with participating. Informed consent serves to protect the rights and well\u2010being of human subjects in clinical research by ensuring their full understanding and voluntary participation. It is essential to have complete and accurate information about the study in order to make an informed decision. In clinical research, informed consent is crucial for ensuring the ethical and legal compliance of the study and the protection of the rights of human subjects. The informed consent document should be clear, concise, and understandable to the participant and their legal representative, and should be presented in easily understandable, non\u2010technical language. The content of the informed consent form must include a description of the study's objectives, the study's procedures, and the participant's rights and responsibilities",

With a mean cylinder correction of \u20100.79 (range: \u20101.77 to 0), the ICL plus LtK group showed the best outcome with a mean refractive cylinder of \u20100.23 (range: \u20101.64 to 0) in the postoperative 3 months, p = 0.034. The study showed that implantation of femtosecond laser generated lens (ZLE) and toric ablation in the same capsular bag could be performed safely without any mechanical complication and had the ability to correct low corneal astigmatism.",
            "Excellent! What is the study measuring? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In vitro and in vivo data, including one randomized controlled trial, suggest that the NK activating ligand Nectin\u20102 on natural killer cells is involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). This single\u2010arm, phase 2a trial examined the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of the antibody\u2010drug conjugate Hu5F9\u2010CD3 BCMA in relapsing MS (RMS) patients. Methods: The study aimed to dose\u2010escalate by 0.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or at 2\u2010weekly (Q3W) intervals in patients who tolerated an early dose. The safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events. MRI data were the primary efficacy endpoint. Results: Twelve patients are enrolled with six on Q3W 0.5 mg/kg and six on Q3W 1.0 mg/kg who received 3 treatments. Seven patients were treated with 2.0 mg/kg/cycle, three of whom had previously been treated at 0.5 mg/kg Q3W. To\u2010date, all 12 patients completed all study visits and 11 remain on\u2010treatment. The MRI results suggest that no patient had a 9\u2010hole\u2010peg\u2010test positive relapse, and there has been no increase in the median number of active T2\u2010weighted lesions, with a trend toward a reduction in the median number. No patient discontinued as a result of an adverse event. Conclusions: This study indicates that the combination of a safe antibody\u2010drug conjugate and a biomarker, Nectin\u20102, is effective compared with historical controls in a small pilot study without the requirement for a randomised control group.",
            "Could you please elaborate on the rationale for this approach? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Aims: To describe our model of community based diabetes nurses (CBDNs) and the training content, to explore the satisfaction of the participants with the model of CBDNs. METHODS: Ninety four diabetes patients participated the training sessions, which comprised of 8 topics. All the participants were asked to evaluate the training sessions. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part included 4 items, which were mainly aimed to describe the satisfaction in terms of the CBDNs and the training content; and the second part included 10 items, specifically, aimed to describe the perception of CBDNs about the impact of the training, training on their knowledge, and their interest in the model. RESULTS: Eighty six participants completed the training and evaluation sessions. Eighty four.7 % of the participants agreed that it was very helpful. Nine (10.5%) and only one (1.2%) patient complained about the lack of accessibility to the CBDNs and thought that there was insufficient training on self management of diabetes. Ninety eight point one percent (98.1%, 83/84) of the participants agreed or strongly agreed that the CBDNs have increased their motivation in self managing diabetes and maintaining a balanced lifestyle. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of the CBDN model and the training contents was positive. As for the further development of this model, more community diabetes nurses are required to reduce the ratio waiting time for the initial screening and the referral to hospital. The training manual requires further revisions to increase the specificity of training content for diabetic patients and to facilitate the accessibility of CBDNs.\n\nIntroduction\nDiabetes Mellitus has been considered as a major health threat and a global epidemic of the 21st century. Approximately 246 million people worldwide have diabetes. It has been reported that approximately 10% of the entire population were suffering from diabetes in the UK , and over 12% of the adult population living in China . Besides, 26.6% of the patients undergoing dialysis had experienced the development of diabetes .\nThe development of diabetes can lead to various complications, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), kidney disease, ocular disease or nerve damage. The prevalence of diabetes was projected to increase by 4",

Could you please provide me with some more information about your treatment method? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nSkin barrier dysfunction and related conditions, such as atopic dermatitis and urticaria, are growing at an alarming rate. However, the cause of such skin disorders is unclear, making it difficult to find appropriate treatments. The concept of the present study is to restore the skin barrier by regulating the skin flora. Zantogin\u00ae Gel is a drug-free topical agent with a low molecular weight that has received a patent as an ingredient for skin care products. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical application of Zantogin\u00ae Gel in skin disorders caused by skin barrier dysfunction with a single-center prospective exploratory clinical study. Patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis or urticaria at skin barrier sites were enrolled and treated for 4 weeks. Atopic dermatitis, urticaria and skin barrier function were evaluated, and blood samples were routinely evaluated. No side effects, changes in hematology and biochemical profile were observed with topical treatment at the dose tested. The results of this clinical study suggest that the topical treatment of Zantogin\u00ae Gel, a low molecular weight natural product, is a novel method for treating mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, urticaria and skin barrier dysfunction.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSkin barrier dysfunction is known to promote various skin diseases, and atopic dermatitis and urticaria are the most common, with increasing prevalence in recent years. Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that begins with skin barrier dysfunction at an early age. Although the exact etiology of atopic dermatitis is not understood, recent evidence supports the importance of the skin microenvironment as a therapeutic target for skin barrier disorders. 13S-methionine, also known as s-adenosylmethionine (SAM), is a methyl donor that is thought to be involved in the regulation of the skin microenvironment by regulating the expression of genes involved in skin barrier function. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that targeting lipid metabolism using Z",

            "Starting at a lower dose allows for the assessment of any potential adverse effects or toxicities associated with the treatment. It is a necessary step in the dose escalation design of the trial to ensure patient safety and determine the optimal therapeutic dose. Now, let's move on to Dose Level 1.",
            "For Dose Level 2, the participant group/arm is patients receiving 1x10(8) TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The intervention/treatment remains as TmPSMA-02 CAR T cells. This arm aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intermediate dose of TmPSMA-02 CAR T cells. This dose may be seen as a potential therapeutic dose as it is between Dose Levels -1 and 3. By exploring different dose levels, we can optimize the therapeutic efficacy and identify the most effective dose for future clinical use.

TmPSMA\u201002 is an anti\u2010prostate cancer chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy designed to recognize prostate\u2010specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and neuroendocrine cell membrane antigen. In a previous Phase I/Part 1 clinical trial (NCT03926073), TmPSMA\u201002 CAR T cells showed promising anti\u2010tumor activity in metastatic castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with a reasonable safety profile. Additionally, a Phase I/Part 1 clinical trial is ongoing in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) (NCT04866291). The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of escalating doses of TmPSMA\u201002 CAR T cells in patients with mCRPC. Study design: This is an open\u2010label, single\u2010arm, dose finding study. Cohorts will include no more than 12 patients for each cohort for a maximum total of 54 patients. There are 5 dose levels of TmPSMA\u201002 CAR T cells: 1x10(5) (Cohort A); 3x10(5) (Cohort B); 1x10(6) (Cohort C); 1x10(7) (Coh",
            "For Dose Level 3, the participant group/arm is patients receiving 3x10(8) TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The treatment remains as TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells. This arm helps to determine the maximum tolerated dose of TmPSMA-02 CAR T cells, which is the highest dose that can be administered without causing significant adverse effects. It is crucial in evaluating the safety and potential efficacy of the treatment, as well as informing future clinical trials and treatment protocols.

CP comprises a group of disorders characterized by problems with muscle coordination, body movement, and posture that limit an individual's functional abilities. However, no single treatment has been proven to be effective in reversing or mitigating the symptoms of CP. Nimodipine (Nim) has been shown to improve the quality of life (QoL) in children with CP. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of Nim in 40 patients with bilateral cerebral palsy (BCP) in terms of the effectiveness of locomotor training. Methods: The study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A total sample of 40 BCP patients, aged 3\u20108 years, were randomly allocated into 2 groups: intervention group: 35 patients who received 25 mg of Nim per day for a year and placebo group: 15 randomized control patients who received identical placebo tablets. The patients' movement impairment and other functional activities were assessed by a trained neurodevelopmental therapist using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (Brunnstrom) [1], GMFM (Vojta) [3], and GMFCS [4] at the baseline, 6th, and 12th months after initiation of the treatment. The assessment was carried out using the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health [2]. In addition, quality of life scores using the Pediatric Quality of Life question",

            "Abstract:\nThe prostate cancer death rate in England has fallen by 48% since 1990. This is mainly due to increased awareness and treatment, and is likely to increase by further developments.1 Radioligand therapy (RLT) is the most recent development of 177Lu\u2010 PSMA therapy and is rapidly emerging as an important treatment option for prostate cancer. This treatment is based on the monoclonal antibody IgG 177Lu\u2010 PSMA\u2010617, a ligand that binds to PSMA, which is then targeted by radiotherapy in men with prostate cancer. PSMA is a specific cell membrane protein on the surface of prostate cancer cells that is expressed in prostate cancer lesions.177Lu\u2010PSMA\u2010617 is an ideal choice for radiotherapy, as it has low non\u2010specific binding to normal cells and tissues and high binding affinity to PSMA. A recent retrospective study has shown improved clinical outcomes with minimal toxicity in PSMA+ prostate cancer patients with RLT. With more data, we will better understand the efficacy and safety of RLT and its role in treating prostate cancer.",

Protocol Information and Introduction Lung transplantation (LT) is the primary treatment for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In addition to improving symptoms and quality of life, LT has also been shown to improve survival in IPF. Unfortunately, only one-third to one-half of patients survive 1 year posttransplantation, and about 50% survive 5 years. The long-term survival of LT recipients with IPF, mainly due to mortality from chronic rejection, remains a major problem in the field of clinical transplantation. Currently, chronic rejection is the leading cause of late LT morbidity and mortality, making it the primary target of clinical therapies. However, new immunosuppressive agents, such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, cannot prevent chronic allograft destruction. In addition, no effective treatment for the prevention and treatment of chronic rejection is available. As a result, research is actively being conducted to develop novel and effective therapies for the treatment of pulmonary allograft rejection. At present, most IPF patients who do not receive LT are also diagnosed and treated with Pirfenidone or Nintedanib drugs. But there is still a lot of uncertainly about the value of Pirfenidone. This is because IPF patients who do not receive the recommended drug are still subject to mortality. Therefore, our team launched this clinical study to observe, analyze and evaluate the clinical efficacy and application value of Pirfenidone in the treatment of patients with pulmonary fibrosis. A.

Recent pilot studies indicate that fasting may also benefit gait and cognition in humans, particularly in those with obesity. Our goal in this study is to test the effects of a caloric restriction intervention on these outcomes in older men. Specifically, we will measure gait and cognitive parameters using the Timed Up-and-Go and Verbal Fluency tasks in individuals with obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI) \u2265 25); 30 individuals will be randomly assigned to a time-restricted eating intervention and 15 will serve as a successful aging comparison group. Both groups will be assessed at baseline and at the end of the study, following a 24-week intervention period.

Can you tell me more about the LEARN program? \n\nAbstract:\nAdults with obesity are vulnerable to metabolic alterations, including insulin resistance and inflammation, which are risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Obesity\u2010related liver disease is a prevalent problem worldwide; however, there remain many gaps in knowledge of treatments for NAFLD. Dysregulation in circadian rhythm is associated with insulin resistance and fatty liver disease in preclinical studies, and this provides rationale to test circadian rhythm interventions. Time\u2010restricted eating (TRE) is a promising form of nonpharmacological intervention that restricts the window during which calories are consumed. However, there are few rigorous studies of its effects in individuals with NAFLD. This study tests a 24\u2010week TRE protocol in adults with overweight and obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We also develop a time\u2010restricted eating training manual to maximize adherence to the intervention. The purpose of this study is to test whether a TRE intervention improves liver function, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic indicators in adults with NAFLD. Secondary aims are to determine the effects of this TRE protocol on quality of life, sleep and appetite, and the effects of the intervention itself on body weight and composition. The results of this study will provide critical information on the benefits of circadian rhythm\u2010based interventions in the treatment of NAFLD.",

And, what is the comparator or control treatment? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this project is the evaluation of an action-research that combines the use of two single-dose hydroalcoholic solutions on abscesses in people who self-inject drugs (PWID) of the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a hand-hygiene method called 'WHO-5', this hand-hygiene method contains five moments: (1) preparation; (2) hand-rub (using a hydroalcoholic solution); (3) moment before patient care and between patients; (4) moment before aseptic procedure; and (5) hand-rub immediately after removing gloves. This project has the following hypotheses: 1. PWID can develop hand-hygiene practices adapted to their daily use at the time of preparation and after skin lesion cleaning using the solution for hand-rubbing; 2. Hydroalcoholic solution containing 80% alcohol concentration shows superiority to the conventional 70% alcohol concentration in the treatment of abscesses in PWID; 3. Educational intervention combined with the use of a hydroalcoholic solution with an alcohol concentration of 80% is more effective in the treatment of abscesses in patients with a positive drug test than the educational intervention alone in combination with the normal hydroalcoholic solution concentration in PWID.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSeveral studies in health have demonstrated the importance of good hand hygiene, since there is a direct relationship between contamination and infection, therefore, proper management of hand hygiene is vital in health care, since it can significantly reduce the risk of healthcare-related infections and therefore prevent cross infections in patients. The WHO-5 hand-hygiene method, which was developed to meet the standards of this type of hygiene in the hospital environment, already presented in 2013, that the ideal concentration for the hydroalcoholic lotion is 80% alcohol, once this concentration guarantees a high efficacy and, on the other hand, a reduction in the incidence of allergic reactions.

            "Thank you for the information. Now, let's discuss the study's design details. We'll start with the primary purpose, which is prevention. [/H1]  In this study, the participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: a test group or a placebo group. This type of randomization ensures that the potential effects of the test drug are not influenced by biased or subjective factors. It also ensures that the results of the study are generalizable to a larger population since each group will have an equal chance of receiving the test drug or the placebo. [/H1] [H2] In this study, each group will have a total of 30 participants. In total, we will have 60 people, as there are two groups in this experiment. [D01/H01] [H1] The groups will receive the intervention together over a period of time. The intervention model in this study is parallel assignment. Parallel assignment means that both groups will receive the intervention at the same time and will not receive the intervention in a staggered or stepped manner. This type of intervention model helps to maintain a consistent intervention protocol and minimizes the potential impact of extraneous factors that may affect the participants' responses to the intervention.  [D01/H01] [H1] The intervention will be given openly, with the researcher and participants aware of each other's group assignment. This type of masking does not provide a \"blind\" element to either the researcher or the participant, as they will know which group each participant is randomly assigned to. While it is not possible to fully blind the participants or the researcher in this intervention model, it is still important to ensure that the intervention is delivered as intended and that the study results are accurate and reliable.

Both mRNA vaccines are formulated as sterile liquid for injection and will be administered into the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm. \n\nThe primary purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of these candidates in participants aged 18 to 55 years. The study also aims to evaluate the immune response in participants who have previously received an authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nThe study will be conducted in two stages: the double-blind period and the open-label period. During the double-blind period, participants will receive either mRNA-1283.222 or mRNA-1273.222. After 14 days, participants will switch to the other vaccine in an open-label manner and receive the second dose of the alternative vaccine at Month 2.\n\nDifferent from our earlier study MN00-060b, this study will evaluate both a single dose and a heterologous prime-boost regimen consisting of two doses of mRNA-1283.222 and one dose of mRNA-1273.222, respectively..\n\n[/H2] [H1] Primary outcome(s)\n=================\n1.

Cervical shortening is a common preterm delivery risk marker that has not received enough attention. The aim of the study is to improve quality of life after treatment of cervical shortening using acupuncture.Who can participate?Women aged 18 years and over who are pregnant and having treatment or scan for cervical shortening between week 14-24 of pregnancy.What does the study involve?Participants are randomized to the acupuncture group (6 weekly acupuncture treatment sessions) or standard care (standard antenatal care and cervical shortening treatment). QoL and health satisfaction questionnaires will be completed by participants, 4-6 weeks after treatment for cervical shortening and again at 36 weeks gestation and 6 months postnatally.What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?The potential benefits are that participants will receive acupuncture treatment at no direct cost, and improved quality of life and health satisfaction as a result of treatment through improved outcomes. Potential risks are acute adverse reactions to acupuncture such as bleeding, pain, or skin infections. Risk is minimised by using disposable sterile instruments, needles and single use point location diagram.Where is the study run from?Participants will come to the clinics of Australian Centre for Complementary health in Sydney.When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?January 2016 to June 2017Who is funding the study?Australian Centre for Complementary healthWho is the main contact?Mr Paulus Wiranto wiranto.paulus@gmail.com",

Results from this trial demonstrated that a single treatment with TAC-001 was well-tolerated with no safety concerns and demonstrated signs of improvement in clinician-reported measures of atopic dermatitis severity at 2 months post-treatment. The current Phase II study is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of TAC-001 in patients with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who have failed to respond to or are intolerant to traditional therapies.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nSafety and Efficacy of a Single Transcutaneous Infusion of Allogeneic Allogeneic Bone Marrow-Derived Regulatory T Cells in Patients With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis, Who Had Failed Topical or Systemic Therapies: A Multi-Center, 2-Dosed, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Phase 2 Study\n\nConditions",

Thirty patients with severe COPD (FEV1 <50% predicted) on stable LTOT were randomized to one of two groups: Group A, which received a course of 10 clang inhalations per day for 28 days, and group B which was treated for the same period without such treatment. Patients were reassessed after 32 days. The improvement in FEV1 was statistically significant for both groups only after the treatment period (p<0.001). The improvement was similar in the two groups (p= 0.96). There was no statistically significant difference in the level of exercise tolerance, dyspnoea index, quality of life, or the results of the walking test between the two groups.

I am planning to conduct a prospective cohort study.\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nChlorogenic acid, as a major antioxidant, exhibits many pharmacological and physiological properties in vivo. Numerous studies have reported that chlorogenic acid has excellent anti-cancer effect. The role of chlorogenic acid in anti-oxidant and chemoprevention may also be attributed to the inhibition of the cyclooxgenase (COX) pathway. In addition, chlorogenic acid has the ability to inhibit a variety of proteins, which may be involved in tumor metastasis and proliferation. However, only a few studies have reported the function of chlorogenic acid on colon cancer and the corresponding mechanism of action. Therefore, combined with the results of the literature report, we are going to investigate the function and mechanism of chlorogenic acid to treat colon cancer. We will focus on the following areas: inhibition of tumor proliferation and apoptosis induction, inhibition of migration and invasion of tumor cells, and inhibition of angiogenesis and inflammatory response. The purpose of this study is to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of chlorogenic acid in the treatment of colon cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis prospective cohort study will collect a total of 60 volunteers who will undergo colonoscopy for colon cancer screening in Fuwai Hospital of Ningxia Medical University.

Methods: We conducted a pre\u2010specified secondary analysis of the multisite, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, phase II MOBILE\u2010HF trial in which 150 HF patients were randomized to 12\u2010month treatment with amisulpride (100 mg/day) or placebo and compared these patients with 150 non\u2010HF controls. The primary outcome was the prevalence of low mood in HF patients and the secondary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in HF patients with low mood compared to patients without low mood. Results: Twenty percent and 25% of all HF patients had low mood and poor quality of life, respectively, and the main cause of the low mood was HF. Patients who reported any MACE at the end of the study were older, had an abnormal ECG, a lower NYHA class and had a greater left atrial diameter. In multivariate analysis, HF patients with low mood had a greater risk of MACE compared to patients without low mood, after adjusting for NYHA class (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.78, p=0.01), in spite of adequate treatment (\u03b2\u2010blocker: 70.2%, ACE\u2010I/ARB: 64.1%, statin 73.7%).

In a randomized, controlled, single\u2010center study, 20012 adults who had temporomandibular disorders were randomly allocated into three groups. One group received two weeks of ultrasound, while the other two received pulsed electromagnetic field therapy for the same amount of time. A total of 566 participants who completed the study were evaluated for signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders. Results: The VAS scale and jaw movement tests were used to measure the severity of TMD. Significant improvements were seen in jaw movement tests and the VAS scale at the end of the fifth week compared to baseline. At the end of the study, ultrasound therapy appeared to be the most successful treatment approach among all three methods. There was no variation recorded between the male and female groups. Conclusion: According to the current findings, the effectiveness of ultrasound and magnetic field therapy for the treatment of temporomandibular disorders appears to be similar."

The patients will be invited for a physical examination at day 0, day 14 and day 30 of the course.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nOur research team was the first to demonstrate that knee osteoarthritis could be successfully treated conservatively only with home-based exercises. This was in a RCT where patients with osteoarthritic knee pain performed home-based exercises for 8-10 weeks with good effect on symptoms as well as performance capacity. This is of importance because the majority of patients with knee osteoarthritis find surgical intervention, i.e. knee replacement, the only treatment option with similar effect sizes as the home-based exercises at 1-2 year follow-up. Based on our research group's earlier findings, this study aims to test which factors that predict successful outcomes and also adverse effects in patients with knee osteoarthritis undergoing a knee exercise program. This way we expect to develop a predictive model where the outcome will be dependent on several variables, i.e. anthropometric, anatomical and pain, which all might influence the treatment outcome of knee exercises. Knowing how successful the treatment is dependent on different factors will enable further development of treatment and tailoring of treatment according to the patient's clinical presentation as an alternative to a potentially more expensive surgical intervention. In addition, it might prevent the development of unnecessary complications if adverse effects can be identified prior to treatment commencement. Consequently, we would hope to achieve faster treatment results and better long-term care of patients with knee osteoarthritis.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nWhich Factors Predict Successful Outcomes and Adverse Effects of Home-based Exercises in Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nOsteoarthritis of Knee\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Exercise\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Males or females aged between 50 and 75 years with knee osteoarthritis and",

            "Patient Safety Initiative for Inpatient Treatment Using Antimicrobial Therapy - A Prospective Cohort Study\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nInpatient treatment of patients with suspected hospital-acquired infections is associated with a higher risk of adverse events (AESI) and unjustified continuation of antimicrobials. In addition to the risk of AESI, the increased use of antimicrobials can lead to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The introduction of innovative diagnostic techniques, which allow even very low bacterial load to be detected in a short period of time, may lead to more personalized antibiotic therapy and the optimization of antimicrobical treatment in case of suspected nosocomial infections. The present study aims to investigate the implementation of an innovation in diagnostic medicine using innovative diagnostic techniques based on the detection of nucleic acids in patients with suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired bacteremia. As comparators, we will evaluate a diagnostic procedure based on conventional blood culture determination and antibody determination.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAn estimated 250,000 pneumonia patients die annually in Germany. Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are among the leading causes of death in the hospital. Early diagnosis and specific therapy are key factors for the reduction of deaths and the associated costs. The use of standardized diagnostic procedures can reduce the diagnostic time and enable the initiation of adequate antimicrobial therapy for the therapy of patients. The results of the present study aim to demonstrate the benefit of a standardized diagnostic procedure for hospital-acquired pneumonia. In this prospective monocentre study, adult patients will be diagnosed according to two different diagnostic procedures. One diagnostic procedure is based on an innovative approach for the identification of pathogens (RNA/DNA diagnostics). The other diagnostic procedure is based on conventional blood culture detection and antibody detection. Both diagnostic procedures will include routine analyses. The first diagnostic procedure will be limited to the investigation of Gram-negative bacteria. The patient's informed consent of the participant is not required. The results obtained will be evaluated and compared with each other with regard to their clinical impact using a previously validated risk score (RAPID-N). The expected results will provide new insights into both the",
            "The \"Before innovative diagnostic technologies\" arm will include ICU patients who are treated using the current gold standard diagnostic techniques. The control group will serve as a baseline for comparison.\n\n# Trial Protocol V4.0: A randomised, open-label, parallel group, active controlled, phase III trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lenvatinib, an anti-angiogenic agent, combined with capecitabine in patients with unresectable advanced gastric cancer with known KRAS mutation, who progressed after prior fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy\n\nAbstract:\nBackground Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer\u2010related death in China. The overall 5\u2010yr survival rate for gastric cancer patients is only 30%. For patients with unresectable advanced gastric cancer, systemic chemotherapy has been the backbone of treatment for over 30 years, although resistance to chemotherapy could still occur. Thus there is an unmet need for effective drugs in the treatment of unresectable advanced gastric cancer. Lenvatinib acts as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1\u20133 (VEGFR\u20101\u20133) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1\u20134 (FGFRs). The goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib versus capecitabine in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer with known KRAS mutation, who progressed after prior fluoropyrimidine\u2010based chemotherapy. Patients and methods This is a randomized, open\u2010label, parallel group, active controlled, phase III study in China. An estimated 346 patients with unresectable advanced gastric cancer with known KRAS mutation, who progressed after prior fluoropyrimidine\u2010based chemotherapy, will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with lenvatinib 20 mg once daily or oral capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 twice daily on a 2\u2010weeks\u2010on/1\u2010weeks\u2010off cycle. The primary endpoint is progression\u2010free survival in the intention\u2010to\u2010treat population. Secondary endpoints include overall survival; objective response rate; time to progress",

We conducted a prospective, single\u2010centered, randomized controlled trial. Thirty patients were randomly distributed into SNS group and control group. The number of patients in the two groups was 15. We collected the data of patients, including age, gender, BMI, size of skin necrosis, operative time, and hospital stay. Preoperative CT or MRI and postoperative CT scans of the SNS group were used for digital planning, and the 3D reconstruction image was used for intraoperative navigation. The control group was directly treated with traditional surgical and suturing. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and short\u2010term postoperative complications were observed. The results showed that the operation time in the SNS group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). The rate of flap necrosis in the SNS group was significantly (P\u200a<\u200a0.05) lower than that in the control group. There was no significant difference in postoperative infection rate between the two groups (P\u200a>\u200a0.05). SNS assisted surgery can reduce the operative injury to the patient blood supply, shorten the operation time, reduce the risk of postoperative infection, and improve the postoperative recovery of patients.\n\nIntroduction\nClinical skin flap tissue repair is a method of repairing skin defects by means of healthy, local flaps.[ Clinical skin flap tissue repair often requires the use of complex anatomical structure and blood supply distribution. Flap repair often needs to mobilize and cut off the skin and subcutaneous tissue around the wound site, and the mobilization of flaps often causes ischemic damage, wound secretions, and necrosis of adjacent skin and soft tissue tissues.

To lower the risk of postoperative lung injury following pleurectomy and to evaluate the impact on the oncological outcome, we performed a prospective randomized trial in which we compared lobectomy for PPE of lung cancer with pneumonectomy following intrapleural instillation of 12.5 ml of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Patients and Methods From Oct 2014 to Jan 2016, 84 patients with lung cancer and symptomatic malignant pleural effusion randomized to either pneumonectomy or lobectomy combined with tPA were included in this study. Thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed followed by intraoperative instillation of 12.5 ml of tPA. Postoperative radiotherapy was administered to 38 patients and chemotherapy was administered to 18 patients with stage IIIa disease. Lung function tests were repeated after 3 and 6 month follow\u2010up and compared with the preoperative values. Results The baseline characteristics were balanced in the two groups. The number of adverse events was similar in the two groups. There were no deaths. Lung function tests demonstrated an expected decline following pulmonary resection without a difference between the two groups. The median survival duration and disease free survival were 14.1 months and 18.8 months respectively with no significant difference between the groups. Lung function declined in both groups without a difference. Conclusion Intrapleural instillation of tPA does not seem to affect postoperative lung function or survival in lobectomy for lung cancer. Lung resection following tPA instillation is a safe procedure and may be used to facilitate pleurectomy or lobectomy of lung cancer.",
            "It's like a dream come true for you, but what are the main objectives of the study? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground/Introduction. Intrapleural administration of fibrinolytic agents is used to treat unilateral pleural effusions, mainly in patients with malignant pleural effusions or chronic pleural effusions. However, the use of fibrinolytics in the management of pleural infection is controversial regarding the risk of intrapleural bleeding. In addition, the optimal dose and the optimal duration of treatment are not well established. Objective. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a low dose of intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the management of parapneumonic pleural infection. Methods. This is an observational study, conducted in the Pleural Diseases Service of the Dr. Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez General Hospital of the Mexican Institute of Social Security. It included 20 patients of both sexes, between 18 and 65 years of age, with parapneumonic pleural effusion and pleural infection. Patients were randomized into two groups, with 10 patients in each. Group A: 2.5 mg of tPA; group B: 10 mg of tPA. Both were treated with 25 mg of fibrin glue for 15 days. The primary outcome measure was the mortality rate, and the secondary outcome measures were the incidence of bleeding complications and hospital stay. Results. We did not observe any deaths in Group A or Group B. However, there is a difference in the number of incidences of bleeding complications as well as hospital stay. Group B showed two cases of bleeding complications compared to only one in Group A (p > 0.05). In addition, the hospital stay in Group B was 33.17 \u00b1 15.86 days versus 26.9 \u00b1 11.75 days in Group A (p = 0.0209). Conclusion. The treatment of a low dose of intrapleural tPA at 2.5 mg is safe and efficient in patients with parapneumonic pleural infection. Conclusion. The low dose of tPA (2.5 mg) is a safe and effective alternative for the management of parapneumonic pleural infection. (Figure presented"

For such systems, dismembered pyeloplasty is often needed but has a long\u2010term failure rate of about 30%. We describe a case series of patients with duplex systems treated by endoscopic repair of the anastomosis via a pigtail approach. Materials and Methods: From 2009 to 2017, six patients with large ureteral duplex systems with proximal anastomotic stenosis and reflux were treated by endoscopic repair of the anastomosis via a pigtail approach. This approach uses the renal pelvis of the upper moiety as a guide to repair the obstruction. Preoperative evaluation included diagnostic intravenous urography, cystoscopy, voiding cystourethrogram, and renal scintigraphy. All patients underwent a ureteroscopic anastomotic repair via a pigtail approach. Results: Six patients were treated with endoscopic repair ranging from age 12 to 42 with a mean age of 23.5 years. Sites of the obstruction were located at the pelviureteric junction on the lower moiety (n = 5) and the pelviureteric anastomosis on the upper moiety (n = 1). The mean follow\u2010up duration was 12 months (range 3 to 60 months). There have not been any recurrences. Conclusions: Endoscopic repair of a duplex system offers a less invasive solution to treating patients with large ureteral duplex systems.

To clarify, would you like the Snoezelen-Based Occupational Therapy intervention to involve a sensory room design that includes a variety of stimuli and promotes active participation by the person using it? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nDementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes considerable cognitive impairment, especially in the areas of memory and executive function. It is characterized by difficulties with communication, personal care, and problem-solving. This cognitive decline can lead to behavioral and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, depression, aggressiveness, sleep disturbances, and wandering. As a consequence, people with dementia and their caregivers suffer from a high burden of disease, which has serious negative consequences for their quality of life and is a significant problem for the German health care system. With a steadily aging population, it is essential to develop new strategies to deal with this challenging situation. In recent years, a new approach to intervention has been developed: Snoezelen rooms, also known as Multisensory Environments (MSE), are designed to create a calm and relaxing environment with various sensory stimuli (auditory, visual, tactile, etc.). These stimuli aim to improve the person's attention span, reduce restlessness and anxiety, and enhance relaxation. The Snoezelen intervention can last up to two hours each day (including 20-minute check-ins every hour) and should be administered several times a week to people with dementia. The Snoezelen system has been developed to include a variety of stimuli and activities that can be individually tailored to the person's needs and preferences. Preliminary studies have shown positive effects of Snoezelen on cognitive performance, mood, and general well-being in older adults and people with dementia. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Snoezelen-based intervention on reducing agitation, depression, aggression, sleep disturbances, and wandering in people with dementia. \n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvidence-Based, Individualized, Snoezelen Room Intervention (SIRI-E)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDementia, Behavioral and Psychiatric Symptoms of Dementia, Alzheimer Disease, Agitation in Al",

This is a pilot study and results will be used to design a future research study with a more diverse participant population, and the aim of this study is not to focus on a specific patient group or therapeutic goal.

Pancreatitis is a serious condition that can cause significant injury to the pancreas. It is estimated that it affects about 30,000 patients in Japan every year. The current standard of care for pancreatitis is inadequate and patients often experience serious complications, including organ failure. The newly developed method we are evaluating in this study is believed to be more effective than the current standard of care. This trial is an open-label, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the newly developed methods. A total of 60 patients with pancreatitis will be enrolled in the trial. Each patient will be randomized into one of two groups. Those who are assigned to the experimental group will receive the newly developed methods for 30 minutes each day for 3 days, while those in the control group will receive current standard of care. The primary outcome will be the change in pancreatic enzyme levels, which will be measured at baseline and 24 hours after treatment. Secondary outcomes include symptoms related to pancreatic exacerbation, inflammatory markers, liver function tests, and patient satisfaction. We hope that the results of this trial will provide much-needed evidence for the effectiveness of the newly developed methods in the treatment of pancreatitis.

The study aim at comparing the long-term outcomes and complication rates between arthroscopic and open surgical lateral ankle procedures for hallux rigidus. Patients with primary hallux rigidus and primary hallux valgus were randomized into two groups. Ankle arthrodesis or first metatarsal osteotomy was chosen as indications for arthroscopic and open surgery. The post-operative follow-up period was six months, and was further divided into three time points. A standardized clinical evaluation by the same assessor was performed, and clinical outcomes and complication rates were compared.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHallux rigidus and hallux valgus are the most common forefoot pathologies, and surgical treatment of these are common in clinical practice. Since arthroscopic surgery is less invasive than open surgery, and has the potential for lower postoperative pain, earlier functional recovery, and shorter hospitalization, many studies have demonstrated a trend for arthroscopic surgery to become more widely used in the treatment of hallux rigidus and hallux valgus. However, a recent randomized controlled study found that arthroscopic surgery for hallux rigidus was associated with increased postoperative complications, and recommended that open procedures should be emphasized. This study has been criticized, since the surgical procedure for arthroscopic surgery was not fully described. In the meantime, many studies on arthroscopic and open surgical procedures for hallux rigidus and hallux valgus have shown that the operative procedure used was an important factor in the results. Due to these circumstances, the effect evaluation of current arthroscopic procedures for hallux rigidus and hallux valgus and the evaluation of open surgical methods was insufficient. Therefore, our study aims to perform an adequately large study comparing the outcomes between open and arthroscopic procedures. A total of 320 patients with symptomatic Hallux rigidus and/or Hallux valgus deformities will be enrolled.",

We will use the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), Posttraumatic Stress Checklist (PCL), and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) to assess the severity and impact of chronic pain, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and PTSD-related symptoms in clinic employees.

However, there is limited research on the interaction between chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients treated in primary care. In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on integrated care approaches to addressing chronic pain and PTSD. These approaches often involve the use of a stepped care model, which aims to provide patients with the most appropriate level of care based on their individual needs. To date, there is no consensus on the most effective mode of integrated care for chronic pain and PTSD, and there is a need for research to determine the optimal approach. Furthermore, it is not clear how this integrated care approach would be implemented in primary care. A growing body of research has indicated the importance of understanding providers' perspectives on chronic pain management. This is particularly important in the context of primary care, where providers are often responsible for managing patients with multiple comorbidities. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the potential for provider burnout and turnover, particularly in the field of primary care. As such, it is important to understand how providers view their role in managing patients with chronic pain and PTSD, and to identify factors that may contribute to burnout and turnover. Such knowledge could",

Since it's an observational study, there won't be a specific intervention, but we'll focus on gathering perspectives and insights from individuals experiencing co-occurring chronic pain and PTSD. Their experiences will provide valuable insights into patient-reported outcomes, coping strategies, and quality of life. What are your thoughts on this? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether two different types of neuromodulation - transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and acupuncture - are both effective in treating chronic non-cancer related back pain.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study compares two pain treatments for patients with chronic low back pain to see which one works better. The primary goal is to find out if either TENS or acupuncture is more effective at reducing pain, and the secondary goal is to see which treatment is more effective at improving functional mobility and quality of life for patients with non-cancer related back pain. Investigators also want to find out which interventions patients prefer. The study is randomized and the participants will not know which intervention they are randomly assigned for until after the screening process is finished. Participants receive one of the two treatments, for which they are blinded to which of the two treatments they receive. The treatment is given for 10 minutes every time and 5 consecutive days per week for three weeks. Follow up interviews are conducted after two, four, and ten weeks, and the patients will be asked what treatment they think they received and if the outcomes differ between treatments.

This open randomized trial was conducted from February 2020 to August 2020. Patients who were diagnosed with hemiplegia after stroke by the diagnostic criteria of the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association were included in the group. In the group, the experimental group performed gait training with a standing technique on parallel bars and the control group performed gait training without a standing technique. If the patient can stand independently after rehabilitation treatment, they can walk freely on the floor. But patients who have a hard time standing after gait training cannot walk independently. Stabilization, trunk extension, and gait training were performed for seven days each week at one session a day until the 3 rd week. For safety, there was no re-injury of the lower limbs during gait training and no adverse events such as fracture and dislocation. \n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\nAge older than 19 years old\nPatients diagnosed with cerebral infarction or hemorrhage by the diagnostic criteria of the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association \nExperienced a first stroke \nAble to stand up from sitting and walk independently with support at least 5 m before stroke\nCan walk about 10 m without support from the first day of stroke rehabilitation. \nAn able to sit on a stool in an upright position with a hip flexion angle of 30-90\u00b0 in the first day of stroke rehabilitation.\nAn able to open and close both legs, and the angle between the thighs and legs is about 45\u00b0- 90\u00b0 in lying and sitting positions. \nAble to walk with a knee extension angle of 0-70\u00b0\nAble to extend the trunk and pelvis"

If that\u2019s the case, congratulations, and please keep in mind that you will need to register the larger trial on ClinicalTrials.gov and on an appropriate national registry (for example, the WHO-UMC Trial Registration Data Set).\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of a 3\u2010week internet\u2010based cognitive behavioural intervention (iCBT) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on symptom severity.BACKGROUND AND THEORICAL RATION: IBS is a chronic relapsing condition with a median remission length of 52 weeks. There is a need for treatments with long\u2010term effects on the disease.iCBT for chronic pain is an effective treatment, but the efficacy of iCBT for IBS has not been examined. There is evidence to suggest that the mechanism of pain reduction after iCBT for chronic pain is similar to IBS, and that the same concept could be applied for IBS. METHOD: Twenty IBS patients were randomized into two groups: (1) intervention (n=10) or (2) waiting list control (n=10). The intervention lasted 3 weeks and included 6 sessions of iCBT. The primary outcome was change in symptom severity (IBS Severity Score), secondary outcomes were IBS\u2010related Quality of Life, pain catastrophizing, psychological distress, disability and stress reactivity.RESULTS: All 20 patients were reached for follow\u2010up, which increased the attrition rate from 20 to 50%. Both the baseline and long\u2010term dropout rates for iCBT were higher than the current estimate for psychological treatments for IBS. The study showed strong preliminary evidence that iCBT improves IBS symptom severity. Improvements in IBS symptom severity, IBS\u2010related Quality of Life and pain catastrophizing were maintained at 18 weeks.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirm that it is feasible to conduct an RCT of iCBT among IBS patients. iCBT may be a potentially effective treatment for IBS.\n\nThe study is",

Now, could you please provide me with any additional information such as primary and secondary objectives for your trial? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Lymphoma survivors (LS), including those treated with high\u2010dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell reinfusion (HSCT), suffer long\u2010term impairments in cardiac function and physical activity. Exercise is recommended to improve cardiovascular function and reduce cancer mortality in LS. METHODS: This 6\u2010month, randomized controlled study will determine the effects of a low\u2010moderate intensity aerobic (LMA\u2010HIIT) exercise program versus standard of care on peak VO2, exercise capacity, cardiac function, and cardiorespiratory fitness in LS treated with HSCT. The LMA\u2010HIIT program will include walking, cycling, and light resistance exercises at an intensity of 55%\u201365% peak VO2 and 50%\u201360% of HRR peak. We hypothesize that a structured exercise program designed for the lymphoma population with a relatively high intensity interval will improve peak VO2, improve exercise capacity, and improve cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiac function in LS treated with HSCT. This study will also assess how HRR is affected by exercise. Additionally, health\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL) will be assessed before and after the study completion. Primary objective: The aim of the study is to determine (1) if an individually\u2010based LMA\u2010HIIT exercise program improves peak VO2, (2) if an individually\u2010based LMA\u2010HIIT exercise program improves HRQoL, (3) if an individually\u2010based LMA\u2010HIIT exercise program improves cardiovascular fitness, (4) how autonomic modulation is altered by exercise in LS treated with HSCT. Secondary objective: Participants will be monitored with an EKG for any changes in the resting or the exercise heart rate variability (HRV, ms). Additionally, the effect of exercise on ejection fraction will be analyzed. Tertiary objective: The tertiary objectives in this study include: (1) the change of heart rate recovery (HRR ms) in LS treated with HSCT (2",

Can you please provide me with the details? \n\nAbstract:\nThis paper presents the development and internal validation of an assessment tool, the Self\u2010Regulatory Functioning Questionnaire (SRFQ), which is a behavior\u2010based performance measure in clinical populations, valid in the Czech language. SRFQ focuses on self\u2010regulation of individuals' behavior and consists of 22 items reflecting 4 dimensions of self\u2010regulation (metacognitive, motivational, volitional, and decisional). The questionnaire was administered to 906 clinically depressed participants, who were treated with either cognitive therapy or pharmacotherapy in a 12\u2010week randomized controlled trial. Internal consistency coefficients were moderate (ranging from .57 to .84). The scale showed satisfactory discriminative and predictive validity.

Exercise is associated with improved physical outcomes in patients with cancer, including lower disease-specific and all-cause mortality, yet only 20-30% of cancer survivors meet the recommended physical activity guidelines. Given the large number of cancer patients, many with chronic diseases such as cancer, high-quality exercise programmes are necessary for both patients' well-being and for the reduction of cancer-specific mortality. Aim(s):The aim of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of a cancer patient tailored exercise initiative.Who can participate?Adults diagnosed with cancer who are able to read and understand English and have access to a smartphone.What does the study involve?Once patients agree to participate in the study, a member of the research team will establish communication via email, and the initial questionnaire assessing fitness levels will be sent via email. At the end of the questionnaire, the first training session (face-to-face) will be scheduled at the UST Cancer Centre. The first training session will take approximately two hours and the patient will be assessed by our research team, receive a basic exercise programme and be invited to three supervised exercise sessions offered weekly for a period of four weeks. The supervised phase will be followed by an unsupervised phase, during which participants will perform the exercise program prescribed to them. Participants will be encouraged to record their training activities in this phase of the study, and a researcher will check in with them at the end of each week.

            "Great! Let me further explain the rationale behind measuring e' and VTI parameters in the study. \nThe E' parameter is a measure of cardiac output and is calculated from the Doppler signal of the mitral annulus. It reflects the contractility of the left ventricle (LV) and is an important indicator of LV health. Red blood cell transfusion can lead to a decrease in blood viscosity, which can have a positive effect on cardiac output. VTI, or velocity-time integral, is a measure of stroke volume and is determined by the mean velocity of the mitral blood column (V) and the time of the QRS complex (T). E' and VTI parameters are, therefore, closely linked and can be used together to assess the impact of red blood cell transfusion on cardiac output. \nBy measuring E' and VTI parameters in the post-intervention period, we can evaluate whether red blood cell transfusion results in changes in cardiac output, and ultimately the effectiveness of the intervention on anemic patients. \nOverall, the experimental arm design and the parameters to be measured (E', VTI, and others) should help us to evaluate the impact of red blood cell transfusion on the cardiovascular system in anemic patients in the emergency department.",

            "Thank you for providing these details. It seems like a comprehensive approach targeted at managing dental anxiety.\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nMany dental patients experience some degree of anxiety or fear about dental treatment. It can range from mild jitters to such severe anxiety that it makes it impossible for them to receive dental care. Dental anxiety can lead to dental visits being avoided, which can lead to poor oral hygiene and serious oral health problems. In addition, many oral health problems are treatable if detected early. However, patients avoid dental visits due to anxiety, which can result in severe oral health problems, especially among children and adolescents in developing countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective methods to help individuals with dental anxiety receive dental care. We propose a randomized clinical trial to investigate the effect of behavioral therapeutic techniques on reducing dental anxiety among patients undergoing dental treatment. Our proposed intervention uses Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which consists of two procedures. The first is Relaxation Breathing, which involves controlling the breath, and the second is Muscle Relaxation, which involves controlling the muscles. Both procedures will be used for patients in the intervention group.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe primary objective of this randomized clinical trial is to investigate the effect of behavioral therapeutic techniques (CBT) on dental anxiety among patients undergoing dental treatment. The study will be conducted on 75 patients aged 18-30 years from government dental office in Baghdad-Iraq who will be randomly assigned to two groups: intervention group and control group. Patients in the intervention group will undergo Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) by adopting CBT components (Distraction technique and Mindfulness technique). Patients in the control group will undergo conventional therapy used by the researcher. The behavioral intervention will involve using distraction techniques to interrupt the anxiety-generating cycle. These techniques may involve playing music to distract the patient or providing oral numbing agents. The outcome of this study will be based on the Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) and pain intensity scores on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). DAS will measure changes in anxiety levels before and after the intervention, while VAS will measure changes in pain levels before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis will be used to compare the two groups",

In this phase II, 140 patients with rectal cancer who meet our screening criteria (cT1-2N0M0 primary tumor at colonoscopy) will be included in our study. Patients will be divided equally into experimental and control groups, with 70 patients in each group. Patients in the control group will receive standard colonoscopy, while those in the experimental group will also be asked to undergo an additional examination with new devices.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPatients presenting to our center for routine scheduled colon inspections and who meet the inclusion criteria (cT1-2N0M0 primary tumor at colonoscopy) will be asked to participate in the study. Participants will be enrolled into the Control and Experimental groups by non-probability sampling, and the total number of participants will not exceed 140. Participants will be asked to sign inform consent and complete a questionnaire. The first part of the questionnaire will collect participant information related to the questionnaire. Colonoscopy is not a diagnostic tool for early detection of cancer, but it is currently the standard technology used for screening and early detection of colorectal neoplasia. Colonoscopy is also used to examine patients with a history of hemorrhoids, bloody bowel movements, or unexplained black stool as part of routine medical care. When the colonoscope is used for biopsy or removal of polyps, the procedure can detect early cancer. If there is no risk of rectal cancer, routine outpatient colonoscopy will be cancelled. Otherwise, the participant will undergo colonoscopy before inclusion in the study. No medications will be used during the procedure, and the procedure will be stopped at the location of the adenoma or polyps. In the control group, participants will be invited to participate in a 5-year follow-up visit after the colonoscopy. The diagnostic stethoscope will not be used in the control group. Only when bow",

Is there any question regarding the study design? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Previously, a multi\u2010center, prospective, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind, trial demonstrated that high\u2010dose dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has a beneficial effect on cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Given that the clinical picture of AD can sometimes be accompanied by apathy, we decided to test whether DHEA could be used to treat apathy as well as cognitive dysfunction in subjects with AD. Methods: We included 52 patients (32 women and 20 men) with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate Alzheimer's disease who were randomly assigned to receive either 200 mg dehydroepiandrosterone or placebo at morning rise and at night from baseline until month 6.

Results: We found statistically significant differences between the treatment group and placebo group as assessed by the ADAS\u2010cog (p = 0.04; \u03c1, 0.345), the ADCS\u2010ADC (p = 0.03; \u03c1, 0.399), and the AES (p = 0.02; \u03c1, \u20100.428) in favor of a beneficial effect of DHEA. None of the other clinical tests was able to detect a difference between treatment groups.

The study will be conducted at three sites in Burkina Faso: CNHU-HKM, H\u00f4pital Saint Jean de Dieu - Boko, and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Yalgado Ou\u00e9draogo. A total of 600 participants will be enrolled in the study based on their inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants in the study will have their blood drawn at a routine blood culture in accordance with national guidelines for blood culture and clinical management. The results of the blood culture will be compared to the BactInsight turbidimeter result to determine its diagnostic performance. This study will aid in developing a blood culture monitoring strategy that is more precise and efficient for Burkina Faso's patients, which could contribute to the country's health system's reduction of severe bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients.\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nWe propose to assess the BactiRadTM BactInsight turbidimeter as a new tool for blood culture surveillance in a real-world point-of-care laboratory setting. There is an urgent need for automated blood culture monitoring technology that not only provides earlier blood culture alerts but also a reliable and reproducible technology.

In this retrospective study, we aim to determine the impact of post-wash total motile sperm count (TMSC) on the pregnancy rate of patients undergoing IUI treatment. We propose to conduct a retrospective study including 180 patients undergoing IUI treatment between 1/1/2020 and 1/1/2023. In this study, the post-wash TMSC will be measured, and the sperm dose for insemination will be determined according to the standard treatment protocols. The primary outcome will be the pregnancy rate, which will be compared between patients with different post-wash TMSC. Secondary outcomes will include the pregnancy rate in each cycle, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate. By analyzing the data, we hope to provide evidence-based guidance for clinicians in optimizing treatment protocols for patients undergoing IUI treatment.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nFactors That Influence Post-wash Total Motile Sperm Count in Intrauterine Insemination Treatment\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nInfertility\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Aged 20-40 and diagnosed with infertility for at least 6 months Patients undergoing I",

Your insights have helped us to refine our criteria and improve the study design, which will ultimately enhance our ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. We look forward to incorporating your recommendations into our study procedures.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: As an important cardiovascular disease risk factor, obesity is closely related to the development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Previous studies have shown that body mass index (BMI) can be used to assess the risk of MACE. However, the relationship between BMI and MACE is still unclear. Materials and methods: We included 1,546 patients with major adverse cardiovascular events from the CARDS study and divided them into groups based on BMI. The relationship between BMI and risk of MACE was analyzed using logistic regression. Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with a higher BMI had a higher risk of MACE (odds ratio: 1.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.05\u20101.19; p < 0.001). The relationship between BMI and risk of MACE was not modified by age, sex or history of hypertension or diabetes. Conclusions: Higher BMI was associated with an increased risk of MACE, independent of age, sex and other cardiovascular risk factors.",

To establish the degree of cardiac autonomic denervation, measurements of stimulation\u2010induced changes of blood pressure (BP) and HR during 111I\u2010metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy are required. The aim of the study was to compare the measurements of stimulation\u2010induced changes of BP and HR using the S2\u2010cardio\u2010accelerator reflex with 111I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy to the results of cardiac angiography. Five patients with symptomatic autonomic dysfunction, three with clinically manifest cardiovascular disease and four healthy subjects were included in this study. One hundred and 80 mg of pentazocine was injected within 33 s and scintigraphic images of the heart and its major vessels were recorded for 15 min. The degree of sympathetic neuron damage after repeated injection of pentazocine was compared with the extent of aortic and coronary artery stenosis found during angiography. Significant increase in HR after pentazocine injection resulted in a higher degree of autonomic denervation in cardiac autonomic dysfunction patients than in patients with cardiovascular disease (p < 0.001). This increase was also observed in healthy subjects (p < 0.05). However, no difference was seen when the results obtained with the S2\u2010cardio\u2010accelerator and those with angiography were compared. Therefore the results of pentazocine S2\u2010test are not affected by anatomical changes of the aorta and coronary arteries.",

            "Interventional? Interesting. This seems to be something new. What kind of intervention are you planning? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: There has been an increase in the number and diversity of patient\u2010centered outcomes (PCS) measurement instruments. An overview of commonly used instruments and methodological weaknesses, can guide researchers in the selection and development of PCS instruments that can inform clinical decision\u2010making and facilitate improved patient outcomes. Objectives: To identify and describe the most common PCS measurement instruments published in oncology and provide a systematic overview of their content, methodological qualities, use in practice and key limitations. Data Sources: An exhaustive database of oncology PCS measures was populated from relevant articles published between 2009 and 2018. Methods: The instrument type, number of items and psychometric properties of each instrument were abstracted, and each was mapped to 1 of 12 core domains (symptoms, physical functioning, social functioning, emotional functioning, pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, nausea and emesis, nutritional impact, body image, sexual functioning and information\u2010seeking behaviors). The extent to which instruments included multiple items across core domains and the methodological quality of the instruments were assessed. Results: Of 708 instruments identified, 284 are classified as PROMs. The total length of PCS measures ranges from short single\u2010item instruments to 38\u2010item instruments. Items in PCS measures vary in their representation of the 12 core clinical domains. Commonly used PCS measures for overall symptom distress and symptom management include the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ), the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). Conclusion: This review highlights gaps in oncology PCS measures, particularly in areas such as sexual functioning, information\u2010seeking behaviors and body image. Researchers should systematically evaluate whether selected outcomes have the appropriate construct for their proposed research question and are able to accurately address the target content. Researchers should also consider using available instruments, and should develop new instruments to measure outcomes and domains with limited availability of measures.",

A prospective observational study by Chang et al. (2020) assessed the association between the number of injections of anti-VEGFs, including aflibercept, and the risk of infectious and noninfectious complications in patients with wet AMD. This study found that each subsequent anti-VEGF injection may reduce the risk of severe ocular complications when compared with those following the first anti-VEGF injection. However, it is important to note that not all injections of aflibercept result in immediate vision improvements. The injections can also induce transient inflammation of the eye, resulting in irritation, foreign body sensation, eye pain, redness, and blurred or distorted vision. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the safety of each aflibercept injection by continuously observing for the development of complications such as intraocular inflammation and suspected endophthalmitis.\nAim:\nThe proposed non-interventional study aims to continuously observe for the development of intraocular inflammation and suspected endophthalmitis among patients receiving aflibercept injections over a period of eight years (2014-2022). By providing continuous intraocular inflammation and suspected endophthalmitis risk assessment for patients receiving aflibercept injections, this study will provide information that can help optimize treatment outcomes and inform clinical practice and decision-making.\nMethods:\nThe study design is a retrospective, non",

Although bariatric surgery has proved to be the most effective treatment option for obese patients, its potential complications and risk of failure are high. Therefore, minimally invasive and cost\u2010effective obesity treatment methods, such as pharmacotherapy, are becoming more popular. The oral \u03b2\u20103 adrenergic receptor agonist ZD1839 has been shown to cause weight loss in preclinical models and in obese patients with increased adrenergic tone (e.g. patients with untreated hypertension). Aims: We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ZD1839 in obese patients. Methods: In this phase II, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial, 44 patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 and at least one obesity\u2010related comorbid condition were recruited from the outpatient diabetes clinic.

They were divided into two groups depending on which side of the body they suffered from the onset. For pain symptoms, a visual analogue scale (VAS) and for functional status, Temporomandibular functional index (TMJ\u201011) were used. The two groups were then treated with traction therapy, and pain and function were compared before and after treatment. RESULTS: In this study, both groups showed pain relief in the second evaluation and a significant (p<0.03) improvement was observed in TMJ\u201011 in the right side, which was greater than in the left side (92.8 vs. 95.0 in the second evaluation). There was no significant difference (p = 0.62) found in the improvement of TMJ\u201011 between the patients who were treated soon (more than a week after onset) and late (more than 1 month). No significant difference was also observed in the duration of onset for the improvement of pain (p = 0.110) and function (p = 0.183).

They were initially considered to be among the safest of drugs because they were relatively non-dependent and non-addictive.

Therefore, we recommend a low dosage of L-Phenylalanine, such as 300mg/day. This amount is considered safe for pregnant women and those of childbearing potential, and has been shown to have no adverse effects in healthy adults. To reduce the risk of neurotoxicity, we will start with a low dose of L-Phenylalanine and slowly increase it over time, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This will allow us to monitor any potential adverse effects and adjust the dosage accordingly. \n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Purpose:: Diagnostic\nPhase:: Not applicable\nIntervention Model:: Parallel\nBlinding/Masking:: Open\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: Dietary Supplement\nIntervention Description:: The participants will be divided into two groups.

Will you measure it using the same method as the reference group? And secondly, what is the formulation of the supplement? Will you use a capsule, tablet, or liquid? \n [B]elow are the answers to those questions: For the genetic carrier group, the dose of phenylalanine supplementation will be calculated based on the participant's body weight (kg) and adjusted to a maximum dose of 100 mg of phenylalanine per kilogram of body weight. The supplement will be taken as per the study protocol, which will be provided at the first visit. If any adverse events are noted during the study, the dosage may be adjusted by the research team.

We examined cardiovascular outcomes at 15 years in 747 patients randomly assigned to these three treatment groups and compared with the 904 control patients with type 1 diabetes who had received neither growth hormone nor oral hypoglycemic agents.RESULTS: Cardiovascular risk among those in the growth hormone groups (n = 239) and the control group (n = 904) did not differ significantly at 15 years. The estimated prevalence of hypertension in the growth hormone groups and the control group was 8%, 8%, and 7%, respectively (P = 0.74). The estimated low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol averages in the growth hormone groups and the control group after 9 years were 3.19 mmol/L (124 mg/dL) and 3.21 mmol/L (126 mg/ dL), respectively; high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was 1.48 mmol/L (58 mg/dL) in all three groups. The estimated prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in the growth hormone groups and the control group was 40%, 42%, and 35%, respectively (P = 0.52). In multivariate regression analyses, total cholesterol was significantly higher among those in the growth hormone group receiving insulin pumps, but diastolic blood pressure was lower when insulin pumps were used in all groups.CONCLUSIONS: Early growth hormone therapy did not increase cardiovascular risk compared with diabetes control alone."

Have you considered the ethical considerations and the feasibility of the proposed study design? \n\nAbstract:\nThis prospective randomized single\u2010blind study investigated whether the antimicrobial effect of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is compromised due to the presence of an amalgam interface barrier. Three hundred extracted human wisdom teeth were divided into 3 groups: 100 samples treated with 1% NaOCl and 3.5% H2O2 for 10 min (group 1), 100 samples treated with 1% NaOCl and 3.5% H2O2 for 10 min and then stored in 5% sodium thiosulfate for 1 min (group 2) and 100 samples stored in 5% sodium thiosulfate for 1 min and not irrigated (group 3). Subsequently, these treated samples were then divided into 2 new groups by amalgam interface barrier (10 samples). The amalgam interface layer was removed and 2 mL was added of the test fluid and the remaining fluid from the first group was added to group 1. The reduction in colony counts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans in groups 1 and 2 were 100% and 90\u201096%, respectively. We believe our study showed a reduction in the bacterial density of Enterococcus faecalis in the irrigated samples with or without the amalgam interface barrier. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the additional use of 5% sodium thiosulfate led to an insignificant decrease in antibacterial activity.",

In Canada, the prevalence of anxiety is even higher, with 15.8% of Canadians diagnosed with anxiety disorders in 2020. Although the COVID\u201019 pandemic has led to an increase in anxiety, few studies have investigated the specific effects of the pandemic on anxiety symptoms. Objective This retrospective chart review aims to examine the effects of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on anxiety symptoms of patients attending a psychotherapy center between January 2020 and March 2022. Methods Between January 2020 and March 2022, a total of 603 patients (age range: 15\u201045 years) who attended the psychotherapy center were randomly selected for the study. Data on age, sex, socioeconomic status, location, level of anxiety (PHQ\u20108 and GAD\u20102 scores), and comorbid medical conditions were retrieved from the center's electronic medical records system. The levels of anxiety were then categorized using the PHQ\u20108 and GAD\u20102 scores (mild or moderate anxiety, moderate or severe anxiety, or severe anxiety). The study data is then analyzed using SPSS software using a chi\u2010square test to examine the effects of age, sex, socioeconomic status, location, level of anxiety, and comorbid medical conditions on the occurrence of anxiety. The level of anxiety was then compared across the study periods. For each outcome, odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals were reported. Results The results revealed that socioeconomic status, location of residence, and comorbid medical conditions significantly",

This will give us a better understanding of the effect of AVF and TCC on cardiac structure and function. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nEnd-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious and irreversible condition characterized by the loss of kidney function, which is responsible for the maintenance of bodily homeostasis. The prevalence of ESRD is rising globally, with an estimated 3.7 million people currently living with the condition. Management of ESRD involves various treatment options, including dialysis and renal transplantation. For patients receiving dialysis, a central problem is the high incidence of vascular access failure, requiring repeated vascular access procedures and surgical interventions to maintain access adequacy. Autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and transposed central vein (TCCV) grafts are two common surgical options. Although AVF has been the gold standard for vascular access construction, TCCV offers several advantages, including shorter surgical times and lower morbidity. Despite these advantages, no prospective clinical trials have been conducted to compare the success rate and other outcomes of TCCV versus AVF grafts in patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis. The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of TCCV versus AVF grafts in patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis by comparing the primary and secondary endpoints, including vascular access maturation time, dialysis-related complications, and patient outcome. The study's secondary objective is to determine the safety profile of TCCV versus AVF grafts. The results of this study will provide valuable clinical evidence to support the appropriate use of TCCV grafts in patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nEnd-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious and irreversible condition characterized by the loss of kidney function, requiring lifelong treatment with dialysis or kidney transplantation. In 2022, approximately 6% of the global population, or 470 million people, were in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Left unmanaged, these individuals are likely to progress to ESR",

The Before AVF establishment and After AVF establishment groups will both undergo the procedure: AVF, which involves the creation of a direct connection between an artery and a vein. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery, particularly in elderly patients. There is no effective strategy for preventing POD after cardiac surgery. Pneumatic compression device (PCD) may help maintain venous return, thus providing hemodynamic stability.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether PCD would reduce the incidence of POD compared with no intervention after cardiac surgery.METHODOLOGY: This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial including 136 patients aged \u226565 years undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control (C, intrinsic method of fluid maintenance); crystalloid (CX, PCD on both legs plus fluid resuscitation with crystalloids); and colloid (CQ, PCD plus fluid resuscitation with colloids). POD was defined as Richmond Agitation\u2010Sedation Scale score \u20101 or \u20102 at any time within 24 h postoperatively. Baseline variables and perioperative parameters were recorded. The cumulative incidence of POD in the three groups was compared.RESULTS: Thirty\u2010five patients developed POD (C, seven patients (14.6%); CX, zero patients (0%); CQ, 28 patients (52.6%); P\u00a0<\u00a00.001]. The number of fluid boluses (C, 136 [72%] versus CX, 62 [63%] versus CQ, 58 [48%], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and number of inotropic support (C, 21 (16%) versus CX, seven (8%) versus CQ, 34 (30%), P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were lower in the CX group compared to the C and CQ groups.CONCLUSION: Among patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, the PCD significantly reduces the risk of POD and the need for fluid resusc",

This will provide valuable information on the prevention of left atrial enlargement through appropriate vascular access. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis is an exploratory, prospective, single center, interventional, case-control study designed to compare long-term patency rate and clinical outcomes of different types and sites of arteriovenous (AV) fistulae in treating patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis in one tertiary hospital in China (affiliated hospital of the University of Guangzhou). The study will last for approximately 3 years.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSufficient blood flow is needed to satisfy hemodialysis requirements. It can be achieved by either autogenous fistula or synthetic dialysis graft. To date, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is regarded as the arteriovenous access (AVA) with the lowest long-term primary failure incidence. Therefore, the present study will focus on investigating the long-term patency outcomes and clinical outcomes of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) performed for patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on hemodialysis in one tertiary hospital in China (affiliated hospital of the University of Guangzhou). It will consist of two stages. The first stage will be to investigate and design the procedure of the study, and the second stage will be to collect data and follow-up regularly. Before data collection, an ethical approval will be obtained according to the ethical principles defined in the Helsinki Protocol and the Declaration of 1975. The primary endpoint of this study will be the long-term patency rate of AVFs. Secondary endpoints of this study will be primary failure incidence, postoperative complications, and clinical outcomes.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nProspective Case-control Study on Long-term Patency and Clinical Outcomes of Different Types and Locations of AVF in Patients With CRF Undergoing HD\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nChronic Renal Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure: Arteriovenous fistula\n* Procedure:",

            "Yes, exactly! The Atrial fibrillation group and the Non atrial fibrillation group will both undergo the procedure of AVF. This subgroup analysis will provide valuable information on the potential link between AVF and atrial fibrillation. \n\nAbstract:\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the establishment of an AVF and changes in left atrial volume, intracardiac echo tissue Doppler (TDI) and occurrence of atrial fibrillation in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients. Methods: The AVF subgroup analysis of the Dialysis Artery\u2010Patient Outcome study (DAPO\u2010AVF) was retrospectively analyzed. The population was a subset of randomized AVF patients with echocardiographic parameters before and after AVF establishment. The endpoint included left atrial volume index (LAVI), left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF), and TDI. A total of 85 (55.3%) patients who developed new atrial fibrillation from the whole group of 154 patients were assigned to the Atrial Fibrillation group, while the remaining 70 (44.7%) were assigned to the Non\u2010Atrial Fibrillation group. Results: In the Atrial Fibrillation group, LAVI (34.15 \u00b1 18.60 mL/m2 vs. 38.03 \u00b1 19.40 mL/m2, p = 0.126) and TDI (0.80 \u00b1 0.17 cm/s vs. 0.77 \u00b1 0.09 cm/s, p = 0.185) was not significantly different between the two groups. The Non\u2010Atrial Fibrillation group had a greater decrease in LAVI (35.75 \u00b1 18.61 mL/m2 vs. 41.25 \u00b1 19.26 mL/m2, p = 0.048) after AVF establishment compared to the Atrial Fibrillation group. LAVI was significantly larger in the Atrial Fibrillation group preoperatively (40.07 \u00b1 20.08 mL/m2 vs. 3",

A review article published in 2018 investigated reasons for low PCa genetic testing uptake in a survey of 480 men, and the most common reason was a fear of finding out information that might cause negative consequences, such as health insurance difficulties or emotional distress.

Anecdotal reports of neurologic injury are frequent but have not been systematically collected. Our objective was to determine the incidence of neurologic injury during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it to that of usual seasonal influenza. We conducted a retrospective, case report study of patients with symptomatic COVID-19 infection who presented to medical care from 12 February 2020 through 24 May 2020. We also identified patients hospitalized by physicians on the Johns Hopkins Hospital inpatient neurology service in the months of February and May during the usual influenza season in 2019. We studied the incidence of neurologic symptoms and the prevalence of neurologic complications in the SARS-CoV-2 and influenza cohorts, as well as the incidence of encephalopathy and encephalitis in these cohorts. We estimated the rates of death and serious infection complications for the COVID-19 population. The SARS-CoV-2 cohort had severe respiratory disease and a lower rate of neurologic complications and encephalopathies of 1.8% and 0.1% respectively. However, all patients with stroke, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, and meningoencephalitis were part of this cohort. A total of 109 patients with COVID-19 were infected with influenza virus. These patients had a similar rate of neurologic complications (1.8%), with fewer cases of encephalopathy (0.9%), encephalitis (0.0%), stroke (0.1%), and myelitis (0.0%). The SARS-CoV-2 cohort had higher rates of serious infection complications including septic shock, and invasive mechanical ventilation. There were no new on",

The ACE study was based on the hypothesis that positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) will reduce coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), diminish cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and produce more intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) than positive-pressure airway (PPA) in patients receiving CPR (3). Furthermore, many investigators have demonstrated that PPV can produce ICH and acute neurological deterioration in patients with cardiac arrest (4,5), and that PPV may adversely affect CPR quality (6). Thus, the ACE study suggests that the technique for administering PPV during CPR is as important as administering PPV in order to minimize CPP fall and the potentially lethal consequences for both cerebral and cardiac function. \n\nStudy design\n=================\nMulticentre, randomised controlled trial.\n\nStudy population\n=================\n1440 patients >\u200918\u00a0years of age in 45\u00a0hospitals in three countries.\n\nSchedule and interventions\n=================\nCPR was given either with a PPA or with a PPV at a maximum airway pressure of 20 cmH2O.

All participants will fill out questionnaires and will have two visits to the hospital at the beginning of the study. This will be at 6 to 8 weeks and at the end of the study, after 42 weeks of treatment. The study participation time for each participant will be approximately 9 months to 1 year.The questionnaires will ask the participants about their asthma symptoms and medications used, as well as questions about their life and demographic data. The second visit is a routine hospital visit to check the participant's general health, as well as the level of lung function using spirometry. At the end of the study, both groups will continue with the treatment they have been given, either inhaled fluticasonal or a placebo, for 2 years.This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, which means that the participants will be randomly allocated to the two groups, and neither the participants nor the researchers know who is in which group. The use of inhaled fluticasonal or placebo will be decided by a randomization procedure, which is similar to drawing lots.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?Participating in the study will provide important information about the effectiveness of inhaled fluticasonal as a preventive therapy for asthma.

There is currently no therapeutic option to reverse lower extremity venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with inferior vena cava obstruction. METHODS: We treated 50 patients with acute inferior vena cava obstruction (IVCO) related to VTE with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt\u2010PA) infusion. Patients were followed up for eight weeks with serial duplex imaging. RESULTS: After a mean (SD) infusion duration of 14.7 (3.0) h, 40 patients (80%) achieved complete recanalization or near complete recanalization of the inferior vena cava within one month. The median time to recanalization was four days. After recanalization, 36 patients with IVCO experienced complete patency of their inferior vena cava, and eight patients (16%) experienced incomplete patency or residual stenosis. IVCO\u2010related symptoms were not relieved in nine patients in the group with incomplete patency or residual stenosis. There were no bleeding complications during thrombolytic therapy and two embolic events were observed. During subsequent follow\u2010up, deep vein thrombosis was observed in one patient from each group, and no recurrent IVCO in the remaining patients. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator infusion is effective and safe for acute inferior vena cava obstruction related to lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.\n\nIntroduction\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in 1\u20132 per 1000 person-years and a further 10\u201320% of patients will recur within 10 years . Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis is an infrequent but important complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with a prevalence of 1\u20133% . When inferior vena cava obstruction (IVCO) occurs, VTE-related symptoms are not relieved and venous hypertension may cause damage to the organs"

The objective is to describe the degree of impairment of patients with OA, according to the OMERACT\u2010OARSI criteria, and compare it with the perception of quality of life. Methodology: To participate in the investigation, a convenience sample of 210 individuals with a diagnosis of OA attending primary care services in a single region (Andalusia) is needed. Data collection will be carried out using a self\u2010reported questionnaire prepared specifically for this investigation. Patients with previous medical diagnosis of OA will be asked to reply to validated questionnaires (Harris Hip Score, HHS, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, WOMAC). Data will be tabulated and analyzed descriptively using SPSS 24 statistics package. Results: 210 subjects from the Andalusian public health system will be enrolled for this investigation. 81.9% of the participants are female, with a mean age of 69.3 \u00b1 10.3, mean time of evolution of the disease 9.6 \u00b1 3.8 years, and mean Harris Hip Score of 76.9 \u00b1 9.6.

            "Yes.\n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe overall objective of this study is to demonstrate the effects of exercise training in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in the neoadjuvant setting by evaluating tumor regression, systemic inflammatory response and cardiorespiratory fitness.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a standard treatment for patients with early breast cancer who are clinically eligible, but 20% of patients do not respond to treatment. A poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a poor prognosis, since patients with less favorable pathological responses are known to have lower event-free and overall survival after surgery than those with residual disease \u02c2 5mm. Given that the tumor response is related to pathological outcomes, the response markers used to predict the treatment effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are key for this patient group to determine their prognosis and treatment in a timely manner. Recently, new response markers have been identified for predicting neoadjuvant treatment response and improving patient care. However, these response markers are still limited, and further identification and validation of a comprehensive response biomarker are needed. It is also necessary to develop an intervention strategy that improves the treatment response of patients with poor breast cancer by identifying factors that affect the prognosis of patients. In particular, it is essential to establish treatment strategies that improve the prognosis of patients. Exercise has been shown to contribute to cancer treatment, and the American Cancer Society recommends that patients with cancer (including neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer) should maintain physical activity as one of the effective interventions throughout their treatment. However, there have been relatively few studies on the effects of exercise on the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, so there are limited guidelines for exercise. Although most of the studies conducted so far have been exercise during the postoperative period or after treatment, there are only a few studies on the potential and effects of exercise training during the treatment period (including neoadjuvant chemotherapy), and only one study has conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a neoadjuvant",

This two-stage (Phase II) trial will also explore the effect of metformin on tumor response, as measured by imaging studies, and its safety.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe Phase II trial will be conducted in sequential two-stage designs.

            "OK. Please proceed. \n\nAbstract:\nPURPOSE: The objective was to assess the impact of the 2003 recommendations of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) on the use of prophylactic analgesics for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Group\u2010R received a prophylactic patient\u2010controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) infusion, which was started in the preoperative holding area postoperatively when the patient was fully awake. Group\u2010C did not receive a PCA infusion until postoperative day 1. On postoperative day 2, each patient received additional analgesics as needed. The incidence of restless leg syndrome (RLS), level of satisfaction on a visual analog scale (VAS), and postoperative pain at rest (VAS) were compared between groups.RESULTS: Ninety patients were randomized to Group\u2010R and Group\u2010C. The incidence of RLS syndrome was 34% in Group\u2010R and 61% in Group\u2010C (P < .001). The average pain VAS score for Group\u2010C was 5.3 +/\u2010 3.0 (mean +/\u2010 SD), which was higher than that for Group\u2010R (1.8 +/\u2010 1.9, P < .0001). Of those, 10.3% of Group\u2010R vs 36% of Group\u2010C required opioid analgesics on postoperative day 2 (P < .0036). Sixteen percent of Group\u2010R, vs 53% of Group\u2010C (P < .0072), received additional pain medications after the use of extra opioids failed.CONCLUSION: The use of PCA infusions before emergence is associated with significantly less RLS syndrome, reduced patient\u2010reported pain, and lower opioid use. Furthermore, this prophylactic method of analgesia decreases patient discomfort and the risk of postoperative complications.",

It involved 31 hospitals distributed throughout the country and divided into four macro\u2010areas (Lombardy, Friuli\u2010Venezia Giulia, Piedmont, and Lazio).RESULTS: In total, 5535 patients (mean age 79.5\u00b17.7 years) were admitted during the observation period. Of these, 2765 (50%) were admitted for a respiratory cause. The mean age of AECOPD patients during the observation period in 2019 and 2020 did not differ (79.6\u00b110.2 years and 79.6\u00b17.7 years, respectively, p=0.420). No significant difference was observed in terms of the percentage of admissions for AECOPD on a weekly basis in 2019 and 2020 (p=0.990, Cramer's V=0.02), but there was an increase in AECOPD admission in July\u2010August 2020 (p=0.007, Cramer's V=0.17). Moreover, the percentage of patients admitted for AECOPD in intensive care units in the four macro\u2010areas was higher in 2020 compared to 2019 (p=0.194).CONCLUSION: The data on hospitalisations for patients with AECOPD confirm a decrease in admissions for other respiratory pathologies due to the COVID\u201019 pandemic that was partially offset by an increase in admissions for AECOPD, mainly in July\u2010August 2020.

The advent of modern medicine has enabled early detection and intervention to avoid the complications of untreated disease. In breast cancer, the incidence is approximately 2.1 million cases yearly and is the most common cause of cancer death in women. Over 90% of breast cancer diagnoses are made using surgical biopsy as the only sample source. The current standard of practice for the initial surgical approach is to sample localized disease with a standard incisional biopsy, which is a relatively small wedge of breast tissue removed typically under local anesthesia using a needle and a scalpel and sent to a pathology laboratory for analysis. Although most patients at this stage have early-stage low grade cancer and undergo simple surgery and chemotherapy (if deemed necessary), some with a tumor size that appears suspicious based on ultrasound imaging are treated with a mastectomy (removal of the whole breast). In such cases, an open surgical procedure is utilized which involves enlarging the wound to remove the cancer with or without a margin of healthy tissue, often with reconstruction to restore the appearance of the breast. This is a much more complicated surgical procedure. This research protocol has been designed to explore the use of needle and suction devices, which work in a similar fashion, to evaluate whether they can successfully be used for localized and extensive (stage III and IV) breast cancers.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nPercutaneous Fine Needle Aspirate Biopsy Of Breast Tumors Using Needle And Suction Devices To Determine The Optimal Tissue Sample For Surgical Resection: A Clinical Pilot Study\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nBreast Cancer, Stage III Breast Cancer, Stage IV Breast Cancer, Breast Neoplasms, Breast Adenocarcinoma, Stage 0 Breast Cancer, Stage 1 Breast Cancer, Stage II Breast Cancer\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure: Needle & suction biopsy\n* Other: Sentinel node biopsy\n\n\nPart",

These treatments, however, only affect the disease in the 5-year postoperative period, and subsequently the disease may relapse as the disease is rarely completely cured. In some cases, cancer cell relapse may take years or even decades to occur. Since cancer cell death may produce micrometastases that can become detectable within 5-10 years, early metastatic relapses must be managed with active disease-directed therapy, while delayed recurrences should be treated with palliative care to control symptoms. Based on prognostic information, the patients could, in this regard, benefit from specific adjuvant treatment strategies. It is thus essential to detect the relapse in order to improve patient prognosis.\nIn the past, follow-up was only performed occasionally or annually. With the help of new methods for the early detection of recurrences (imaging and biochemical markers such as CA 27.29), follow-up has been accelerated and the interval has been shortened.\nFollow-up is also known to be a stress source for patients and costs associated with clinical care and medical imaging studies should be avoided. It is also known that the frequency of follow-up visits and their content are essential for patients.\nThe purpose of the study is to measure, through a postal questionnaire:\n- patients' satisfaction with the current way of managing routine follow-up ("

Recently, many novel airway clearance devices (ACDs) have been investigated but not approved for clinical use. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether a mechanical vest ACD could improve clinical outcomes in patients with CF. DESIGN: We conducted a double\u2010blind, controlled crossover randomized trial for 10 days at the Shoushinwang Hospital, Seoul, Korea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients underwent 15\u2010minute ACD with vibration or air pulsing using the mechanical vest. Inspiratory capacity, FEV1, and respiratory symptom scores were measured before and after each trial. RESULTS: Inspiratory capacity, FEV1, and score for symptoms of chest congestion showed significant improvement after treatment with the vest compared with airwashing (control) (P < or =.05). FEV1 showed an increased trend toward improvement 1\u20102 days posttreatment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a mechanical vest ACD improved lung function and clinical signs of CF in this preliminary investigation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02660847.

In the United States, about 32,500 people are living with CF, with approximately 1,000 new cases diagnosed each year. The CF gene encodes a protein that regulates the transport of chloride and controls reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and water in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive epithelia. More than 50% of the CF gene is missing, and this deficiency results in the production of a dysfunctional",

            "You're welcome. I look forward to seeing the results of your study!\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is prevalent in various medical conditions including cancer. Fatigue (FT), the most common symptom in both cancer survivors (CS) and active oncology (AC) patients, has a high correlation with EDS. Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of EDS on FT in CS and AC patients. Methods: This study included patients older than 18 years of age with a previous history of cancer. Patients with fatigue who had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire score of >5 and cancer survivors with PSQI score of >5 were identified. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) survey were used to study patients with FT and EDS, respectively. Results: A total of 306 patients with cancer met the criteria for this study. These patients were sub\u2010classified to two groups as active cancer (n = 222) and cancer survivors with no recurrence within last 5 years (n = 84). The mean MFI scores (P = 0.015), and fatigue scores of the NHP sub scaled (P < 0.05), were higher in the FT group, as compared to the non\u2010FT group. When the subcategories of NHP were analyzed, significantly higher values were found in the general health (P < 0.001), vitality (P < 0.001), and mental health subscales (P < 0.001) and the sleep (P = 0.022)\u2010related subscale and the sleep disturbances question (P < 0.001) in the FT group. Mean EDS in the FT group was higher than the non\u2010FT group (P < 0.001). In multiple logistic models, EDS and ESS scores were independent risk factors for the FT. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that EDS and ESS scores were predictors of FT in cancer patients, and they may be potential targets to alleviate the symptoms of FT in patients with cancer and fatigue.",

The patients were divided into four groups (12 patients each), with each group receiving a different PEEP level (0, 5, 10 and 15 cm H2O, respectively). The measurements of pressure (PPl, Pes, Plat, PEEP, and airway pressure) and flow were obtained via esophageal pressure\u2010volume maneuver and Esophageal Doppler probe. All measurements were obtained continuously during both spontaneous ventilation and mechanical ventilation with different inspiration:expiration ratios (I:E = 0.7, 1:1 and 2:1).RESULTS: In all groups during mechanical ventilation, all PEEP levels were associated with significantly greater increases in tidal volume (P > 0.05), tidal elastance (Ers) (P > 0.05) and respiratory resistance (Rrs) (P > 0.05), and significantly lower peak inspiratory pressure (P < 0.05) compared with no PEEP. However, the differences were not significant for PPl (P = 0.216), Pes (P = 0.171) and Esophageal Doppler results (P = 0.134). The changes of these values during mechanical ventilation compared with spontaneous ventilation were not significantly different between all PEEP levels (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: The increase in tidal volume by PEEP may not represent a pathological increase in lung volume (increase of lung elastance and resistance). PEEP did not affect the cardiac output in this study.",

It is currently the most widely used form of pain relief during childbirth, and it is a popular choice for dentistry and outpatient surgeries.\nThe mechanism of action of N2O is not fully understood, but it is believed that it acts on several different pain pathways within the body. It is thought to work by inhibiting the release of certain neurotransmitters, including serotonin and norepinephrine, which play a role in pain perception.\nIn addition to its well-known analgesic effects, N2O also has several other benefits. It is a colorless, non-flammable gas that is relatively affordable and easy to administer. It is also considered to be a safe and low-risk form of pain relief, with few side effects and a rapid onset of action.\nOverall, N2O is a widely used analgesic gas that is known for its rapid onset of action, safety, and versatility.

To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to develop and pilot-test an electronic shared medical decision-making tool for Spanish-speaking patients with ovarian cancer and their clinical care providers. Patient and public involvement: This study is embedded in a project on shared medical decision-making (SDM). The SDM tool itself has not been developed yet. - The project team includes multiple stakeholders including: \u2022\tResearchers: researchers will conduct pre-testing surveys, interviews, observation, and focus groups to develop the SDM tool; researchers will also perform statistical analyses to evaluate the SDM tool  \u2022\tPatients: patient participants will participate in interviews, focus groups, and evaluation surveys; patient participants will also be offered the option to participate in the study by filling out questionnaires via their MD Anderson MyChart account \u2022\tClinicians: clinicians will participate",

The primary outcome for this study will be measured using the Decisional Conflict Scale. Secondary outcomes will include the Decision Satisfaction Scale, decisional regret, and time spent in the decision-making process. To summarize, this prospective, randomized, two-arm, pragmatic trial will compare the effectiveness of a Spanish-language Decision Support Tool and Provider guidance with usual care on decision-making outcomes for Spanish-speaking patients with advanced stage high grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The trial will involve Study Phase 1 and Study Phase 2, as well as a survey to assess long-term impacts of the Decision Support Tool on patients and providers. The timeline for this study is as follows: 12 months for Study Phase 1 and 24 months for Study Phase 2. Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the study design or outcomes?"

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCancer remains the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for around 9.5 million deaths (second only to cardiovascular diseases) and approximately 1 in 6 deaths (17.3 million). The disease directly caused approximately 874,000 deaths in India, the largest number of any single country. Due to the rising global population, cancer cases will continue to rise in the coming years. Over the past few decades, a dramatic rise in cancer, particularly cancers of the digestive system, has been detected in several regions, particularly high GBR countries. According to the recent WHO estimates among the most common cancers worldwide are colorectal (CRC), gastric, oesophageal, pancreatic cancers. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to reduce the mortality rates of these cancers. Oral cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the world, and it is a significant cause of death in several countries and regions. Oral cancer, the squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx, is the second most common cancer in India and has a high mortality rate. It has been known for decades that oral cancer is most common in men, but now the incidence of this disease is growing in young adults and women, but its incidence and death rate is still higher than all the other cancers. Although the incidence of oral cancer is decreasing in the majority of countries, oral cancer continues to be one of the most common cancers worldwide. With regard to other parts of the world other than those of the Western world, the incidence and death rate of oral cancer have been found to be higher in India, South & Central America, Europe, and Pakistan than in other countries. Patients with digestive tract and oral cancers are seen by general practitioners or specialists in the early stages of their illness, which is where the first indication of a malignancy is observed. This first encounter has the potential to improve the prognostic results of patients with digestive tract and oral cancers by providing them with appropriate diagnostic methods and treatment.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nDiagnosing oral cancer at the primary care level is often difficult.

The neuropathological processes of AD include progressive decline of cognitive function and neuronal degeneration of cerebral cortices including the cerebral cortex . There were approximately 35.6 million people with AD worldwide in 2001, and the number is expected to reach 115.4 million by 2050, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) . The global mortality rate of AD is 67,000 deaths per year, and the number of deaths is expected to triple by 2050. It is reported that AD accounts for 60-70% of the total mortality among people with dementia . Therefore, it is important to develop an effective dementia preventive therapy.\nRecently, it has been reported that a high level of blood glucose and hyperglycemia have harmful effects on the brain, leading to accelerated formation of amyloid plaque in the brain cells . In addition, a high-sugar diet (diet with abundant sugar content) promotes AD by accelerating the accumulation of amyloid peptide, resulting in increased oxidative stress and inflammation . Some studies have shown that a high-sugar diet in human brain cells increases the accumulation of amyloid and tau, which have been reported to be biomarkers of AD .\nD-allulose is a rare ketose (ketose monosaccharide, a sugar that cannot be fermented) that is naturally present in honey and has received attention for its potential health benefits, including reducing the risk of dementia. D-allulose can be rapidly absorbed and used as a sugar replacer because it does not cause hyperglycemia . D-allulose has been found to have an anti-glycation activity by affecting the enzymes and protein glycation, as well as by suppressing the accumulation of amyloid in the brain and preventing the formation of free radicals .\nIn addition, D-allulose has been",

            "Thank you for clarifying that. Now, let's discuss the study's secondary purpose. What are your thoughts on using the study to provide better treatment for people who already have cancer? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to test the safety of giving radiation therapy with cisplatin combined with Asparaginase compared to giving radiation therapy with cisplatin alone for patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with curative intent is surgical resection, which has been associated with superior survival when compared with radiation or chemoradiation. However, for many of these patients, surgical resection is not an option due to either age or medical comorbidities or patient refusal. Furthermore, there are several risk factors associated with poor prognosis in surgically resected stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); specifically, tumor >4 cm, N2 nodal involvement, and EGFR and ALK gene mutations. These risk factors have been identified as predictors of poor prognosis in surgically resected cases, and thus for patients with advanced stage lung cancer who are unfit for surgical resection or refuse surgery, alternative treatment approaches should be considered. Neoadjuvant/concomitant treatment (RT\u2009+\u2009CT) has shown promising results in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC. Several phase II trials have shown promising response rates following treatment with chemoradiation therapy regimens. However, the overall survival (OS) rates for patients with locally advanced disease treated with concurrent chemoradiation remain poor (1-year and 2-year OS rates of 60% and 30%, respectively) and further improvements in OS are required. Preclinical studies have shown that combination therapy with cisplatin and Asparaginase can enhance the radiosensitive of pulmonary tumor cells. The combination of these agents may therefore represent an optimal approach for the treatment of advanced stage NSCLC. Currently, there are limited data on the safety of the combination therapy, thus, this pilot study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of combining Asparaginase with cisplatin",

The intervention program, comprising of an enhanced electronic vaccination reminder system and team trainings and meetings addressing refusal to vaccination, was associated with increased rate of vaccination coverage in pediatric patients at the CHS. Using a cohort design, the study investigates the impact of the intervention program among patients who received at least 5 vaccine series recommended at ages five and younger (including Hib, DTaP, pneumococcal, rotavirus, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella and hepatitis B (Hpv) vaccination), as compared to a control group. The investigators aim to evaluate changes in patient vaccination records, as well as changes in patient-provider discussions for vaccinations to assess overall vaccine uptake and discuss any associated barriers. The study utilizes a prospective observational study design in the form of an electronic health record (EHR) review to evaluate the impact of the intervention. The investigators utilize a large data set from the CHS (>20,000 children under five years of age) to compare the rates of vaccine uptake and patient-provider discussions between baseline and intervention periods, and identify potential correlations between these outcomes and sociodemographic factors. Additionally, multivariate analysis is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, controlling for other potential factors that may impact the outcome. The investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the intervention in improving childhood vaccination uptake and address vaccine hesitancy and refusal among pediatric patients at the CHS. The findings of this study can provide valuable insights into the impact of electronic reminders and team trainings in improving vaccination rates, as well as provide new methods to address vaccine hesitancy and refusal in pediatric patients, which may have broader implications for public health.\n\nTrial type\n=================\nTreatment: Other\n\nTrial phase\n=================\nNot Applicable\n\nStudy design\n=================\nPilot study\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\nInclusion Criteria:",

Participants will be stratified as 0-11 months and 1-18 years old. This randomization structure will maintain consistency among the groups by ensuring that each group has the same number of participants among men and women, and the same number of participants in each age group.

            "Right, the control arm is critical to this study. This arm will receive standard physiotherapy care without the AERO Program. The physiotherapist will also assess the barriers to exercise adherence using the COM-B model, but without any specific interventions to address these barriers. This arm will help us determine the value of the AERO Program compared to standard care.\n\nIn terms of the intervention, it's possible to include a combination of two or more active interventions along with standard care in the experimental arm. For example, you could include a home exercise program, behavioral techniques, and/or other interventions tailored to address the barriers to exercise adherence.\n\nIn terms of the sample size and group assignment, you should consider what would be most informative for your study's objectives. For example, if you want to determine the effectiveness of the program in a representative population, a large clinical trial with randomized controlled trials (RCT) design may be appropriate. If you want to address specific concerns regarding exercise adherence, you may consider a smaller clinical trial with a before-and-after design.\n\nIt's also important to consider the ethical aspects of your study. You should ensure that your research protocol is approved by an IRB or ethics committee before conducting the study. You should also obtain informed consent from all participants before enrolling them into the study.\n\nFinally, it's important to collect data on safety and efficacy outcomes to ensure that the AERO Program is safe and effective for patients with osteoporosis. This may include assessing bone mineral density, falls risk, physical function, and patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life and satisfaction with care.\n\nIn conclusion, the experimental arm of your study should include the AERO Program, which is a multi-modal exercise and behavioral intervention tailored to address the barriers to exercise adherence. The control arm should include standard physiotherapy care without any specific interventions to address the barriers to exercise adherence. The sample size and group assignment should be based on the study's objectives, and the safety and efficacy outcomes should be carefully monitored throughout the study.",

[Protocol] The AERO Program Study will include two study arms: Experimental: AERO Program standard care control group The trial will enrol 40 participants with osteoporosis. All participants will complete the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES), the World Health Organization Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL), the Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS), and a physical activity survey at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Participants in the experimental group will also receive a home exercise program tailored to manage osteoporosis. The physiotherapist would also evaluate the barriers to exercise adherence using the COM-B model and provide specific interventions during the PT sessions. In the control group, we will provide standard care for osteoporosis management. This can include home exercise programs, mobilizations, soft tissue techniques, or training with gym equipment. The HEP in the control group will be based on the physical assessment of the physiotherapist. We will compare the two groups to assess the additional benefits of the AERO Program in improving exercise adherence. \n\nStudy design\n=================\nProspective parallel study\n\nDescription\n=================\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of our physical therapy intervention compared to standard outpatient care for patients with osteoporosis. Our intervention was designed based on three models: COM-B, Examination of Musculoskeletal Impairment and Osteoporosis (PROMOT), and the Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA) guidelines. The COM-B model identifies behavioral change mechanisms, i.e., Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation. Our therapist will first screen the participant for barriers and evaluate musculoskeletal impairment using the PROMOT and CPA guidelines. A personalized exercise program will be developed in order to improve physical performance and quality of life, and in order to overcome the detected barriers. The research participants in the current trial are patients with osteoporosis who need advice and treatment from the outpatient unit. They will be asked to perform 3 home exercise prescriptions (HEP) and to make follow-up consultations in 8 weeks. The therapists will use the standard"

In this way, participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive FOLFIRI or FOLFOX plus Fruquintinib.\n\nIntervention\n=================\nIntervention 1: Intervention group: Fruquintinib plus FOLFOX/FOLFIRI. Patients received Fruquintinib 5 mg/day, given orally in 28-day cycles. Patients received FOLFOX (consisting of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, folinic acid 200 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2) given as a 2-hour intravenous bolus followed by 22 hours of infusion and 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 given as a 22-hour intravenous infusion twice a day, every 2 weeks (q2w)] every 2 weeks. FOLFIRI consisted of irinotecan 180 mg/m2 given as a 1.5-hour intravenous infusion plus 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 given as a 2-hour intravenous bolus, followed by 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 given as a 46-hour intravenous continuous infusion, every 2 weeks.

            "For the combination group, the participant group/arm should consist of patients who received fruquintinib in combination with other systemic therapies such as anti-EGFR therapy, anti-VEGF therapy, oxaliplatin (OXA), or irinotecan (CPT-11). This allows for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib in combination with existing treatment for refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nAbstract\nRationale: The median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are 6.4 and 13.8 months, respectively. Moreover, the survival rate at one year is 29% and that at five years is 6%. Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs offer only minimal benefit for previously treated patients with mCRC. Fruquintinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been shown to significantly prolong PFS compared to chemotherapy in patients with mCRC who have progressed following prior treatment. However, the effect of fruquintinib in combination with standard therapy for refractory colorectal cancer is still unknown. Method: In this phase II, single\u2010center trial, 106 eligible patients will be randomized into two groups. The first group will receive fruquintinib alone and the second group will receive fruquintinib combined with standard therapy (such as oxaliplatin (OXA), irinotecan (CPT\u201011), ramucirumab (RAM), regorafenib, or panitumumab), as determined by the investigator. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS evaluated by the investigator using RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include OS, disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Results of this study will contribute to the development of more effective and safe combination treatments for refractory mCRC.",

Background\n\nAcne is a common skin condition that affects up to 80% of adolescents and 5% of adults worldwide. It is characterized by the appearance of bumps on the face, chest, and back, which can be mild to severe. Acne can cause physical discomfort, scarring, and psychological distress, leading to reduced self-esteem and quality of life. The exact cause of acne is not fully understood, but it is believed to be caused by a combination of factors, such as excess production of sebum (a natural oil produced by the skin), clogged pores, and bacteria. Several treatment options are available for acne, including topical medications, oral antibiotics, and hormonal therapies. However, these treatments may not be effective for all patients or may have side effects. Recent studies have shown that prebiotic and probiotic supplementation may be effective in improving acne by reducing inflammation, balancing the microbiome, and regulating sebum production. However, no clinical trials have compared the effects of different prebiotics and probiotics in patients with acne. Therefore, the objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a multispecies prebiotic and probiotic supplement with a multispecies probiotic supplement in patients with acne.\nWe plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 168 adult patients with moderate to severe acne. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three study groups:\n1. Multispecies prebiotic and probiotic supplement group (group A): Patients will receive a dietary supplement that contains a mixture of prebiotic fiber (fructooligosaccharides) and probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus fermentum CUL60, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20, Lactobacillus plantarum CUL34, Lactobacillus paracasei CUL31, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CUL6).\n2.

A single cell can release multiple tumor-associated RNAs and \u223c 50,000 cancer-related mutations into the bloodstream within 5 minutes after the cancer cell divides and dies. This information will be useful for the identification of cancer subtypes, especially for early detection of ovarian cancer. The purpose of our study is to use blood plasma samples collected from women with ovarian cancer to understand the feasibility and accuracy of using ctDNA in the dynamic monitoring of patients with late stage ovarian cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nIn contrast to normal cells, cancer cells present different patterns in gene expression, protein composition, and mutations of tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. The gene-expression patterns of different cancers and in different phases of cancers may be very different. Genetic material in the form of cell-free RNAs and deoxyribonucleic acid from the tumor can be isolated from the blood cells using RNAseq and the sequencing results compared with the known mutated alleles found in the cancer. This information will be useful for the identification of cancer subtypes, especially for early detection of ovarian cancer. The purpose of our study is to use blood plasma samples collected from patients with ovarian cancer at different treatment stages (initial treatment, chemotherapy, and survival) to understand the feasibility and accuracy of using ctDNA to detect the early recurrence of ovarian cancer after primary therapies to guide decision making regarding adjuvant treatments, including dose adjustment of chemotherapy, changes in surgery, and use of immunotherapy.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nDynamic Monitoring of ctDNA for Predicting Recurrence of Advanced Ovarian Cancer After Primary Treatments\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAdvanced Ovarian Cancer\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------",
            "Okay. Thanks. And what is your expected start date? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Differential DNA methylation profiles in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and the development of methylated biomarkers as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tools. Materials and methods: A total of 134 patients diagnosed with stage III colon cancer will be recruited. Two additional peripheral blood samples will be collected after chemotherapy and before liver resection, then the samples will be analysed by high throughput DNA methylation array (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip kit, Illumina, San Diego,USA). Differential DNA methylation analysis will be used to identify methylated genes associated to the liver metastasis of CRC. The DNA methylation of key genes will be evaluated by Bisulfite\u2010pyro\u2010sequencing validation. Results: A total of 134 patients were recruited and their DNA methylation profiles were analysed. DNA methylation profiles of 3077 genes were obtained. Among these genes, we will determine which 30 genes (or genes) associated to liver metastasis are screened through Illumina array. Genes associated to liver metastasis were selected by the following analysis method. (1) Differential analysis (Illumina array) of primary tumor and blood methylation profile data between patients with and without liver metastasis detected by baseline PET\u2010CT. (2) Differential analysis (Illumina array) of blood methylation profile data between patients with and without liver metastasis detected during followup. (3) Pathway enrichment analysis of 30 genes (or genes). (4) Bisulfite\u2010pyro\u2010sequencing validation. The results will be compared with clinical information. The follow\u2010up period is 5 years. (1) The primary endpoint: overall survival (OS). \uf06d Survival was evaluated every 3 months after surgery in a prospective cohort study and compared with blood DNA methylation profiles to detect genes that can predict the prognosis of patients with colorectal liver metastasis. The comparison will be performed with Cox regression analysis (2) The secondary endpoints: disease\u2010free survival (DFS), distant metastasis\u2010free survival",

            "Excellent. Are there any exclusion criteria for this participant group? \n\nStudy design\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) are germ line-encoded PRRs which recognize components of the external pathogens. TLR2 and TLR4 are expressed on the surface of various immune cells including T lymphocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Ligation of TLR2/TLR4 activates inflammatory signaling and recruit cytokines. It had been reported that overexpression of TLR4 caused ovarian cancer through TGF-\u03b2 regulation, that downregulation of TLR4 signaling could effectively inhibit ovarian cancer. However, the mechanism of TLR2/TLR4 regulating cytokine expression in ovarian cancer remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 on the inflammatory response and development of ovarian cancer and its mechanism.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study comprised of patients with primary ovarian cancer undergoing PDS at the Reproductive Center, Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine from October 2019 to January 2020, as our institution is a major center for PDS in China. Each patient gave written consent and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital. Ovarian cancer patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A included patients with high TNF-\u03b1 levels (> 300 pg/mL), and group B included patients with low TNF-\u03b1 levels (< 300 pg/mL). The plasma samples and tumor tissues were collected from these two groups at the start of surgery for TNF-\u03b1 assay and qRT-PCR analysis. Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) and TLR4 expressions in the plasma of the two groups were evaluated using Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and their correlation with the TNF-\u03b1 levels in ovarian cancer patients was analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis. Correspondingly, the mRNA and protein expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 in tumor tissues of the",

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BiPAP treatment on OSA. Methods and materials: Twenty\u2010four patients with moderate to severe OSA with comorbid mild hypertension, obesity (BMI (Body Mass Index): 30\u201035), and type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to a study group who were treated with BiPAP therapy for 15 weeks. Also, twenty\u2010four patients with similar characteristics but without treatment were assigned as the control group. The parameters of OSA were examined using both overnight respiratory polygraphy (RPSG) and full polysomnographic (PSG) studies at baseline and after intervention. Results: In the study group, there was a significant reduction in the respiratory event index (REI) (p = 0.005), the apnea\u2010hypopnea index (AHI) (p = 0.001), the desaturation index (p = 0.005), and oxygenation index (p = 0.006) values compared to before the study. For those in the control group, a statistically significant reduction in AHI, an increase in body weight (p = 0.032), and blood pressure (p = 0.048) values were observed after the study. Conclusion: Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy improved the symptoms of OSA in patients with OSA who had a history of mild hypertension following 15 weeks of therapy.

Can you elaborate on this crossover design? \n\nStudy\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCultural competency is an essential skill set for nurses who work with patients from different cultural backgrounds. However, cultural incompetence can lead to poor clinical outcomes for patients and professionals alike. This study aims to examine the efficiency of using the bibliotherapy method in developing cultural intelligence and competencies among nurses working in the intensive care unit. We hypothesize that nurses who undergo a bibliotherapy intervention will exhibit higher cultural intelligence and competency levels compared to those who do not engage in the intervention. The study will also use a crossover design, which involves combining two interventions to optimize their effects. The nurses will participate in an initial training session on intercultural nursing, followed by two intervention periods: a bibliotherapy intervention and an education intervention. The study aims to produce data that can be used to inform and improve the practice of nurses in providing care for patients from diverse cultural backgrounds.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study aims to examine the efficiency of the bibliotherapy method in developing cultural intelligence and competencies among nurses working in the intensive care unit. The study will employ a crossover design, involving two interventions: an education intervention and a bibliotherapy intervention. The participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the bibliotherapy group and the education group. The bibliotherapy group will receive specialized training to increase their cultural knowledge levels, followed by activities such as reading, watching films, and discussing cultural competency topics in the workplace. The education group, on the other hand, will receive a more traditional education intervention on the basics of intercultural nursing. After the initial intervention, both groups will switch and receive the opposite intervention. The primary outcome measure of the study is a change in cultural knowledge levels. Cultural knowledge will be assessed using a series of questionnaires designed to assess the participants' knowledge of cultural differences, communication strategies, and cultural sensitivity. Secondary outcome measures include changes in self-efficacy, attitudes towards cultural competency, and perceived barriers to cultural competence. Participants will also be asked to complete",

Are you recruiting participants through any particular method? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: Background: The World Health Organization recognizes that nurses play a key role on health care services, especially during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. Research demonstrates that the prevalence of nurses in high\u2010risk countries such as Brazil and Iran is relatively high compared to other health care workers. Nursing education includes many aspects of safety, including preventing occupational injuries and diseases. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the mental health of nurses during the pandemic due to the many stressors they face. Objective: The present study sought to verify the effects of a 10\u2010week mindfulness\u2010based cognitive therapy (MBCT)\u2010based stress management program on resilience, stress, and burnout in nurses. Methods: After obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board, a simple random sample of nurses working in COVID\u201019 intensive care units was selected (60 nurses, 30 in each group) and randomly assigned to a control group who took part in a 10\u2010week mindfulness\u2010based cognitive therapy\u2010based stress management program and a case group (usual attention, 10 classes). Data were collected using the Connor\u2010Davidson Resilience Scale (CD\u2010RISC Form), DASS\u201021 Stress Scale, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA (P <.05). Results: The mean age of the study groups was 38.3 years, and most consisted of women (>90%). Participants with a bachelor's degree made up >90% of both groups. The results of repeated measures ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups after the intervention was completed in all three outcome measures (P <.05). Conclusion: The results suggest that a 10\u2010week MBCT stress management program can be effective in increasing resilience, reducing stress, and reducing burnout. It is suggested that a stress management program based on mindfulness may be effective in preventing occupational stress and burnout in nurses during the pandemic.",

Patients are required to be between the ages of 18 and 70, to have suffered a pelvic fracture, pelvic fracture-associated urethral injury, and be free of infection or tumors. The patient must have been hospitalized and received conservative treatment and intracavernosal injection therapy to determine the degree of erectile function dysfunction before and three months after the initial injury.

            "What is the study measuring? \n\nAbstract:\nThis was a prospective study designed to determine whether it is possible to identify a group of patients who would benefit most from intraoperative colonoscopy (IOC) by assessment of a panel of markers in surgical specimens. The study population comprised patients undergoing elective total or subtotal colectomy. A colonoscope was inspected through the lumen of the colon and antrum and samples were taken 4\u2009cm from the mucosa and the muscularis layers. One part of each sample was frozen, and the other part was embedded in paraffin to be used for immunohistochemical staining of anticytokeratins (AE1/3) and M30, and measurement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20102 and \u20109) levels. A control group consisted of patients who underwent IOC under standard conditions. The results were recorded by independent researchers, and the statistical significance of differences in expression ratios was tested by unpaired t\u2010test. The average expression ratio of AE1/3 was higher in tumor tissue than in healthy tissue, with the highest level occurring in tumor tissues of stage II and III. The expression level of MMP\u20109 decreased in the same order. With an increase in MMP\u20109 level, the AE1/3 expression level decreased in the same order (stage II, stage I, stage III, control group). The positive rate of M30 was higher in stage II/III gastric cancers. The differences in the expression of AE1/3, MMP\u20109, and M30 were statistically significant, and the order was AE1/3\u00a0>\u00a0M30\u00a0>\u00a0MMP\u20109. We propose that high MMP\u20109 level is related to increased tumor infiltration depth, which may be suitable for surgery. This finding may be meaningful in the future development of an algorithm for the selection of patients who will benefit from IOC.",

Within each cohort, 2-3 dose levels will be explored at 1-3 different fractions. One dose level will be explored at each fraction. The first cohort starts with a dose level of 5.8 Gy per fraction. The highest dose level for the cohort is determined by reaching the dose constraint specified in the protocol that limits the dose to organs at risk (OARs). The starting dose level for the following cohorts is based on the results of the previous cohort. The details of the dose levels for each fraction and each cohort are listed in the protocol. Patients will receive adaptive SBRT for abdominopelvic metastases with the purpose of maximizing local tumor control while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues.

As such, palliative options for patients with recurrent or metastatic disease are sorely needed to improve symptoms, quality of life, and overall survival. One such strategy to improve local control is radiation therapy, especially stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The problem with standard radiation therapy for metastases is that the radiation plans are often limited to the visible tumor burden, resulting in suboptimal treatment of invisible lesions when they are too small and of normal structures when the tumor extends beyond its margins.  By utilizing adaptive radiation therapy, it is possible to create radiation treatment plans personalized to the patient's anatomy at the time of treatment and to deliver radiation to areas outside of the visible tumor as well as the gross tumor volume.  This has the potential to improve local control rates and survival, while also minimizing toxicity due to the precise nature of the radiation delivery.   \nWe plan to evaluate the feasibility and safety of adaptive stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) in treating patients with abdominopelvic metastases. Our primary objective is to evaluate ablative radiation delivery to the abdomen and pelvis and measure toxicity rates in patients with abdominal and pelvic metastases.

Participants in this group will receive the standard programming they would typically get in a clinical setting.The trial will be conducted using a crossover design, where each participant will receive both the modified and standard programming.The participants will be asked to attend three follow-up visits, where the standard programming will be assessed, the modified programming will be implemented, and the standard programming will be re-assessed.During the trial, the participants' responses to the programming adjustments will be monitored and recorded to evaluate the efficacy of the modifications.The trial will involve a total of 6 follow-up visits, with each visit lasting up to 1 hour. The last study visit will be about 3 months after the first.\n\nIntervention type\n=================\nProcedure/Surgery",

            "Of course! We can design a placebo control group. What do you think?\n\n\nAbstract:\nINTRODUCTION In pediatric non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the stage of disease is a significant predictor of outcome. Patients who progress to stage \u2162 and \u2163 disease are at high risk of treatmentrelated death (TRD) and relapse. Although combination chemotherapy (eg, HD\u2010D1) could achieve CR, more than half of CR patients would eventually relapse. The investigators hypothesized that intrathecal rituximab may be an effective adjuvant therapy for pediatric non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), especially for those with stage \u2162 or \u2163 disease. METHODS We will investigate a total of 48 children with stage \u2162 or \u2163 non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) on different chemotherapy protocols (eg, HD\u2010D1) in our clinical study. Patients will be divided into two groups, control group and experimental group. The patients in the control group will only receive chemotherapy, whereas the patients in the experimental group will also receive intrathecal rituximab. Routine safety tests (physical examination, laboratory tests, etc.) will be conducted before treatment. After treatment, recurrence and survival will be evaluated for all patients. RESULTS A total of 24 patients will be randomized and received intrathecal rituximab. No TRD or treatment\u2010related deaths (TRD) were observed at the end of the study. However, recurrence was observed in four patients in the experimental group and two patients in the control group. The median follow\u2010up time was 3 years. 16 patients in the experimental group and 12 patients in the control group failed to achieve complete remission (CR). One patient in the experimental group experienced cerebral hemorrhage during treatment. The survival rates at one year, two years, and five years were 57.6%, 43.7%, and 36.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In summary, our data suggest that intrathecal rituximab is a feasible and promising strategy for treating pediatric non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma who are at high",
            "Absolutely. The experimental group will consist of children who agree to receive RTX intrathecal therapy. The control group will consist of children receiving standard treatment without intrathecal rituximab. This will help us evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RTX intrathecal therapy in treating pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma. \n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nBackground/Purpose: To investigate the safety and efficacy of rituximab (RTX) intrathecal therapy in pediatric patients with non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Methods: A prospective, open\u2010label, phase II trial of intrathecal RTX was conducted in pediatric patients (ages 6\u201017) with NHL and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) involvement. Patients received RTX intrathecally at a dose of 5 mg/m2 every 4 weeks for 3 doses. The primary outcome was the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) treatment\u2010related adverse events (AEs). Secondary outcomes included overall response rates, time to progressive disease (PD), and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 21 patients were enrolled in the study (median age: 12 years, range: 6\u201017; 61.9% male; 47.6% CNS NHL; 61.9% EBV\u2010associated lymphoma). Treatment\u2010related AEs were reported in 9.6% of patients, mostly grade 1 and 2 neurological events. No grade 4 or 5 AEs were observed. The CNS response rate was 60%, with 5 patients achieving a complete response and 10 patients achieving a partial response. The median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) and OS were 34.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.9\u201043.9 months) and 41.6 months (95% CI: 34.6\u201048.5 months), respectively. Conclusion: Intrathecal RTX therapy seems to be safe and effective in pediatric patients with NHL with CNS involvement. Larger, randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate these findings"
