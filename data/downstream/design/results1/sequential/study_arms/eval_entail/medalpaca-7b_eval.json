            "For the Vedolizumab arm, we'll include all patients with Crohn's Disease who could benefit from vedolizumab therapy. 5.6 Design and statistical considerations The selection of appropriate design for the proposed research study will depend on the type of research question being asked, for instance, should the research be an observational or an interventional study. A treatment vs control approach could be adopted where in the treatment group will receive an experimental treatment,  intervention or a new drug and the control group will receive the usual treatment, common practice, or drug. A crossover design can be used when the aim is to compare the two treatment groups. In case of a chronic illness like Crohn\u2019s disease where the condition can be treated on and off and patient will experience periods of symptom-free and symptomatic state a within-subjects repeated measures design may be appropriate. In the within-subjects repeated measures design a participant is a subject for himself since he is measuring his/her responses at different time points. The following are the factors that can be varied: \u2751 Treatment: Active treatment (Treatment of choice) & Placebo (or an alternate treatment) \u2751 Time: Interval between 2 assessments within the same participant \u2751 Dose (High dose & Low dose): This can be done by treating group & not in within subjects. For example in the treatment of ulcer disease, a patient may be treated with a high dose of antacid for a period before the measurement is taken, the measurement are compared to his usual response(s) \u2751 Method of administration: Oral & rectal The selection aims to study the dose, time, and method of administration of a drug or treatment. 5.7 Ethical issues In the selection of an appropriate design for a research will depend on the research question and the nature of the research being undertaken. There are ethical concerns that needs to be addressed in all research especially a clinical trial. Clinical Trials are broadly classified into phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the ethical requirements differ.

We have now finalized the design of our clinical trial. \nP2 Study Detailed Design Example: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Implications\nExample of a P2 study focused on diagnostic and therapeutic implications\nP2: Detailed study design for diagnostic and therapeutic implications\nTitle P2: Study Design for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Implications\nIntroduction Urine flow rate could be used to predict patients who are most likely to benefit from a certain treatment option for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). A prospective study is needed to demonstrate the usefulness of urine flow rate measurement as a screening tool for predicting response to treatment. Therefore, the following hypothesis is being tested:\nH0: In patients with LUTS and anuria, urine flow rate in the voiding phase of the urine flow meter will not be associated with patient symptoms as measured by the IPSS.\nH1: In patients with LUTS, urine flow rate in the voiding phase of the urine flow meter will be associated with patient symptoms as measured by the IPSS.\nStudy population Patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) from either benign prostatic hyperplasia, overactive bladder, or chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome\nControl strategy This is a longitudinal cohort/observational study. Urine flow rate and IPSS will be assessed at baseline and at one month follow-up.\nTiming Study visits will be at 8-week intervals. Patients who demonstrate an increase in urine flow rate of greater than 0.5 mL/sec from baseline to follow-up will be followed for another 8 weeks.\nOutcome measures 1. Urine flow rate in the voiding phase (1st 30 seconds) of urine flow meter 2. International prostate symptom score (IPSS)\nBrief description of the study study population and intervention (detailed further below) study endpoint(s)/outcome(s). study period: timings and duration.\nSample size Determine number of patients required by power analysis. A two-sample t test, assuming a pooled standard deviation of urine flow rate (SD = 200 mL/sec)",

            "Randomized would be great for ensuring equal treatment groups, but I'm not familiar with parallel assignment. If you could illustrate a parallel assignment flowchart or describe how it works, that would be very helpful.  [Normal text]Sure, parallel assignment works like this: [Normal text] Participants are assigned to their respective groups once all eligibility requirements are met. That's it. Participants are only in one group for the entire study. [Normal text] I see. I guess you'd need to ensure some kind of randomization at the individual level then to ensure equal groups. [Normal text] Let me explain how this can work. [Normal text]Parallel assignment isn't completely random but can produce comparably equivalent groups. [Normal text] The way it works is that after meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the next available group number is assigned. [Normal text] Imagine there are 70 participants in total - 40 are randomized to the control group and 30 to the treatment group. [Normal text] When the next participant eligibility requirement is met, they're assigned group number 30, which is assigned to the treatment group. [Normal text] If the next participant would have been eligible a few spots later, they'd have been group 31, which is assigned to the control group due to the randomization. [Normal text] Do you see? The first participant in the group is assigned early so they get the treatment, but subsequent participants are assigned to the control group using randomization. [Normal text] If there are many participants, there's still a chance randomization won't produce equal groups, but it's better than just assigning participants sequentially. [Normal text] I had previously been using 1-2-3-4-5 etc. but will try your approach this time around. [Normal text] Great, please let me know your findings. You should be able to avoid the time lag associated with randomization while ensuring some degree of allocation concealment. [Normal text] Of course, you may want to use one of the other methods we discussed for the next study to really ensure equal groups, but this should be fine for now. [Normal text] Alright, let's move on to the follow-up procedures. What was your choice for that so far?  [Normal text] We want",

The third step is optional in some cases depending on the clinical suspicion. The fourth step is the analysis of the biopsies to confirm the diagnosis.

We should definitely add something to increase the statistical power. The issue with this protocol is that it may not be able to detect a difference if there is a very small difference between the two groups. Do you have any ideas to improve it?  [/] One way to improve the protocol is to increase the sample size. An increase in sample size would mean increasing the number of patients randomized in each group. We can also add a secondary outcome other than fluid requirements and infections such as the length of hospital stay. Do you agree?  [/] Yes, I agree. We could also consider other parameters such as the intensity of pain or quality of wound healing. However, we should be careful not to overload the protocol with too many secondary outcomes. We could also consider adding a third study arm where albumin is administered at a high dose. This would further strengthen the protocol.

Let's move on to sample size estimation.\nSample size estimation is an important part of protocol development and an integral component of protocol review. Estimating the sample size for a clinical trial requires several factors, including the effect size, precision, alpha level, and beta error rate. Alpha and beta rates are critical because they determine the statistical power of the study. In general, the alpha level is usually set at 0.05, and the beta error rate is set at 0.20.\nOnce we have the alpha and beta errors established, we need to determine the power of the study. Power refers to the probability of detecting a treatment effect if it exists. For example, if the power is 0.80, it means that if the treatment does have an effect, we will detect it 80% of the time. How many participants we need to include in the study depends on what we are measuring and the precision of the measurements. A clinical trial may need to recruit several hundred or even a few thousand participants to be able to detect a treatment effect with sufficient precision.\nHow long it takes to reach a targeted sample size depends on the study design, the drug under study, and the effect size. In some cases, it may take several years to reach the sample size required. However, it's important to be honest about time requirements in clinical trial design to avoid delays and to make sure the study does not exceed the funds available or the participants' willingness to participate.\nThe sample size estimation is critical because it helps us determine whether the study is likely to be successful. Poorly designed studies can waste money, time, and resources, whereas well-designed studies save them. By carefully considering the sample size in the protocol planning stage, we can increase the chances of a successful clinical trial."

Now, in phase 3, we'll discuss any special consideration for inclusion/exclusion/grouping of patients.

Additionally, by using canned responses, the assistant can provide information faster, which could increase the likelihood that the client will finish the interview without getting distracted or hanging up.\nEven in the above example, the assistant could have made the sentence less verbose by using concise responses such as: \"The intervention is a VIOP. 1*.\" 1*.",

By going through this process, a chatbot can guide the researchers through determining the purpose of the trial, the study arms, the interventions, the masking, the outcome measures, etc. It would even be able to explain to the end users any uncertainties and questions that arise during the session. \nEase of recruitment, engagement, and retention of participants\nThere are a few ethical considerations, however, when it comes to a fully automated chatbot clinical trial. As researchers in this domain are currently addressing 3 of them: Participant privacy and security, bias, and recruitment challenges. Answers from these considerations are exchanged between the chatbot and a human clinician or study team.\nChallenges regarding privacy and security\nCan you tell me about some of the key privacy and security challenges of using your system to support patients recruited for a clinical trial?\n[CHATBOT]\nThere are several factors that we need to take into account when building a system that ensures the privacy and security of sensitive information regarding the health of patients.\nFirstly, we make sure that all the data collected and exchanged using the chatbot is appropriately secured. We use modern cryptographic protocols and secure communication channels to ensure that no outsiders can intercept the data. We make sure all the connections are encrypted as much as possible and that only people who are allowed to see the data can access it. We also store the data on a secured server, in a physically secured location.\nWe take appropriate steps to protect personal identifiers, the participants' health information does not leak. Even our staff is subjected to confidentiality agreements to never reveal the contents of the patients' messages and answer to them in a timely and professional manner. We also ensure all our staff has a proper background and is trained in the privacy rules of our system.\nAnother privacy challenge is to ensure participants' anonymity. The chatbot does not contain any identifying information about them which can later aid in identify them. We use only anonymized data for analyzing purposes. We implement additional measures in case the identity of a participant reveals such as unblinding messages/"

Let's agree on 6 weeks for the well-being intervention and 8 weeks for the classic museum intervention. Finally, what do you think about the outcome measurement? Cardiac function should definitely be measured to evaluate the impact of the interventions on the cardiac system. Psychological well-being should be measured as well to explore the benefits of the well-being intervention. Are there any other outcomes that should be included? Perhaps subjective ratings of engagement with the museum visit should be included as well. Other aspects of psychological well-being, such as stress or anxiety symptoms, might be relevant as well.

We could also look at biomarkers of the immune system, such as levels of cytokines or inflammatory proteins. How should we randomize participants to the two groups to ensure the study is blinded?

Cross-sectional cohort would be where you just select people at the beginning, and then you follow them for some time course, but they are not randomly assigned to different groups. So we will be doing a randomized clinical trial in a cohort fashion so the subjects are sequentially placed into either the treatment and control arm or the other way around. Subjects will be randomly ascertained from the population of interest by our sponsor's physician and from there they will be referred to a study physician for screening. Screening will involve assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria and randomization. After randomization, subjects will begin their respective assigned interventions. Outcomes will be measured as pre-specified. Any adverse events or mild or moderate adverse outcomes will be handled by the study physician and serious adverse events will be referred to the study safety committee which may require unblinding of the subjects. 3.1.2.3 Methods of Evaluation 3.1.2.3.1 Primary Outcome Measure 3.1.2.3.1.1 Our primary outcome measure will be a measure of hip-related function which is assessed both objectively by standardized measures and subjectively by questionnaires. 3.1.2.3.1.2 To clarify, 3.1.2.3.1.2 will involve imaging and we will use a combination of 3.1.2.3.1.2.1 X-ray and 3.1.2.3.1.2.2 MRI to assess the effects of the Revision LR femoral stem. 3.1.2.3.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 3.1.2.3.2.1 Secondary outcome measures will include 3.1.2.3.2.1.1 symptoms via questionnaires"

A power of 80% and an alpha of 5% indicate that the study has 80% power to detect an effect if it is really there, and an effect is actually there 5% of the time by chance. The required sample size depends on too many factors to lay out here (for example, the effect size, the variance, and the correlation between observations). However, one simple formula used in clinical trials estimation is: Sample Size = Z2Xpq/2*[1-beta], where Z is the standard normal distribution with a given \u03b1/2, p is the frequency of the disease in the population, and q is the frequency of the disease in the control population, and \u03b2 is 1-\u03b2. In the following example, let's assume we need to detect a difference of standard deviation units between the treatment and control groups, and two-thirds (2/3) of those affected by the disease will be included in the study. This sample size estimation formula is: Sample size = 2[1-(0.66)]=4.3*Z(0.025,2)=127.3.

The sponsor (independent or otherwise) will maintain a signed consent form for a minimum of three years past the study conclusion. 8 Recruitment 8.1 Recruitment Strategies Participant recruitment is one of the most challenging tasks of conducting a study. Recruitment will vary depending on the population of interest, the type of study design, and the type of study site (e.g., clinic, school). For some studies, social media recruitment may also be an option. When devising a recruitment strategy, consider the following: Will there be a need for screening of potential participants? Will there be a screening instrument? What types of participants will be eligible and ineligible? Who can participate (e.g., any patient with a specific diagnosis or only those diagnosed within a specific timeframe)? What locations (e.g., only a specific clinic or research site, or can participants be recruited at home) should be targeted? What methods of recruitment will be used (e.g., posting flyers, mailing, advertisements, social media)? To what populations will the announcement be directed (e.g., patients only, community residents, employees of a particular organization)? How many participants should be enrolled? How will participants be retained? What monitoring mechanisms will be in place to track the flow of participants through different stages of the study? Recruitment of study participants typically begins at the planning stage of the study, not after IRB review. In some cases, a recruitment plan may have to be modified during the study due to lower than expected or higher than anticipated enrollment numbers.\n8.2 Recruitment Procedures The following procedures are suggested for participants who agree to be contacted about study opportunities: Initial Contact All recruitment contacts should begin with the establishment of contact information for the prospective participant (including address, telephone and e-mail addresses). A written or verbal description of the research study should then be provided. The purpose of the research should be explained and a voluntary participation request should be made. Consent should never be oral\u2014consent forms must be signed and dated before any study-related procedures occur, including provision of information about the research.",

Another helpful approach might be to have them visualize the harmful effects of smoking on their bodies with some type of scale from mild to severe. Then they might visualize themselves with those negative affects reversed. The positive imagery should be more powerful than the negative. It's also important for them to imagine what their lives will be like with the harmful affects of smoking reversed since the urge to smoke will be greatly diminshed when they visualize the changes they have made. When you think of it, they're not really doing the actual affirming, they're just thinking or visualizing - a different approach that's been shown to work well is guided imagery - where you give them the positive affirming and assist them in visualizing the positive affects, which is like you mentioned in your post with an added step which is to talk them through it. I like to give them 3-5 minutes of guided imagery per \"session\" so that they have time to truly visualize themselves with the effects you've already discussed and others we haven't.

This will help test the effects of a low-nicotine product in the mornings, when people often experience the strongest desire to use. In the second arm, the participants will use the Ampli-01 6-mg nicotine pouch, which contains the same amount of nicotine as the low-nicotine arm, but provides a stronger dose. This will evaluate the impact of a medium-to-high nicotine product in the mornings. Finally, in the third arm, the participants will use the ZYN Cool Mint Mini Dry 6-mg nicotine pouch. This product is a leading competitor in the market and will be used as a control comparison. It will give us a better understanding of the effects of a high-nicotine device in the morning. Do you have any other questions?",
            "Given the above considerations, I suggest the inclusion of both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. For quantitative data, I propose that we measure blood and plasma concentrations of nicotine, metabolites, and other relevant biomarkers. This will allow us to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the test products. To capture the subjective effects, I recommend including subject diaries or surveys, which would allow subjects to report on their use of each product and any related side effects. Additionally, I suggest that blood pressure and heart rate measurements be taken mid- and post-use to evaluate potential cardiovascular effects."

            "Great, I'll go over the calculations for you. For this study, we need to estimate the average difference between the mean change in the treatment and control groups, which is the difference we want to detect, as well as the standard and deviation of the difference. Based on our previous discussion, we'll use the motor function assessment tool as the outcome measure. We'll calculate the minimum detectable effect size based on the smallest difference that we would consider clinically meaningful. We'll use an intra-group SD of 9.0, given the nature of this measurement tool, and we'll use 10 participants per group to account for dropouts. 10 squared plus 10 squared is equal to 100, so we'll divide that by the number of groups or cohorts, which is 2. That gives us a sample size of 20 participants per cohort for 100% power at \u03b1=0.05. I'll go through the calculations again in case there's anything I missed. To find the minimum detectable effect size, we calculate the SD of the difference between the treatment and control groups using 9.0 as the intra-group SD. We then take that and raise it to a 0.25 because we want to account for a small effect, given the exploratory nature of the study. That gives us an effect size of 2.29. We then square that number and multiply it by 100 because we want that number as the minimum result we would accept as \"statistically significant.\" So the minimum detectable effect size is 22.9. We then take 22.9 and raise that to the 0.5 power to find the sample size. That gives us a sample size of 22.9 squared or 541.8 for the minimum detectable effect size. Now that we have the minimum detectable effect size, we need to estimate the standard deviation or SD for the difference between the treatment and control groups. We did this previously by calculating the intra-group SD based on previously published research. For this study, the intra-group SD is 9.0 because of the nature of the measurement tool we plan to use. We then multiply that number by the square root of the number of groups or cohorts, which is 2. This gives us an SD",

            "Perfect! We have outlined a solid study design for evaluation of the safety and tolerability of REGN754 in healthy volunteers. The different arms ensure that we have enough flexibility in dose escalation and sufficient safety data at different dose levels. The randomization and blinded treatment ensure rigorous and ethical evaluation of our findings. Let's move onto the next section.  *The preceding example is a fictional vignette but one that closely aligns with the actual design of a clinical trial.\nIn the preceding section, we learned how to determine the type and number of study arms needed based on our objectives. In this section, we will move on to actually designing the study. We'll discuss allocation concealment, randomization, and blinding.\nThroughout the design of the trial, how can we ensure that the treatment arm is not known by the people conducting the study as well as those enrolling participants? Allocation concealment can be achieved through the use of sealed envelopes. Sealed envelopes help ensure that those assessing the data do not know the identity of the treatment, while enrolling participants are not able to see the assignment of sealed envelopes. Randomization can be achieved through Randomization Software or Randomization Treva, software that randomizes by a random number generated by a computer. Blinding, that is, ensuring blinding of participants, investigators, and analysts, is important so as not to influence the outcome through bias, either conscious or unconscious. Bias can include allocation concealment and randomization. Bias can also include double blinding, that is, blinding the participants and the investigators to the treatment group, and triple blinding, that is, blinding the participants, the investigators, and the statistician analyzing the data (often difficult outside of a surgical trial).\nOnce the study arms and number of arms are determined and allocation concealment, randomization, and blinding are considered, we must also specify where to allocate participants and when to conduct our intervention. Specifically, do we want or need to have a placebo? In pivotal trials, a placebo is often needed, as the drug being studied has never been used before. In such cases, a placebo alone provides information on the efficacy of the drug. In some cases, such as surgical"

            "Finalizing the study design and arms Once all the details of the study have been considered and finalized, it's time to finalize the study arms or groups. This is the stage where the study design is reduced to text. Finalizing the study design is an important step that ensures that the research question is appropriately addressed by the study design. Ideally, the finalized study design should be clearly presented, unambiguous, and easily understood by anyone with knowledge of the disease or intervention of interest. Finalizing the study design is particularly critical for prospective trials as it helps to avoid confusion, delays, and other problems during the study implementation phase. Finalising the study design may require several revisions and iterations until it is completely satisfactory. You can use tools such as flow charts, diagrams, or narrative text to finalize the study design. It's essential to include the details of any randomization, blinding or masking procedures, exclusions, and detailed descriptions of the intervention and comparator(s), study population, outcomes, timing and duration, and any other relevant details. Implementation Following finalization of the study design, the information can be used to develop a study implementation plan that includes feasibility studies, budgeting, and timelines. It's also important to develop a data management plan that clearly outlines how data will be collected, stored, and verified throughout the study. A publication or dissemination plan should be developed that includes the intended target audience, venue, and timing of publication or presentation. It's important to involve study stakeholders at this stage to ensure that everyone is on the same page and prepared for the study. Implementation of the study as per the study plan is the next step, where research staff and/or study investigators may face challenges and delays that need to be overcome efficiently to ensure that the study is implemented as per the study plan. In case of any unanticipated events or setbacks, a contingency plan should be developed to minimize disruption to the study. Close monitoring throughout the study is necessary to ensure that the study remains on track, complications are promptly addressed, and appropriate action is taken to protect the safety and well-being of study participants. Evaluation of the study Upon completion of the study, the results are evaluated to determine the strengths, limitations, and overall effectiveness of the study design and implementation.

            "The control group is a critical feature of randomized controlled trials and essential in ensuring a comparison group. It allows us to compare the intervention group to a group receiving the usual care. It also allows us to determine if benefits of the intervention are due to the intervention or nature of the illness. How should the control group be defined? There are several options including active control groups, usual/Best care, wait-list, sham/ placebo control, and no/delayed treatment groups. Since participants in the usual treatment group will likely receive some care outside of the study, we will likely want an intent-to-treat or as-treated analysis. \nThat sounds like a good plan. What do you think about the measurement and timing of the outcomes?  We'd like to measure behavioral problems and clinical outcomes at baseline, post intervention, and follow-up. We may also want to collect cost data. Are there any additional considerations related to our populations, interventions, or measurement? I'm glad you brought that up. The measurement of behavioral problems using established tools and clinical outcomes are well-accepted methods. However, the addition of costs would add important information to the existing knowledge. For example, we could calculate the cost-per-quality-adjusted life-year (cost-QALY) gained. The choice of primary and secondary outcomes is an important consideration as well. These should be selected based on feasibility, meaningful patient-centered outcomes, and fit to the study. Are there any other specific considerations we should be aware of before we move forward with designing the study? I can think of two other important considerations. The first is blinding of the participants and the research team. Second, the sample size calculation and retention of participants are critical to the success of the trial. The sample size should accurately reflect the anticipated effect size and loss to follow-up. We can use power analysis to calculate an appropriate sample size once the study is developed.\nI think we are ready to move forward with the study design. Are there any final suggestions or comments you have before we begin? I would just like to remind you that this is a novel approach and it will take lots of time, hard work, and patience to move the science forward. Let's continue to engage in dialogue and feedback throughout this process.",
            "Based on the above suggestions, I would anticipate that the study would be approved by the ethics board and fundable by the NIDA or NIH. There are active research groups examining this area and I would suggest contacting them for insight into their approach to the study design and statistics.",
            "[instructor] That's an important consideration in any clinical trial, especially if we are investigating a newer or investigational treatment. If the control group is not given the intervention, we cannot say with certainty that the improvement in the treatment group is due to the intervention. However it is important to include a control group, to help us determine the specific effects of the intervention, and to be able to say that the effect is due to the intervention rather than the natural course of the illness, other treatments, or other factors.\nOne of the challenges in the health care setting is making room in the treatment schedule for new interventions, and ensuring that we are providing best available standard care at the same time. In your case, the research protocol would specify which treatments will be provided, and which will be the control group. You could also consider adding either a third arm, with the CoMBI-SMI intervention, but a different control, an active care arm with the intervention, and a third control arm receiving a placebo or inactive treatment. You want to be conscious of the power analysis for the study, and ensure that you have adequate sample size, to address any of the research hypothesis you're formulating your research protocol is important to ensure that we have adequate sample size, to addressing your questions about formulating your research protocols about the adequate sample size, to ensure you have a sample size to questionnaire you questions about formulating research hypotheses about the treatment.

By combining the suprascapular nerve and superficial cervical plexus block, we can potentially decrease these unintended consequences while maintaining adequate pain relief. This is of particular relevance in high-risk patients or patients with pre-existing lung disease.

[Participant] I still don't understand the criteria for the exclusion of participants, specifically point number 6. What is a serious allergic reaction? [Narrator] A serious allergic reaction is any life-threatening reaction that requires the use of epinephrine or the use of a respirator. [Participant] What is a negative serum pregnancy test? [Narrator] A negative serum pregnancy test means that the test result was below the minimum threshold of the test kit. [Participant] Can you repeat that? [Narrator] The minimum threshold of the test kit is the lowest level of pregnancy hormone (\u03b2-hCG) that can be detected by the test. [Participant] What does antimitotic mean? [Narrator] An antimitotic is a medication used to slow or stop the growth of living cells and is commonly used in cancer treatment. [Participant] What is an immunosuppressive medication? [Narrator] Immunosuppressive medications are drugs that suppress the activity of the immune system. [Participant] What does planned bowel surgery mean? [Narrator] Planned bowel surgery is anticipated bowel surgery that is not an emergency procedure. [Participant] But what about unplanned bowel surgery? [Narrator] Unplanned bowel surgery is any surgical procedure that is necessary and done without prior planning. [Participant] Can you explain the difference between an active skin disease other than HS and a history of active skin disease other than HS? [Narrator] An active skin disease other than HS is any chronic, inflammatory skin disease that requires ongoing treatment. A history of active skin disease other than HS is a past diagnosis of a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that has been resolved, but may require additional treatment.

            "The placebo comparator arm, entitled \"Placebo: Sham Treatment,\" will also include obese subjects with Type 2 Diabetes. To maintain blinding, participants in the placebo comparator arm will receive a sham treatment that does not involve any medication. The primary purpose of this arm is to compare the efficacy of HU6 with the placebo. When designing your trial, always make sure that the design clearly outlines the comparison between the active treatment you're studying and a sham comparator.\nThe two study arms are now defined. The next thing to do is to develop an inclusion/exclusion criteria worksheet where you list all the factors that will qualify or disqualify a subject from being included in the trial. For example, there may be certain requirements for age, gender, medical history, and medications. Perhaps there are certain laboratory values that need to be within certain ranges. Specify each criterion and list the rationale for it. Doing this up front prevents subjects from wasting time and resources by screening out those who do not meet the parameters before they get to the phase of the trial where more resources are required.  The inclusion/exclusion criteria should be designed based on factors that may affect the safety and efficacy of the intervention being studied. After you have your inclusion/exclusion criteria set up, the next step in protocol development is determining the number of subjects to include and the sample size needed for statistical analysis. As a rough guideline, you should plan for 10-20% \"intention to treat\" (ITT) dropouts. This is based on past experience of about 1/5-1/4 of participants dropping out before the end of a trial. Using that as a basis, you would plan your trial so that you can enroll 20-40 subjects for every agent that you are testing. If some of those drop out due to medical reasons beyond your control, you'll still have the number of subjects needed for the trial. You should also decide on the randomization scheme, where to conduct the study, what lab measurements to make, whether to do dose escalation, and how to handle adverse events as well as other issues specific to the type of study you plan to conduct. By working through these general steps and coming up with a detailed protocol, you will better understand the study design, its feasibility, and potential challeng",

The study design is a 10-day, randomized single-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in female patients. Twenty female patients with a confirmed diagnosis of chronic bacterial cystitis were randomized to receive Raphamin or match placebo. Although it is felt that Raphamin provides a great advantage over the current treatments in efficiency and side effect profile, several deaths have occurred in earlier studies in which Raphamin was given to patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min). In the present study, only mildly symptomatic patients were enrolled (no fever, no recent UTIs, and no new-onset hematuria). One woman in the Raphamin arm dies of \"flu-like symptoms,\" while another developed seizures and is hospitalized. Subsequent review of the data revealed that 8 of the 18 subjects in the placebo group had mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min), which should have excluded them from enrollment. The data from the trial are complete and the drug has performed extremely well (76% efficacy). There is controversy about whether the additional lives saved by using Raphamin outweigh the additional lives lost due to renal insufficency.\nRaphamin has a good chance of receiving approval by the FDA even with the deaths. The design of the study was appropriate under the circumstances and the IRB felt that the risk- benefit ratio was acceptable.

Protocol 1 randomizes men with FDG-PET-defined PET-avid disease to MDRT versus SOC ADT, whereas protocol 2 randomizes men without PET-avid disease to receive either MDRT or SOC ADT. Men randomized to SOC ADT receive the standard, nonrandomized treatment typically provided at the participating investigator center according to the site's preferences.\nThis clinical research study is powered to detect a statistically significant improvement in overall survival of 24% in protocol 1 and a statistically significant improvement in the 3-year time-to-events such as progression or death from mHSPC of 75% in protocol 2."

In recent times, the use of double surgical gloves has gained popularity due to their perceived better efficacy in preventing needle perforation. However, there is limited evidence from randomized control trials comparing double glove use to single glove use. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of double surgical gloves in reducing the rate of needle perforations during orthopedic surgery. [SPONSOR/CRO], in association with [INSERT RECIPIENT/INVESTIGATOR], are conducting this randomized control trial in [INSERT BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH SETTING]. Up to [NUMBER] orthopedic surgeons and surgical faculty at [INSERT NAME OF HOSPITAL/CLINIC] will participate in the study. [INSERT STUDY POPULATION HERE] participants will be randomly allocated to use either double or single surgical gloves and complete a study period of [NUMBER] months. The primary endpoint will be the rate of glove perforations during surgery. Secondary endpoints will include assessment of surgical team motivation to use double gloves and perforations per case. Data will be collected through chart abstraction and direct observation. This study will provide evidence about the efficacy of double gloves in preventing needle punctures during orthopedic surgery.

Can you please provide me with a mock scenario? [/B/W] Sure! Here's a mock scenario for a clinical trial design: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new drug, Prozac. The study involves a single group of 30 participants with major depressive disorder, who are randomly assigned to either receive Prozac or a placebo pill for 6 months. The primary outcome measure will be change in scores on a depression scale from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcome measures will include changes in quality of life, self-esteem, and sleep quality. Participants will be evaluated at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months.\nThe advantages of this study include a relatively short duration (6 months) and the use of a proven drug with a good safety profile.

A single dose is given to a small number of healthy subjects, and pharmacokinetics of this dose are studied.\nStage 1 (Phase 1): Include studies that involve a limited number of subjects who receive the drug for the first time. Monitoring of very low doses to rule out severe drug toxicity is also done here.\nStage 2 (Phase 2): This phase involves a limited treatment course of increasing doses of the drug, with a main focus on safety and dosage.  Effects on a disease target are observed.\nStage 3 (Phase 3): this phase involves a larger number of subjects who receive the investigated drug for the first time.  Outcomes are monitored, and side effects are documented.\nStage 4 (Phase 4): also known as post-marketing surveillance.

These engineered T cells are then infused back into the patient s blood or bone marrow, where they localize to the antigen-expressing multiple myeloma cells and secrete cytokines that mediate cell death.

Now, for the control/comparison arm, how should we frame the intervention/treatment?  As the intervention for the first arm is the 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT imaging, for the control/comparison arm, we should consider the standard of care for renal tumor imaging, which may be a CT/Ultrasound scan, or based on the standard clinical practice in your institution, region, or country, etc.",

Comparing the results between the two arms can help us determine the diagnostic benefit of 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT. I think we're making great progress. How should we define the outcomes of interest for our study? [INV] The primary outcome of interest is detecting renal tumors. The secondary outcomes of interest are tumor size and staging for each arm. [/IND] Excellent choices! Detecting renal tumors is the top priority, as it gives us a clearcut measure of the study's success. Tumor size and staging provide valuable information about the characteristics and extent of the tumor. And we want to evaluate both the intervention and control groups to ensure our findings are unbiased. Now, how should we define the study timeline? [ID]We plan to recruit participants and conduct 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT imaging for all participants before the trial begins and then re-scan the patients after 6 months. We will monitor the groups for any major adverse events and follow up with survival/recurrence data at one year. [/IND] Good choice! Assessing renal tumors at baseline and then again after 6 months allows us to monitor the tumors' growth and response to treatment. The follow-up at 1 year helps us determine the durability of the effects. How should we plan for randomization and blinding? [INV] We plan to randomize patients one:one to either receive 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT imaging or the standard imaging modality using block randomization. We will maintain blinding to group assignment until the end of the study. [/IND] Randomization ensures that the treatment groups are comparable at baseline, and blinding helps prevent biased results. This is essential for this type of study, as the intervention is known and cannot be masked. How should we define the statistical analysis plan?

Including a healthy control group allows us to compare the results from 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT and standard imaging in renal tumor patients with those in healthy volunteers, accounting for any potential confounding factors. Now, what would you suggest as the intervention or treatment for the third arm? 18F-FAPI-RGD may cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. To minimize these side effects, what would you suggest for the third arm as the intervention or treatment? 18F-FAPI-RGD is a very expensive imaging agent and not yet widely available. To ensure fair comparison with the standard imaging, what would you suggest as the intervention or treatment for the third arm?",

Now that we have defined our arms, let's discuss the primary endpoint of the study. What should be the primary endpoint of the study?",

This will help ensure that those arms are randomized equally. The \"1\" arm will receive 18F-FAPI-RGD, and the \"0\" arm will receive a control intervention (e.g., saline) unless you plan to use a healthy control group, in which case it will be labeled healthy control.

Study 3: Arm C - Septic Shock: Patients in this arm would be mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock. Study 4: Arm D: Patients with severe TBI or burns. What do you think?  [INSTR] I think these changes make the protocol more clear and concise.  [/INSTR] Great! Let's proceed with the submission."

Secondly, I think it would be better to use a crossed-over parallel model rather than a parallel model with two treatment arms. A crossed over design is more likely to ensure equal exposure of the participants to both arms as would be the case with a crossover design. Finally, the open label design is not ideal as it may affect the outcome in one or both of the arms.",

In this arm, participants will wear the OBI with a surgical waistband to provide additional support for the device and also to ensure that it remains in place throughout the study period. The use of a waistband will help to reduce the risk of it accidentally coming off during daily activities.",

Secondary outcome measures of the clinical trial include assessments of cost-effectiveness and qualify of life measures.\nClinical trials are research studies that investigate new treatments in children and adults. Most clinical trials test new drugs or treatments. Clinical trials test many kinds of treatments, including new drugs, new ways of using existing medications, new treatments that combine different types of therapies, or new approaches to surgery or other treatments. Treatments that are proven to be beneficial in clinical trials can then be used for many people.",
            "Research has shown that if a participant thinks they are receiving a treatment, but they are actually receiving a sham or placebo, they can still show improvement. This is known as the placebo response. So, by including both the experimental and sham comparator arms in the trial, we can better assess the true response to the experimental treatment.",
            "That's correct! Allocating participants randomly to either the experimental or sham comparator arm is an important step in ensuring the integrity of the clinical trial and minimizing the impact of bias.",
            "Yes, blinding is critical for ensuring the integrity of the trial and interpreting results, and will help minimize the risk of data being influenced by knowledge of treatment assignment. In this case, participants and investigators administering the treatment will be blinded to the arm they are on, in addition, data analysts will be blinded to group assignments until the study is complete.",

A popular tissue conditioner is scaling liquid. Another option is saliva, which can be used as a purging agent to help clear debris from the gingival region prior to or during cementation. Lastly, some dental professionals use soda blasting to elevate margins. Soda blasting involves shooting small glass particles at a high speed onto the tooth surface to gently remove cement and debris from the gingival region. The choice of deep margin elevation material depends on the specific circumstances of each case, including the level of debris accumulation, the nature of the restoration to be cemented, and the patient's personal health status.

            "Here you should summarize the full treatment arms from phase 1 through phase 4. Note: Adapt the example below to meet the specific design of your clinical trial.\nThis summary is to be provided when necessary in order to describe the general steps or phases in the plan of treatment for the patient.\nBecause patients with osteosarcoma have a variety of treatment options and because the optimal therapy is strongly influenced by the stage at diagnosis, it is important to provide a general summary of the treatment phases for each disease stage. General Treatment Strategies for the Initial Management of Metastatic Osteosarcoma The decision to perform surgery in a patient with metastatic osteosarcoma depends on several factors including the patient\u2019s performance status, location and extent of the metastasis, prior therapy, and presence of any significant comorbid conditions.  If the performance status is good and the tumor is detected at one site, surgery and chemotherapeutic therapy is the first line of treatment.  If the tumor is detected at several sites, the main goals of the initial approach can include pain control and stabilization of the neuro-musculoskeletal system to avoid surgical complications and maintain function. Radiation to the primary tumor site as well as to sites of active metastasis and any sites of active disease may be considered. This approach is mainly used for patients with unresectable disease (e.g., pelvic or rib involvement). If there is doubt about the exact size, location, and extent of metastases, staging studies such as a computed tomopraphy (CT) scan may be helpful.  After induction therapy, the main goal of therapy in patients with disease limited to bone is complete resection. If there are multiple sites of disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be considered to obtain a complete tumor necrosis or control of locally advanced disease before surgery. Radiation may also be used to treat persistent disease after surgery.\nIf the patient is not a candidate for surgery, initial treatment involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.  Neoadjuvant or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation are used if feasible. If not, the initial treatment can be sequential chemotherapy and radiation.  Chemotherapy is typically administered until the lesions have shrunk"

            "This is where things go wrong.\nThe sponsor decides they want to use UFR+IVUS and fractional flow reserve as an active treatment arm.\nThe only difference between this design and the ideal study is that IVUS/FFR is being used as an intervention. If UFR and FFR are inaccurate for assessing stenosis severity, then using IVUS and FFR to guide treatment will lead to suboptimal medical therapy (and unnecessary procedures), and hence worse outcomes for patients. FFR is a good test (as are all the tests you propose using), but it\u2019s no better than the tests which you propose. What sense does it make to use an inferior test as a comparator?",

I'll now proceed to capture this information. Before closing, is there anything else you would like to add?",

            "The participants in the control or comparison group for the experimental arm should be randomly assigned to a control or placebo group. The control arm should receive either no intervention or standard obstetric management for a non-vertex presenting twin. So, is that agreed?",
            "Correct. The inclusion criteria are that participants must be at or after 24 weeks gestation, have had no prior cesarean delivery, and have a nonvertex presenting fetus. The goal of this arm is to assess the effectiveness and safety of a procedure. The last group you need to identify for the study is the control, or comparison, group/arm. Which of the following do you suggest for that?",
            "That's a sound plan. Now we've gone through all the study arms, can you suggest a study name and a brief explanation?",
            "That's very thorough. With both the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria clearly defined, along with the intervention or treatment arm for the control group and the actual intervention for the experimental group, we are ready to move on to the sample size estimation. Since it is a clinical trial, how many subjects will be needed for this study? \u2753 I'd like to go over the sample size estimation in some detail, since the sample size can vary depending on the type of study, but it is important to develop an accurate estimate for the number of subjects needed. Based on our design, we need 200 subjects in each group, for a total of 400 subjects enrolled in the study. This gives us a 20% cushion for participant dropout or loss to follow up, and we should be able to detect a highly significant difference of 20% between the groups with 90% power. This is a high powered study that will provide us with very strong evidence regarding the effectiveness of the external cephalic version procedure. 40"

The informed consent process is a necessary step in clinical research, and it helps to protect the rights and welfare of participants. It also helps to ensure the credibility of the research and the accuracy of the data. The process usually starts with a discussion between the potential participant and the research team, where they are provided with information about the study's purpose, procedures, expected benefits and risks, and alternative treatments. The prospective participant is asked to sign an informed consent form after they have read and understood the information. If the participant chooses to join the study, they will be asked to sign the form, which is legal assent to participate. If a minor is participating, a parent or legal guardian must also give their assent. Before deciding to participate in a clinical trial, potential participants should receive enough information \u2013 in an understandable form \u2013 about the potential risks and benefits of the study to make a well-informed decision. With this knowledge, the participant can make an informed decision about whether to accept or decline study participation.
