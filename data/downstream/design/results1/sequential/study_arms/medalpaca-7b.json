            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
