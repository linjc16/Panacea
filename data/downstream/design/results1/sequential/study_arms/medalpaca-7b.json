Providing education on sexual life during pregnancy can help pregnant women better understand and navigate their sexuality during this period. The two hours of individual and face-to-face training, along with the homework assignments and information booklet, are designed to empower pregnant women to communicate with their partners, address concerns, and explore alternative ways to maintain intimacy during pregnancy.\n\n2. No Intervention: CONTROL\n- Participant Group/Arm: Pregnant women in the control group\n- Intervention/Treatment: None\n- Reasoning: This study arm serves as a comparison group to evaluate the effectiveness of the sexual education intervention. By not providing any specific treatment other than routine procedures, the control group allows researchers to observe any changes in attitudes towards sexuality and sexual response among pregnant women without the educational intervention.

The intermittent form will have inflation and release of cuffs 5 sessions a week for 12 weeks. The continuous form requires one uninterrupted inflation till the end of the week. After the treatment period, participants will be subjected to a follow-up evaluation to determine the adverse effects, complications, safety, and performance in the exercise sessions. To rule out the Hawthorne effect, we will include a second group that will perform only stretching exercises for a comparable period. Would you prefer an open-label or a blinded design?",

            "For the Vedolizumab arm, we'll include all patients with Crohn's Disease who could benefit from vedolizumab therapy. 5.6 Design and statistical considerations The selection of appropriate design for the proposed research study will depend on the type of research question being asked, for instance, should the research be an observational or an interventional study. A treatment vs control approach could be adopted where in the treatment group will receive an experimental treatment,  intervention or a new drug and the control group will receive the usual treatment, common practice, or drug. A crossover design can be used when the aim is to compare the two treatment groups. In case of a chronic illness like Crohn\u2019s disease where the condition can be treated on and off and patient will experience periods of symptom-free and symptomatic state a within-subjects repeated measures design may be appropriate. In the within-subjects repeated measures design a participant is a subject for himself since he is measuring his/her responses at different time points. The following are the factors that can be varied: \u2751 Treatment: Active treatment (Treatment of choice) & Placebo (or an alternate treatment) \u2751 Time: Interval between 2 assessments within the same participant \u2751 Dose (High dose & Low dose): This can be done by treating group & not in within subjects. For example in the treatment of ulcer disease, a patient may be treated with a high dose of antacid for a period before the measurement is taken, the measurement are compared to his usual response(s) \u2751 Method of administration: Oral & rectal The selection aims to study the dose, time, and method of administration of a drug or treatment. 5.7 Ethical issues In the selection of an appropriate design for a research will depend on the research question and the nature of the research being undertaken. There are ethical concerns that needs to be addressed in all research especially a clinical trial. Clinical Trials are broadly classified into phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the ethical requirements differ.

If you could illustrate a parallel assignment flowchart or describe how it works, that would be very helpful.  [Normal text]Sure, parallel assignment works like this: [Normal text] Participants are assigned to their respective groups once all eligibility requirements are met. That's it. Participants are only in one group for the entire study. [Normal text] I see. I guess you'd need to ensure some kind of randomization at the individual level then to ensure equal groups. [Normal text] Let me explain how this can work. [Normal text]Parallel assignment isn't completely random but can produce comparably equivalent groups. [Normal text] The way it works is that after meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the next available group number is assigned. [Normal text] Imagine there are 70 participants in total - 40 are randomized to the control group and 30 to the treatment group. [Normal text] When the next participant eligibility requirement is met, they're assigned group number 30, which is assigned to the treatment group. [Normal text] If the next participant would have been eligible a few spots later, they'd have been group 31, which is assigned to the control group due to the randomization. [Normal text] Do you see? The first participant in the group is assigned early so they get the treatment, but subsequent participants are assigned to the control group using randomization. [Normal text] If there are many participants, there's still a chance randomization won't produce equal groups, but it's better than just assigning participants sequentially. [Normal text] I had previously been using 1-2-3-4-5 etc. but will try your approach this time around. [Normal text] Great, please let me know your findings. You should be able to avoid the time lag associated with randomization while ensuring some degree of allocation concealment.

During our formative research, we found that participants were resistant to behavioral interventions, especially those who were skeptical about behavioral interventions, such as female sex workers. It was also based on our experience from similar studies where participants were not ready to adopt new behaviors after short-term behavioral interventions.  We were also concerned that if we did not provide a clear comparison group, it would be difficult to prove the impact of the behavioral intervention. Therefore, we decided to have a comparison arm that received a minimal didactic intervention to ensure a comparison group.

Outcomes will be evaluated through measuring the hospital length stay, inflammatory markers such as CRP and CRP/albumin ratio, and the development of postoperative complications. This arm aims to assess the impact of Zinc supplementation on postoperative outcomes in children with Hirschsprung disease.\n\n2. No Intervention: Control\n   - Participant Group/Arm: 25 children diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease and planned for elective surgery\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Standard care without Zinc supplementation\n   - Details: Participants in this arm will receive the standard care provided for the cases and will not be supplemented with Zinc. Outcomes will be evaluated by measuring the hospital length stay, inflammatory markers, and the development of postoperative complications. This arm serves as the control group to compare the outcomes of the experimental group receiving Zinc supplementation.\n\nDo you have any other questions or is there anything else I can assist you with?"

            "Let's review the inclusion and exclusion criteria from the previous example with some additional explanations. We can see that inclusion criteria 1, 2, and 3 are the same. However, we did state that the first criterion was altered to include burns received within the last 7 days. The reason for this is to ensure that the burns do not get older and the wounds start to heal. By having an inclusion period of only 7 days, it will restrict the study to new burns only.\nThe exclusion criteria were also altered. Exclusion criterion 4 was changed from no history of renal or liver disease to no recent surgery in the last 7 days. Because surgery in the last 7 days can cause a change in renal or liver function, it was decided to exclude any patient who has had surgery in the last 7 days. Exclusion criterion 5 was changed from no history of metabolic disease to no history of psychiatric disease. Psychiatric disease may alter hemodynamics and thus, affect the readings taken while the patient is undergoing fluid resuscitation. By excluding patients with a history of psychiatric disease, it ensures a baseline measure of hemodynamics can be taken prior to fluid resuscitation.\nThe next section will cover how to define the specific aims of the study.",

Group B (Control): Crystalloid group: Paediatric solution will be administered according to weight. Designed as a study to assess the role of albumin in fluid resuscitation in pediatric burns. 3.\nOutcome: Primary outcome is fluid requirements on day 2. Secondary outcome is hospital stay and infections. So, what do you think?  Do you think this is a well-designed protocol?  [/] I think this is a good protocol. In fact, I think it's too good. We should definitely add something to increase the statistical power. The issue with this protocol is that it may not be able to detect a difference if there is a very small difference between the two groups. Do you have any ideas to improve it?  [/] One way to improve the protocol is to increase the sample size. An increase in sample size would mean increasing the number of patients randomized in each group. We can also add a secondary outcome other than fluid requirements and infections such as the length of hospital stay. Do you agree?  [/] Yes, I agree. We could also consider other parameters such as the intensity of pain or quality of wound healing. However, we should be careful not to overload the protocol with too many secondary outcomes. We could also consider adding a third study arm where albumin is administered at a high dose. This would further strengthen the protocol. However, we should be careful not to increase the risks of administering excessive albumin as that can be harmful. What do you think? 4. [/] I think the protocol is great! I would love to run this study in our hospital. Is there anything I can do to help you? [/] Absolutely! You can help by submitting the protocol to your Institutional Review Board (IRB) for approval. You can also help by identifying suitable recruitment sites where we can enroll patients. Do you have access to a database of institutions dealing with burns? 5.

            "Got it. Now, let's focus on the study arms. Based on the information you've provided so far, I can suggest the following study arms:\n\n1. Experimental Arm (CM313 Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 30 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive CM313.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of CM313 injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: This arm is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of CM313 in treating immune thrombocytopenia. By administering CM313 to a subset of patients, researchers can evaluate the drug's effectiveness in improving platelet counts and reducing symptoms. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design ensures unbiased results and allows for comparison with the placebo arm.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator Arm (Placebo Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 15 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive placebo.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of placebo injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: The placebo comparator arm is essential to establish the baseline for comparison with the CM313 intervention arm. By including a placebo group, researchers can assess the true effects of CM313 beyond any placebo effects. This arm helps to control for confounding variables and provides a more accurate assessment of the drug's efficacy and safety.",

Let's move on to sample size estimation.\nSample size estimation is an important part of protocol development and an integral component of protocol review. Estimating the sample size for a clinical trial requires several factors, including the effect size, precision, alpha level, and beta error rate. Alpha and beta rates are critical because they determine the statistical power of the study. In general, the alpha level is usually set at 0.05, and the beta error rate is set at 0.20.\nOnce we have the alpha and beta errors established, we need to determine the power of the study. Power refers to the probability of detecting a treatment effect if it exists. For example, if the power is 0.80, it means that if the treatment does have an effect, we will detect it 80% of the time. How many participants we need to include in the study depends on what we are measuring and the precision of the measurements. A clinical trial may need to recruit several hundred or even a few thousand participants to be able to detect a treatment effect with sufficient precision.\nHow long it takes to reach a targeted sample size depends on the study design, the drug under study, and the effect size. In some cases, it may take several years to reach the sample size required. However, it's important to be honest about time requirements in clinical trial design to avoid delays and to make sure the study does not exceed the funds available or the participants' willingness to participate.\nThe sample size estimation is critical because it helps us determine whether the study is likely to be successful. Poorly designed studies can waste money, time, and resources, whereas well-designed studies save them. By carefully considering the sample size in the protocol planning stage, we can increase the chances of a successful clinical trial."

We use modern cryptographic protocols and secure communication channels to ensure that no outsiders can intercept the data. We make sure all the connections are encrypted as much as possible and that only people who are allowed to see the data can access it. We also store the data on a secured server, in a physically secured location.\nWe take appropriate steps to protect personal identifiers, the participants' health information does not leak. Even our staff is subjected to confidentiality agreements to never reveal the contents of the patients' messages and answer to them in a timely and professional manner. We also ensure all our staff has a proper background and is trained in the privacy rules of our system.\nAnother privacy challenge is to ensure participants' anonymity. The chatbot does not contain any identifying information about them which can later aid in identify them. We use only anonymized data for analyzing purposes.

Experimental: Virtual Intensive Outpatient Program\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Virtual Intensive Outpatient Program\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is the main focus of the trial, as it involves the implementation and evaluation of the virtual intensive outpatient program. Participants will receive a comprehensive treatment plan that includes daily psychotherapy groups, weekly individual therapy, medication management, and daily breathalyzer monitoring. This arm is essential for assessing the effectiveness of the virtual program in replicating the structure and abstinence monitoring of a residential treatment program.\n\n2. Control: No Treatment\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder\n   - Intervention/Treatment: No Treatment\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as a control group to compare the outcomes of participants who receive the virtual intensive outpatient program with those who do not receive any treatment. By including a control group, researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual program in comparison to no treatment, providing valuable insights into the impact of the intervention.",

The first one is primary surgical tumor resection with anastomosis or only tumor resection without anastomosis. The intervention/treatment for this arm is primary tumor resection. This arm is crucial as it represents the standard approach for treating obstructive left colon cancer. It allows for the comparison between patients undergoing primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis or without an anastomosis (Hartmann's procedure). This comparison will help determine the optimal surgical approach for these patients in terms of outcomes such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. What are your thoughts on this arm?",

We can modify the intervention/treatment description to specify primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis, associated with or without a diverting loop ileostomy. This modification will allow us to analyze the impact of diverting loop ileostomy on stoma rate and quality of life. Thank you for your input! Now, let's move on to the second participant group/arm. This arm involves endoscopic stent positioning. The intervention/treatment is staged resection after endoscopic stenting with Self-expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS). This arm is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic stenting as a bridge to surgery for patients with obstructive left colon cancer. By comparing this approach with primary surgical tumor resection, we can assess the outcomes and benefits of each strategy, such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and timing of chemotherapy initiation. This comparison will provide valuable information for clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment option for these patients. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "Absolutely. The comparison of outcomes between these two arms will contribute significantly to the understanding of the benefits and risks associated with each approach. Now that we have discussed both arms, here are the full study arms for the clinical trial:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. Participant Group/Arm: Primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis (associated or not with a diverting loop ileostomy) or without a primary anastomosis (Hartmann's procedure)\n   Intervention/Treatment: Procedure: primary tumor resection\n\n2. Participant Group/Arm: Endoscopic stent positioning\n   Intervention/Treatment: Staged resection after endoscopic stenting with Self-expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS)\n\nThese study arms will enable researchers to compare different treatment approaches for obstructive left colon cancer and provide valuable insights into optimal management strategies."

            "The study is now designed. Once all essential elements are in place, it's time to prepare the clinical trial protocol. This document outlines the rationale for the study, the objectives, the design, the target population, eligibility and exclusion criteria, the inclusion and exclusion protocols, the statistical considerations, the quality control and monitoring plans, the data analysis plan, and the ethical considerations. During the protocol preparation stage, any potential issues that may arise during the study must also be addressed and resolved before the study begins. For example, a contingency plan may need to be created in the event that a participant experiences a futile adverse event, such as a severe allergic reaction to a study drug. Once the protocol is finalized, the next step is to obtain the required approvals and authorizations from appropriate regulatory bodies to conduct the trial. If necessary, an independent ethics committee or institutional review board (IRB) must review and approve the study protocol, and informed consent forms for study participants must be approved as well. Additionally, any interactions with industry must be coordinated, and any regulatory requirements related to the conduct of clinical trials must be met. Once all regulatory approvals are obtained, the trial can begin recruiting participants, and the study can proceed as planned. The clinical trial process is often iterative and can require a lot of time and effort, but it's essential to ensuring the safety and efficacy of new treatments. What else is there to consider?",

Now, let's discuss the duration of the intervention. 6 weeks seems like a reasonable duration for the well-being intervention, but is it too short for the classic museum intervention? 6 weeks should be fine for the classic intervention. What do you think? 8 weeks might be even better for the well-being intervention, and participants might need more time to fully experience the effects of the well-being intervention. 8 weeks should be fine for the classic museum intervention. 2 weeks might be too short for the well-being intervention, as participants might not develop a routine of visiting museums regularly after the study. 2 weeks might also be too long for the classic museum intervention, as participants might not see any benefits after just 2 visits. Let's agree on 6 weeks for the well-being intervention and 8 weeks for the classic museum intervention. Finally, what do you think about the outcome measurement? Cardiac function should definitely be measured to evaluate the impact of the interventions on the cardiac system. Psychological well-being should be measured as well to explore the benefits of the well-being intervention. Are there any other outcomes that should be included? Perhaps subjective ratings of engagement with the museum visit should be included as well. Other aspects of psychological well-being, such as stress or anxiety symptoms, might be relevant as well. Let's include a measure of subjective ratings of the engagement with the museum visit, as well as psychological well-being and cardiac function outcomes. What else should we measure? Any other outcomes that we might want to consider? 3D. It would be interesting to measure physiological markers of stress and inflammation before and after the intervention to evaluate any physiological differences between the two groups. We could also look at biomarkers of the immune system, such as levels of cytokines or inflammatory proteins. How should we randomize participants to the two groups to ensure the study is blinded? We should randomize participants to the well-being intervention and the classic museum intervention to ensure neither participants nor the staff know which group each participant is in. 3E.

This arm will include all patients operated for complete cytoreductive surgery and who have signed the informed consent form. The intervention for this arm will be the epigastric lymph node biopsy, which will be performed to evaluate the rate of dissemination of ovarian carcinomatosis through this pathway. This arm will help investigate the role of the IELN basin as a possible systemic metastatic pathway in patients with OPM. What do you think about this suggestion?",

The primary purpose of this diagnostic arm is to evaluate the rate of dissemination of ovarian carcinomatosis through the IELN basin. By analyzing the epigastric lymph nodes, we aim to identify a new biomarker predictive of the pattern of progression of OPM and the risk for systemic dissemination.

Since we already have the experimental arm focusing on patients undergoing complete cytoreductive surgery, we can consider creating another arm to compare the outcomes of patients who do not undergo the epigastric lymph node biopsy. This arm could serve as a control group to evaluate the impact of the intervention. What do you think about this idea?",

The required sample size depends on too many factors to lay out here (for example, the effect size, the variance, and the correlation between observations). However, one simple formula used in clinical trials estimation is: Sample Size = Z2Xpq/2*[1-beta], where Z is the standard normal distribution with a given \u03b1/2, p is the frequency of the disease in the population, and q is the frequency of the disease in the control population, and \u03b2 is 1-\u03b2.

            "The consent form provided to the subject is to be signed and dated by the study participant before the initiation of the study. The sponsor (independent or otherwise) will maintain a signed consent form for a minimum of three years past the study conclusion. 8 Recruitment 8.1 Recruitment Strategies Participant recruitment is one of the most challenging tasks of conducting a study. Recruitment will vary depending on the population of interest, the type of study design, and the type of study site (e.g., clinic, school). For some studies, social media recruitment may also be an option. When devising a recruitment strategy, consider the following: Will there be a need for screening of potential participants? Will there be a screening instrument? What types of participants will be eligible and ineligible? Who can participate (e.g., any patient with a specific diagnosis or only those diagnosed within a specific timeframe)? What locations (e.g., only a specific clinic or research site, or can participants be recruited at home) should be targeted? What methods of recruitment will be used (e.g., posting flyers, mailing, advertisements, social media)? To what populations will the announcement be directed (e.g., patients only, community residents, employees of a particular organization)? How many participants should be enrolled? How will participants be retained? What monitoring mechanisms will be in place to track the flow of participants through different stages of the study? Recruitment of study participants typically begins at the planning stage of the study, not after IRB review. In some cases, a recruitment plan may have to be modified during the study due to lower than expected or higher than anticipated enrollment numbers.\n8.2 Recruitment Procedures The following procedures are suggested for participants who agree to be contacted about study opportunities: Initial Contact All recruitment contacts should begin with the establishment of contact information for the prospective participant (including address, telephone and e-mail addresses). A written or verbal description of the research study should then be provided. The purpose of the research should be explained and a voluntary participation request should be made. Consent should never be oral\u2014consent forms must be signed and dated before any study-related procedures occur, including provision of information about the research.",
            "Great, and what other key details of the study design would you like to discuss?\n7.4.4 Inserting the Overview and Background Information Chapter 7 discussed the importance of summarizing the background information in a concise, catchy overview, and providing references to more detailed background information for the reader who is interested in obtaining more information. Here is an example (Figure 7.3). 7.5 Concluding Remarks\nHere is where you wrap up the entire research plan with a few sentences summarizing the key elements of the protocol and your thoughts about its feasibility. This section will be the last section of the protocol and should include the statement, \"Signed (date), (names of physician, researcher, and investigator).\" [INST 2] This concludes the protocol.

            "Although the above is an example, similar discussions occur throughout the protocol development process. The protocols in the GRADE pro forma will not be as concise, but will follow the same general format. The rationale for each question is important in guiding the study design and in justifying why you recommend a particular outcome. In the end, a strong rationale will make your study more informative. It will provide the foundation upon which all the details of the protocol will be built.",

The active comparator arm could involve patients with periodontitis receiving non-surgical periodontal treatment performed with Minimally Invasive Non-Surgical Therapy (MINST) approach. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely. The placebo comparator arm with quadrant Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) serves as the control group in the study. SRP is a commonly used treatment for periodontitis, and by comparing its effectiveness to the experimental MINST treatment, we can determine the impact of MINST on clinical and serum parameters. The active comparator arm with MINST treatment is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of the new treatment approach. By comparing the outcomes of this arm with the control arm, we can assess the effectiveness of MINST. Does that clarify the reasons for each study arm?",
