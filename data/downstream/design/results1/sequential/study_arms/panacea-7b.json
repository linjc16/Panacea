            "Great! Now let's move on to the second study arm. I suggest creating an active comparator arm where participants receive only behavioral health behavior change counseling. The counseling sessions can focus on pain management and self-efficacy strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Excellent! Now, for the third study arm, we can integrate motivational interviewing and a web-enabled, 5-session group self-management class in addition to the standard back pain rehabilitation program. This will help us assess the impact of adding motivational interviewing to the self-management program. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Perfect! Just to ensure clarity, here are the full study arms we have designed based on our conversation:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. No Intervention: Control group\n2. Self-management program alone\n3. Self-management program with health behavior change counseling"

            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
