            "As you mentioned before, the patients in the control group will not receive any intervention. Do you have any other study arms in mind that you would like to include?",
            "Great! We can now focus on the third study arm, which will involve the behavioral health behavior change counseling intervention. We could have participants receive the counseling from a trained counselor over the phone or video call for up to 26 weeks. What do you think? \nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that tests the feasibility of the intervention being delivered to participants in the primary care setting compared to a group-based virtual setting. Participants will be older adults with chronic low back pain with a primary care referral. Participants will be randomized to either an arm that receives behavioral health behavior change counseling or an arm that receives the nurse-led self-management program. The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility of the procedures of conducting a fully powered study to address these important questions in a larger setting.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to assess the effectiveness of behavioral health behavior change (BHBC) intervention delivered through a nurse-led self-management group in comparison to a nurse-delivered self-management group on reducing disability and pain in older adults with chronic low back pain. This pilot RCT is a two-arm study with a control and treatment group. All participants will receive the nurse self-management program (MSMP) based on the Stanford-OHSU Chronic Disease Self-Management Program. Participants in arm 1 will receive the MSMP plus behavioral health interventions (BH BC) delivered by a trained behavioral health provider in a one-on-one setting. We will use an intention-to-treat analysis to determine pre-post changes in PROMIS Pain, Global Self-Assessment, and the Pain Self-Efficacy questionnaire.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nBehavioral Health Behavior ChangE Intervention Delivered via Nurse-led Self-Management Program on ReductIon of Disability and Pain in Older Adults With Chronic Low Back Pain\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nChronic Low Back Pain\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Behavioral Health Behavior Change Intervention\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: 18 years or older Primary",

            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Perfect! Here are the full study arms for the trial:\n\n1. No Intervention: Control\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants receive no intervention.\n\n2. Active Comparator: Self-management program (SMP)\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks.\nIntervention/Treatment: Behavioral: Self-management program\n- An evidence-based 6-week SMP led by a registered nurse. The SMP is based on the Arthritis Self-Management Program and the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program.\n\n3. Experimental: Self-management program (SMP) with Health Behavior Change Counseling (HBCC)\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks and receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing.\nIntervention/Treatment:\n- Behavioral: Health Behavior Change Counseling\n  * A telephone-based intervention employing principles and practices of motivational interviewing.\n- Behavioral: Self-management program\n  * An evidence-based 6-week SMP led by a registered nurse.
