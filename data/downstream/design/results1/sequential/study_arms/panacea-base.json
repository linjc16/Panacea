Participants will be older adults with chronic low back pain with a primary care referral. Participants will be randomized to either an arm that receives behavioral health behavior change counseling or an arm that receives the nurse-led self-management program. The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility of the procedures of conducting a fully powered study to address these important questions in a larger setting.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to assess the effectiveness of behavioral health behavior change (BHBC) intervention delivered through a nurse-led self-management group in comparison to a nurse-delivered self-management group on reducing disability and pain in older adults with chronic low back pain. This pilot RCT is a two-arm study with a control and treatment group. All participants will receive the nurse self-management program (MSMP) based on the Stanford-OHSU Chronic Disease Self-Management Program. Participants in arm 1 will receive the MSMP plus behavioral health interventions (BH BC) delivered by a trained behavioral health provider in a one-on-one setting. We will use an intention-to-treat analysis to determine pre-post changes in PROMIS Pain, Global Self-Assessment, and the Pain Self-Efficacy questionnaire.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nBehavioral Health Behavior ChangE Intervention Delivered via Nurse-led Self-Management Program on ReductIon of Disability and Pain in Older Adults With Chronic Low Back Pain\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nChronic Low Back Pain\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Behavioral Health Behavior Change Intervention\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: 18 years or older Primary",

The study consists of 3 study arms/groups: an experimental arm with 3 PB\u2010D918 dose levels and a placebo arm. A total of 24 subjects will be randomized into the experimental arm. Of this, six will be randomized to 3 sequential dose cohorts and receive SC PB\u2010D918 or a matched placebo once a week for 12 treatment weeks. The placebo arm will receive SC placebo for 12 treatment weeks. The placebo dose level will be assigned at random, blinded, and in sequence. The study design will follow a 3+3 dose\u2010escalation scheme. A total of 12 subjects will be randomized into the placebo arm (four subjects per dose cohort). Participant enrollment will begin with the lowest dose level cohort and escalate sequentially through each dose level cohort until approximately 4 subjects have completed the study per dose level and been followed for at least 7 weeks following the last study dose. PB\u2010D918 injection will not be administered to subjects until dose\u2010confirmation cohorts have demonstrated safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in at least 24 participants.

What is the study measuring? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Echocardiography plays an essential role in the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction (DD) caused by left ventricular (LV) relaxation abnormality, but is operator dependent. The Tissue Doppler Imaging derived S' wave is a reliable measure of LV systolic function and a surrogate of left ventricular relaxation (LV\u2010R). This study investigated the reproducibility of the Tissue Doppler Imaging derived S' wave for the diagnosis of DD.METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of studies of the efficacy and safety of ivabradine in Chinese patients with stable coronary artery disease and DD. All the patients were required to complete Tissue Doppler IV in the post\u2010exercise echocardiographic study.RESULTS: S' wave is highly reproducible for the diagnosis of DD in post exercise IV at a reference S' waves \u226512\u2009cm/s. The re\u2010test was done at least 1 week after the initial measurement, and the reproducibility results are as below: AUC of the ROC curve to diagnose diastolic dysfunction (DD) \u22651.66; Sensitivity, 68.2%; Specificity, 77.6%; AUC for DD \u22652: Sensitivity, 64.4%; Specificity, 74.6%. The diagnostic value of DD \u22652 was similar with or without LV hypertrophy (LVMI\u2265115\u2009g/m(2)). There was no significant change in S' wave and reproductibility from baseline to the end of 18th month treatment. At the end of 12\u2010month treatment, the S' wave did not differ among the three treatment groups (P>0.05).

The UEL related to BC represents a common and severe complication for breast cancer patients after surgery. Lymphedema represents a complex pathological process and NMES provides a non-invasive technique with the dual function of exercise and pain control in the treatment of lymphedema. In this regard, the electrical stimulation of the lymphatic system has been shown to decrease the formation of edema by increasing the lymph return and the muscle/soft tissue pump function, and it has been reported that this technique may also reduce the risk of developing lymphatic dysfunction and lymphedema. Both forms of NMES (low frequency, burst or high frequency) can be effective in the treatment of lymphedema, but high frequency has been shown to be more effective in the prevention of lymphedema, according to the available literature.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nNeuromuscular Electrostimulation in the Prevention of Upper Extremity Lymphedema: High Frequency vs. Burst Mode\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nBreast Cancer, Upper Extremity Lymphedema\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Low frequency versus burst mode neuromuscular electrical stimulation\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients with history of surgery with axillary lymph node dissection surgery, unilateral breast cancer, upper extremity lymphedema.

            "to a renal replacement therapy modality because it can be started or stopped easily and allows for rapid adjustment of fluid removal while also maintaining hemodynamic control in patients with a critical illness. To achieve sufficient fluid and uremic toxin removal, it is essential to achieve adequate UF efficiency. However, insufficient UF can contribute to increased hemodynamic instability, hypervolemia, and fluid overload, leading to worsening outcomes. Furthermore, an excessively high volume of UF can cause a reduction in cardiac output, which often occurs in patients with high vascular resistance, low cardiac output, cardiac failure, and impaired contractility. While HDF therapy can be considered as an adequate choice in terms of fluid removal and uremic clearance, there are some difficulties as well. Hemolysis during HDF can cause a decrease in hematocrit, anemia, and the need for frequent blood transfusions, which can result in poor patient prognosis. Therefore, the erythrocyte reduction filter (ERF) is one of the crucial components of the extracorporeal circuit that reduces the risk of these complications by selectively removing red blood cells.\nMost ERFs used in HDF systems are a combination of a polyamide membrane filter and polysulfone membrane filter with a pore size of 1 \u03bcm or 3 \u03bcm. The smaller the pore size of the filter is, the more it reduces hemolysis and the higher the resistance to blood flow, but it also causes an increase in transmembrane pressure and a decrease in blood flow. On the contrary, a larger pore size filter can reduce pressure and can increase blood flow.\nThe Baxter 2\u2010step HDF system is composed of an 80/20% polysulfone and polyamide membrane filter for hemofiltration and an 80/20% and polysulfone membrane filter for hemodialysis. This system is connected via a single filter housing that includes an ERF with a pore size of 3 \u03bcm (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL). However, the filter is an 80/20 filter composed of polysulfone and polyamide, and the pore size is 3 \u03bcm. Although the pore size is larger",

Plasma lysine concentrations were 114% higher in comparison to placebo, with similar increases in the urinary excretion of lysine and arginine. A significantly higher nitrogen balance was achieved during lysine restriction. The dietary treatment resulted in a reduction of body weight, lean body mass, and fat free mass. Appetite was not affected by the lysine restriction diet, as was shown by food intake and plasma concentrations of ghrelin and cholecystokinin concentrations. Total lipids and plasma albumin concentration were significantly reduced during lysine restriction in comparison to placebo. However, protein intake significantly decreased during lysine restriction.\n\nIntroduction\nLysine is the first nutrient the body needs to be in a positive nitrogen balance. The lysine requirement has been shown to increase with an increase in protein intake. The addition of lysine to protein-deplete diets can increase the body\u2019s nitrogen balance (1) and its nitrogen utilization efficiency (2,3). This may explain why the human diet, even when consuming foods and supplements with essential amino acids, has proven to be inadequate in certain individuals (4).\nLysine restriction has been used clinically to decrease the requirements of lysine-requiring drugs (e.g., fluconazole), increase protein synthesis while decreasing degradation (5), and reduce the plasma lysine concentration in patients with hyperlysinemia (6).\nAnimal studies have shown that the body's efficiency of protein utilization is optimal with a moderate lysine intake, although a large body of research has demonstrated that an optimal lysine intake varies according to dietary protein intake (7\u20138). This is supported by a human study, which indicates that the optimal lysine requirements are between optimal to super-optimal intake (5).\nLysine is also essential for normal",

METHODS: From January 2018 to January 2020, 54 diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this randomized, controlled, open\u2010label, parallel groups trial. Patients were randomized into two treatment categories: glyburide (1:30:30 mg) plus DH treatment group (1:30:30 mg/day) and glyburide only treatment group (1:30:30 mg/day). The control group received the same treatment as the experimental group, while the treatment group in addition underwent DH treatment for 24 weeks. The main outcome measure was change in the 24\u2010h urine albumin\u2013creatinine ratio (UACR). RESULTS: The average follow\u2010up interval in the two groups was 4\u20105 months. At week 24, the change in 24\u2010h UACR were \u221250.15 \u00b1 23.45 mg/g and \u221257.79 \u00b1 28.31 mg/g for the DH and control groups, respectively. Patients in the DH group had a significantly greater reduction in 24\u2010h UACR than did those in the control group did (P < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant difference in blood glucose (BG) control between the experimental and control groups (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in BG levels between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with DH plus glyburide for 24 weeks resulted in lowering of 24\u2010h UACR, whereas glyburide alone only resulted in lowering of BG levels. This approach could be a potential clinical strategy for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy complicated with dyslipidemia. Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).",

What participant group or arm would you like to include in this arm? \nInstitution: University of Alberta\nInstitution: Sunnybrook Health Science Centre\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nBiliary tract cancer (BTC) is one of the most common and frequent causes of death worldwide, resulting in approximately 11.6% of all cancer deaths. Consequently, it causes high morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Early diagnosis of BTC is vital to improve outcomes and prognosis. In early stages, BTC typically has no specific symptoms, such as unintended weight loss or abdominal pain, and often presents as advanced or metastatic BTC. The current diagnostic method of choice is Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP) with or without abdominal endosonography, followed by tissue sampling by fine needle aspiration (FNA) and biopsy. The sensitivity of this diagnostic method is limited due to BTC often being confined to the biliary system and inaccessible. A more invasive and more costly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by biopsy can be employed to obtain tissue samples, although this method is inaccessible in many countries due to its limited availability. The use of peritumoral injection combined with laparoscopic biopsy or ultrasound-guided biopsy is another method that can improve sensitivity in BTC-affected patients. In recent years, with the improvement of sequencing technology and the development of blood-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid biopsy techniques, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is increasingly becoming a hotspot in precision cancer diagnosis. However, the diagnosis rate of ctDNA from blood samples in early BTC is low. Biliary tract cancer bile may have a high cancer DNA load due to abnormal bile flow and may be a diagnostic gold standard for extraction of ctDNA. However, to date, only a few studies and cases report the possibility of extracting ctDNA from bile using massively parallel next generation sequencing (NGS). Therefore, it is the purpose of this study to determine whether bile ctDNA sequencing can be used as",

The most common reason for revision surgery is failure of implant/patellar fixation fixation. In our previous study, different fixation options, implants and drilling techniques in THA revision have been described. There has been no clinical or radiological comparison, however, between cemented screws and cementless stems in THA revision using the same implant for fixation. The goal of the present trial is, therefore, to measure the radiological outcomes of cemented and cementless stems in THA revision using the same type of femur stem for fixation.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe goal of the present prospective clinical study is to measure the radiological outcomes of cemented and cementless stems in THA revision using the same type of femur stem for fixation. In a prospective longitudinal case-control design, we will compare radiological outcomes of patients receiving revision THA with cemented or cementless stems, using a single type of cementless distal femur stem (Stryker TrioptTM) after revision for one of the following indications: periprosthetic fracture, dislocation, or inflammatory loosening after unconstrained primary or revision THA. The primary clinical and radiological outcomes of interest are the implant survivorship (a component revision has to be performed) and the femoral stem loosening/migrating (defined by a change in the stem migration of 2 mm or more at follow up). Secondary outcome measures include the Harris hip score, SF-36, EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) and quality of life questionnaire. We will include 28 patients in the study, with both treatment groups consisting of 14 patients. Patients will undergo imaging, according to the EPOS/ESPRIT guidelines, at baseline and 3, 5 and 10 years.

Have a good day!\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to improve a treatment for a rare type of blood cancer known as plasma cell leukemia (PCN) by adding a medication called thalidomide to the treatment of patients with this disease. This drug has been used for about 50 years to treat other conditions such as skin cancer and multiple myeloma, but has not been used to treat plasma cell leukemia. Because plasma cells carry the disease-causing gene, BCL2, and thalidomide blocks the BCL2 protein from blocking cell death (apoptosis), researchers believe it may have antileukemia activity.

Introduction Background and Rationale {6a}\nBackground\nToothbrushing is an effective measure for plaque removal, yet people may not brush their teeth regularly. Furthermore, toothbrushing is limited by its dependence on manual dexterity, particularly in the elderly who are more likely to have reduced manual dexterity .\nIn recent years, new technologies have been developed to assist people in brushing their teeth effectively and independently, especially in the light of the increasing elderly population . Toothbrush autonomy has been introduced to assist the elderly in brushing their teeth. In these cases, the toothbrush is controlled by a pressure sensor embedded in its handle . Another device, the Br\u00fcshel, combines an electric toothbrush with a software program in the form of a tablet that provides instructions on how to brush each section of teeth via visual and audio instructions . These innovative toothbrushing technologies are designed to encourage regular brushing behaviours. However, these technologies are limited by a lack of patient motivation since they are not supported by any incentive, i.e. a reward.\nIt has been shown that extrinsic reinforcement through a \u201ctangible\u201d incentive, such as a prize or a medal, can effectively motivate students to work harder than when no rewards were provided . Similarly, monetary rewards have been shown to have a stronger motivational effect on children than non-monetary rewards, such as letters of participation or praise . In addition to financial incentives, rewards can also be intangible, such as recognition by their parents . In the context of toothbrushing, the effectiveness of intrinsic reinforcement, such as a \"clean\" smile or a feeling of fresh breath, has been demonstrated .\nHowever, it is unclear whether an extrinsic motivational incentive can support new toothbrushing technologies to increase user comfort and compliance. This is important because motivational rewards could be used at all stages of the tooth brushing process: when users prepare to use the toothbrushing device, when they are using the device, or after using the device.\nStudy aims\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an intrinsic motivational technology on the toothbrushing behaviour of young adults aged 18-35 years. More specifically, this pilot study will test the effectiveness of an interactive motivational game in promoting good tooth",

This study will aim to investigate if tDCS is well accepted, and will evaluate the effect of three doses (0mA, 1mA, 2mA) of tDCS on craving, neuropsychological measures and self-reported outcomes in recently abstinent methamphetamine use (28 days) compared to a control condition during a 2 hour single session. This study is registered with the Australian Human Research Ethics Committee (ID 2016298516).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThere has been a great deal of interest in using transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to treat symptoms of addiction. Some initial data has been produced that using tDCS in the brain region of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, BA11) in meth users reduces craving, and other data suggests that targeting areas associated with cognitive control (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) using tDCS could act as an intervention to reduce craving. However these studies have only assessed the effects of tDCS on craving levels without assessing other aspects that may influence success in recovering from addiction by reducing craving. The current study is a sham-controlled, single session experiment that aims to test three dose conditions of brain stimulation (0 mA; 1 mA; 2 mA) on various factors that may influence success in overcoming cravings that often prompt the use of methamphetamine in people with addiction. In particular, the current study aims to: assess the safety and tolerability of tDCS with the doses studied; explore whether the doses tested would reduce the severity of cravings (primary); examine any differential effect on cognitive measures and self report measures; and examine the impact of the dose of tDCS on brain activity (functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Prostate biopsy was performed using 29\u2010gauge, disposable 18\u2010cm needle bioptome under ultrasonography (USS) guidance by the urologist who had worked for more than five years or with the urology resident who had participated in less than five prostate biopsy procedures. The biopsy results were compared in each group.\nResults\nThe mean age of the patients was 64.1+5.4 years in the urologist\u2010 biopsy group and 64.8+4.8 years in the resident\u2010biopsy group (difference p value=0.183). The prostate volume, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and percentage of positive biopsy cores were not different between the two populations. However, when evaluating the individual results of both tests, it was observed that 9 (23.1%) of the urologists\u2010performed, 5 (13.2%) of the resident\u2010performed needle biopsies were not technically efficient. This difference was significant (p value=0.005). It has been seen that urologist\u2010performed needle biopsies are more complicated and are at least 6 times more likely to fail (p value=0.002).\nConclusion\nNeedle biopsies performed by an experienced urologist should be preferred in patients with suspected prostate cancer.\n\n1.

Experimental: Domiciliary CGA\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Frail older adults over age 75 who are discharged from the Emergency Department and referred to the Community Specialist Team in Limerick.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will consist of domiciliary Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) including nursing, medical, and allied health assessment and intervention. The majority of this intervention will be delivered in the patient's own home, with a medical review at the hub for specialist geriatric medical expertise. A domiciliary visit within 24-48 hours of referral will be conducted by a team member who will act as the case coordinator. Referrals for domiciliary care will be made based on patient needs, with individualized interventions prescribed. This arm aims to assess the impact of providing CGA in a home-based setting, which may improve patient comfort, accessibility, and overall outcomes.\n\n2. Active Comparator: Hub-based CGA\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Frail older adults over age 75 who are discharged from the Emergency Department and referred to the Community Specialist Team in Limerick.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: CGA as defined above will be delivered in an Out-patient setting at the hub. This arm serves as the comparison group to the experimental arm, allowing for the evaluation of the effectiveness of domiciliary CGA compared to hub-based CGA. It is necessary to have this arm to assess whether the setting of CGA delivery impacts clinical and process outcomes among older adults.\n\nI hope this summary provides a clear overview of the study arms.

In the arms testing Cemiplimab and/or Fianlimab to maintain response, only people who have had a complete or partial response after at least 6 doses of an initial systemic therapy will be eligible. In the arms testing Cemiplimab and/or Fianlimab for the treatment of metastatic disease, only people with progressive disease despite at least 6 doses of an initial systemic therapy will be eligible.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is a phase 1, open-label study. Phase 1 studies are generally used to test out new treatment methods, treatments, or procedures in people for the first time. Open-label means that everyone involved in the study will know which study treatment is being given. It also means that Cemiplimab/Fianlimab will not be compared to any other treatments. This is a first-in-human study, where participants will be treated with the lowest planned dose of Cemiplimab/Fianlimab. The doses will be increased one at a time and followed for safety. If none or a small number of participants experience unacceptable side effects with higher doses, future participants will be treated with the highest dose. In this study, safety means that the treatments will be monitored closely for any unintentional effects on the body (for example, the way a medication can change a person's blood levels). If the highest planned dose has not been exceeded but no",

In 2020, approximately 230,000 women were diagnosed with EOC worldwide, and more than 200,000 women died from it. EOC is characterized by an initial asymptomatic stage, and more than 70% of these patients are diagnosed when the disease has advanced into the advanced stage. More than 70% of patients with EOC receive cytoreductive surgery and post-operative paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy. Paclitaxel is a member of the taxoid family of drugs and is a microtubule stabilizing agent used in the treatment of various cancers. As a common first-line treatment for primary and recurrent malignancies of the ovary and fallopian tube, carboplatin and paclitaxel are considered the preferred first-line regimen for EOC. Carboplatin and paclitaxel have demonstrated superiority in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rate, and have become a widely used chemotherapy drug in clinical treatment and become the preferred treatment in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. However, the 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer is only about 30%-35%. This survival rate may be related to the patient's physiological condition before surgery, the stage of metastasis, and the amount of primary treatment tumor. Currently, the clinical research direction needs to be continued to improve the survival rate. Studies have shown that the mechanism of epithelial ovarian necrosis is related to multiple factors such as inflammation, hypoxia, and nutrition, which ultimately lead to apopt",

I'm glad I could be of assistance.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground and Aims: \u0394100, a novel formulation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), enhances cognitive performance in young men. In a clinical trial, we previously found \u0394100 to be safe, effectively absorbed orally, and improve attention, speed of processing, and learning/memory. Due to the sexually dimorphic nature of the CNS, we postulated that the drug might be more effective when used by men. Research Design and Methods: In a double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, crossover study, healthy adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of either \u0394100 (50 mg daily) or placebo. We examined the effectiveness of \u0394100 with a series of clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological tests. DHEA sulfate concentrations in serum and the neurosteroid concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were measured. In parallel, we evaluated the cognitive effects of DHEA metabolites DHEA sulfate and 3\u03b1\u2010androstanediol glucuronide (3\u03b1\u2010ADiol\u2010G) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Results: \u0394100 improved learning in normal controls (n = 62), and the drug was more effective in men than in women, as well as in older adults (n = 40) compared to young adults. The cognitive effects of \u0394100 were mediated by its conversion to 3\u03b1\u2010ADiol, a DHEA product. The effect on learning was also independent of testosterone fluctuations. In PD (n = 10), preliminary evidence was obtained that the cognitive and behavioral impairments of the disease are partially due to decreased production of 3\u03b1\u2010ADiol by peripheral tissues."

            "Sure! One potential approach is to analyze blood samples for biomarkers related to LRRK2 activity. Blood samples are much easier to collect than CSF samples, and there is evidence to suggest that some LRRK2 activity can be measured in plasma samples. However, it's crucial to note that blood samples may not be as accurate or sensitive as CSF samples in detecting changes in LRRK2 activity. Another option is to analyze muscle tissue samples, which could provide another window into LRRK2 activity in individuals with Parkinson's. However, muscle biopsies are an invasive procedure and may not be feasible for some participants. Ultimately, the choice of biomarker analysis method will depend on the specific objectives of the research and the participant population. Thank you for asking!",

            "Okay. Now, let's move on to the specific methods for the trial. Can you briefly describe the clinical trial method you will be using? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: The incidence of endometrial cancer (EC) and adenomyosis in reproductive age women is increasing. In particular, EC is the most common gynecological malignancy, and early diagnosis and early surgical intervention are important factors for improving the prognosis of patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of transvaginal transfollicular tracer\u2010guided high\u2010frequency focused ultrasound (TFUS) therapy for the treatment of EC in patients with myometrial invasion thickness \u22672.5 cm. DESIGN: Forty\u2010five patients were enrolled randomly. Transvaginal sonography was used to assess the number, size, and characteristics of follicles in patients in different stages, and the corresponding ultrasound data (diameter and number) were used as the basis of transvaginal transfollicular tracer\u2010guided (TTTG) high\u2010frequency focused ultrasound for the treatment of EC. Clinical curative effect was evaluated according to EC progression, patient's reproductive endocrine function assessment, and ultrasound dynamic observation after operation. RESULTS: The TTTG group and the operation group were compared with patients with endometrial thickness \u22672.5 cm and uterine myoma in patients with endometrial cancer. Clinical data show that the patients were comparable, and the curative effect of the two groups is 90%; the reproductive function recovery period of the TTTG group was also shorter than that of the control group. Moreover, it was found that the myometrial invasion thickness of the postoperative ultrathin slice was only 0~1.9 cm and complete remission occurred in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: It shows that transvaginal transfollicular tracer\u2010guided (TTTG) high\u2010frequency focused ultrasound is a new and effective method for the treatment of patients with EC.",

Now, let's move on to the next arm. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nChronic venous disease (CVD) is a vein disease causing venous ulcers that are difficult to heal and negatively impact quality of life. The geko\u2122 W3 or X-W3 System are minimally invasive medical devices used to promote healing by providing gentle electrical stimulation to leg muscles that aid in reducing leg swelling. The geko\u2122 W3/X-W3 Systems use adhesive pads to attach to the skin. The current hydrogel adhesive material in geko\u2122 X-W3 devices has been found to have poor skin adhesion, particularly in elderly participants in previous clinical studies. Hydrogels are a type of soft adhesive material designed to minimize stress on skin, promote healing, and avoid irritation. However, commercially available hydrogels are still suboptimal for use in medical devices like the geko\u2122 X-W3. This study aims to develop and evaluate a new hydrogel adhesive for use in medical devices like geko\u2122 X-W3. The effectiveness of the new hydrogel adhesive will be compared with the current adhesive in terms of skin adhesion and comfort, as well as patient satisfaction and device usability. The study will involve two phases. During the development phase, up to 20 participants will be recruited to share their opinions and preferences on different types of hydrogel adhesives. During the clinical phase, up to 40 participants will be recruited to test the comfort and durability of the new hydrogel adhesive during two-week wear trials. Participants will complete questionnaires and provide feedback on the efficacy and comfort of the adhesive. The new hydrogel adhesive is expected to improve skin adhesion, comfort, and device usability for patients with CVD, leading to faster and more effective wound healing.\n\nOfficial Title",

Exercise\u2010based interventions are effective management strategies for LBP, and the aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of group based exercise and a remote exercise program in reducing pain and improving health and function for adults with LBP. Method: A randomized, two\u2010arm, controlled single\u2010blinded study design, evaluating an 8 week group exercise program (Beyond Back Pain\u00ae Program), and a remote self\u2010exercise program (My Back Pain\u2122 Program). Participants were recruited from four community gyms, four regional primary care facilities, and the public health system in Northern Sydney. Participants were assessed as a group at baseline and at 3 and 12 month follow up to determine changes in pain, health and function. Results: A total of 138 participants (male = 92, female = 46) completed the 8 week group program, with outcomes assessed at baseline, 3 and 12 month follow up. Significant improvements were observed at 3 months in pain (p < 0.001), disability and self\u2010efficacy (p < 0.001) for group participants. At 12 month follow up, a substantial reduction in pain was observed for both groups, with disability measures and self\u2010efficacy showing non\u2010significant changes. The group program resulted in higher levels of physical activity, which correlated with improvements in pain and health and function measures. Conclusions: Despite greater improvements in pain during the 8 week group exercise program compared to the remote self\u2010exercise program, the benefits were maintained at one year. Furthermore, a key finding is that both programs increased self\u2010reported physical activity levels.",

We hypothesize that the technology-enhanced approach will reduce procedure time, improve outcomes, and increase patient satisfaction compared to traditional ablation techniques. Methods: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial involving adult patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation at a single center. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the traditional ablation or technology-enhanced ablation group. The primary outcome is procedural time. Secondary outcomes include procedure success, procedure durations, and patient satisfaction with both procedures. We will also analyze the cost-effectiveness of the two approaches. Results: This study is ongoing, and the initial results will be available after enrolling 100 participants. Conclusion: This study seeks to improve the quality of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation by assessing the impact of a technology-enhanced ablation approach. We anticipate that the results will have significant implications for clinical practice and patient outcomes.\nIntroduction\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of heart arrhythmia in developed countries, affecting over 9 million people in the United States alone. Catheter ablation is recognized as the most effective treatment for symptomatic patients with drug-refractory AF. However, the procedure is time-consuming, often exceeding 4 hours. The long duration of the procedure can lead to increased risk of complications such as bleeding and infection, as well as a negative impact on patient satisfaction.\nIn recent years, advances in technology have revolutionized interventional cardiology procedures by improving procedural efficiency, reducing procedural complications, and enhancing patient outcomes. Catheter navigation systems are one such technology that has been developed to enhance the precision and efficiency of catheter ablation. Catheter navigation systems are computer-assisted systems that use image-guided mapping techniques to guide the catheter to its intended location within the heart. This",

            "The design of the experimental arm with the combination of Cemiplimab and Ziv-Aflibercept was chosen for several reasons. Firstly, the combination therapy allows us to target multiple pathways involved in tumor growth and immune evasion, potentially leading to a more potent anti-tumor effect. Secondly, the treatment schedule and dosing regimen were designed to optimize the benefits of both drugs while minimizing the risk of toxicity.

It has been shown to prevent the formation of new blood vessels in tumors and inhibit tumor growth. Blocking VEGF may also enhance the immune response against cancer.\n- Cemiplimab is a human monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody that works by blocking the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on immune cells. This helps enhance the immune response against cancer cells.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with!"

Methods: A double\u2010blind study included 12 patients with chronic alcoholism and alcoholic pancreatitis. The patients were randomized to a control group (n = 6) treated for 3 days with 5% dextrose in water (D5W) and to the treatment group (n = 6), treated for 3 days with intravenous GGT, 150 IU/kg (5\u201025 mg/kg) followed by 100 IU/kg (4\u201020 mg/kg) during the next 17 hours. GGT was extracted from human plasma with a special chromatographic purification technique. The patients were followed clinically and by laboratory assays (blood routine, serum transaminases, and lipids) to assess the efficacy of the therapy. Results: Five patients in both groups died of complications of pancreatitis. The patients in the control group did not show a clear improvement in blood samples. However, in the treatment group, the patients showed a significant decrease in the serum levels of all biochemical parameters of inflammation and an increase in the serum levels of 3\u2010hydroxy\u20103\u2010methylglutaryl\u2010CoA reductase mRNA. No serious side effects of GGT treatment were observed. Conclusions: The 24\u2010h intravenous administration of plasma\u2010derived GGT can safely attenuate the biochemical manifestations of alcoholic pancreatitis in chronic alcoholic patients.

The treatment will start with a one-hour session weekly in the first month, and the time lags between sessions will be 2 weeks in months 2 and 3, 4 weeks in months 4 and 5 and 6 weeks in months 6 and 7. From month 8 to month 12, sessions will occur every 4 weeks.  The control group will begin its treatment in month 12. The intervention will be delivered by a clinical psychologist as it was developed from CBT, PST and MBSR. It will comprise of nine modules, including stress perception, stress management, the art of being present, communication, relationships, spirituality, health and illness, and mindful movement. Each of sessions of the modules will last for 90-minutes. During the last session (session 8), a session on problem solution will be included into all interventions in order to assist participants to transfer the knowledge learnt into life at work.

The intervention group received face\u2010to\u2010face medication adherence health education by community nurses for 15 minutes three times within 3 weeks. Both groups received routine psychological education. The primary outcome was patients' knowledge about medication adherence, and the secondary outcome was patients' perception of self\u2010efficacy.RESULTS: The education helped reduce the difference in knowledge scores between the two groups from 19.68 (95% CI= \u20107.24, \u20102.13) at baseline to 1.51 (95% CI= \u20101.76, \u20101.26) at 2 weeks, \u20104.86 (95% CI= \u20105.69, \u20104.04) at 1 month, and 0.48 (95% CI= \u20102.51, \u20101.62) at 3 months post\u2010intervention (p = 0.038 compared to baseline).

            "Can an explanation of the logic behind this allocation and intervention model be provided? \n\nBackground\n=================\nIt is well known that the treatment of depression or anxiety in patients with cancer is more difficult than in the general population and more difficult than treating general depression. This has been demonstrated by 2 reviews. In addition, the response to the antidepressants is not so good, so the patients do not achieve a better response than that of the non-treated group. Therefore, it is necessary to search for new effective treatments for treating depression in these patients. The most recent of these is transcranial repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r-TMS), which has been demonstrated to be effective in adults with major depressive disorder. Previous studies in patients with breast cancer have also proven the efficacy of r-TMS therapy over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in combination with escitalopram (ESC) for 4 weeks in improving quality of life. \n \nStudy design\n=================\nNon-randomized two groups' pre-post study\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\n1.

            "The primary endpoint will be 90-day survival, and the secondary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality or liver transplant. These endpoints will help us evaluate the efficacy and safety of CytoSorb treatment in this population. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Acute\u2010on\u2010chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by acute deterioration of chronic liver disease (CLD) with concurrent development of encephalopathy and variceal bleeding. ACLF patients often require intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. Liver transplantation may be the only definitive treatment for patients with refractory ACLF who do not survive to transplantation. Cyclosporine A (CsA) has been shown to reduce mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS) for patients with ACLF in retrospective studies, but not in a randomized controlled trial. We designed this Phase III multi\u2010center trial to determine whether CsA can improve survival outcomes for patients with ACLF. Methods: 4AIM is a prospective, international, randomized controlled trial comparing CsA versus control (standard medical care without CsA) in patients with ACLF. The primary endpoint is 90\u2010day survival. Secondary endpoints include a composite of all\u2010cause mortality or liver transplant. Patients are randomly assigned either CsA dose-calibrated using the area under the concentration\u2010time curve (AUC) or a fixed total daily dose of CsA. CsA therapy is initiated immediately upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and continued until ACLF resolves, death, or ICU discharge. Survival outcomes will be compared between CsA and control groups in an intention\u2010to\u2010treat (ITT) analysis. The safety of CsA will be evaluated by assessing adverse events, such as infection and graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease. A central laboratory will analyze liver biopsies for quantitative analysis of inflammatory cytokines and other immune\u2010inflammatory biomarkers. The efficacy and safety of CsA treatment in patients with ACLF will be assessed in a phase III, randomized, and controlled fashion. This study may lead to improved outcomes for patients",

Pacemakers are artificial devices designed to control the heart rate by either stimulating the heart muscles or causing electrical blockage in specific arteries of the heart. When used together, the drugs and pacemakers aim to normalize the heart rhythm and prevent tachycardia. While drugs and pacemakers are known methods for treating tachyarrhythmia, there may be cases when a combination of the two is necessary. In our study, we intend to investigate the combination of drugs and pacemakers for the treatment of tachyarrhythmia in our study design. Our study will focus on three distinct heart rhythm abnormalities: atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. Patients will be divided into two groups: drug therapy only and drug therapy plus pacemaker. The study duration and follow-up for patients in each group will vary due to the uniqueness of each heart rhythm disorder, and individualization of treatment is essential to ensure optimal outcomes. The goal of our study is to provide an innovative and effective treatment approach for tachyarrhythmia utilizing both drugs and pacemakers, and to optimize each therapy as best as possible for the individual patient.\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\n1) Patients diagnosed with tachyarrhythmia\nMinimum age: 18 Years\nMaximum age: 80 Years\nGender: Both\n\nExclusion criteria\n=================\n1) Other concomitant disease conditions that do not allow for participation of a clinical trial to be performed\nMinimum age: 18 Years\nMaximum age: 80 Years\nGender: Both\n\nPrimary outcome\n=================\nOverall response to therapy and overall adverse events\n\nSecondary outcome\n=================\nThe incidence of adverse events and mortality at 4 years",

As for the specific intervention, I suggest a multidisciplinary program that includes non-invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. Can you provide me with further details on the program you envision, such as the frequency and duration of the electrical stimulation sessions? \n\nAbstract:\nSeventy\u2010four consecutive patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) between June 2015 and August 2020 were enrolled in this study after obtaining the approval of the hospital Ethics Committee and the written consent of the patients. There were 35 males (47.2%) and 39 females (52.8%). The mean patient age was 60.8 years (interquartile range=23\u201370 years). The most common cause of ARDS was sepsis (41 patients), followed by lung contusion (19 patients) and post-cardiothoracic surgery (18 patients). In our study, we used a multidisciplinary approach that included non\u2010invasive electrical stimulation of the spinal cord in addition to standard treatment. We used the Spinalon\u00ae device (Cefa srl., Italy) for electrical stimulation. This was a 12\u2010channel, transcutaneous device that was capable of generating a square pulse (pulse width=100 \u03bcs). The stimulation intensity ranged from 3 to 5 mA and was applied for 30 minutes twice daily. The stimulation was based on motor action potentials, and two sessions per day were performed using a stimulator frequency of 10 Hz. After a maximum of 10 sessions or a minimum of 8 sessions, the patient could be considered as improving. The primary outcome was the 28\u2010day mortality rate, while the secondary outcomes were the number of ventilator\u2010free days (VFDs), the length of ICU and hospital stay, and the serum biomarker levels.

A flow diagram of study participants will be developed to document the reasons for enrolling and discontinuing the intervention. Additionally, we will record parameters such as length of mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilation free days, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay.CONCLUSIONS: A randomized controlled trial comparing Transcutaneous Biopac Electrical Stimulator and usual care to prevent respiratory muscle atrophy in ARDS patients showed that the intervention was feasible.

Therefore, in this clinical trial, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a combination therapy of dexamethasone plus aprepitant plus ondansetron in preventing the post\u2010operative emetic effect of paclitaxel. Seventy\u2010three patients hospitalized for breast conservation therapy or mastectomy for breast cancer were enrolled in a double\u2010blind, randomized, and comparative study. The patients were divided into three groups of 20 each. They received 20 mg aprepitant orally on days 2 and 3 and received 25 to 50 mg daily ondansetron for up to 3 days if they did not vomit. The first group was administered oral ondansetron 25 mg daily from Day 2 to Day 3, the second group received dexamethasone IV from Day 2 to Day 3, and the third group received aprepitant and ondansetron. Patients received a 3\u2010day course of paclitaxel from Day 1 to 3, but ondansetron was not allowed during antiemetic use. Postoperative vomiting and nausea were recorded for 24 hours after surgery, and the incidence of nausea and vomiting was compared in all groups. The study population had a mean age of 5",
            "Sure! The first study arm we discussed is ondansetron given every 3 weeks in combination with aprepitant and dexamethasone. In the second study arm, ondansetron will be administered weekly combined with aprepitant and dexamethasone. The details of the study arms and interventions/treatments are available in our discussion section. We plan to evaluate the effectiveness of both study arms in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with spinal cord injury and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are receiving chemotherapy combined with PD-1 blockade. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Exercise\u2010induced respiratory problems in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly understood. Objectives: To assess whether a single session of high\u2010intensity interval training (HIIT) performed on a 10\u2010m incline could improve expiratory flow volume and the maximum voluntary ventilation in a 6\u2010min period of maximal exercise (MVV) in SCI patients with COPD. Methods: Six SCI patients with COPD, aged 20\u201373 years (mean age: 49 years), were included in the study. Following a baseline measurement, 3 consecutive sessions of HIIT (6 \u00d7 6\u2009min with breaks) were performed. The distance and speed performed during each interval were individually adapted for each subject. Results: After 3 consecutive HIIT sessions, flow\u2010volume curve loop analysis showed that vital flow volume was enhanced (0.94 \u00b1 0.56 L/s, P\u2009<\u20090.001), forced expiratory flow at 25% of vital capacity was improved (0.90 \u00b1 0.38, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and MVV was increased by 27% (P\u2009=\u20090.030). Conclusion: HIIT performed on a 10\u2010m incline for 60\u2009min twice a week for 4 weeks can significantly increase the expiratory flow volume of SCI patients with COPD. PMID: 35123623\n\n\n1."

Current efforts to improve nutrition among older adults have not been effective, particularly among African Americans at risk for malnutrition and food insecurity. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of providing nutrition counseling and meals virtually through a secure telehealth platform. Eligible participants will receive four 20-minute nutrition counseling sessions, which will focus on increasing intake of specific foods, with meals provided for three months post discharge from the hospital. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up. We hypothesize that the intervention will improve nutritional intake and outcomes in older African Americans, who are currently underrepresented in studies on MNT.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nMany seniors do not receive all of the nutrients they need from the foods they eat, leading to malnutrition and an increased risk for adverse health outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of virtual medical nutrition therapy (MNT) among older African Americans with high risk for malnutrition. Eligible participants will receive four 20-minute MNT sessions, with the dietitian using evidence-based, patient-centered counseling to increase intake of specific foods."

Compared to methadone, it results in fewer serious side effects, and also improves treatment retention. However, some of the patients are unwilling to accept opioid withdrawal and prefer methadone. Thus, it is essential to develop new strategies for buprenorphine treatment. We recently investigated an early buprenorphine treatment combined with dermal microdosing of methadone as a novel approach. Early treatment of heroin dependence with buprenorphine is followed by a gradual dose reduction of buprenorphine and methadone combined to achieve a controlled withdrawal period. To verify methadone effects at the end of the buprenorphine period, two different dose regimens of methadone were compared regarding the level of sedation and opioid craving. Sixteen participants with opioid dependence were randomly assigned to a high methadone concentration (10 mg daily) or to a lower concentration (1 mg daily). We found both dose regimes equally effective in terms of sedation and withdrawal symptoms. However, craving for heroin was significantly lower in the low\u2010dose group. Thus, it can be concluded that the microdosing of methadone is an effective treatment for opioid\u2010dependent patients in whom the buprenorphine treatment shows a lack of effect.",

Prostate cancer is often treated with radiation therapy as the initial treatment option. Patients receive standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) treatment, with a high rate of disease control in the low and intermediate risk group. For a subset of patients at higher risk, post\u2010operative radiation is performed to address concerns for local disease control and reduction of local prostate recurrence (LRP). Post\u2010operative radiation also is used for patients with high risk disease who cannot undergo surgery, or in whom surgery is either associated with unacceptable morbidity or who decline the surgical option. The standard post\u2010operative radiation is generally delivered in 6\u201010 weeks using standard EBRT, which can be impractical, costly, and inconvenient. We have the resources to treat these patients with advanced, intensity modulation technology (IMRT) that allows for dose escalation and dose conformity. Post\u2010operative radiation can also be delivered with proton therapy using the same radiation planning principles as IMRT. Proton therapy for post\u2010operative radiation is a safe, well tolerated treatment option. While the majority of LRP can be surgically controlled, a subset of patients will have local recurrence (LRP) at the prostate bed due to incomplete or negative surgical margins. A randomized clinical trial is in progress with University of Michigan using IMRT post\u2010operative radiation utilizing IMRT at 7440 centigray (cGy) to the whole prostate bed in 56 fractions. This study is comparing the standard arm of 65\u201068 Gy in 28\u201030 fractions to the 7440 cGy arm, a 50% increase in dose. We hypothesize that",

This arm will be compared to the first arm to determine the effect of the Hypervolt Device on treatment outcomes in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.",
            "I agree, we have designed both study arms. Now let's move on to other sections of the protocol, such as the primary outcome measure. \n\nPrimary Outcome Measure\n=================\nThe primary outcome measure is the amount of pain at the start of the study, and 1 and 2 months after the start of the study. The Visual Analog Scale will be used to measure pain, with a value of 5-10 indicating a higher level of pain. A decrease in pain levels indicates an improvement in the condition. We will also measure secondary outcomes such as muscle strength and joint movement, but we can leave this for now. \n\nStudy Design\n=================\nI would suggest a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a controlled and experimental treatment group. For the active comparator control group, the standard treatment protocol will be used in both groups, with a control group that does not receive additional intervention. \n\n\nParticipant Selection\n=================\nParticipants aged 35-65 with shoulder impingement will be included in the study. Participants should be free of any other diseases or conditions that may affect the study results. We will also need to get informed consent from the participants. The sample size will be calculated using a previous study on the hypervolt device. \n\nParticipant Consent\n=================\nInformed consent will be obtained from each participant verbally and in writing before the start of the study. A consent form will be prepared detailing the study procedures, potential benefits, and potential risks. \n\n\nStudy Duration\n=================\nParticipants will be evaluated at the start of the study, and then monitored at 1 and 2 months. During these visits, the primary outcome measure will be evaluated. \n\nStatistical Analysis\n=================\nThe mean and standard deviation of the pain score will be calculated for both the control and experimental groups. The Chi-square test will be used to determine whether the groups are similar in age, BMI, gender, and other factors. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to evaluate the difference in pain scores between the two groups. The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to evaluate the difference in secondary outcome measures between the two groups, such as muscle strength and joint movement. The p value will be set at 0.05 to determine statistical significance. Presentation",

Previous studies have explored the use of various interventions to reduce the pain associated with subcutaneous blood tests, such as topical anesthetics. While these interventions can be effective, they can also be time-consuming and require additional medication. One potential intervention that has been shown to reduce pain and stress is the use of a stress ball during a subcutaneous blood test. Stress balls are commonly used relaxation techniques that involve squeezing a small, squishy ball to reduce stress and anxiety. \nAim\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of a stress ball in reducing pain and anxiety during a subcutaneous blood test.\nMethodology\nStudy participants will be invited to participate in the study during their appointment for a subcutaneous blood test.

These were compared to 56 patients who underwent partial duodenum and total sublimis resection, followed by end\u2010stapling of the esophagus. Functional assessment was based on the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI).RESULTS: Twenty\u2010one of 39 patients in the partial sublimis group and 27 of 40 patients in the total sublimis group developed diarrhea. Compared to the total sublimis group, patients in the partial sublimis group reported a 24% decrease in diarrhea, as reported by the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI). Postoperative hospital stay was 8 days in the GIQLI total sublimis group vs 1 day in the partial sublimis group. Postoperative mortality was zero in patients undergoing total sublimis gastrectomy and 6% in patients undergoing partial sublimis gastrectomy.CONCLUSIONS: Partial sublimis gastrectomy and GIQLI end\u2010stapling was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative diarrhea, shortened hospital stay, and significantly reduced postoperative mortality compared to total sublimis gastrectomy.",

A recent single\u2010arm phase II clinical trial of adaptive radiotherapy with ETHOS, a modality using integrated PET/CT and IMRT during RT, showed clinical feasibility and tolerability in breast cancer. The aims of the present study were to validate whether the outcomes of this adaptive radiotherapy using ETHOS are comparable to those of conventional intensity\u2010modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Methods: We recruited hypersensitive patients with localized inoperable breast cancer with a high locoregional risk that required RT. Eligible patients were randomized to receive either adaptive radiotherapy with ETHOS or conventional IMRT. As a primary endpoint, the locoregional recurrence\u2010free rates were compared between the two groups using the log\u2010rank test. Secondary endpoints included rates of acute toxicity and cosmetic outcome. Results: Between October 2020 and October 2022, 55 patients were enrolled and randomized. The first breast cancer patient was initially enrolled in this trial. 14 patients (25.5%) from the adaptive radiotherapy group and 16 patients (29.1%) from the conventional IMRT group were eligible for the protocol analysis. The median follow\u2010up was 11 months for the treatment arms. A non\u2010significant 5\u2010year locoregional recurrence rate was observed for the adaptive radiotherapy arm (2.47%) than the conventional IMRT arm (10.33%). Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the 5\u2010year freedom from severe cosmetic outcomes was higher in the adaptive radiotherapy arm",

Moreover, cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients.\nCirrhotic patients have cardiac myopathy related to end diastolic dysfunction. However, the pathogenesis of cardiac myopathy in chronic liver disease is still unclear. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could contribute to endothelial dysfunction by inducing vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation leading to end diastolic hypertension and cardiac myopathy in cirrhotic patients.\nEfficacy and safety of a selective angiotensin receptor type I (AT1) blocker on cardiac parameters have not been fully illustrated in clinical trials.\nTherefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of a selective angiotensin receptor type I (AT1) blocker, DWJ1464, on echocardiographic findings such as pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), and clinical outcomes of chronic liver disease patients.\n\nStudy Population\n=================\nParticipant groups\nThe subjects will be patients with chronic liver disease except for patients with portal hypertension.\nThe chronic liver disease diagnoses include hepatitis B virus infection (HBV), hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic or biliary liver disease, autoimmune liver disease",

The prevalence of smoking among asylum seekers is at around 40% (Cornelius et al., 2014), and this group in particular has a high rate of smoking-related morbidity and mortality (Ajma et al., 2011; Ridgely et al., 2002; Stanton et al., 2009). Although smoking prevalence and smoking-related inequalities are also addressed in the Netherlands, studies have pointed to the persistent problem of smoking (Hoeksma et al., 2013; Van den Bergh et al., 2002; Van Kessel et al., 2007). The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of a cessation intervention in terms of the reduction of smoking for asylum seekers in the Netherlands.

            "OK, let\u2019s continue. What's the hypothesis or research question you're trying to address in this study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy versus a standard vehicle on preventing sunburn and skin aging induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In addition, it will also assess the participant's and physician's perception of UV damage. Finally, the biochemical profile and histology will be used to assess the extent of UV induced damage.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe skin is the largest and most exposed organ in the body and is considered the most fragile. It is a dynamic biological system with the capacity to maintain its function while undergoing constant repair and protection against environmental insults. This is all the more surprising when one takes into consideration that the skin undergoes frequent abuse. Ultraviolet (UV) exposure is the most common source of non-inflammatory abnormalities in the skin. Repeated exposure to sunlight throughout life accelerates skin aging by inducing wrinkles, sagging and loss of elasticity. Acute damage due to UV exposure can also be observed in the form of sunburn. Since 2025, an increase in skin cancers should be observed. Melanoma, the most lethal type of skin cancer, could rise by 52%, while cutaneous basal cell carcinoma by 56% and squamous cell carcinoma by 63%, with an estimated 1.1 million new cases in that year. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from sunlight is known to be a carcinogen (cancer causing agent) in humans. Sun exposure is the leading cause of skin aging. UVB is known as being the main cause of sunburn. It is also the main cause of skin cancer. UVA penetrates very deeply into the skin but is less potent in causing skin cancer than UVB. Chronic sun exposure causes long-term and cumulative effects - wrinkling, loss of elasticity, mottled pigmentation, and actinic dermatoses. The photoprotective potential of a sunscreen product is usually evaluated by measuring erythema (skin redness induced by sunburn) which is an immediate photoeffect, since a change in blood flow causes the skin to redden almost immediately",

For the intervention or treatment, participants will be using the test product Sunscreen -R43, which contains long-wear metal oxide particles. This arm is necessary to assess the efficacy of the sunscreen in providing protection against UV radiation in both static conditions and after water immersion. This will help determine the water resistance properties of the sunscreen, which is crucial for its effectiveness in real-life scenarios such as swimming or sweating.",

The purpose of this arm is to serve as a control to compare the SPF values obtained in static conditions with those obtained after water immersion. By having a control group that does not undergo water immersion, researchers can isolate the effect of water resistance on the sunscreen's efficacy. This will help validate the results obtained from the experimental arm.",

Conservative treatments or surgery can be a solution to improve the symptoms and life quality. Balloon kyphoplasty is a common surgical procedure to treat the OVCFs and has been widely used in many countries in the world. But the long-term effect on osteoporosis in balloon kyphoplasty is not enough. The porous titanium cage has been used to treat the osteoporosis in hip but has not been used for other sites. Researchers want to know whether the cage implants in kyphoplasty can improve the osteoporosis in spine. The investigators will recruit OVCF subjects in balloon kyphoplasty and follow them up for 5 years. The participants will be recruited from Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Friendship Hospital and followed in our hospital for 5 years and every 6 month the bone mineral density(BMD) of the participants will be tested according to DEXA scan. The investigators will evaluate the BMD change of the patients.

This group can serve as a control group, which will allow us to compare the results of the Sphereplast group with the control group. Does this sound like a good idea to you? \n\nAbstract:\nFive hundred and forty four women were randomised to receive a single 60 mg oral dose of finasteride, 40 mg desipramine, both finasteride and desipramine, or placebo one hour before urodynamic evaluation. Finasteride significantly increased outlet resistance and detrusor pressure. Combination therapy increased the number of incontinent patients in the 2 hour urodynamic follow\u2010up period, and those taking combination therapy passed more urine while having leakage with a similar rise in detrusor pressure. Desipramine, however, alone increased the number of patients who passed urine with concomitant urinary leakage while finasteride decreased this number. Combination therapy was more effective than desipramine alone in delaying urination and increasing maximal flow rate. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that finasteride is effective for the treatment of neurological bladder dysfunction. Desipramine alone in this population may increase the number of incontinent patients and should be avoided. Detection of the underlying cause of voiding disturbance is particularly important in the management of this condition.",

We recommend careful surgery and pathological examination for TD positive patients. \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of tumor deposits (TDs), a marker of intravascular tumor cell clusters (TCCs) on clinical outcomes in the neoadjuvant treatment (T) of operable HER2\u2010positive breast cancer (BC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 2013 to 2018, 191 individuals with untreated inflammatory (n = 84) or invasive infiltrating HER2\u2010positive BC underwent multimodality treatment following inclusion in one of nine clinical trials, including endocrine therapy and trastuzumab emtansine (T\u2010DM1) or lapatinib. The objective of these trials was to assess the efficacy of these treatments in the neoadjuvant setting. After pathological analysis, patients were retrospectively classified into tumor thrombi positive and negative groups, according to the presence or absence of tumor cells in blood vessels (n =\u00a023 and n = 168, respectively). The primary outcome was the inverse relationship between TDs and pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy; the secondary outcome was survival. RESULTS: Median follow\u2010up was 45.0 months. TCC status was determined in 191 lesions. Cohort characteristics at baseline are presented in Table\u00a01. After multivariate analysis that included tumor size, Ki67, lymph node status, and treatment, only the presence of TCCs was found to be an independent predictor of pCR rate. The presence of TCCs was associated with worse invasive disease\u2010free survival (p = 0.024). Median invasive disease\u2010free survival was 58.3 months for patients without TCCs and 28.4 months for patients with TCCs (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.3; P =.026). CONCLUSION: TCCs are negative prognostic factors for",
            "The participant group/arm for the non-TD cohort will be the \"non-TD cohort\". This arm will consist of patients who were determined to be TD negative by the pathologists. These are patients with tumor deposits in the peritumoral adipose tissue without any architectural residue of lymph node, but without a clear border separating tumor from normal tissue. The intervention/treatment for this arm will also be surgery. If the patients are TD positive, we recommend careful surgery and pathological examination. \n\nAbstract:\nRATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Tumor deposits (TD) are tiny nodules of metastatic mammary cancer embedded in normal mammary tissue that cannot be visualized on imaging or histologically due to the lack of desmoplastic reaction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the presence of TD in breast cancer surgery specimens and histopathologic features.METHODS: From March 2014 to August 2020, 113 patients with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy with axillary dissection were included in the retrospective study. The pathological specimen was examined for the presence of TD by H&E staining. The presence or absence of TD was compared with clinicopathologic and histopathologic factors.RESULTS: TD were detected in 51 (45.1%) of the 113 samples examined. The ratio of TD in invasive lobular carcinoma was significantly higher than that in tubular, mucinous, and medullary cancer (P = 0.027), and the mean size of TD in invasive lobular carcinoma was significantly smaller than that in tubular cancer (P = 0.012). The presence of TD was positively correlated with high nuclear grade, lymphatic invasion, axillary lymph node metastasis, and estrogen receptor positivity.CONCLUSIONS: The presence of TD affects the histopathologic features of breast cancer, indicating the importance of considering TD when analyzing microscopic sections of breast cancer specimens.\n\nIntroduction\nBreast carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor among women worldwide .

Many educational initiatives and programs have been implemented, including through community-based and school-based interventions, targeting this age group. However, we know that these benefits can be short-lived or do not generalize to pain experienced in daily life.PURPOSE:The current study aims to improve upon previous pain management interventions by incorporating an innovative delivery mechanism. Students will learn pain science concepts through a fun and engaging science-fair-style activity and be provided a home-based take-home game kit to reinforce learning.

Can you go through the rational behind using this dose and frequency? \nStudies have shown that colchicine in conjunction with corticosteroids has a beneficial effect in reducing the incidence of pericarditis relapses. The starting dose is 0.5 mg tid. The dose should be escalated based on toxicities, and the maintenance dose is 0.5 to one mg daily. The dose should be adjusted to minimize the gastrointestinal side effects. This arm is the standard of care in patients with colchicine-resistant glucocorticoid-dependent idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. It will be used as a comparator arm to determine the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine in reducing the risk of recurrence. \nThat's reasonable. To summarize, in this trial, both arms will receive Hydroxychloroquine 400mg daily and Colchicine 0.5 mg tid. This trial will also assess the optimal dose regimen for Colchicine induction treatment, which will include various titrations based on tolerability, clinical response, and toxicity, but no maintenance medication will be included.

What are the specific interventions or treatments in this trial? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nGastric intestinal metaplasia (IM), also known as precancerous gastric lesions, is a premalignant lesion of the digestive tract mucosa. Gastric cancer is often considered to be a malignant tumor that develops on the basis of gastric intestinal metaplasia. It is generally believed that the main pathogenesis of gastric cancer is chronic inflammation, which results in an imbalance of intestinal flora in the stomach and damages the gastric mucosa. Studies found that there is a close relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and chronic gastritis, and the occurrence and development of gastric cancer may be related to the colonization of Helicobacter pylori. This study aimed to observe the changes of intestinal flora in patients with precancerous intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori positive, to explore the relationship between different types of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric intestinal metaplasia.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nGastric mucosal flora has a significant effect on metaplasia induced by chronic atrophic gastritis. Infection or colonization of intestinal bacteria in the human stomach plays an important role in the carcinogenesis process of gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to detect and analyze the distribution of gastric helicobacter pylori strains in patients with stomach cancer. To detect and analyze the diversity of gastric flora in patients with gastric cancer. To explore the relationship between disease progression and changes in diversity of gastric flora. At present, there are no special provisions for the diagnosis, clinical treatment and pathogenic classification of Helicobacter pylori in China, and the diagnosis is often based on the diagnostic criteria issued by WHO and Maastricht IV consensus. For the purpose of diagnosis, this study uses Giemsa staining combined with biopsy, rapid urease test, DNA microarray technology, and 16s rDNA ribosomal",

The pharmacokinetics of repotrectinib will be compared between these patients and patients with hepatic impairment, allowing us to assess the impact of hepatic impairment on the drug's pharmacokinetics. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Repotrectinib is an oral multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) initially developed for the treatment of oncogene\u2010addicted non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previous studies have demonstrated that co\u2010amendment of repotrectinib with food produces significant elevation in its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) compared with fasted conditions. Based on those results, the current pharmacology, safety, and efficacy of this agent will be evaluated in this phase 1 trial (UMIN000025650) conducted under fasting conditions. Methods: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors were to be considered eligible for this trial. The primary objective was to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) following oral administration of repotrectinib (TPX\u20100005) on day 1 of each 28\u2010day cycle. The 0.56\u2010mg and 1\u2010mg cohort groups did not demonstrate any dose\u2010limiting toxicities (TLTs). The highest dose was assigned as the RP2D (2\u2010mg treatment group). The second aim was to evaluate the safety of repotrectinib administered on days 1\u201028 of each cycle. The third aim was to examine its pharmacokinetics (PKs). Conclusions: We developed a novel drug dosing method that provided safety in patients with solid tumors. We will continue to evaluate the safety and PKs of this drug and establish it as a well\u2010tolerated treatment option for the clinic.",

(A) Patients with histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have progressed during or after prior therapies, for whom no standard curative or palliative therapies are available or are intolerable, will be identified and considered for enrolment. These patients will be eligible for screening for moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Grade B) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Grade C), or normal hepatic function (Child-Pugh Grade A). (B) Patients who meet the criteria for the respective hepatic impairment group will be randomized to received treatment at the recommended Phase 2 dose (or dose level at which the MTD is defined) of 3 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg per day of TPX-0005. Patients with normal hepatic function will be enrolled in the TPX-0005 (3 mg/d) arm. Patient randomization will follow the 3+3 design. (C) Pharmacokinetics for all enrolled patients will be analyzed at each phase of a pharmacokinetic study. (D) Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by adverse event review, physical examination, clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis.

This information will be valuable in understanding the safety and efficacy of repotrectinib in patients with advanced cancer and hepatic impairment. It will also help inform future studies and improve treatment options for this patient population.\n\nAnswers:\nThe pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses in the Ramping Up the Rituxan\u00ae (RU) \u00ae Dose in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) (ReRU) study were similar regardless of how PD endpoints were measured . No statistically significant differences between PD measures of RU 2000 mg were observed for endpoints that assessed either absolute CD19 counts or CD19 count decrease from baseline when compared with RU 325 mg in this cohort. The RU dose level associated with maximal or near-maximal PD activity was 2000 mg . Based on data from the ReRU study, the dosing of RU for CLL patients will remain unchanged to help ensure optimal tumor control with this effective and well-tolerated regimen.\nBackground\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable hematologic malignancy characterized by lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, cytopenias, constitutional symptoms, and a poor prognosis . Despite the wide availability of effective therapies, most patients relapse and develop resistant disease . Currently, the only curative option is allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which is associated with significant graft-versus-host disease- (GvHD)\u2013related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, more effective long-term treatment options for patients with CLL are needed . The development of targeted therapy has greatly improved the care of this population.

Methods This will be an open\u2010label randomized controlled trial. The study was designed as a 3\u2010arm study. Each treatment group will contain a similar number of participants with similar baseline characteristics. Each participant will have a 6\u2010month treatment course to each drug (SGLT2 inhibitor, sGC stimulator, and ARNI respectively). The study will be double\u2010blind. The aim of the study is for the researchers to compare the cardiac function changes as assessed by echocardiology and CT. Results It is anticipated that the changes in cardiac function will follow similar trend as the cardiac function with other heart failure drugs. Discussion It is well known that some heart failure drugs have a positive effect on cardiac function parameters, such as reduction of left ventricular chamber dimension, reduction of left atrial chamber dimension, and increase of global longitudinal strain.

Patients and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated with radiotherapy on the breast after conservative surgery for breast cancer. Eligible patients included patients with histologically proven breast cancer who were treated with conservative surgery and received adjuvant radiotherapy in the 15\u201024 years after surgery. The initial number of lesions was analysed by counting the number of lesions on the operative specimen using the pathological report. Local control was defined as the time from the completion of radiotherapy to the time of local recurrence through recurrence on diagnostic imaging or pathological examination. Treatment response to radiotherapy according to the number of lesions was analysed retrospectively. The follow\u2010up period was 24\u201074 months, and the median duration was 46 months (range, 24\u201074 months). Results: The treatment response to radiotherapy was analysed in 39 patients (range in number of lesions 1\u20104). In patients with 1\u20102 lesions, in\u2010breast tumour reoccurrence occurred in 10% of patients with a median recurrence time of 19 months (range 10\u201030 months.); in those with 3\u20104 lesions, recurrences were observed in 86.7% of patients with a median recurrence time of 14 months (range 8\u201022 months). No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups [Chi\u2010square test P = .528] (Table 1). Conclusions: The results of this retrospective study suggest that women with three or more tumorous lesions in the breast treated with radiotherapy following conservative surgery have a greater chance of local in\u2010breast\n\nIntroduction\nLocal recurrence and distant metastasis are the most common treatments for early-stage breast cancer. Previous reports have suggested that there is a correlation between local recurrence and the number of tumorous lesions present on the operative specimen .

We also aimed to assess how imaging and clinical indicators can predict the occurrence of postoperative complications. We evaluated 102 patients undergoing myomectomy due to uterine myomas. Preoperative MRI, ultrasound (US), and intraoperative classification based on palpation findings (MRI/US\u2010p, US\u2010p alone, and preoperative/intraoperative palpation) were compared to predict the occurrence of conversion surgery and postoperative complications. Patients who underwent conversion surgery, i.e. laparoscopic surgery that could not continue, were evaluated based on preoperative MRI, preoperative/intraoperative palpation findings, and US. Postoperative complications were evaluated according to the Clavien\u2010Dindo classification. Of the 102 patients, eighty (78.4%) had conversion to laparotomy surgery. The patients who underwent conversion surgery had higher uterine volume and fibroid diameter on US, and higher total myoma volume, fibroid number, and size, and total uterine myoma volume on MRI than those who did not. On intraoperative palpation, the proportion of cases with a hard uterus, multiple fibroids, and large fibroids were higher among patients undergoing laparotomic surgery. In terms of postoperative complications, the incidence of Grade B (2.9%) and C (0.9%) complications was higher among patients who underwent open surgery. According to the multivariate analysis of risk factors, fibroid diameter on US, total uterine myoma volume on MRI, and uterine volume on US were identified as independent risk factors for conversion surgery, and a larger uterus and hard uterus were associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications.

The pouch serves as a reservoir for food, limiting the amount of food that can be eaten at one time and slowing down digestion.\nThe CAGB procedure typically takes about 60-90 minutes and is performed laparoscopically, using a few small incisions in the abdomen.\nThe following are the steps of the CAGB procedure: \n\u2022 General anesthesia is administered to the patient to put them to sleep during the surgery. \n\u2022 The surgeon creates a tiny camera (laparoscope) through a small incision in the abdomen, allowing him or her to see inside the body. \n\u2022 The surgeon creates three other small incisions in the abdomen through which surgical instruments are inserted. \n\u2022 The stomach is divided into a small pouch and connected to a small section of the small intestine. \n\u2022 The new connection allows food to bypass most of the stomach, slowing down digestion and reducing absorption of calories. \n\u2022 The incisions are closed and the patient is taken off the operating table. \nDuration of follow-up period is 1 year.\nNumber of Arms:: 2\nTarget Number of Participant:: 20\nArm Type:: Active comparator\nArm Description:: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass \n\u2022 Patients will be followed after surgery for one year. \n\u2022 During follow-up, patients are seen by the doctor at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. \n\u2022 During these visits, the doctor will assess how well the patient is recovering, any complications, and the patient's weight loss. \n\u2022 At 1 year,"

Objective(s): The objective of the study is to investigate long\u2010term effects of perioperative 90Sr\u2010microsphere treatment in patients with grade 2 gliomas. Study Design / Materials, Methods, and Procedure: We performed radiographic and clinical follow\u2010up 6 months and 12 months after surgical resection and pre\u2010operative brachytherapy with 90Sr\u2010microsphere implantation in a prospective randomized single\u2010center study in 72 patients with grade 2 gliomas. The patients were randomized between two treatment groups; a control group and a treatment group. The treatment group received three treatment cycles in total, while the control group received a single treatment cycle followed by a delayed treatment based on randomization results after the first treatment cycle. The pre\u2010operative brachytherapy was performed by surgical implantation of 90Sr microspheres at the time of resection. In all of the patients pre\u2010 and post\u2010implantation radiographic evaluation was performed by plain X\u2010ray and multidetector CT, respectively. Pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative clinical assessment was determined using the Karnofsky and the Pittsburgh neurological performance status parameters. Results: The study population included 20 men and 28 women with a mean age of 47 years. Five patients dropped out of the study or were excluded before radiographic evaluation could be performed.

Objectives: To determine the efficacy of ASA in the treatment of episodic migraine. Methods: A single\u2010center randomized double\u2010blind crossover clinical trial was used to compare two Aspirin formulations and placebo to evaluate efficacy, tolerability and patient preference. Thirty patients with migraine with aura were evaluated. Each participant used active pharmaceutical ingredients of two different ASA formulations and placebo for ten days as randomly assigned. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are in accordance with the International Headache Society (IHS) recommendation for migraine headache. Two weeks of washout period was recommended between the treatments. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and relief at 2 hours, nausea at 1, 2 and 4 hours and headache impact. Adverse events were also assessed. Participants recorded headache daily in a diary and completed questionnaires of migraine, pain, nausea and headache impact. Results: A significant reduction of pain in migraine attacks, greater headache impact and greater relief was observed with oral Aspirin formulations compared to placebo. The use of ASA in migraine attacks reduces pain, however, the use of a more effective ASA formulation can further improve therapeutic results. 13\u2010Jan\u20102016 6:25\u2010PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe first description of Aspirin as treatment for headache was published by Krafft\u2010Ebing in 1876 (Krafft\u2010Ebing, 1876). In the 1950s, the first controlled studies began demonstrating the efficacy of Aspirin\u00ae as a migraine headache treatment (Smith and Krupey, 1952; Kramish et al., 1959). Since then, thousands of clinical studies have been published demonstrating Aspirin\u2019s analgesic and anti\u2010inflammatory properties as a migraine treatment (Selvaratnam and Teghtoram, 2005).\nNon-steroidal anti-",

One group (n=100/group) will use 0.1% HPMC PF study drops 4x day as needed, while the other group (n=100) will use 0.2% hyaluronic acid/ 0.1% HPMC PF eye drops 4x day as needed. Primary endpoints are changes in Likert\u2010scale pain scores (compared to Baseline) at 14 (day 0), 30, and 60 days of use and total days of use. Secondary endpoints are changes in symptom severity, conjunctival staining, and signs of ocular surface injury. The study will be carried out at multiple academic and private US practices.RESULTS: As of 08/31/2022, recruitment is expected to be complete within 3\u20106 months.DISCUSSION: The objective of this study is to verify the effectiveness of HPMC PF eye drops to help resolve CLRD in a multicenter, cohort\u2010controlled study design, assessing its effectiveness and durability as a viable option in the marketplace.CONCLUSION: This study will build upon the positive results of a prior successful pilot study. As such, Drops & Drops have the potential to be proven as an effective new treatment option for contact lens wearers with CLRD, addressing a critical and under\u2010served need in the contact lens market.",

Urine was taken at the time of admission for routine care and screened with immunological assays, which were then confirmed, when positive, by GC\u2010MS. The specimens were subsequently rerun with GC\u2010MS using the method of confirmation of positive results, either with deuterated internal standards or by the GC\u2010MS full\u2010scan method.RESULTS: The urine was positive by immunoassay for drugs of abuse in 21 of the 182 patients. The GC\u2010MS full\u2010scan method confirmed a positive result for 17 of these 21 patients, while the positive result for one patient was not confirmed either by GC\u2010MS with deuterated internal standards or using the GC\u2010MS full\u2010scan screening method.

            "Perfect. Now that we have all the necessary information, let's start designing the study arms. We'll begin with the active comparator arm. In this arm, patients will undergo DC cardioversion (DCCV) plus pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Additionally, an implantable loop recorder will be inserted in the pre-pectoral area with local anesthetic at least one week before randomization. Two femoral sheaths will also be inserted at the groin area in all patients on the day of the procedure prior to randomization. Is there anything you'd like to add or modify for this arm?",
            "Absolutely. For the pulmonary vein isolation, a catheter ablation technique will be used to create electrical isolation around the pulmonary veins, preventing pulmonary vein ectopy from triggering atrial fibrillation. This is a crucial step in comparing the efficacy of ablation versus cardioversion in reducing AF recurrence. As for the DC cardioversion, it will be performed if the patient is still in AF at the end of the pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The implantable loop recorder, known as the Reveal device, will be inserted in the pre-pectoral position under the skin with local anesthetic and sedation at least a week before randomization. It will provide continuous recording of the heart rhythm and rate, which can be downloaded via a home monitoring system to establish the primary endpoint of the study. Lastly, two femoral sheaths (7Fr) will be inserted using ultrasound guidance under local anesthetic. These sheaths will serve as the access route for cardiac catheter insertion during the procedure. Do you have any questions or suggestions regarding these interventions?",
            "Certainly. In the sham comparator arm, patients will undergo DC cardioversion (DCCV) along with a sham procedure. Similar to the active comparator arm, an implantable loop recorder will be inserted in the pre-pectoral area with local anesthetic at least one week before randomization. Two femoral sheaths will also be inserted at the groin area in all patients on the day of the procedure prior to randomization. Additionally, intermittent phrenic nerve pacing will be employed for the sham group through the femoral venous sheath using a quadripolar catheter. Is there anything you'd like to modify or add for this arm?",
            "Absolutely. As in the active comparator arm, DC cardioversion will be performed to treat irregular heart rhythms, specifically atrial fibrillation. The implantable loop recorder, the Reveal device, will be inserted in the pre-pectoral position under the skin with local anesthetic and sedation at least a week before randomization. It will provide continuous recording of the heart rhythm and rate for data collection. Two femoral sheaths (7Fr) will also be inserted using ultrasound guidance under local anesthetic. In addition, a sham procedure will be performed after randomization, along with intermittent phrenic nerve pacing. This sham procedure, along with the use of intermittent phrenic nerve pacing, serves as a control group to compare the outcomes of the active intervention arm and assess the specific impact of pulmonary vein isolation in reducing AF recurrence.

We will measure the length of hospital stay in both the experimental and control arms from the day of surgery until discharge. The primary outcome measure will help us determine if Zinc supplementation can reduce the length of hospital stay for children undergoing surgery for Hirschsprung disease. Additionally, we will use the change in inflammatory markers such as CRP and CRP/albumin ratio as secondary outcome measures. By measuring these markers, we can evaluate if Zinc supplementation can improve postoperative immune function and reduce the risk of postoperative infections. \n\n\nOverall, I think the outcomes selected for this study are appropriate and will help us evaluate the impact of Zinc supplementation on postoperative outcomes in children with Hirschsprung disease.

It is also involved in the regulation of inflammation and has been shown to have antioxidant properties. Zinc deficiency is common in children and may contribute to poor postoperative outcomes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of preoperative Zinc supplementation on postoperative outcomes in children undergoing surgery for Hirschsprung disease. We randomly assigned 50 children with Hirschsprung disease to receive either 25 mg of Zinc per day for seven days prior to surgery or standard care without Zinc supplementation. The primary outcome measure was the change in hospital length stay after surgery. Secondary outcome measures included changes in inflammatory markers such as CRP and CRP/albumin ratio as well as the development of postoperative complications. The results of our study were clear and showed significant improvement in postoperative outcomes in children who received Zinc supplementation. The children in the Zinc group had a shorter hospital length stay, reduced inflammatory markers, and lower rates of postoperative infections."

The stable isotopes used in the intervention will include 13C5-phenylalanine. \nDetermination of albumin catabolic rate in humans using 2H5-phenylalanine and 13C5-phenylalanine as tracers\n\nAbstract:\n1. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma, and, while some data indicate that synthesis (albB) and catabolism (albC) may not be balanced at normal fasting rates, there are few human data on net albumin synthesis rate (ASR). 2. Urinary excretion of 13CO2 provides a noninvasive method of measuring ASR. Previous studies of the clearance (C(r)) of 13CO2 from plasma by albumin have used phenylalanine as a precursor. Because 13CO2 is a minor component of phenylalanine, phenylalanine\u2010driven ASR cannot be measured precisely and the validity of the clearance rate of 13CO2 (C(r)) as a measure of ASR may be questioned. 3. We have compared the urinary excretion of 12C02 and 13C02 when 10 adult subjects were given a bolus of 13C5\u2010phenylalanine. 4. We measured both the enrichment of urinary 13C02 and 12C02 and calculated their clearance rates (C(r) (urinary)). 5.

Secondary objectives were to determine whether high\u2010dose VDT affects serum calcium levels. Methods: We performed a single\u2010center, randomized controlled clinical trial of older adults who were vitamin D insufficient or deficient and received 10,000 IU/d to 80,000 IU/d of cholecalciferol. Participants older than 65 years were recruited from the university hospital. Results: Two hundred and eighteen subjects with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (25(OH)D: 7.0 \u00f7 21.1 ng/mL) were enrolled. 108 subjects were assigned supplementing doses as low as 10,000 IU/d and 100 subjects were assigned doses as high as 80,000 IU/d. A total of 164 subjects were available for the efficacy analysis (low\u2010dose group, 72; high\u2010dose group, 92) and 132 subjects were available for the safety analysis (low\u2010dose group, 58; high\u2010dose group, 74). Although the mean 25(OH)D level significantly increased during the 12\u2010month study period in both groups, it increased more in the high\u2010dose group than in the low\u2010dose group [median: 21.3 ng/mL in the high\u2010dose group vs. 16.7 ng/mL in the low\u2010dose group"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of Ta or T 1 bladder cancer were enrolled in the study. On the second postoperative day after treatment for bladder cancer, the patients underwent a flexible cystoscopy and biopsy of the posterior wall mucosa. The tumor and biopsy specimens were graded according to the WHO criteria, and the biopsy specimens were then stained with an antibody against P\u2010glycoprotein. Gemcitabine was instilled into the bladder through a Foley catheter, and patients were randomized after they were given a single dose of gemcitabine: 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, or 15.0 mg. P\u2010glycoprotein expression was reevaluated after a 48\u2010h interval. All procedures were repeated the next day. The dose of gemcitabine necessary to suppress P\u2010glycoprotein expression was defined as the concentration of gemcitabine needed to suppress P\u2010glycoprotein expression in 10% or more of the population. RESULTS: In total, 40 patients were enrolled in this study. A high intraobservational variability in P\u2010glycoprotein expression was found in the posterior wall mucosa of both tumor\u2010free (73 +/\u2010 72%) and tumor\u2010bearing (63 +/\u2010 68%) areas. Gemcitabine suppressed P\u2010glycoprotein expression in the tumor\u2010free posterior wall of five patients (12.5%) and suppressed P\u2010glycoprotein expression in the tumor\u2010bearing posterior wall of six patients (15%; P = .392). A single dose of 12 mg of intravesical gemcitabine was sufficient to suppress P\u2010glycoprotein expression in 10%",

[1] The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 50 to 100 million cases of dengue fever worldwide annually, and this number is expected to increase due to the changing climate and globalization.[2] Dengue fever is caused by four closely related dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), and it can be classified as dengue fever with or without warning signs or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). [3] Dengue fever is characterized by a high fever (39\u00b0C or higher), headache, muscle and joint pain, and skin rash.[4] Patients with warning signs may develop severe complications, such as bleeding, shock, liver damage, and hemorrhagic fever. [3] Diagnostic testing for dengue fever includes detection of dengue viral RNA or antibodies, and it is important to differentiate dengue fever from other diseases with similar clinical manifestations, such as influenza, typhoid fever, and leptospirosis.[5] There is no specific treatment for dengue fever, and the management of this disease is mainly supportive. [6] The prognosis of dengue fever varies from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe complications and even death, depending on the severity of the case.[2] As such, there is a need for early diagnosis and treatment of dengue fever to prevent complications and reduce mortality rates. [3] In this study, we aim to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of a new point-of-care testing (POCT) device for dengue fever and its impact on clinical outcomes.\n\n#\nStudy design\n=================\nSingle-",

The intervention focuses on teaching coping skills, healthy identity development, and collective action as ways to buffer against chronic stress. The intervention is grounded in a holistic, strengths-based approach that aims to provide children with the tools and resources they need to reduce their stress, improve their mental health, and foster personal growth and resilience.It is essential that we take several important precautions when implementing this study. First, it is crucial to ensure the safety and well-being of our study participants. Children in both groups\u2014Experimental: BaSICS Intervention group and No Intervention Control group\u2014should be provided with psychological support and mental health resources as needed. These resources may include in-person or telephone counseling, medication, referrals to other mental health providers, or other appropriate interventions, as determined by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist who is experienced in working with children. If a study participant refuses to participate in the study or drops out for any reason, it is important to maintain the relationship of trust and rapport that we have established with them. Even though they will not be able to participate in the study, they should still be offered psychological support and mental health resources as needed. Additionally, the well-being of our study participants should be our primary concern. If we suspect that a participant is at risk of harming themselves or others, or if they express suicidal ideation, we should involve a crisis hotline or other appropriate resources to ensure their safety. It is important for us to maintain the integrity of our study design and data collection process.

The intervention includes teaching coping skills, healthy identity development, and collective action as ways to buffer against chronic stress.

Depending on the number of children in the sample, the sample size may need to be adjusted to ensure sufficient power to detect differences between the conditions. \n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to consider potential confounding factors that could influence the outcomes of the study. For example, baseline differences in sociodemographic characteristics, mental health symptoms, or other relevant factors between the groups could bias the results. Therefore, it will be necessary to include these factors as covariates in the statistical analyses to account for any differences between the groups. \n\nFinally, it is important to consider whether the sample size is sufficient to detect meaningful differences between the conditions. This can be determined by calculating the power of the study based on the expected effect size and the desired level of statistical significance. If the power is low, the study may need to be repeated with a larger sample size to increase its chance of detecting significant differences between the conditions"

Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial and the subjects were selected from patients with acute liver failure (ALF). We chose 160 patients with an expected survival of more than 72 hours who applied to the ICU and were selected as the research subjects. The subjects were divided into group P and group A based on the modified method of intravenous feeding (the rate of infusion is increased by 10% every 24 hours) combined with the control group treated with the traditional intravenous feeding method. The amount of feeding that the two groups can tolerate and the nutritional status, organ function, coagulation function, and inflammatory response were compared between the two groups to evaluate the impact of modified enteral nutrition on clinical outcome in patients with acute liver failure. Results: There was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, the severity of disease, and Child\u2010Pugh score between the two groups (P>0.05). There was no difference in the percentage of patients who could tolerate feeding and who had to stop feeding (both P>0.05), but the amount of nutrition the two groups can tolerate was higher than that of the control group (P<0.05).

For example, if the study is investigating a condition that is more prevalent in a specific sex, such as a disease that primarily affects women, then it may be appropriate to only include women in the study. However, if the condition being studied is not sex-specific, it may be more appropriate to include both males and females in the study to ensure that the results are generalizable to the broader population.

We used two doses of hyaluronate (20\u2010mg and 30\u2010mg doses, administered as intra\u2010articular injections once a week for three consecutive weeks) in a double\u2010blinded design. All patients were randomized to both groups in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome variable was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale at six weeks post injection; the difference between the baseline pain score and the pain score at six weeks post injection was analyzed. An intent\u2010to\u2010treat analysis was performed for the primary outcome. Analyses were based on the WOMAC pain score being the primary outcome. The secondary outcome variable was WOMAC physical function.RESULTS: The mean baseline pain scores at six weeks post injection between the two study groups did not exhibit significant difference, while the improvement in pain scores at six weeks post injection (primary outcome variable) in the low\u2010dose (20\u2010mg) group was found to be more clinically relevant than that in the high\u2010dose (30\u2010mg) group.

A recent study has found that preoperative oral supplementation with an immune\u2010enhanced oral nutrition could improve postoperative outcomes such as the length of hospital stay, readmission rate and the number of days of antibiotic treatment when compared with the conventional preoperative nutritional support. However, the study had several limitations including small sample size, lack of randomization, and retrospective study design. This study aims to investigate the effects of preoperative oral supplementation with an immune\u2010enhanced oral nutrition on postoperative outcomes compared to the conventional preoperative oral nutrition. <b>Methods and analysis:</b> We will carry out a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Two hundred and two patients who are scheduled for major head and neck cancer surgery will be randomized to intervention (preoperative oral supplementation for 7 days with an immune\u2010enhanced oral nutrition) or control group (conventional preoperative oral supplementation for 7 days). The primary outcome is the duration of hospitalization. The secondary outcomes include readmission rate, antimicrobial consumption, 30\u2010day mortality and complication rate, including cardiac and respiratory complications. <b>Ethics and dissemination:</b> This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative immune nutritional support in cancer surgery. Although the effect of an immunonutrient\u2010containing nutritional supplement has been reported in previous studies, there is a lack of randomized controlled studies conducted in China. This is a multicenter clinical trial that has been approved by the ethics committee of Huaian Second People's Hospital.

In a randomized clinical trial on 135 patients, we compared the efficacy and safety of sorafenib with doxorubicin regimens. The disease control rate and disease\u2010related quality of life of patients using doxorubicin were excellent. The response rate of doxorubicin was 10% higher than that of sorafenib. Median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) in patients using doxorubicin was 6 months longer compared to that of patients receiving sorafenib (9 months vs. 3 months). Similarly, median overall survival (OS) of patients using doxorubicin was also longer than that of patients receiving sorafenib. Adverse events were rare and treatment compliance with doxorubicin regimen was good in patients with thyroid cancer."

This cohort will be selected based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 classification (Gilberts et al., 2016), molecular biology (e.g. wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase [IDH]1/2 and absence of 1p19q codeletion), and the absence of any 1p/19q codeletion-defined oligodendroglial tumors or IDH-mutant tumors since these have been previously evaluated for prognosis. Approximately 180 patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas will be identified undergoing initial resection. Genomic DNA will be isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens collected at the time of surgery, and this material will be used for exome, RNA-seq and methylation analysis.

This study is the first study to explore the clinical application of CK312 and is a two-stage phase II trial. It is a monocentric, open-lable, non-randomized, multi-coohort study. The first-stage cohort will be used for PK and safety observations, and for PK analysis of the CK312 single group, and to determine the recommended doses and regimen if necessary. In the stage II, one cohort per expansion cohort will be enrolled. Two patients will be enrolled for each cohort. The first-stage cohort will receive a dose of 5 \u03bcg/kg and 6 \u03bcg/kg respectively, the second-stage cohort will receive a dose of 7 \u03bcg/kg and 8 \u03bcg/kg respectively. The treatment will be carried out every 21 days for 6 cycles. During the same period, the investigator will take safety and PK test. In case of adverse reaction, researchers can adjust the dosage or terminate the intervention according to the actual situation. This study is expected to enroll 24 lung cancer patients, including 12 chemotherapy-controlled lung cancer patients in the combination arm (treatment group) and 12 chemotherapy-controlled lung cancer patients in the single arm (control group) for the first-stage cohort. The expansion population will be further evaluated according to the efficacy of the patients in the treatment group, and whether to expand the sample size will be finally decided by the DLT group and DMC based on the results of the evaluation.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study is a phase II clinical trial, which is an open-lable, exploratory study, a monocenter, multi-cohort, sequential group design evaluation.

Eighteen female athletes (18\u00a0years of age \u00b1 2) with a body mass index of 20 to 23\u00a0kg/m2 participated voluntarily in the study. They were divided into an aerobic and a control group. Aerobic group activities included an aerobic exercise (8\u2010 to 15\u2010minute walking) for 6\u00a0weeks at 55% to 85% of their target heart rate. The control group activities included routine sport activities. The blood volume ratio of subjects was measured before and after the study. The data were evaluated by the Wilcoxon test. There was a significant increase in aerobic group blood volume (before and after) compared with baseline (p=0.004). There was no significant difference in blood volume ratios in the aerobic\u2010exercise group (before and after study) compared with the baseline and control group (after study and baseline). No statistically significant differences between the two groups were found. In conclusion, the results of our study showed that an increase in blood volume due to 8\u00a0weeks of aerobic exercise does not have any significant differences compared with a nonaerobic exercise.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlood volume (BV) is one of the components of body fluid and is important in maintaining adequate circulating blood volume, thus enabling organ perfusion in the body (1). It comprises about 8% of body weight in healthy individuals. The red blood cells (RBCs) carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body and carry it back by collecting carbon dioxide and metabolic waste products. Aerobic exercise is an exercise that uses oxygen for cell and tissue energy production for a prolonged period of time, allowing it to continue the same amount of effort (2).\n\nNonpregnant women who exercise more than or equal to4\u00a0days a week at moderate to vigorous intensity for a minimum of 30 minutes per session are more likely to have high levels of physical activity, which is a form of aerobic exercise (2). Aerobic exercise is defined as an exercise that maintains more than 60% of",

By comparing the microbial status before and after implant placement, we can investigate if there are any specific microbial changes associated with Tapered Pro Implants. This information can be valuable in improving implant surgery treatments by understanding which microbes may potentially impact bone remodeling and healing. \n\nAbstract:\nMicrobiology \u2010 Microbial status of the oral cavity is an essential factor for maintaining dental implants in the long term. The success of dental implants is primarily determined by the quality of periodontal tissues around them. Aim \u2010 The aim of the study is to analyze whether there is a difference between the diversity and composition of the oral microbiome before implant placement between healthy patients, periodontally treated patients, and patients with a history of implant failure. The comparison will also be compared between implant\u2010retained prostheses installed in different parts of the maxilla. The impact of microbial diversity on the success rate of dental implants will be evaluated. Material and methods \u2010 The study involves 35 patients aged 18\u221280 years with a minimum follow\u2010up period of one year. Mucosal samples were collected during standard dental implant placement, and the diversity and composition of the microbiome were analyzed using next\u2010generation sequencing. Results \u2010 The comparison of microbiome diversity and composition between healthy patients, periodontally treated patients, and patients with a history of implant failure showed that the diversity and composition of microbial communities in the oral cavity differ significantly depending on the overall health of patients. Further, it was found that microbial diversity does not affect implant success rates. Conclusions \u2010 This study has shown that there is a difference in the microbial status of the oral cavity depending on the health status of patients and the location of dental implants. The study also revealed that factors other than microbial diversity play a greater role in the success rate of dental implants. The results of the study can be used to improve the standard of care for dental implants and to develop targeted treatments for different types of patients.",

The prolonged use of antibiotics was found to disrupt the natural flora of the mouth leading to the overgrowth of Candida sp. which may contribute to the development of oral candidiasis and other fungal infections. The aim of this study is two-fold, to investigate the clinical efficacy of Xylitol as an adjunct to the antifungal therapy against Candida species colonisation in HIV-infected patients with immune-mediated deficiency that are receiving antibiotics therapy and to also compare the effects of using Xylitol in two forms which is an oral wash and an oral swab on its efficacy. This study will last for 6 weeks and will have an assessments at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 of study.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nOral candidiasis is a common problem seen in patients who have undergone extensive antibacterial therapy, including immunocompromised patients. In the past, it was considered a rare occurrence in the immunocompetent hosts, accounting for less than 3% of the pathogens causing candida infections. Oral candidiasis is particularly common in the immunocompetent patient who has received intensive antimicrobial therapy. Studies have shown that the prevalence of candida colonisation is higher in patients receiving antibiotics for infection that are immunocompetent and those receiving antibiotics that are HIV-positive. However, it has been reported that treatment in these patients can be complicated by several factors, particularly the frequent presence of other pathogens. In addition, Candida species are well known to exhibit resistance to azole antifungal agents. Thus, the identification of agents to treat candidiasis is very important. In this study, we propose to determine the effectiveness of using Xylitol adjunct to the antifungal therapy for the treatment of Candida species in HIV-infected patients. Patients receiving intensive antibiotic therapy that are colonised by candida species were included in the study and 30 patients were treated with fluconazole"

The first part of the study is the dose finding phase (Phase 1A), which includes 3 parts (Parts A, B and C). Phase 1A Part A will open with up to approximately 6 participants in sequential cohorts receiving escalating fixed escalating dose of BMS administered as a 60 minute intravenous (IV) infusion before kidney transplantation followed by 4 or 5 subsequent doses. Part B is designed to include 6 or 7 participants in sequential dose cohorts to further investigate BMS activity in preventing ABMR. Part C is designed to include 6 or 7 participants in sequential dose cohorts and explores BMS activity when combined with a different tacrolimus dosing strategy. Part B and C will only proceed if the safety data from the first 3 participants in Part A show no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and if the preliminary evidence of BMS efficacy for the prevention of ABMR suggests that further participants are recommended. The second part of the study is the dose expansion phase (Phase 1B), which will be conducted in accordance with a safety and efficacy analysis of data from all participants in Phase 1A. Participants who enter Phase 1B will be randomized to receive either a fixed or an optimal dose of BMS administered intravenously after kidney transplantation.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Phase 1, Randomized, Controlled, Open-Label Dose-escalation and Dose-expansion Study of BMS-986185 in the Treatment of De Novo ABMR\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAllograft Rejection, Kidney Transplant, HLA-matched Kidney Transplant, High-risk",

Here we investigate the association between blood pressure at baseline and the risk of developing AS in the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) cohort using a prospective nested case\u2013control design. Measurement: Baseline blood pressure (N\u00a0= 1,083,113 measurements in 319 participants) was measured by general practitioners (GPs) in the Netherlands using a calibrated sphygmomanometer during a routine annual checkup or during visits for the research programs.

Results: During a median follow\u2010up of 13.8 years, 319 patients developed AS. The prevalence of baseline hypertension was 22.2%. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) from a logistic regression analysis were consistently higher for each category of higher blood pressure: for blood pressure above 140/90\u2009mmHg (vs. normal), OR 1.65 (95%CI 1.09\u20102.52), p\u00a0= 0.021, for blood pressure above 130/80\u2009mmHg (vs. normal), OR 1.47 (95%CI 1.04\u20102.05), p\u00a0= 0.032, and",

The safety and effectiveness of a once daily 3.0 mg subcutaneous dose of liraglutide plus a reduced\u2010calorie diet and behavioral modification in overweight and obese patients was compared with placebo for 56 weeks, as reported in the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes (Saxenda\u00ae for Weight Loss\u2013A Randomized, Placebo\u2010Controlled, Phase 3 Study in Patients with Obesity) trial. Materials and Methods: Adults with a body mass index \u226530 kg/m2 or \u226527 kg/m2 with at least 1 weight\u2010related comorbidity and no previous significant weight loss in the past 6 months, were randomized (1:1) for once\u2010daily subcutaneous dose of liraglutide or placebo for 56 weeks. Rescue treatment with a weight\u2010loss product was allowed after 24 weeks for treatment failure (failure to lose \u22654% weight or discontinuation because of lack of weight loss). Results: Among 3,731 randomized patients, 2,546 were treated with liraglutide and 2,518 with placebo. Greater proportions of patients lost \u22655% (34.0 vs 7.8%) and \u226510% (21.2 vs 1.4%) of baseline body weight with liraglutide compared with placebo (p<0.001). Mean change in body weight at the end of the study with liraglutide (4.37 kg) and placebo (0.86 kg) was higher with liraglutide (p<0.001). The least\u2010squares mean change in glycosylated hemoglobin with liraglutide (\u20100.08) was higher than that with placebo (\u20100.01; p<0.001).

In the first line chemotherapy era, the PFS in patients with  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\u2013wild type LUAC has been relatively disappointing (median OS 12.3 months). In contrast, the overall survival (OS) of the patients has been improved drastically by the development of novel, effective therapeutic agents and by establishing effective strategies for screening driver-gene mutations.   Nivolumab (NIVO) is a human immunoglobulin IgG4\u03ba monoclonal antibody that is programmed cell death-1(PD-1) blocking antibody. NIVO has shown to prolong PFS and OS compared with chemotherapy in patients with LUAC in two randomized phase III  trials, CheckMate 017, for the first-line treatment, and CheckMate 057, for the second-line treatment after progression of a platinum-based chemotherapy (Murai, et al. NEJM 2016;Goton, et al. NEJM 2018) (Figure 1).    Checkmate 017 is the first  randomized phase III  trial to compare the effect of nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks IV infusion) with that of standard chemotherapy (pemetrexed, cisplatin, and then pemetrexed alone) in 626 patients with advanced LUAC(NCT017219). The PFS in patients with PD-L1 negative tumors was 2.3 and 4.2 months in the nivolumab and chemotherapy groups (HR 0.81 [95 % CI 0.54-1.22]), respectively. Median OS was not reached in either group.

Tears may cause significant disability or pain, the surgical repair of which has shown to have better outcomes compared to nonsurgical management. However, the rate of re-tear after rotator cuff repair has been shown to be up to 21% and this leads to recurrent disability or pain. Despite several studies addressing the causes of insufficient rotator cuff repair, the topic of anesthesia during rotator cuff repair has remained largely unexplored. Anesthesia that could maintain patients to be quiet and comfortable would be ideal, and general anesthesia is still considered the gold standard. However, despite general anesthesia being the most popular treatment for rotator cuff repair, our results showed that arthroscopic shoulder surgery under local anesthesia alone (LA) for smaller rotator cuff tears could have advantages in terms of better pain control and faster recovery. Nevertheless, the question of whether rotator cuff repair under loco regional anesthesia (LRA) only could be considered an alternative to general anesthesia remains unanswered.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Effect Of Loco Regional Anesthesia vs Loco Regional Anesthesia Combined With General Anesthesia On The Successful Rate of Rotator Cuff Repair\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nTear of Rotator Cuff, Tendon Rupture, Musculotendinous Disease, Tendon Insufficiency, Degenerative Diseases, Rotator Cuff Diseases, Shoulder Diseases\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: loco regional anesthesia\n\n\nParticipation"

At present, its incidence rate is increasing year by year. PTB has become one of the most common infectious diseases in the world. It is most difficult to prevent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and diagnose PTB, and the diagnosis of PTB in China is mainly based on the TB diagnosis and treatment management system in 2019, so this method is easy to be interfered by other factors, and has less guiding significance for anti-TB treatment. Therefore, it is quite important to explore the new methods and strategies for detection and treatment of PTB. Interferon gamma test is one of the strategies to prevent the tuberculosis epidemic. It is hoped that it can be widely used in practice to achieve good results. The objective of this study is to compare the effect of IGRA examination on early PTB prevention and anti-tuberculosis treatment of the target population in China's health care system.

Methods: 33 patients with axSpA (mean age, 46 years; range, 35\u201065 years; mean disease duration, 6 years; range, 2\u201010 years), who participated in an on\u2010going randomized controlled trial, received a short\u2010course of anti\u2010TNF\u2010\u03b2 (infliximab, 3 mg/kg at week 0, 2 and 6) or placebo, and underwent an MRI at baseline and week 12. Three radiologists, blinded to the time of acquisition and patient, performed the evaluation on FD. The primary outcome was the mean change in FD between baseline and week 12 in the patellar articular cartilage, the tibial plateau, the fibular head and the talar dome. A cut\u2010off point of more than 2.5 for a positive increase in FD was used to determine the presence of changes in these areas. Results: All radiologists found positive changes in 97.6%, 97.4%, 97.3% and 97.8% for the talar dome, the tibial plateau, the fibular head and the patellar articular cartilage, respectively. There was no significant difference at baseline. The change in FD correlated with the decrease in enthesitis index and the decrease in pain score. Conclusion: The FD showed the same increased value in patients with axSpA but, compared to baseline, the absolute change did not differ between anti\u2010TNF\u2010\u03b2 and placebo. This measure was not able to differentiate these two patient settings."

In a first phase of the study, using a within-subject design with cross-over, the effects of a single infusion of both ketamine and the infusion of a placebo (e.g. 1 infusion of ketamine or placebo and 1 infusion of ketamine followed by placebo on a separate day) will be compared. The second phase of the study will consist of a between-subjects design, with treatment with ketamine and placebo, for seven infusions, to assess the long term effects of ketamine. Patients who demonstrate a positive effect on the primary outcome of cognitive function, will continue to another study phase during which 12 open label infusions of ketamine will be monitored. The use of EEG during drug infusions and after infusion of ketamine will provide the researchers the opportunity to examine the effect of ketamine on connectivity in the brain of veterans with PTSD. Ketamine can be used in different ways. In this pilot study the researchers are using two different ways. In the first phase the researchers will use the drug in a single infusion.

            "That's good to hear. Could you elaborate on this single group assignment? \n\nBackground\n=================\nLung cancer screening (LCS) by means of computed tomography (CT) is recommended for high-risk patients (60 years and older with at least 30 pack years of smoking). CT screening reduces lung cancer mortality. However, the effect is largely achieved among early-stage and current smokers, with little to no effect seen when applied to the low-risk population in primary care (PC). The reason for this is that CT screening can only be applied when high-risk patients (30+ pack years) are identified. This is the case in the PC setting, however. In 2018, half of smokers in the Netherlands were classified as low risk according to the Dutch national lung screening guidelines. The implementation of LCS in primary care thus currently faces a significant implementation barrier. This may change in the future, as the risk cut-off criterion for high risk in the lung screening guidelines may be lowered as new evidence on the effects of LCS become available. \n\nResearch questions\n=================\n1. Does the implementation of LCS in PC lead to an increase in the proportion of smokers who (self-report being) in high-risk? \n2. Does the implementation of LCS in PC lead to an increase in the proportion of smokers who (self-report being) willing to be referred for additional care by a GP, such as smoking cessation counseling?\n3. What are the attitudes of high-risk former smokers towards additional care by a GP or lung cancer nurse specialist (LCNS), and what are the perceived barriers and facilitators to accepting this care?\n\nIntervention\n=================\nPart of all patients who are already smoking 30 + pack years and still smoking, who have smoked >= 30 pack years in the past and who are referred by a general practitioner as high risk (e.g., on the basis of smoking history or lung health questionnaire) will be invited to participate in a comprehensive intervention program to help smokers prepare for LCS.

Please continue describing the trial design details. \n\nAbstract:\nWe report the results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an automated feedback system for preventing inappropriate prescriptions of antibiotics and potentially harmful drugs (PHDs) among patients in hospital. Hospital medical records data from 1413 patients in 49 wards at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh were audited during a 12\u2010month period in 2007. From this we identified 1910 episodes of care, each one lasting 24 hours, that were deemed as potentially preventable with the new feedback system: 997 episodes of care involving an inappropriate antibiotic and 913 involving a potentially harmful drug. The mean daily rate of inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics was 6.4 per 100 patient\u2010days, and the mean daily rate of inappropriate prescribing of potentially harmful drugs was 5.5 per 100 patient\u2010days. We used risk adjustment and logistic regression analysis to analyze the influence of potential confounding factors on the occurrence of potentially preventable harms. Using the adjusted odds ratios, a feedback intervention group was identified which contained patients who would benefit most from the feedback system. The feedback system was then piloted in this selected group of patients only. The data collected from this feasibility study suggest that an automated feedback system targeting hospital clinicians with potentially preventable harms has the potential for preventing up to 60% of errors in medication prescribing.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn 2004, an NQE target for antimicrobial prescribing was introduced by the Scottish Department of Health, requiring a 20% increase in guideline concordant antimicrobial prescribing. In order to meet this, it is likely that strategies that improve the management of infections in hospitals will also contribute to improving the appropriate use of antibiotics. Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing and potentially harmful drug (PHD) prescriptions are significant issues in both primary and secondary care. Research findings have demonstrated that, inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is commonplace in hospitals, with up to 50% of prescriptions being either unnecessary or inappropriate. Several studies have identified the reasons for this in",

            "suitable treatment option. Palliation can be achieved by a primary resection of the obstructive lesion with or without stoma formation or colonic bypass surgery. However, patients who are treated with palliative surgery do not experience the same benefits from a primary resection as oncological patients and the palliative approach has only a minimal impact on survival. As the majority of colonic cancers are right-sided and located in the ascending colon, the mortality rates are higher for left-sided colonic cancer and this accounts for 20% of all incident colorectal cancers. Patients with obstructive left-sided colonic cancer often have a long history of symptoms due to the delay in diagnosis. Emergency surgery is usually the best option in this group of patients, which does not have a curative intent. However, the primary treatment of oncological patients involves wide tumor resection with lymphadenectomy and anastomosis. There are only a very limited number of reports of emergency surgery and these were mostly performed on left-sided colorectal cancer patients with distal obstruction. The only long term survival has been reported in stoma patients. In some cases the stapled end-to-end anastomosis fails and the patient requires an ileostomy or a permanent colostomy. As this procedure will probably cure the primary tumor (and prevent disease recurrence), these patients should be closely monitored during follow-up. This study aims to improve the overall outcome of patients with obstructive left-sided colonic malignancy through a novel approach combining right hemicolectomy en transverse derivation with an elective colostomy and postoperative chemotherapy. If this novel approach results in improved survival, surgical patients may benefit from wide left hemicolectomy, which includes tumor resection with lymphadenectomy and anastomosis. Primary Objective Primary outcome of the study is survival. The survival rate after emergency surgery of right hemicolectomy with transverse colon derivation and a palliative left hemicolectomy will be compared with the data of patients who will receive emergency resection with a stoma and chemotherapy.

We agree that it is crucial to investigate outcomes such as stoma rate and quality of life in both groups to provide a more comprehensive understanding of patient experiences and preferences. To this end, we have added a further investigation on the outcomes and quality of life for patients with and without a diverting loop ileostomy in our methods. We have also considered the limitations of this approach, including potential variations in surgeon preferences and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, which can also affect surgical outcomes and quality of life. By including this additional investigation, we hope to provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to different surgical outcomes and improve the quality of care and support for patients with obstructive left colonic cancer.\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nIn this single center, retrospective cohort study, 1) we will report the outcomes of primary surgical tumor resection with and without anastomosis with a stoma. 2) we will compare the outcomes of primary tumoral resection with later wide colotomy after 2 weeks with palliative left hemicolectomy, which is the current standard of care. 3) we will compare the outcomes of surgery with palliative stenting. 4) we will compare outcomes of the various approaches in the following groups 1) tumor <3 cm, 2) tumor 3-5 cm in size, and 3) tumor> 5 cm, separately, using propensity matching. 5) patients with or without a primary colorectal anastomosis will receive a colonoscopy at 3, 6, and 9 months after surgery. This will provide us with the long-term, definitive follow-up data, and, importantly, these results are expected to support the development of guidelines regarding the appropriate use of diversion stoma in left colon obstruction.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nIn a single center, retrospective cohort study, patients with obstructive left colon cancer who underwent emergent surgery between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020 will be included.

            "Thank you for the comprehensive criteria. Now, let's proceed to designing the study arms based on the information provided. We have two participant groups/arms to consider. The first one is primary surgical tumor resection with anastomosis or only tumor resection without anastomosis. The intervention/treatment for this arm is primary tumor resection. This arm is crucial as it represents the standard approach for treating obstructive left colon cancer. It allows for the comparison between patients undergoing primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis or without an anastomosis (Hartmann's procedure). This comparison will help determine the optimal surgical approach for these patients in terms of outcomes such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "That's a valid point. We can modify the intervention/treatment description to specify primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis, associated with or without a diverting loop ileostomy. This modification will allow us to analyze the impact of diverting loop ileostomy on stoma rate and quality of life. Thank you for your input! Now, let's move on to the second participant group/arm. This arm involves endoscopic stent positioning. The intervention/treatment is staged resection after endoscopic stenting with Self-expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS). This arm is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic stenting as a bridge to surgery for patients with obstructive left colon cancer. By comparing this approach with primary surgical tumor resection, we can assess the outcomes and benefits of each strategy, such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and timing of chemotherapy initiation. This comparison will provide valuable information for clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment option for these patients. What are your thoughts on this arm?",

It is recognized as the most common movement disorder after Parkinson's disease. ET is caused by the dysfunction of the neuronal network of the cerebellum and the subcortical region. Tremor is often associated with a complex postural attitude. In particular, patients often have the need to use their hands. This is known as kinetic tremor. The aim of this study is to test different methods of gait analysis to understand the gait characteristics of patients with this ET. Patients will be recruited through the Movement Disorders Research Center of the Istituto Clinico Humanitas. Patient selection will be made using a set of questionnaires including the Movement Disorder Society Rating Scale for ET, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale, the Sickness Impact Profile, the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Falls Efficacy Scale. Gait analysis will be performed according to the protocol of the Parkinson Study Group. In the first phase of the experimental session, the patient will be seated in the wheelchair with his head resting against the headrest, his arms on the arms of the wheelchair. The body position is then adjusted so that it is symmetrical on both sides. If necessary, the position in the wheelchair will be improved by adjustment of the height of the wheelchair seat and by adjustment of the position of the back and seat belts. After this initial adjustment, the patient will wear a headpiece and electrodes will be placed on the legs, at shoulder height and behind the neck, and at ankle height. A pair of inertial sensors will be placed on both feet. To record the patient's speech, two wireless microphones will be placed on him. The patient will then stand up and walk freely for 10 seconds. The patient must walk fast enough to cover about 5 meters in 10 seconds, but not so fast that he loses his balance. The therapist will then ask the patient to walk for 3 meters without turning or accelerating, at a speed determined by the patient or the examiner. After that, the therapist will ask the patient to walk slowly to the end of the floor. The therapist then asked the patient to walk",

Despite its prevalence and associated health care costs, the available knowledge of the mechanism of neuropathic pain, including DP in diabetic patients, is very limited. In addition, while a number of treatments for neuropathic pain are in use, there are gaps in our understanding of their mechanisms of action and how they actually exert their therapeutic effect. It is our hope that by characterizing the mechanisms of these drugs and identifying new targets, we will be able to improve the safety and efficacy of the treatment of DP in diabetic patients.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPainful diabetic polyneuropathy (PDPN) is a highly prevalent disorder affecting approximately 30% of diabetes patients and 70% of those with type II diabetes, with associated health care costs projected to rise as the aged and diabetic population grows. DP is a painful condition characterized by burning, tingling and pain, as well as autonomic dysfunction, with associated symptoms such as hot and cold intolerance, abnormal sweating, and sexual dysfunction. Current treatments are inadequate, being moderately effective at best and unable to reverse pain or nerve function. Further, DP often progresses to the point of refractory neuropathic pain, and many chronic diabetics suffer from ongoing, debilitating pain. Diabetes causes vascular dysfunction via chronic inflammation, glucose flux dysregulation and oxidative and nitrosative stress that is likely to compromise blood flow and nerve function; the mechanism(s) of action through which DP develops and progresses are not defined. However, it is known that mitochondrial functional derangement plays an important role through mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidant and nitrosative stress. In particular, oxidative stress appears to play a key role in promoting diabetic neuropathy. It has been hypothesized that the administration of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a naturally occurring anti-oxidant may increase antioxidant defenses within"

What are the expected outcomes of this study? \n\n\nStudy type\n=================\nObservational study\n\nStudy design\n=================\nTransversal observational study\n\nDescription\n=================\nBrownish teeth are often a source of dissatisfaction in the population, even despite the existence of effective and reasonably priced tooth bleaching procedures. An alternative to this is laser light as an activating agent for the bleaching process, being efficient in bleaching yellow teeth1and reducing the sensitivity induced by such a treatment2. However, in dark teeth, there is the possibility of discoloration due to the photochemical effect of the laser, especially when the teeth have an intrinsic brownish color, and the use of a laser at an energy density that can trigger the bleaching effect without exceeding the discoloration threshold. Therefore, there is a need to find out whether a single session with a low-level diode laser could be a trigger for the bleaching in brownish teeth3. This article's goals are to assess tooth sensitivity before, immediately after, and 1 month after a low-level laser therapy before the bleaching treatment of brownish teeth and to find correlations between the bleaching process and intrinsic tooth discoloration.MethodsA case-control, clinical, pilot study, conducted at a public dental service in northern Portugal, on adults between 18 and 60 years old with brownish teeth. The sample was non-probabilistic, composed of individuals who presented with brownish teeth of at least 6 on the Vita scale. Participants will receive a single laser treatment session with an 810 nm laser at 0.5 Watts, before the bleaching treatment consisting of a 38% hydrogen peroxide gel for 20 minutes. The bleaching treatment will be applied to both the dentine and enamel of the affected teeth by the dentist. All the teeth in the oral cavity were bleached, except for teeth that, for anatomical or functional reasons, did not accept it. The intensity of sensitivity was assessed after bleaching and 1 month later using a visual analog scale (VAS). The intensity of tooth bleaching 1 month after bleaching was assessed with the Vita scale. The relationship between the color change and the intensity of sensitivity will be evaluated.\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================",

In this study, patients with AS were divided into three groups of control, pilates, and isometric groups. They then performed Pilates exercises, isometric exercises, or no intervention for 8 weeks. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) questionnaire and the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain and fatigue were evaluated at the beginning of the study and again 8 weeks after the start of the interventions. Data were analyzed using SPSS software and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. We also studied the possible relationship between the results of the BASFI questionnaire, NRS for pain, NRS for fatigue, weight, gender, and age with the intervention. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: In each group, 23 people participated in the study. The mean age of the subjects was 35.57\u00b19.65 years, and 52% were women. Comparing the groups revealed that the Pilates and isometric exercise groups were significantly better than the control group in terms of the BASFI questionnaire scores for functional outcome (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Also, these two groups had significantly lower pain (P<0.001) and fatigue (P<0.05) scores compared to the control group. There was no significant difference between the two exercise groups in terms of pain, fatigue and function (P> 0.05).Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrated that both Pilates and isometric exercises can reduce pain and fatigue, and improve functional disability in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

            "Abstract:\nRATIONALE: In patients with pancreatic cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may yield a good response based on a preliminary assessment of resectability. However, there are no standard response evaluation criteria yet.PURPOSE: This multicenter study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFOX (FOLinic acid, 5\u2010fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer according to the response criteria in neuro\u2010endocrine tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (mRECIST) criteria.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed clinical and radiological data from patients with pancreatic cancer who were enrolled in phase II of a multicenter, open\u2010label study that evaluated FOLFOX chemotherapy and in whom an efficacy evaluation was performed by CT scan or dynamic contrast\u2010enhanced MRI with the RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST criteria, which were established for neuro\u2010endocrine tumors. We evaluated the efficacy of FOLFOX for various response evaluations and the correlation of different radiological response criteria and complete resection.RESULTS: Twenty\u2010eight patients completed eight cycles of preoperative FOLFOX and received radical surgery. The complete resection rate was found to be 89% (25/28). In the RECIST evaluation, a partial response (PR) was observed in one patient (3%) and a stable disease was observed in three patients (11%), while in the mRECIST evaluation, a PR was observed in two patients (7%) and a stable disease with non\u2010pancreatic residual disease was observed in three patients (11%). There was no significant difference between the mRECIST and RECIST assessments in terms of tumor response using a chi\u2010square test.CONCLUSION: In patients with pancreatic cancer who received FOLFOX chemotherapy, a large proportion of responders were identified by the mRECIST criteria, and the complete resection rate was also comparable between the two evaluation criteria.

In Part 1B , the dose may be increased for further participants if Odronextamab \u226520 mg/kg is determined to be safe at the end of Part 1A. A dose level expansion cohort will enroll to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of Odronextamab at the dose level determined to be active and safe at the end of Part 1A.\n- Within approximately 2 weeks following completion of the dosing period Odronextamab + CHOP, the participants will receive a consolidation treatment of 4 additional cycles of CHOP chemotherapy treatment. \n- A total of 18 or fewer newly diagnosed patients will be enrolled in Part 1A dose escalation. In the expansion cohort, further up to 136 patients will be enrolled.

The study will utilize a standard 3+3 dose-escalation technique, which involves a stepwise increase in dosage while monitoring for tolerability and adverse events. Part 1B will focus on the selected dose cohort from Part 1A, which will aim to establish the recommended starting dose (RSD) for the treatment phase (Part 1C). \n\nPart 2 will be a randomized, open-label, two-arm, one-sided crossover, controlled study. Patients randomized to the first treatment arm will receive Odronextamab + Rituximab for Cycles 1-4, followed by crossover to receive Rituximab + Chemotherapy [RCH] for Cycles 5-11. Conversely, those in the second treatment arm will receive the reverse sequence, starting with RCH for Cycles 1-4 and subsequently crossover to receive Odronextamab + [Rituximab] for Cycles 5-11.  The primary analysis will be performed using a descriptive analysis, and the key secondary endpoint, a non-inferiority analysis, will involve the determination of a CI for OS. The two-stage step-down approach will be utilized for this assessment. \n\nAs you can see, we have designed the study phases and treatment arms based on a thorough understanding of the available data and a commitment to evaluating the safety and efficacy of Odronextamab in combination with chemotherapy effectively.  The combination of Odronextamab and rituximab in Parts 1C and 2 will help us compare the efficacy of both therapies, providing critical information to advance the treatment of DLBCL patients in the future.\nUser Rating: 3 / 5\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug Odronextamab in combination with standard chemotherapy treatment in patients with a type of blood cancer called diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

The patient needs to be in a supine posture, which has greater adverse effects on the patient's lungs and lungs. The diaphragm movement is also limited.3 Therefore, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become a minimally invasive alternative option for patients with lung cancer undergoing surgery.4 Lung is the organ most closely related to the respiratory system. Therefore, there is a high risk of lung ventilation injury during surgery.5 During VATS, the patient often maintains a lateral or lateral position to reduce operating field obstruction caused by lung inflation and to facilitate the operation of the lung on the dependent side. Because of insufficient lung ventilation and positioning, there is a risk of lung injury (LV) and postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs).6\u20138 PPCs usually occur within 30\u00a0days after surgery and include atelectasis, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchitis or phlegmon, pneumothorax, pleural effusion/empyema, infection, ventilation and intubation complications, etc.9\u201311\nThe incidence of LV and PPCs is increasing, and the incidence of pneumonia and respiratory failure accounts for the highest proportion.2, 12 Among patients undergoing VATS, the incidence of LV was 24.4%, and the incidence of PPCs was 34.4%.2 Moreover, LV and PPCs can further lead to postoperative complications and poor prognosis, causing a long hospital stay, increased postoperative cost of hospitalization and increased medical burden, and even death.2, 9, 12 Therefore, early prevention of LV and PPCs will reduce morbidity and improve the prognosis of patients.\nCurrently, the main preventive measures include effective control of lung ventilation, optimizing position"

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare chronic, progressive disease characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance in the pulmonary arteries, which in turn leads to right ventricular failure. The main cause of PH patients is congenital heart disease (PAH). Because of the lack of awareness and education on PAH, there are no relevant medical centers or specialists in the country. This study will examine the characteristics of PAH in terms of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, etiology and other related indicators, in order to provide guidance for early screening and intervention of PAH in the future. Therefore, the investigators hope to collect data for the clinical observation study, to assess some related risk factors, as well as the effect of follow-up intervention programs in PAH patients. This study is an observational study focusing on the clinical characteristics of PAH patients in China. First, the clinical characteristics of PAH patients are evaluated. For each patient, the general medical history, blood routine and urine routine, blood biochemistry, stool routine, blood coagulation function, liver and kidney function, infectious factors and antibodies, ECG, cardiac function, brain natriuretic peptide, echocardiography, lung function and chest high-resolution CT are collected. Second, the characteristics of high-risk family members are evaluated. In addition, the investigators carry out a comprehensive evaluation of patients with other factors affecting physical function, to assess their physical activity level, social resources, sleep quality, nutritional status, disease self-management level, and other issues. Thirdly, the investigators determine the specific pathogenic factor of each case, and design a case report to comprehensively summarize the medical history and treatment of all patients. The investigators will perform a retrospective analysis of 49 patients with congenital heart disease to further analyze the characteristics of patients, and at the same time further analyze and compare their short-term and long-term prognoses.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPulmonary hypertension is a rare chronic, progressive disease, characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance in the pulmonary arteries, which in turn leads to right ventricular failure.

The trial will assess the impact of the intervention using a matched\u2010pair difference\u2010in\u2010difference analytic approach. The intervention consists of three key components: 1) delivery of a 2\u2010hour health and financial literacy program by trained peer\u2010leaders, 2) access to an online resource guide that promotes evidence\u2010informed health behaviors among adults with diabetes, and 3) targeted texting reminders of health\u2010related and financial literacy messages throughout the trial. The program was first piloted with a convenience sample of patients attending health\u2010related classes at the study site. Participants will be recruited in three phases to evaluate the intervention over time. A total of fifty healthcare delivery sites (clusters) from a single large academic medical center network will be randomized in a stepped\u2010wedge fashion to implement the intervention. The intervention will be rolled out in 3 cohorts of 17 sites, with the first cohort receiving the control condition and being re\u2010exposed to the intervention in a rolling fashion during the trial. The objective of this trial is to determine the effectiveness of a health and financial literacy program on improving health and wealth behaviors among patients receiving care within an academic medical center network."

            "Thank you for providing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Now, let's discuss the design of the study arms. Based on the information you've given me so far, I suggest the following study arms:\n\n1. Experimental: VR-TrAC\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the VR-TrAC group will follow the Virtual Reality Training for Aggression.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The VR-TRAC group will undergo a 16-session training program focused on aggression control using virtual reality technology. The training is based on the Virtual Reality Aggression Prevention Training (VRAPT) protocol developed by Klein Tuente et al. The sessions are structured to target different stages of information processing related to aggressive behavior, including early and late stages. Participants will practice handling aggressive-inducing situations in virtual reality scenarios.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is essential to assess the effectiveness of the VR-TRAC intervention in reducing aggression among the prison-based population. The structured training program using virtual reality technology allows for a controlled and immersive environment to practice aggression control strategies. By comparing the outcomes of this group with the control group, researchers can evaluate the impact of VR-TRAC on aggression regulation.\n\n2. Other: Care as Usual\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the Care as Usual group will receive standard care provided in the prison setting.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Care as Usual (CAU) in prison consists of treatments aimed at stabilizing psychological states, such as pharmacological treatment, supportive contact, or transfer to a Penitentiary Psychiatric Centre for necessary interventions.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as the control group for comparison with the VR-TRAC intervention group. By including a group that receives standard care practices in the prison environment, researchers can evaluate the additional benefits of the VR-TRAC program in reducing aggression beyond what is typically provided. This arm helps assess the incremental value of the VR-TRAC intervention in improving aggression control outcomes compared to standard care practices.",

            "Yes, there are. The machined transcortical portion of the experimental arm is expected to have a better clinical and radiographic outcome compared to the roughened transcortical portion in the active comparator arm. The bone consumption procedure in both arms is expected to improve the stability of implants in thin, partially edentulous ridges. We are also interested in assessing whether the combination of the bone consumption and bone expansion procedures is superior to the bone expansion technique alone for implant placement and supporting long-term dental prostheses.\n\nStudy design\n=================\nProspective cohort study\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\nThe patients selected for this study will be those with partially edentulous implant gaps in the posterior upper and/or lower jaw and with a residual bone width of 3 to 5 mm. They should be non-smokers or non-heavy smokers, with a maximum of five cigarettes per day. They should also be 18 to 80 years old and present no contraindications to surgery or dental implants. The inclusion criteria are further detailed in the study protocol.\nWhat is the population of patients with partially edentulous implant gaps in the posterior upper and/or lower jaw who have a residual bone width of 3 to 5 mm? \nTo answer this question, we have included a population of patients with partially edentulous implant gaps in the posterior upper and/or lower jaw who have a residual bone width of 3 to 5 mm. Additionally, we have conducted a power analysis to determine the required sample size based on the difference in the implant healing index (HI) between the study arms. The inclusion criteria regarding the residual bone width were determined after considering the typical range of bone width for successful implant placement and the limitations of the bone expansion procedure.\nWhat does a non-smoker or non-heavy smoker mean in this study? \nA non-smoker or non-heavy smoker is defined as someone who has smoked fewer than five cigarettes per day. This criterion was included to minimize the risk of complications during and after surgery.\nWhat is the minimum and maximum age of the patients in this study? \nThe minimum age is 18 years and the maximum age is 80 years, which is considered the upper age limit for successful implant placement.

Hypofibrinolytic effects of colchicine have proven beneficial in primary prevention of VTE. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a short perioperative colchicine administration in prophylaxis against VTE after spinal surgery. Methods: The study is a double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre, randomised parallel\u2010group trial involving 690 adults undergoing elective spinal surgery. Adults undergoing elective spinal surgery or surgery of the upper extremities or neck under general anaesthesia (excluding trauma or infection) with a minimum duration of surgery time 60 minutes and a high risk of developing VTE were eligible for the study (250 patients for each group). Patients were randomly allocated to perioperative treatment with Colchicine or placebo for three days. The primary outcome is the detection of a DVT by lower limb ultrasonography within one month after surgery. A secondary outcome is the incidence of secondary bleeding after spinal surgery. Results: From October 2017 to February 2018, we included 690 patients in this study: 255 patients in the colchicine group and 256 patients in the placebo group. According to the Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis, no significant difference was found between the two groups in the incidence of DVT. The rate of postoperative DVT in the colchicine group was 7.9%, 95% confidence interval 4.6%\u20109.8%, and in the placebo group 5.9%, 95% confidence interval 2.5%\u20107.3%.

To determine the appropriate target sample size for a feasibility clinical trial to evaluate the safety and performance of the Revision LR femoral stem. Methods. The sample size was estimated based on the primary outcomes, which are the primary total hip function score (THA) at two years and one year. The THA was measured using the Harris Hip Score (HHS) scale, with a higher score indicating better outcomes. The sample size was calculated using a power analysis with a 50% effect size (ES), two\u2010tailed alpha error of 0.05, and a power of 0.80. The calculation was based on the previous study results of the primary THA scores, assuming that half of the participants would experience improvement or worsening from baseline. The primary result was divided in half, and the sample size equation was calculated. The sample size calculation was performed using a spreadsheet. The obtained sample size was rounded up to the nearest 5 or 10, taking into account potential dropouts. Results. The estimated sample size was 25 participants per study arm, based on the assumption of 25% attrition at two years and 10% attrition at one year. Conclusions. The sample size calculation was completed for this feasibility clinical trial, and the estimated sample size was 25 participants per study arm.

The disease process starts with the build-up of fatty deposits in the inner layer of the arteries, known as atherosclerosis. As the disease develops and progresses, it can lead to plaques that may become unstable, rupture and trigger a heart attack or stroke. Carotid artery imaging using ultrasound is a clinical procedure used to diagnose and confirm these atherosclerotic deposits and assess the extent of the disease. The disease process can affect both the innermost and outermost layers of the arteries but this varies by disease severity, patient and disease location. The innermost layer of the arteries consists of mostly a smooth muscle that is called the intima. The outermost layer consists of connective tissue and smooth muscle that constitute the wall of the artery and is called the media. These layers expand and contact each other as an individual ages or if disease is present. This makes it more difficult to assess the disease and the development of it without looking at the layers.This means that doctors have to rely on imaging techniques to estimate disease location, disease severity and rate of growth. In medical studies, the average increase in the size of the middle layer of the carotid artery has been suggested to be 0.1mm per year in people who are over 55. Recent research has shown that patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to produce procollagen protein in the blood. Procollagen is one of the proteins that is",

Due to the relatively high cost of topographers, the analysis of corneal topography was mainly limited to the preoperative examination of corneal refractive surgery. The costly diagnostic imaging device for corneal topography is available. Therefore, it is necessary to expand its use. In this study, we conducted a prospective and systematic study using a topographer for the management of refractive patients in a routine clinical setting. The aim of this study was to detect a progressive thinning of the cornea within a 5-yea period after the refractive status remained stable and to establish an early detection and diagnostic system of corneal thinning diseases. Methods \n\nCorneal topography was performed using the Oculus Pentacam HR device. All images were recorded at the baseline and every year for five years. Intraocular pressure, corneal pachymetry (with noncontact tonometer), and the Schirmer test were performed once a year. Clinical observation included the development of corneal stromal cysts and cataracts. A complete ocular examination was performed at all visits. Patient demographics such as age and sex were recorded. The diagnosis of progressive corneal thinning and keratoconus was made by Pentacam. The corneal topography map was also used to assess the presence of posterior elevation, which may indicate posterior elevation, corneal ectasia, or corneal ectasia. Intraocular pressure was measured using an applanation tonometer. Patients with progressive thinning were classified according to the KC staging system and the presence of posterior elevation was categorized.

Since CCLX can significantly slow the progression of KC and achieve excellent visual correction and refractive stability, its application in the treatment of KC has extended to various stages of KC.\nThe treatment effect of CXL is mainly due to the interaction of UV irradiation and riboflavin to strengthen the structure of corneal collagen. It also makes the cornea stiffer and more resistant to stress damage by affecting the expression of various genes and proteins . However, studies have found that the change in corneal biomechanics in the same course of progression may be different in KC . In mild KC patients (\u226447 D), the corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) increased before CXL. In advanced KC patients (KC >47 D), the corneal hysteresis in patients receiving CXL decreased significantly, while the corneal resistance factor (CRF) also decreased significantly, which was different from the change in the early stage . The degree of change in the central corneal thickness (CCT) after CXL was related to keratometry (K) and pachymetry . In patients with greater corneal stiffening, the central corneal thickness (CCT) of the treated eye decreased, while the central corneal thickness (CCT) of patients with low corneal stiffening increased. At the same time, the decrease or increase of CCT after CXL treatment was not related to the reduction or reduction of K, respectively. But these results did not take into account the influence of corneal biomechanics on the change in CCT.\nTransprismal photorefractive keratectomy (PTRK) has been effective and safe in the treatment of myopia.

The incidence of post\u2010stroke delirium varies from 7.4% to 49% and varies from 18.9% to 60.6% with vascular cognitive impairment. Donepezil is an inhibitor of acetyl cholinesterase, which blocks the decomposition of acetylcholine, thus increasing its concentrations. Donepezil is used in the treatment of dementia. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 4 mg Donepezil for 10 weeks in the treatment of delirium and vascular cognitive fading. Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial in Iran. For this reason, the patients will enter the study as individuals or group according to the degree of disability based on The Modified Rankin Scale, and the same will be assigned to the experimental and control group. There will be a 10\u2010week drug administration period for the experimental group and a 10\u2010week follow\u2010up period for both groups. Participants\u2019 medical information is recorded using a medical checklist questionnaire, which includes demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and clinical features. Moreover, brain MRI and cognitive function test are used to assess baseline cognition and brain function. Donepezil and placebo are randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. Finally, the data collected will be compiled and analyzed using the SPSS software version 22. Conclusion: In Iran, few clinical trials have been done on delirium. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of delirium and cognitive fading. Findings of this study will be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of delirium and to conduct studies in delirium care.",

Dupilumab is now under investigation in patients with asthma and other paediatric indications. Methods: The 506\u2010MG\u2010LIBERTY-ASTHMATAKIDS was a double\u2010blinded, active\u2010controlled, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial which included children aged 2 to <12 years (\u226530kg). Participants were randomised 1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 300mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), dupilumab 100mg Q2W or placebo for 52 weeks. All study medications were administered by subcutaneous injection. A total of 268 participants were randomised in each group. Co\u2010primary endpoints were annualised rate of asthma exacerbations in patients aged \u22656 years and annualised rate of asthma exacerbations and/or time to first asthma exacerbation in patients aged 2\u2010<6 years. Results: Significant and clinically relevant improvements in the annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbations were observed in children/adolescents aged \u226530kg and/or \u22656 years of age treated with dupilumab 300 or 100 mg Q2W compared with placebo. Significant improvements in the annualised rate of asthma exacerbations and/or time to first asthma exacerbation were observed for children <6 years of age treated with dupilumab compared with placebo. The safety profile for Dupilumab was comparable to the placebo. Conclusions: Dupilumab treatment provided significant and sustained improvements in asthma exacerbations, demonstrating an efficacy and safety profile similar to that seen in other study populations.",

However, the optimal method of treating for pain control have not been elucidated. The study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of oral administration of pregabalin versus nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs in patients treated for perianal abscesses. Methods: This randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial with assessor blinding was conducted between February 2021, and December 2022, in the Department of Plastic Anatomy and Pediatric Surgery. A total of 106 patients aged&gt;19 years were included. They were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg pregabalin orally twice a day (experimental group) or the same volume of placebo (control group) for 4 days. The primary endpoint was pain intensity on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, and 3, assessed by the patient using a Visual Analog Scale. The secondary endpoints were analgesic use, the mean pain score per 24 hours, complications, and other adverse events. Data were analyzed by intention\u2010to\u2010treat (ITT) and completers analysis. Results: Of the 106 patients, 30 patients (28.3%) were excluded due to protocol deviations, and 76 patients were included in the ITT analysis (38 patients in the experimental group and 38 in the control group). Pregabalin resulted in significantly lower pain intensity scores on POD 3 than placebo [95% CI: \u20102.38 to \u20100.35, p = 0.016] based on the ITT analysis. In the completers analysis, pregabalin resulted in a lower primary endpoint compared with placebo on POD 3 [95% CI: \u20102.83 to \u20100.56, p = 0.007] and better analgesic effect in POD 3 [95% CI: \u20101.54 to \u20100.13, p = 0.033",
            "Very good! This arm will help us assess the efficacy of the active substance in treating uncontrolled asthma and/or severe asthmatic wheeze in young children. Once we have obtained the informed consent from the participants and their parents or other legal representatives and enrolled them in the study, we will administer the first dose of Dupilumab or placebo (subcutaneous injection). Based on the participant's previous medical history and symptoms during screening, a treatment period of 24 weeks will be defined. What happens if the participant has an adverse event related to the study treatment? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: In this study, we will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma in children aged 2 to 5 years. In this age group, it is very significant to investigate the potential benefits in terms of efficacy and safety of Dupilumab, as there are currently limited available treatment options for children in this age range with severe asthma. Moreover, previous research has shown that Dupilumab can effectively reduce inflammation in the airways and improve clinical outcomes in adults and adolescents with severe asthma. The aim of this study is to determine if the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Dupilumab in children aged 2 to 5 years is non\u2010inferior to its efficacy in adults and adolescents. It is necessary to obtain informed consent to participate in a clinical trial involving human subjects, as participants and their legal representatives need to understand the purpose of the study, the risks and benefits involved, and the rights and obligations associated with participating. Informed consent serves to protect the rights and well\u2010being of human subjects in clinical research by ensuring their full understanding and voluntary participation. It is essential to have complete and accurate information about the study in order to make an informed decision. In clinical research, informed consent is crucial for ensuring the ethical and legal compliance of the study and the protection of the rights of human subjects. The informed consent document should be clear, concise, and understandable to the participant and their legal representative, and should be presented in easily understandable, non\u2010technical language. The content of the informed consent form must include a description of the study's objectives, the study's procedures, and the participant's rights and responsibilities",

And what about the secondary efficacy endpoints? \n\nAbstract:\nLaser in situ keratomileusis (Lasik) in patients with low myopic astigmatism (\u2264 3.50 D) have been shown to be not always satisfactory. Efficacy of LtK combined with hazyon femtosecond laser\u2010generated lens (ZLE) was evaluated in patients with low myopic astigmatism. Seventy\u2010three patients with myopia > \u20102.00 D and astigmatism up to \u20103.50 D were randomly divided into three groups: control (phacoemulsification and intraocular lens [IOL]), ICL (implantable collamer lens) and ICL plus LtK (hazyon femtosecond laser\u2010generated lens plus LtK) groups. The refractive error at postoperative 3 months was recorded and measured at postoperative 12 months. Visual acuity at postoperative 12 months was compared by analysis of variance. No statistical significances were found between the groups for any refractive correction and visual result. With a mean cylinder correction of \u20100.79 (range: \u20101.77 to 0), the ICL plus LtK group showed the best outcome with a mean refractive cylinder of \u20100.23 (range: \u20101.64 to 0) in the postoperative 3 months, p = 0.034.

This single\u2010arm, phase 2a trial examined the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of the antibody\u2010drug conjugate Hu5F9\u2010CD3 BCMA in relapsing MS (RMS) patients. Methods: The study aimed to dose\u2010escalate by 0.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W) or at 2\u2010weekly (Q3W) intervals in patients who tolerated an early dose. The safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events. MRI data were the primary efficacy endpoint. Results: Twelve patients are enrolled with six on Q3W 0.5 mg/kg and six on Q3W 1.0 mg/kg who received 3 treatments. Seven patients were treated with 2.0 mg/kg/cycle, three of whom had previously been treated at 0.5 mg/kg Q3W. To\u2010date, all 12 patients completed all study visits and 11 remain on\u2010treatment.

METHODS: Ninety four diabetes patients participated the training sessions, which comprised of 8 topics. All the participants were asked to evaluate the training sessions. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part included 4 items, which were mainly aimed to describe the satisfaction in terms of the CBDNs and the training content; and the second part included 10 items, specifically, aimed to describe the perception of CBDNs about the impact of the training, training on their knowledge, and their interest in the model. RESULTS: Eighty six participants completed the training and evaluation sessions. Eighty four.7 % of the participants agreed that it was very helpful. Nine (10.5%) and only one (1.2%) patient complained about the lack of accessibility to the CBDNs and thought that there was insufficient training on self management of diabetes. Ninety eight point one percent (98.1%, 83/84) of the participants agreed or strongly agreed that the CBDNs have increased their motivation in self managing diabetes and maintaining a balanced lifestyle. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of the CBDN model and the training contents was positive. As for the further development of this model, more community diabetes nurses are required to reduce the ratio waiting time for the initial screening and the referral to hospital. The training manual requires further revisions to increase the specificity of training content for diabetic patients and to facilitate the accessibility of CBDNs.\n\nIntroduction\nDiabetes Mellitus has been considered as a major health threat and a global epidemic of the 21st century.

Could you please provide me with some more information about your treatment method? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nSkin barrier dysfunction and related conditions, such as atopic dermatitis and urticaria, are growing at an alarming rate. However, the cause of such skin disorders is unclear, making it difficult to find appropriate treatments. The concept of the present study is to restore the skin barrier by regulating the skin flora. Zantogin\u00ae Gel is a drug-free topical agent with a low molecular weight that has received a patent as an ingredient for skin care products. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical application of Zantogin\u00ae Gel in skin disorders caused by skin barrier dysfunction with a single-center prospective exploratory clinical study. Patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis or urticaria at skin barrier sites were enrolled and treated for 4 weeks. Atopic dermatitis, urticaria and skin barrier function were evaluated, and blood samples were routinely evaluated. No side effects, changes in hematology and biochemical profile were observed with topical treatment at the dose tested. The results of this clinical study suggest that the topical treatment of Zantogin\u00ae Gel, a low molecular weight natural product, is a novel method for treating mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, urticaria and skin barrier dysfunction.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSkin barrier dysfunction is known to promote various skin diseases, and atopic dermatitis and urticaria are the most common, with increasing prevalence in recent years. Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that begins with skin barrier dysfunction at an early age. Although the exact etiology of atopic dermatitis is not understood, recent evidence supports the importance of the skin microenvironment as a therapeutic target for skin barrier disorders. 13S-methionine, also known as s-adenosylmethionine (SAM), is a methyl donor that is thought to be involved in the regulation of the skin microenvironment by regulating the expression of genes involved in skin barrier function. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that targeting lipid metabolism using Z",

It is also known, however, that the metabolism of orally taken carbamazepine with the active metabolite E is saturated. At low levels, the body produces a minimal amount of E metabolites, which may be related to the dose of carbamazepine ingested or the pharmacokinetics of certain drug transporters. An increase in drug concentrations is associated with a decrease in the drug's effect, which increases the frequency of seizures and raises the risk of a seizure complication. The concentration at which the benefits of the anti-epileptic drug exceed the toxic action corresponds to a narrow therapeutic range, which can vary from drug to drug. The toxic action associated with carbamazepine is dose-dependent and involves the accumulation of the active metabolite E. In turn, an increase in the concentration of active metabolite E in the body can cause side effects, which can affect compliance. Therefore, there will be some patients who will need to withdraw from the therapy due to the intolerable dose or concentration of active metabolite E. At this time, it is suggested that serum tryptophan levels could be associated with an increased frequency of seizures and decrease in the therapeutic effect of carbamazepine, thereby causing the dose to be raised. Studies evaluating carbamazepine levels in patients with epilepsy have shown that the presence of increased concentrations of"

TmPSMA\u201002 is an anti\u2010prostate cancer chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy designed to recognize prostate\u2010specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and neuroendocrine cell membrane antigen. In a previous Phase I/Part 1 clinical trial (NCT03926073), TmPSMA\u201002 CAR T cells showed promising anti\u2010tumor activity in metastatic castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with a reasonable safety profile. Additionally, a Phase I/Part 1 clinical trial is ongoing in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) (NCT04866291). The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of escalating doses of TmPSMA\u201002 CAR T cells in patients with mCRPC. Study design: This is an open\u2010label, single\u2010arm, dose finding study. Cohorts will include no more than 12 patients for each cohort for a maximum total of 54 patients. There are 5 dose levels of TmPSMA\u201002 CAR T cells: 1x10(5) (Cohort A); 3x10(5) (Cohort B); 1x10(6) (Cohort C); 1x10(7) (Coh",

CP comprises a group of disorders characterized by problems with muscle coordination, body movement, and posture that limit an individual's functional abilities. However, no single treatment has been proven to be effective in reversing or mitigating the symptoms of CP. Nimodipine (Nim) has been shown to improve the quality of life (QoL) in children with CP. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of Nim in 40 patients with bilateral cerebral palsy (BCP) in terms of the effectiveness of locomotor training. Methods: The study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. A total sample of 40 BCP patients, aged 3\u20108 years, were randomly allocated into 2 groups: intervention group: 35 patients who received 25 mg of Nim per day for a year and placebo group: 15 randomized control patients who received identical placebo tablets. The patients' movement impairment and other functional activities were assessed by a trained neurodevelopmental therapist using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (Brunnstrom) [1], GMFM (Vojta) [3], and GMFCS [4] at the baseline, 6th, and 12th months after initiation of the treatment.

Participants (n=50) will be recruited from the oncology department through a collaborative partnership between Dr. Christina Vu-Thiem, the principal investigator for this study, who is a breast-cancer oncologist, and Dr. Patricia McAlister, who is a professor of Physical Therapy at the University of Pittsburgh and a leading clinical researcher in the area of bone health for cancer survivors. Dr. McAlister will also serve as clinical lead for the study, and work with the principal investigator and research team to perform patient screening, recruit participants, conduct testing, and provide support for data collection activities. The study team will recruit women who have been diagnosed with Stage I, Stage II, or Stage III breast cancer and have been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy up to 12 months prior to enrollment. Recruited patients will be tested for osteosarcopenia. In general, osteosarcopenia is characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced muscle mass, and is a risk factor for post-menopausal breast cancer. The intervention is a 12 week exercise program that combines strength training and weight-bearing aerobic exercise. If you qualify to join this study, you will be in the study for 14 weeks, including a 2-week break between the screening visit (week 0) and the 9-week intervention (weeks 2-12). You will be asked to complete an extensive survey to assess your health-related quality of life. You will also undergo comprehensive body composition and functional fitness testing and complete a body image questionnaire. If you complete the 9-week intervention, you will also participate in a single follow-up visit, during which you will repeat the comprehensive body composition and functional fitness testing and complete the body image questionnaire. 50 women who meet the eligibility requirements for the study will be recruited to participate.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis pilot randomized control trial seeks to examine the feasibility of implementing a progressive, 12-week, exercise program designed to reduce the risk of bone fracture among",

            "Abstract:\nThe prostate cancer death rate in England has fallen by 48% since 1990. This is mainly due to increased awareness and treatment, and is likely to increase by further developments.1 Radioligand therapy (RLT) is the most recent development of 177Lu\u2010 PSMA therapy and is rapidly emerging as an important treatment option for prostate cancer. This treatment is based on the monoclonal antibody IgG 177Lu\u2010 PSMA\u2010617, a ligand that binds to PSMA, which is then targeted by radiotherapy in men with prostate cancer. PSMA is a specific cell membrane protein on the surface of prostate cancer cells that is expressed in prostate cancer lesions.177Lu\u2010PSMA\u2010617 is an ideal choice for radiotherapy, as it has low non\u2010specific binding to normal cells and tissues and high binding affinity to PSMA. A recent retrospective study has shown improved clinical outcomes with minimal toxicity in PSMA+ prostate cancer patients with RLT. With more data, we will better understand the efficacy and safety of RLT and its role in treating prostate cancer.",

Protocol Information and Introduction Lung transplantation (LT) is the primary treatment for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In addition to improving symptoms and quality of life, LT has also been shown to improve survival in IPF. Unfortunately, only one-third to one-half of patients survive 1 year posttransplantation, and about 50% survive 5 years. The long-term survival of LT recipients with IPF, mainly due to mortality from chronic rejection, remains a major problem in the field of clinical transplantation. Currently, chronic rejection is the leading cause of late LT morbidity and mortality, making it the primary target of clinical therapies. However, new immunosuppressive agents, such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, cannot prevent chronic allograft destruction. In addition, no effective treatment for the prevention and treatment of chronic rejection is available. As a result, research is actively being conducted to develop novel and effective therapies for the treatment of pulmonary allograft rejection. At present, most IPF patients who do not receive LT are also diagnosed and treated with Pirfenidone or Nintedanib drugs. But there is still a lot of uncertainly about the value of Pirfenidone. This is because IPF patients who do not receive the recommended drug are still subject to mortality. Therefore, our team launched this clinical study to observe, analyze and evaluate the clinical efficacy and application value of Pirfenidone in the treatment of patients with pulmonary fibrosis. A.

            "Understood. Here's what the Pain Neuroscience Education intervention should entail: It involves educating patients about the neuroscience of pain, as well as the relationship between pain and movement, thoughts, and emotions. It is based on the principle that psychological and social factors, such as beliefs and fear of pain, can significantly affect the sensation of pain. The intervention includes education on the neuroscience of pain, as well as the relationship between pain and movement, thoughts, and emotions.\n\nEducation on the neuroscience of pain: This involves explaining to patients that pain is a complex experience that is not just a response to tissue damage. It involves educating patients about the complex network of nerves, hormones, and brain functions that contribute to the experience of pain. Education on the relationship between pain and movement, thoughts, and emotions: This involves educating patients about the connection between their thoughts, behavior, and pain. It includes teaching patients about how their thoughts and beliefs about pain can influence their pain experience and encouraging them to adopt healthier behaviors and thoughts about pain.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. The Pain Neuroscience Education intervention will consist of educational materials and sessions that aim to inform and educate patients about the complexities of pain. The intervention will be designed to help patients understand that pain is a multidimensional experience that can be influenced by various factors such as emotional state, beliefs, and social support. The intervention will also focus on the role of movement in managing pain and strategies to promote physical activity and strengthening, while also managing pain.",

By using the MDASI-GI questionnaire, we can evaluate the severity of symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, change in taste, and feeling bloated. This data will help us understand the impact of MIPG on symptom management and quality of life for these patients. The MITG arm will serve as the standard of care/control group for comparison. By administering the MDASI-GI questionnaire to participants undergoing MITG, we can evaluate and compare the severity of gastrointestinal cancer symptoms between the two surgical procedures. This comparison is essential for determining the efficacy and impact of MIPG versus MITG on symptom management and patient outcomes.",

This arm will involve a behavioral intervention focused on addressing potential problematic food parenting behaviors and enhancing more proactive food parenting behaviors. We will use behavioral parent training, providing parents with skills and strategies to support their children's healthy eating habits. The intervention will be designed to address factors such as family meal times, modeling healthy eating behaviors, promoting variety in food choices, and providing consistent and positive feedback to children regarding their eating habits. This arm will allow us to determine if changes in the food parenting environment, can help reduce obesity risk factors in children who are highly food motivated. I think it's an excellent addition! \n\nAbstract:\nA two\u2010phase intervention study was conducted wherein 165 children were randomized to a placebo, erythropoietin (EPO), interferon beta (INF), or EPO+INF treatment. Pulmonary function, dyspnea, chest X\u2010rays, and quality of life were examined during two different phases. Erythropoietin was superior to INF and placebo for improving pulmonary function and reducing the rate of exacerbations. Fifty children were assigned to combined or sequential treatment with EPO and INF for at least one year. Improvements were sustained in patients treated with both EPO and INF. Overall results suggest that EPO may be an important addition to standard asthma treatments.",

Can you tell me more about the LEARN program? \n\nAbstract:\nAdults with obesity are vulnerable to metabolic alterations, including insulin resistance and inflammation, which are risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Obesity\u2010related liver disease is a prevalent problem worldwide; however, there remain many gaps in knowledge of treatments for NAFLD. Dysregulation in circadian rhythm is associated with insulin resistance and fatty liver disease in preclinical studies, and this provides rationale to test circadian rhythm interventions. Time\u2010restricted eating (TRE) is a promising form of nonpharmacological intervention that restricts the window during which calories are consumed. However, there are few rigorous studies of its effects in individuals with NAFLD. This study tests a 24\u2010week TRE protocol in adults with overweight and obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We also develop a time\u2010restricted eating training manual to maximize adherence to the intervention. The purpose of this study is to test whether a TRE intervention improves liver function, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic indicators in adults with NAFLD. Secondary aims are to determine the effects of this TRE protocol on quality of life, sleep and appetite, and the effects of the intervention itself on body weight and composition. The results of this study will provide critical information on the benefits of circadian rhythm\u2010based interventions in the treatment of NAFLD.",

And, what is the comparator or control treatment? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this project is the evaluation of an action-research that combines the use of two single-dose hydroalcoholic solutions on abscesses in people who self-inject drugs (PWID) of the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a hand-hygiene method called 'WHO-5', this hand-hygiene method contains five moments: (1) preparation; (2) hand-rub (using a hydroalcoholic solution); (3) moment before patient care and between patients; (4) moment before aseptic procedure; and (5) hand-rub immediately after removing gloves. This project has the following hypotheses: 1. PWID can develop hand-hygiene practices adapted to their daily use at the time of preparation and after skin lesion cleaning using the solution for hand-rubbing; 2. Hydroalcoholic solution containing 80% alcohol concentration shows superiority to the conventional 70% alcohol concentration in the treatment of abscesses in PWID; 3. Educational intervention combined with the use of a hydroalcoholic solution with an alcohol concentration of 80% is more effective in the treatment of abscesses in patients with a positive drug test than the educational intervention alone in combination with the normal hydroalcoholic solution concentration in PWID.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSeveral studies in health have demonstrated the importance of good hand hygiene, since there is a direct relationship between contamination and infection, therefore, proper management of hand hygiene is vital in health care, since it can significantly reduce the risk of healthcare-related infections and therefore prevent cross infections in patients. The WHO-5 hand-hygiene method, which was developed to meet the standards of this type of hygiene in the hospital environment, already presented in 2013, that the ideal concentration for the hydroalcoholic lotion is 80% alcohol, once this concentration guarantees a high efficacy and, on the other hand, a reduction in the incidence of allergic reactions.

Method: We recruited 30 nonobese (body mass index (BMI)\u2009=\u200918.5\u201024.9) and premenopausal controls (n\u2009=\u200915) and 30 obese (BMI\u2009=\u200930\u201039.9) and perimenopausal women from January 2018 until July 2019. Participants were asked to consume four 500\u2009mg capsules of either ginger (treatment group, n\u2009=\u200930) or placebo daily for four weeks. Polysomnography was used to monitor sleep quality, polysomnography to monitor sleep quality, and food cravings were assessed. Results: Sleep quality of the treatment group was found to be improved compared to premenopausal controls when they consumed ginger capsules daily for four weeks. However, no significant differences were seen in sleep quality parameters between the treatment or placebo group on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep architecture, or respiratory disturbance index following the sleep study and the snoring propensity score, as well as appetite control parameters from the Food Craving Inventory. Conclusions: Daily consumption of ginger capsules (4000\u2009mg/d) for four weeks in perimenopausal women with obesity might improve sleep quality and appetite control parameters.",

This type of randomization ensures that the potential effects of the test drug are not influenced by biased or subjective factors. It also ensures that the results of the study are generalizable to a larger population since each group will have an equal chance of receiving the test drug or the placebo.

[D01/H01] [H1] The intervention will be given openly, with the researcher and participants aware of each other's group assignment. This type of masking does not provide a \"blind\" element to either the researcher or the participant, as they will know which group each participant is randomly assigned to.

I am planning to conduct a prospective cohort study.\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nChlorogenic acid, as a major antioxidant, exhibits many pharmacological and physiological properties in vivo. Numerous studies have reported that chlorogenic acid has excellent anti-cancer effect. The role of chlorogenic acid in anti-oxidant and chemoprevention may also be attributed to the inhibition of the cyclooxgenase (COX) pathway. In addition, chlorogenic acid has the ability to inhibit a variety of proteins, which may be involved in tumor metastasis and proliferation. However, only a few studies have reported the function of chlorogenic acid on colon cancer and the corresponding mechanism of action. Therefore, combined with the results of the literature report, we are going to investigate the function and mechanism of chlorogenic acid to treat colon cancer. We will focus on the following areas: inhibition of tumor proliferation and apoptosis induction, inhibition of migration and invasion of tumor cells, and inhibition of angiogenesis and inflammatory response. The purpose of this study is to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of chlorogenic acid in the treatment of colon cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis prospective cohort study will collect a total of 60 volunteers who will undergo colonoscopy for colon cancer screening in Fuwai Hospital of Ningxia Medical University.

Methods: We conducted a pre\u2010specified secondary analysis of the multisite, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, phase II MOBILE\u2010HF trial in which 150 HF patients were randomized to 12\u2010month treatment with amisulpride (100 mg/day) or placebo and compared these patients with 150 non\u2010HF controls. The primary outcome was the prevalence of low mood in HF patients and the secondary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in HF patients with low mood compared to patients without low mood. Results: Twenty percent and 25% of all HF patients had low mood and poor quality of life, respectively, and the main cause of the low mood was HF. Patients who reported any MACE at the end of the study were older, had an abnormal ECG, a lower NYHA class and had a greater left atrial diameter. In multivariate analysis, HF patients with low mood had a greater risk of MACE compared to patients without low mood, after adjusting for NYHA class (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.78, p=0.01), in spite of adequate treatment (\u03b2\u2010blocker: 70.2%, ACE\u2010I/ARB: 64.1%, statin 73.7%).

The patients will be invited for a physical examination at day 0, day 14 and day 30 of the course.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nOur research team was the first to demonstrate that knee osteoarthritis could be successfully treated conservatively only with home-based exercises. This was in a RCT where patients with osteoarthritic knee pain performed home-based exercises for 8-10 weeks with good effect on symptoms as well as performance capacity. This is of importance because the majority of patients with knee osteoarthritis find surgical intervention, i.e. knee replacement, the only treatment option with similar effect sizes as the home-based exercises at 1-2 year follow-up. Based on our research group's earlier findings, this study aims to test which factors that predict successful outcomes and also adverse effects in patients with knee osteoarthritis undergoing a knee exercise program. This way we expect to develop a predictive model where the outcome will be dependent on several variables, i.e. anthropometric, anatomical and pain, which all might influence the treatment outcome of knee exercises. Knowing how successful the treatment is dependent on different factors will enable further development of treatment and tailoring of treatment according to the patient's clinical presentation as an alternative to a potentially more expensive surgical intervention. In addition, it might prevent the development of unnecessary complications if adverse effects can be identified prior to treatment commencement. Consequently, we would hope to achieve faster treatment results and better long-term care of patients with knee osteoarthritis.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nWhich Factors Predict Successful Outcomes and Adverse Effects of Home-based Exercises in Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nOsteoarthritis of Knee\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Exercise\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Males or females aged between 50 and 75 years with knee osteoarthritis and",

In addition to the risk of AESI, the increased use of antimicrobials can lead to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The introduction of innovative diagnostic techniques, which allow even very low bacterial load to be detected in a short period of time, may lead to more personalized antibiotic therapy and the optimization of antimicrobical treatment in case of suspected nosocomial infections. The present study aims to investigate the implementation of an innovation in diagnostic medicine using innovative diagnostic techniques based on the detection of nucleic acids in patients with suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired bacteremia. As comparators, we will evaluate a diagnostic procedure based on conventional blood culture determination and antibody determination.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAn estimated 250,000 pneumonia patients die annually in Germany. Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are among the leading causes of death in the hospital. Early diagnosis and specific therapy are key factors for the reduction of deaths and the associated costs. The use of standardized diagnostic procedures can reduce the diagnostic time and enable the initiation of adequate antimicrobial therapy for the therapy of patients. The results of the present study aim to demonstrate the benefit of a standardized diagnostic procedure for hospital-acquired pneumonia. In this prospective monocentre study, adult patients will be diagnosed according to two different diagnostic procedures. One diagnostic procedure is based on an innovative approach for the identification of pathogens (RNA/DNA diagnostics). The other diagnostic procedure is based on conventional blood culture detection and antibody detection. Both diagnostic procedures will include routine analyses. The first diagnostic procedure will be limited to the investigation of Gram-negative bacteria. The patient's informed consent of the participant is not required.

The overall 5\u2010yr survival rate for gastric cancer patients is only 30%. For patients with unresectable advanced gastric cancer, systemic chemotherapy has been the backbone of treatment for over 30 years, although resistance to chemotherapy could still occur. Thus there is an unmet need for effective drugs in the treatment of unresectable advanced gastric cancer. Lenvatinib acts as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1\u20133 (VEGFR\u20101\u20133) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1\u20134 (FGFRs). The goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib versus capecitabine in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer with known KRAS mutation, who progressed after prior fluoropyrimidine\u2010based chemotherapy. Patients and methods This is a randomized, open\u2010label, parallel group, active controlled, phase III study in China. An estimated 346 patients with unresectable advanced gastric cancer with known KRAS mutation, who progressed after prior fluoropyrimidine\u2010based chemotherapy, will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with lenvatinib 20 mg once daily or oral capecitabine 1,000 mg/m2 twice daily on a 2\u2010weeks\u2010on/1\u2010weeks\u2010off cycle. The primary endpoint is progression\u2010free survival in the intention\u2010to\u2010treat population. Secondary endpoints include overall survival; objective response rate; time to progress",

The clinical trial record number is NCT05568682 and was created on May 30, 2022. \n\nAbstract:\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference of clinical outcomes of surgical navigation system (SNS) assisted and conventional free flap surgery in subumbilical periumbilical skin necrosis repair. We conducted a prospective, single\u2010centered, randomized controlled trial. Thirty patients were randomly distributed into SNS group and control group. The number of patients in the two groups was 15. We collected the data of patients, including age, gender, BMI, size of skin necrosis, operative time, and hospital stay. Preoperative CT or MRI and postoperative CT scans of the SNS group were used for digital planning, and the 3D reconstruction image was used for intraoperative navigation. The control group was directly treated with traditional surgical and suturing. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and short\u2010term postoperative complications were observed. The results showed that the operation time in the SNS group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). The rate of flap necrosis in the SNS group was significantly (P\u200a<\u200a0.05) lower than that in the control group. There was no significant difference in postoperative infection rate between the two groups (P\u200a>\u200a0.05). SNS assisted surgery can reduce the operative injury to the patient blood supply, shorten the operation time, reduce the risk of postoperative infection, and improve the postoperative recovery of patients.\n\nIntroduction\nClinical skin flap tissue repair is a method of repairing skin defects by means of healthy, local flaps.[ Clinical skin flap tissue repair often requires the use of complex anatomical structure and blood supply distribution. Flap repair often needs to mobilize and cut off the skin and subcutaneous tissue around the wound site, and the mobilization of flaps often causes ischemic damage, wound secretions, and necrosis of adjacent skin and soft tissue tissues. Subumbilical periumbilical skin necrosis repair is one",

You can also describe the intervention as intrapleural administration of a drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). \n\nAbstract:\nBackground Risk of significant lung injury (LI) following thoracoscopic pleurectomy is still a main concern in thoracoscopic management of malignant pleural effusion. To lower the risk of postoperative lung injury following pleurectomy and to evaluate the impact on the oncological outcome, we performed a prospective randomized trial in which we compared lobectomy for PPE of lung cancer with pneumonectomy following intrapleural instillation of 12.5 ml of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Patients and Methods From Oct 2014 to Jan 2016, 84 patients with lung cancer and symptomatic malignant pleural effusion randomized to either pneumonectomy or lobectomy combined with tPA were included in this study. Thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed followed by intraoperative instillation of 12.5 ml of tPA. Postoperative radiotherapy was administered to 38 patients and chemotherapy was administered to 18 patients with stage IIIa disease. Lung function tests were repeated after 3 and 6 month follow\u2010up and compared with the preoperative values. Results The baseline characteristics were balanced in the two groups. The number of adverse events was similar in the two groups. There were no deaths. Lung function tests demonstrated an expected decline following pulmonary resection without a difference between the two groups. The median survival duration and disease free survival were 14.1 months and 18.8 months respectively with no significant difference between the groups. Lung function declined in both groups without a difference. Conclusion Intrapleural instillation of tPA does not seem to affect postoperative lung function or survival in lobectomy for lung cancer. Lung resection following tPA instillation is a safe procedure and may be used to facilitate pleurectomy or lobectomy of lung cancer.",
            "It's like a dream come true for you, but what are the main objectives of the study? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground/Introduction. Intrapleural administration of fibrinolytic agents is used to treat unilateral pleural effusions, mainly in patients with malignant pleural effusions or chronic pleural effusions. However, the use of fibrinolytics in the management of pleural infection is controversial regarding the risk of intrapleural bleeding. In addition, the optimal dose and the optimal duration of treatment are not well established. Objective. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a low dose of intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the management of parapneumonic pleural infection. Methods. This is an observational study, conducted in the Pleural Diseases Service of the Dr. Manuel Gea Gonz\u00e1lez General Hospital of the Mexican Institute of Social Security. It included 20 patients of both sexes, between 18 and 65 years of age, with parapneumonic pleural effusion and pleural infection. Patients were randomized into two groups, with 10 patients in each. Group A: 2.5 mg of tPA; group B: 10 mg of tPA. Both were treated with 25 mg of fibrin glue for 15 days. The primary outcome measure was the mortality rate, and the secondary outcome measures were the incidence of bleeding complications and hospital stay. Results. We did not observe any deaths in Group A or Group B. However, there is a difference in the number of incidences of bleeding complications as well as hospital stay. Group B showed two cases of bleeding complications compared to only one in Group A (p > 0.05). In addition, the hospital stay in Group B was 33.17 \u00b1 15.86 days versus 26.9 \u00b1 11.75 days in Group A (p = 0.0209). Conclusion. The treatment of a low dose of intrapleural tPA at 2.5 mg is safe and efficient in patients with parapneumonic pleural infection. Conclusion. The low dose of tPA (2.5 mg) is a safe and effective alternative for the management of parapneumonic pleural infection. (Figure presented",

Our purpose was to study effect of short\u2010course oral prednisolone on adherence to ICS in patients with asthma exacerbation. METHODS: A total of 58 patients hospitalized with acute asthma requiring admission were randomized to prednisolone, placebo and prednisolone with added ICS (ICS group). They were given the same regimen of oral prednisolone (1mg/kg for 4 days) and 4 puffs of BDP inhalation twice daily, and were asked to return to the outpatient department after 14 days (D14). The patients recorded the doses of BDP, prednisolone and the number of puffs in an asthma diary. RESULTS: After 14 days, there were no statistical differences in changes of serum glucocorticoids, airflow limitation and exacerbation scores in the three groups. However, the proportion of prednisolone dose reduction in ICS group was higher compared with placebo group and prednisolone group, whereas the dropout rate of BDP was higher in placebo group and prednisolone group. The ICS group adhered to BDP better than other groups, but the adherence did not affect their outcomes. CONCLUSION: In patients with acute asthma exacerbation, the better compliance to ICS will improve the therapeutic effect when combined with short\u2010course of oral prednisolone."

For such systems, dismembered pyeloplasty is often needed but has a long\u2010term failure rate of about 30%. We describe a case series of patients with duplex systems treated by endoscopic repair of the anastomosis via a pigtail approach. Materials and Methods: From 2009 to 2017, six patients with large ureteral duplex systems with proximal anastomotic stenosis and reflux were treated by endoscopic repair of the anastomosis via a pigtail approach. This approach uses the renal pelvis of the upper moiety as a guide to repair the obstruction. Preoperative evaluation included diagnostic intravenous urography, cystoscopy, voiding cystourethrogram, and renal scintigraphy. All patients underwent a ureteroscopic anastomotic repair via a pigtail approach. Results: Six patients were treated with endoscopic repair ranging from age 12 to 42 with a mean age of 23.5 years. Sites of the obstruction were located at the pelviureteric junction on the lower moiety (n = 5) and the pelviureteric anastomosis on the upper moiety (n = 1). The mean follow\u2010up duration was 12 months (range 3 to 60 months). There have not been any recurrences.

To clarify, would you like the Snoezelen-Based Occupational Therapy intervention to involve a sensory room design that includes a variety of stimuli and promotes active participation by the person using it? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nDementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes considerable cognitive impairment, especially in the areas of memory and executive function. It is characterized by difficulties with communication, personal care, and problem-solving. This cognitive decline can lead to behavioral and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, depression, aggressiveness, sleep disturbances, and wandering. As a consequence, people with dementia and their caregivers suffer from a high burden of disease, which has serious negative consequences for their quality of life and is a significant problem for the German health care system. With a steadily aging population, it is essential to develop new strategies to deal with this challenging situation. In recent years, a new approach to intervention has been developed: Snoezelen rooms, also known as Multisensory Environments (MSE), are designed to create a calm and relaxing environment with various sensory stimuli (auditory, visual, tactile, etc.). These stimuli aim to improve the person's attention span, reduce restlessness and anxiety, and enhance relaxation. The Snoezelen intervention can last up to two hours each day (including 20-minute check-ins every hour) and should be administered several times a week to people with dementia. The Snoezelen system has been developed to include a variety of stimuli and activities that can be individually tailored to the person's needs and preferences. Preliminary studies have shown positive effects of Snoezelen on cognitive performance, mood, and general well-being in older adults and people with dementia. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Snoezelen-based intervention on reducing agitation, depression, aggression, sleep disturbances, and wandering in people with dementia. \n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvidence-Based, Individualized, Snoezelen Room Intervention (SIRI-E)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDementia, Behavioral and Psychiatric Symptoms of Dementia, Alzheimer Disease, Agitation in Al",

The current standard of care for pancreatitis is inadequate and patients often experience serious complications, including organ failure. The newly developed method we are evaluating in this study is believed to be more effective than the current standard of care. This trial is an open-label, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the newly developed methods. A total of 60 patients with pancreatitis will be enrolled in the trial. Each patient will be randomized into one of two groups. Those who are assigned to the experimental group will receive the newly developed methods for 30 minutes each day for 3 days, while those in the control group will receive current standard of care. The primary outcome will be the change in pancreatic enzyme levels, which will be measured at baseline and 24 hours after treatment. Secondary outcomes include symptoms related to pancreatic exacerbation, inflammatory markers, liver function tests, and patient satisfaction.

The trial will take place in a setting where the majority of patients are receiving chemotherapy for lung or breast cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe study includes several arms and procedures. Prior to randomization, all patients will complete the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), as well as a measure of immune function. The study will use a repeated measures design. Once randomized (50 patients per group) patients will be invited to participate in two mind-body therapy classes led by a trained facilitator. There are three study arms. Two-arms (Arm 1, Arm 2) will receive a combined mindfulness and progressive stretching interventions. One-arm (Arm 3) will receive mindful stress reduction. Participants in each arm will be randomized, one group will receive the two mind-body interventions in the first four weeks, and the other in the following four weeks. This will be followed by two follow-up visits during weeks 8 and 13. Participants also receive an audio-based, standardized stress management guide that includes information on stress reduction strategies, including meditation, relaxation techniques, and progressive muscle relaxation. This study will utilize a randomized assignment to the three study groups.

Could you please give me more information about the interventions? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe present study is a prospective, controlled clinical study. The study aim at comparing the long-term outcomes and complication rates between arthroscopic and open surgical lateral ankle procedures for hallux rigidus. Patients with primary hallux rigidus and primary hallux valgus were randomized into two groups. Ankle arthrodesis or first metatarsal osteotomy was chosen as indications for arthroscopic and open surgery. The post-operative follow-up period was six months, and was further divided into three time points. A standardized clinical evaluation by the same assessor was performed, and clinical outcomes and complication rates were compared.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHallux rigidus and hallux valgus are the most common forefoot pathologies, and surgical treatment of these are common in clinical practice. Since arthroscopic surgery is less invasive than open surgery, and has the potential for lower postoperative pain, earlier functional recovery, and shorter hospitalization, many studies have demonstrated a trend for arthroscopic surgery to become more widely used in the treatment of hallux rigidus and hallux valgus. However, a recent randomized controlled study found that arthroscopic surgery for hallux rigidus was associated with increased postoperative complications, and recommended that open procedures should be emphasized. This study has been criticized, since the surgical procedure for arthroscopic surgery was not fully described. In the meantime, many studies on arthroscopic and open surgical procedures for hallux rigidus and hallux valgus have shown that the operative procedure used was an important factor in the results. Due to these circumstances, the effect evaluation of current arthroscopic procedures for hallux rigidus and hallux valgus and the evaluation of open surgical methods was insufficient. Therefore, our study aims to perform an adequately large study comparing the outcomes between open and arthroscopic procedures. A total of 320 patients with symptomatic Hallux rigidus and/or Hallux valgus deformities will be enrolled.",

How would you like to measure the outcomes? \n\nStudy type\n=================\nObservational study\n\nStudy design\n=================\nCross-sectional study\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\nGender: Both\n\nExclusion criteria\n=================\n- Not applicable.\n\nPrimary outcome\n=================\n- For the first study arm, we will measure outcomes using self-report measurements. We will use the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), Posttraumatic Stress Checklist (PCL), and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) to assess the severity and impact of chronic pain, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and PTSD-related symptoms in clinic employees. We will collect these data using self-report surveys administered at baseline and at the end of the study.\nCondition category\n=================\nMental Health, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\n\nPrimary outcome\n=================\nPatient-reported Outcomes.\n\nSecondary outcome\n=================\nNone\n\nAbstract\n=================\n\nBackground\n-----------------\nPain is one of the most common complaints in primary care. However, there is limited research on the interaction between chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients treated in primary care. In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on integrated care approaches to addressing chronic pain and PTSD. These approaches often involve the use of a stepped care model, which aims to provide patients with the most appropriate level of care based on their individual needs. To date, there is no consensus on the most effective mode of integrated care for chronic pain and PTSD, and there is a need for research to determine the optimal approach. Furthermore, it is not clear how this integrated care approach would be implemented in primary care. A growing body of research has indicated the importance of understanding providers' perspectives on chronic pain management. This is particularly important in the context of primary care, where providers are often responsible for managing patients with multiple comorbidities. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the potential for provider burnout and turnover, particularly in the field of primary care. As such, it is important to understand how providers view their role in managing patients with chronic pain and PTSD, and to identify factors that may contribute to burnout and turnover. Such knowledge could",

Since it's an observational study, there won't be a specific intervention, but we'll focus on gathering perspectives and insights from individuals experiencing co-occurring chronic pain and PTSD. Their experiences will provide valuable insights into patient-reported outcomes, coping strategies, and quality of life. What are your thoughts on this? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether two different types of neuromodulation - transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and acupuncture - are both effective in treating chronic non-cancer related back pain.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study compares two pain treatments for patients with chronic low back pain to see which one works better. The primary goal is to find out if either TENS or acupuncture is more effective at reducing pain, and the secondary goal is to see which treatment is more effective at improving functional mobility and quality of life for patients with non-cancer related back pain. Investigators also want to find out which interventions patients prefer. The study is randomized and the participants will not know which intervention they are randomly assigned for until after the screening process is finished. Participants receive one of the two treatments, for which they are blinded to which of the two treatments they receive. The treatment is given for 10 minutes every time and 5 consecutive days per week for three weeks. Follow up interviews are conducted after two, four, and ten weeks, and the patients will be asked what treatment they think they received and if the outcomes differ between treatments. At the end of the study, participants are told what their actual treatment was.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nTENS and Acupuncture for Chronic Low-back Pain\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nChronic Non-cancer Related Low Back Pain\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: TENS\n* Procedure: Acupuncture\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Age greater than 18 years.

If that\u2019s the case, congratulations, and please keep in mind that you will need to register the larger trial on ClinicalTrials.gov and on an appropriate national registry (for example, the WHO-UMC Trial Registration Data Set).\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of a 3\u2010week internet\u2010based cognitive behavioural intervention (iCBT) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on symptom severity.BACKGROUND AND THEORICAL RATION: IBS is a chronic relapsing condition with a median remission length of 52 weeks. There is a need for treatments with long\u2010term effects on the disease.iCBT for chronic pain is an effective treatment, but the efficacy of iCBT for IBS has not been examined. There is evidence to suggest that the mechanism of pain reduction after iCBT for chronic pain is similar to IBS, and that the same concept could be applied for IBS. METHOD: Twenty IBS patients were randomized into two groups: (1) intervention (n=10) or (2) waiting list control (n=10). The intervention lasted 3 weeks and included 6 sessions of iCBT. The primary outcome was change in symptom severity (IBS Severity Score), secondary outcomes were IBS\u2010related Quality of Life, pain catastrophizing, psychological distress, disability and stress reactivity.RESULTS: All 20 patients were reached for follow\u2010up, which increased the attrition rate from 20 to 50%. Both the baseline and long\u2010term dropout rates for iCBT were higher than the current estimate for psychological treatments for IBS. The study showed strong preliminary evidence that iCBT improves IBS symptom severity. Improvements in IBS symptom severity, IBS\u2010related Quality of Life and pain catastrophizing were maintained at 18 weeks.CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirm that it is feasible to conduct an RCT of iCBT among IBS patients. iCBT may be a potentially effective treatment for IBS.\n\nThe study is",

Now, could you please provide me with any additional information such as primary and secondary objectives for your trial? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Lymphoma survivors (LS), including those treated with high\u2010dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell reinfusion (HSCT), suffer long\u2010term impairments in cardiac function and physical activity. Exercise is recommended to improve cardiovascular function and reduce cancer mortality in LS. METHODS: This 6\u2010month, randomized controlled study will determine the effects of a low\u2010moderate intensity aerobic (LMA\u2010HIIT) exercise program versus standard of care on peak VO2, exercise capacity, cardiac function, and cardiorespiratory fitness in LS treated with HSCT. The LMA\u2010HIIT program will include walking, cycling, and light resistance exercises at an intensity of 55%\u201365% peak VO2 and 50%\u201360% of HRR peak. We hypothesize that a structured exercise program designed for the lymphoma population with a relatively high intensity interval will improve peak VO2, improve exercise capacity, and improve cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiac function in LS treated with HSCT. This study will also assess how HRR is affected by exercise. Additionally, health\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL) will be assessed before and after the study completion. Primary objective: The aim of the study is to determine (1) if an individually\u2010based LMA\u2010HIIT exercise program improves peak VO2, (2) if an individually\u2010based LMA\u2010HIIT exercise program improves HRQoL, (3) if an individually\u2010based LMA\u2010HIIT exercise program improves cardiovascular fitness, (4) how autonomic modulation is altered by exercise in LS treated with HSCT. Secondary objective: Participants will be monitored with an EKG for any changes in the resting or the exercise heart rate variability (HRV, ms). Additionally, the effect of exercise on ejection fraction will be analyzed. Tertiary objective: The tertiary objectives in this study include: (1) the change of heart rate recovery (HRR ms) in LS treated with HSCT (2",

SRFQ focuses on self\u2010regulation of individuals' behavior and consists of 22 items reflecting 4 dimensions of self\u2010regulation (metacognitive, motivational, volitional, and decisional). The questionnaire was administered to 906 clinically depressed participants, who were treated with either cognitive therapy or pharmacotherapy in a 12\u2010week randomized controlled trial. Internal consistency coefficients were moderate (ranging from .57 to .84). The scale showed satisfactory discriminative and predictive validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was computed to test the stability of the questionnaire across two measurement points.

            "Great! Let me further explain the rationale behind measuring e' and VTI parameters in the study. \nThe E' parameter is a measure of cardiac output and is calculated from the Doppler signal of the mitral annulus. It reflects the contractility of the left ventricle (LV) and is an important indicator of LV health. Red blood cell transfusion can lead to a decrease in blood viscosity, which can have a positive effect on cardiac output. VTI, or velocity-time integral, is a measure of stroke volume and is determined by the mean velocity of the mitral blood column (V) and the time of the QRS complex (T). E' and VTI parameters are, therefore, closely linked and can be used together to assess the impact of red blood cell transfusion on cardiac output. \nBy measuring E' and VTI parameters in the post-intervention period, we can evaluate whether red blood cell transfusion results in changes in cardiac output, and ultimately the effectiveness of the intervention on anemic patients. \nOverall, the experimental arm design and the parameters to be measured (E', VTI, and others) should help us to evaluate the impact of red blood cell transfusion on the cardiovascular system in anemic patients in the emergency department.",

            "Thank you for providing these details. It seems like a comprehensive approach targeted at managing dental anxiety.\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nMany dental patients experience some degree of anxiety or fear about dental treatment. It can range from mild jitters to such severe anxiety that it makes it impossible for them to receive dental care. Dental anxiety can lead to dental visits being avoided, which can lead to poor oral hygiene and serious oral health problems. In addition, many oral health problems are treatable if detected early. However, patients avoid dental visits due to anxiety, which can result in severe oral health problems, especially among children and adolescents in developing countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective methods to help individuals with dental anxiety receive dental care. We propose a randomized clinical trial to investigate the effect of behavioral therapeutic techniques on reducing dental anxiety among patients undergoing dental treatment. Our proposed intervention uses Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which consists of two procedures. The first is Relaxation Breathing, which involves controlling the breath, and the second is Muscle Relaxation, which involves controlling the muscles. Both procedures will be used for patients in the intervention group.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe primary objective of this randomized clinical trial is to investigate the effect of behavioral therapeutic techniques (CBT) on dental anxiety among patients undergoing dental treatment. The study will be conducted on 75 patients aged 18-30 years from government dental office in Baghdad-Iraq who will be randomly assigned to two groups: intervention group and control group. Patients in the intervention group will undergo Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) by adopting CBT components (Distraction technique and Mindfulness technique). Patients in the control group will undergo conventional therapy used by the researcher. The behavioral intervention will involve using distraction techniques to interrupt the anxiety-generating cycle. These techniques may involve playing music to distract the patient or providing oral numbing agents. The outcome of this study will be based on the Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) and pain intensity scores on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). DAS will measure changes in anxiety levels before and after the intervention, while VAS will measure changes in pain levels before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis will be used to compare the two groups",

Colonoscopy is not a diagnostic tool for early detection of cancer, but it is currently the standard technology used for screening and early detection of colorectal neoplasia. Colonoscopy is also used to examine patients with a history of hemorrhoids, bloody bowel movements, or unexplained black stool as part of routine medical care. When the colonoscope is used for biopsy or removal of polyps, the procedure can detect early cancer. If there is no risk of rectal cancer, routine outpatient colonoscopy will be cancelled. Otherwise, the participant will undergo colonoscopy before inclusion in the study. No medications will be used during the procedure, and the procedure will be stopped at the location of the adenoma or polyps.

Given that the clinical picture of AD can sometimes be accompanied by apathy, we decided to test whether DHEA could be used to treat apathy as well as cognitive dysfunction in subjects with AD. Methods: We included 52 patients (32 women and 20 men) with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate Alzheimer's disease who were randomly assigned to receive either 200 mg dehydroepiandrosterone or placebo at morning rise and at night from baseline until month 6.

In addition, can you tell me the details of the intervention you have in mind? \n\nIntroduction:\n\nEmerging data suggest the efficacy of intranasal insulin (IN-INS) as a novel approach to treat acute hypoxemia in ARDS patients. \nPurpose:\n\nThis protocol proposes the first randomized, controlled, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled clinical trial on IN-INS for the treatment of acute hypoxemia in ARDS patients. In order for clinically relevant results to be obtained, the trial was designed in a 1:1 fashion with three doses of IN-INS to be tested.\nMethods:\n\nA two-center prospective randomized clinical trial is proposed in this protocol. Moderate-to-severe hypoxemic ARDS ventilated patients will be randomized to either a IN-INS or a placebo group. IN-INS or placebo will be administered intranasally at specific time periods: at baseline, then six and 12 hours after the initial application. \nPrimary outcome measurement: arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2); secondary outcome measurements: respiratory system compliance (Crs) and static lung compliance (Cstat); adverse events (AEs); 60-day mortality. The study will be conducted with 48 patients (24 each) for an anticipated duration of one year.\n\nKeywords: Hypoxemia, Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Insulin, Intranasal administration, Nitric oxide, Mortality\n\nBackground\nEmerging data suggest the efficacy of intranasal insulin (IN-INS) as a novel, pharmacologically feasible, and economically viable approach to treat acute hypoxemia in adult patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS . However, the underlying mechanisms by which IN-INS affects pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics and tissue oxygenation are poorly understood .\nThe effect of IN-INS on organ perfusion and oxygenation is known to be mediated primarily by NO.

In this retrospective study, we aim to determine the impact of post-wash total motile sperm count (TMSC) on the pregnancy rate of patients undergoing IUI treatment. We propose to conduct a retrospective study including 180 patients undergoing IUI treatment between 1/1/2020 and 1/1/2023. In this study, the post-wash TMSC will be measured, and the sperm dose for insemination will be determined according to the standard treatment protocols. The primary outcome will be the pregnancy rate, which will be compared between patients with different post-wash TMSC. Secondary outcomes will include the pregnancy rate in each cycle, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate. By analyzing the data, we hope to provide evidence-based guidance for clinicians in optimizing treatment protocols for patients undergoing IUI treatment.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nFactors That Influence Post-wash Total Motile Sperm Count in Intrauterine Insemination Treatment\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nInfertility\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Aged 20-40 and diagnosed with infertility for at least 6 months Patients undergoing I",

Your insights have helped us to refine our criteria and improve the study design, which will ultimately enhance our ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the data. We look forward to incorporating your recommendations into our study procedures.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: As an important cardiovascular disease risk factor, obesity is closely related to the development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Previous studies have shown that body mass index (BMI) can be used to assess the risk of MACE. However, the relationship between BMI and MACE is still unclear. Materials and methods: We included 1,546 patients with major adverse cardiovascular events from the CARDS study and divided them into groups based on BMI. The relationship between BMI and risk of MACE was analyzed using logistic regression. Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with a higher BMI had a higher risk of MACE (odds ratio: 1.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.05\u20101.19; p < 0.001). The relationship between BMI and risk of MACE was not modified by age, sex or history of hypertension or diabetes. Conclusions: Higher BMI was associated with an increased risk of MACE, independent of age, sex and other cardiovascular risk factors.",

To establish the degree of cardiac autonomic denervation, measurements of stimulation\u2010induced changes of blood pressure (BP) and HR during 111I\u2010metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy are required. The aim of the study was to compare the measurements of stimulation\u2010induced changes of BP and HR using the S2\u2010cardio\u2010accelerator reflex with 111I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy to the results of cardiac angiography. Five patients with symptomatic autonomic dysfunction, three with clinically manifest cardiovascular disease and four healthy subjects were included in this study. One hundred and 80 mg of pentazocine was injected within 33 s and scintigraphic images of the heart and its major vessels were recorded for 15 min. The degree of sympathetic neuron damage after repeated injection of pentazocine was compared with the extent of aortic and coronary artery stenosis found during angiography. Significant increase in HR after pentazocine injection resulted in a higher degree of autonomic denervation in cardiac autonomic dysfunction patients than in patients with cardiovascular disease (p < 0.001). This increase was also observed in healthy subjects (p < 0.05). However, no difference was seen when the results obtained with the S2\u2010cardio\u2010accelerator and those with angiography were compared. Therefore the results of pentazocine S2\u2010test are not affected by anatomical changes of the aorta and coronary arteries.",

What kind of intervention are you planning? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: There has been an increase in the number and diversity of patient\u2010centered outcomes (PCS) measurement instruments. An overview of commonly used instruments and methodological weaknesses, can guide researchers in the selection and development of PCS instruments that can inform clinical decision\u2010making and facilitate improved patient outcomes. Objectives: To identify and describe the most common PCS measurement instruments published in oncology and provide a systematic overview of their content, methodological qualities, use in practice and key limitations. Data Sources: An exhaustive database of oncology PCS measures was populated from relevant articles published between 2009 and 2018. Methods: The instrument type, number of items and psychometric properties of each instrument were abstracted, and each was mapped to 1 of 12 core domains (symptoms, physical functioning, social functioning, emotional functioning, pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, nausea and emesis, nutritional impact, body image, sexual functioning and information\u2010seeking behaviors). The extent to which instruments included multiple items across core domains and the methodological quality of the instruments were assessed. Results: Of 708 instruments identified, 284 are classified as PROMs. The total length of PCS measures ranges from short single\u2010item instruments to 38\u2010item instruments. Items in PCS measures vary in their representation of the 12 core clinical domains. Commonly used PCS measures for overall symptom distress and symptom management include the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ), the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). Conclusion: This review highlights gaps in oncology PCS measures, particularly in areas such as sexual functioning, information\u2010seeking behaviors and body image. Researchers should systematically evaluate whether selected outcomes have the appropriate construct for their proposed research question and are able to accurately address the target content. Researchers should also consider using available instruments, and should develop new instruments to measure outcomes and domains with limited availability of measures.",

A prospective observational study by Chang et al. (2020) assessed the association between the number of injections of anti-VEGFs, including aflibercept, and the risk of infectious and noninfectious complications in patients with wet AMD. This study found that each subsequent anti-VEGF injection may reduce the risk of severe ocular complications when compared with those following the first anti-VEGF injection. However, it is important to note that not all injections of aflibercept result in immediate vision improvements. The injections can also induce transient inflammation of the eye, resulting in irritation, foreign body sensation, eye pain, redness, and blurred or distorted vision. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the safety of each aflibercept injection by continuously observing for the development of complications such as intraocular inflammation and suspected endophthalmitis.\nAim:\nThe proposed non-interventional study aims to continuously observe for the development of intraocular inflammation and suspected endophthalmitis among patients receiving aflibercept injections over a period of eight years (2014-2022). By providing continuous intraocular inflammation and suspected endophthalmitis risk assessment for patients receiving aflibercept injections, this study will provide information that can help optimize treatment outcomes and inform clinical practice and decision-making.\nMethods:\nThe study design is a retrospective, non",

Although bariatric surgery has proved to be the most effective treatment option for obese patients, its potential complications and risk of failure are high. Therefore, minimally invasive and cost\u2010effective obesity treatment methods, such as pharmacotherapy, are becoming more popular. The oral \u03b2\u20103 adrenergic receptor agonist ZD1839 has been shown to cause weight loss in preclinical models and in obese patients with increased adrenergic tone (e.g. patients with untreated hypertension). Aims: We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ZD1839 in obese patients. Methods: In this phase II, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial, 44 patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 and at least one obesity\u2010related comorbid condition were recruited from the outpatient diabetes clinic.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty participants with TMN were enrolled. The duration of TMN was between 3 and 9 months. All patients were evaluated clinically. They were divided into two groups depending on which side of the body they suffered from the onset. For pain symptoms, a visual analogue scale (VAS) and for functional status, Temporomandibular functional index (TMJ\u201011) were used. The two groups were then treated with traction therapy, and pain and function were compared before and after treatment. RESULTS: In this study, both groups showed pain relief in the second evaluation and a significant (p<0.03) improvement was observed in TMJ\u201011 in the right side, which was greater than in the left side (92.8 vs. 95.0 in the second evaluation). There was no significant difference (p = 0.62) found in the improvement of TMJ\u201011 between the patients who were treated soon (more than a week after onset) and late (more than 1 month). No significant difference was also observed in the duration of onset for the improvement of pain (p = 0.110) and function (p = 0.183).

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the most significant effect of Naltrexone on opioid dependent patients when they are in a detoxification program. Research has shown that Naltrexone in low doses reduces opioid dependence.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nOpioids, or opiate substances, have been around since the 1700s. They were initially considered to be among the safest of drugs because they were relatively non-dependent and non-addictive. However, it was later shown in the 1970s that some of the most commonly used ones of this time were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of American veterans involved in the Vietnam War.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvaluating the Use of Naltrexone in Detox Centres\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAddiction\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Naltrexone\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Ability to sign consent.

The purpose of this intervention is to prevent subjects from knowing that the study involves a placebo. | Drug: Naltrexone<br>* Naltrexone is a partial opioid antagonist",
            "That is well explained. Now could you give me the expected enrolment for the study?",
            "Yes, the first study arm will include those genetic carriers. The second study arm will be for a group of non-carriers who do not have PKU.",
            "Previous research has shown that high doses of L-Phenylalanine, especially when consumed as part of a high-phenylalanine diet, can be neurotoxic in PKU patients. Therefore, we recommend a low dosage of L-Phenylalanine, such as 300mg/day. This amount is considered safe for pregnant women and those of childbearing potential, and has been shown to have no adverse effects in healthy adults. To reduce the risk of neurotoxicity, we will start with a low dose of L-Phenylalanine and slowly increase it over time, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This will allow us to monitor any potential adverse effects and adjust the dosage accordingly. \n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Purpose:: Diagnostic\nPhase:: Not applicable\nIntervention Model:: Parallel\nBlinding/Masking:: Open\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: Dietary Supplement\nIntervention Description:: The participants will be divided into two groups.

Will you measure it using the same method as the reference group? And secondly, what is the formulation of the supplement? Will you use a capsule, tablet, or liquid? \n [B]elow are the answers to those questions: For the genetic carrier group, the dose of phenylalanine supplementation will be calculated based on the participant's body weight (kg) and adjusted to a maximum dose of 100 mg of phenylalanine per kilogram of body weight. The supplement will be taken as per the study protocol, which will be provided at the first visit. If any adverse events are noted during the study, the dosage may be adjusted by the research team.  The supplement will be taken orally, with the participant instructed to chew the tablet or dissolve the liquid in water.

Which outcome are you interested in measuring first? \n\nAbstract:\nCONTEXT: Children with type 1 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular disease.OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine whether early growth hormone therapy increased cardiovascular risk compared with diabetes control alone.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to three groups of daily growth hormone: 3 mg/m2 (45 patients), 6 mg/m2 (46 patients), and 11 mg/m2 (49 patients). We examined cardiovascular outcomes at 15 years in 747 patients randomly assigned to these three treatment groups and compared with the 904 control patients with type 1 diabetes who had received neither growth hormone nor oral hypoglycemic agents.RESULTS: Cardiovascular risk among those in the growth hormone groups (n = 239) and the control group (n = 904) did not differ significantly at 15 years. The estimated prevalence of hypertension in the growth hormone groups and the control group was 8%, 8%, and 7%, respectively (P = 0.74). The estimated low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol averages in the growth hormone groups and the control group after 9 years were 3.19 mmol/L (124 mg/dL) and 3.21 mmol/L (126 mg/ dL), respectively; high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was 1.48 mmol/L (58 mg/dL) in all three groups. The estimated prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in the growth hormone groups and the control group was 40%, 42%, and 35%, respectively (P = 0.52). In multivariate regression analyses, total cholesterol was significantly higher among those in the growth hormone group receiving insulin pumps, but diastolic blood pressure was lower when insulin pumps were used in all groups.CONCLUSIONS: Early growth hormone therapy did not increase cardiovascular risk compared with diabetes control alone."

Three hundred extracted human wisdom teeth were divided into 3 groups: 100 samples treated with 1% NaOCl and 3.5% H2O2 for 10 min (group 1), 100 samples treated with 1% NaOCl and 3.5% H2O2 for 10 min and then stored in 5% sodium thiosulfate for 1 min (group 2) and 100 samples stored in 5% sodium thiosulfate for 1 min and not irrigated (group 3). Subsequently, these treated samples were then divided into 2 new groups by amalgam interface barrier (10 samples). The amalgam interface layer was removed and 2 mL was added of the test fluid and the remaining fluid from the first group was added to group 1. The reduction in colony counts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans in groups 1 and 2 were 100% and 90\u201096%, respectively. We believe our study showed a reduction in the bacterial density of Enterococcus faecalis in the irrigated samples with or without the amalgam interface barrier.

In Canada, the prevalence of anxiety is even higher, with 15.8% of Canadians diagnosed with anxiety disorders in 2020. Although the COVID\u201019 pandemic has led to an increase in anxiety, few studies have investigated the specific effects of the pandemic on anxiety symptoms. Objective This retrospective chart review aims to examine the effects of the COVID\u201019 pandemic on anxiety symptoms of patients attending a psychotherapy center between January 2020 and March 2022. Methods Between January 2020 and March 2022, a total of 603 patients (age range: 15\u201045 years) who attended the psychotherapy center were randomly selected for the study. Data on age, sex, socioeconomic status, location, level of anxiety (PHQ\u20108 and GAD\u20102 scores), and comorbid medical conditions were retrieved from the center's electronic medical records system. The levels of anxiety were then categorized using the PHQ\u20108 and GAD\u20102 scores (mild or moderate anxiety, moderate or severe anxiety, or severe anxiety). The study data is then analyzed using SPSS software using a chi\u2010square test to examine the effects of age, sex, socioeconomic status, location, level of anxiety, and comorbid medical conditions on the occurrence of anxiety. The level of anxiety was then compared across the study periods. For each outcome, odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals were reported. Results The results revealed that socioeconomic status, location of residence, and comorbid medical conditions significantly",

This will give us a better understanding of the effect of AVF and TCC on cardiac structure and function. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nEnd-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious and irreversible condition characterized by the loss of kidney function, which is responsible for the maintenance of bodily homeostasis. The prevalence of ESRD is rising globally, with an estimated 3.7 million people currently living with the condition. Management of ESRD involves various treatment options, including dialysis and renal transplantation. For patients receiving dialysis, a central problem is the high incidence of vascular access failure, requiring repeated vascular access procedures and surgical interventions to maintain access adequacy. Autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and transposed central vein (TCCV) grafts are two common surgical options. Although AVF has been the gold standard for vascular access construction, TCCV offers several advantages, including shorter surgical times and lower morbidity. Despite these advantages, no prospective clinical trials have been conducted to compare the success rate and other outcomes of TCCV versus AVF grafts in patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis. The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of TCCV versus AVF grafts in patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis by comparing the primary and secondary endpoints, including vascular access maturation time, dialysis-related complications, and patient outcome. The study's secondary objective is to determine the safety profile of TCCV versus AVF grafts. The results of this study will provide valuable clinical evidence to support the appropriate use of TCCV grafts in patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nEnd-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious and irreversible condition characterized by the loss of kidney function, requiring lifelong treatment with dialysis or kidney transplantation. In 2022, approximately 6% of the global population, or 470 million people, were in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Left unmanaged, these individuals are likely to progress to ESR",

There is no effective strategy for preventing POD after cardiac surgery. Pneumatic compression device (PCD) may help maintain venous return, thus providing hemodynamic stability.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether PCD would reduce the incidence of POD compared with no intervention after cardiac surgery.METHODOLOGY: This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial including 136 patients aged \u226565 years undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control (C, intrinsic method of fluid maintenance); crystalloid (CX, PCD on both legs plus fluid resuscitation with crystalloids); and colloid (CQ, PCD plus fluid resuscitation with colloids). POD was defined as Richmond Agitation\u2010Sedation Scale score \u20101 or \u20102 at any time within 24 h postoperatively. Baseline variables and perioperative parameters were recorded. The cumulative incidence of POD in the three groups was compared.RESULTS: Thirty\u2010five patients developed POD (C, seven patients (14.6%); CX, zero patients (0%); CQ, 28 patients (52.6%); P\u00a0<\u00a00.001]. The number of fluid boluses (C, 136 [72%] versus CX, 62 [63%] versus CQ, 58 [48%], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and number of inotropic support (C, 21 (16%) versus CX, seven (8%) versus CQ, 34 (30%), P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were lower in the CX group compared to the C and CQ groups.CONCLUSION: Among patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, the PCD significantly reduces the risk of POD and the need for fluid resusc",

It is more common in men with a family history of PCa, particularly in the case of first-degree relatives. Therefore, genetic counselling is recommended for men who are considering genetic testing or have a family history of PCa.\nHowever, research has shown that a lack of knowledge and misunderstanding about genes and genetics contributes to poor decision making regarding genetic testing. A review article published in 2018 investigated reasons for low PCa genetic testing uptake in a survey of 480 men, and the most common reason was a fear of finding out information that might cause negative consequences, such as health insurance difficulties or emotional distress.

We studied the incidence of neurologic symptoms and the prevalence of neurologic complications in the SARS-CoV-2 and influenza cohorts, as well as the incidence of encephalopathy and encephalitis in these cohorts. We estimated the rates of death and serious infection complications for the COVID-19 population. The SARS-CoV-2 cohort had severe respiratory disease and a lower rate of neurologic complications and encephalopathies of 1.8% and 0.1% respectively. However, all patients with stroke, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, and meningoencephalitis were part of this cohort. A total of 109 patients with COVID-19 were infected with influenza virus. These patients had a similar rate of neurologic complications (1.8%), with fewer cases of encephalopathy (0.9%), encephalitis (0.0%), stroke (0.1%), and myelitis (0.0%).

            "Okay, and what are the goals of your clinical trial? \n\nBackground\n-----------------\nThe ACE trial design and methodology have been published (1,2) with a preliminary report from a large, international, randomized controlled trial (the ACE study) that demonstrated a survival advantage for patients receiving active cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with an endotracheal tube as compared with those receiving active CPR with nasopharyngeal airway (NPA). The ACE study was based on the hypothesis that positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) will reduce coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), diminish cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and produce more intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) than positive-pressure airway (PPA) in patients receiving CPR (3). Furthermore, many investigators have demonstrated that PPV can produce ICH and acute neurological deterioration in patients with cardiac arrest (4,5), and that PPV may adversely affect CPR quality (6). Thus, the ACE study suggests that the technique for administering PPV during CPR is as important as administering PPV in order to minimize CPP fall and the potentially lethal consequences for both cerebral and cardiac function. \n\nStudy design\n=================\nMulticentre, randomised controlled trial.\n\nStudy population\n=================\n1440 patients >\u200918\u00a0years of age in 45\u00a0hospitals in three countries.\n\nSchedule and interventions\n=================\nCPR was given either with a PPA or with a PPV at a maximum airway pressure of 20 cmH2O. The PPA groups received a LMA SupreGlideTM or a SLIPA-LTS\u2122 and the PPV group received a Bain Circuit. The PPA and PPV groups were compared using non-inferiority analyses. The primary outcome was survival with favourable neurological outcome at one year. The secondary outcomes were neurological outcome, hospital survival and rate of new ischaemic or haemorrhagic neurological lesions as determined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and new respiratory lesions as determined by pulmonary computer tomography. \n\n\nKey inclusion criteria\n=================",

All participants will fill out questionnaires and will have two visits to the hospital at the beginning of the study. This will be at 6 to 8 weeks and at the end of the study, after 42 weeks of treatment. The study participation time for each participant will be approximately 9 months to 1 year.The questionnaires will ask the participants about their asthma symptoms and medications used, as well as questions about their life and demographic data. The second visit is a routine hospital visit to check the participant's general health, as well as the level of lung function using spirometry. At the end of the study, both groups will continue with the treatment they have been given, either inhaled fluticasonal or a placebo, for 2 years.This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, which means that the participants will be randomly allocated to the two groups, and neither the participants nor the researchers know who is in which group. The use of inhaled fluticasonal or placebo will be decided by a randomization procedure, which is similar to drawing lots.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?Participating in the study will provide important information about the effectiveness of inhaled fluticasonal as a preventive therapy for asthma.

There is currently no therapeutic option to reverse lower extremity venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with inferior vena cava obstruction. METHODS: We treated 50 patients with acute inferior vena cava obstruction (IVCO) related to VTE with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt\u2010PA) infusion. Patients were followed up for eight weeks with serial duplex imaging. RESULTS: After a mean (SD) infusion duration of 14.7 (3.0) h, 40 patients (80%) achieved complete recanalization or near complete recanalization of the inferior vena cava within one month. The median time to recanalization was four days. After recanalization, 36 patients with IVCO experienced complete patency of their inferior vena cava, and eight patients (16%) experienced incomplete patency or residual stenosis. IVCO\u2010related symptoms were not relieved in nine patients in the group with incomplete patency or residual stenosis. There were no bleeding complications during thrombolytic therapy and two embolic events were observed. During subsequent follow\u2010up, deep vein thrombosis was observed in one patient from each group, and no recurrent IVCO in the remaining patients. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator infusion is effective and safe for acute inferior vena cava obstruction related to lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.\n\nIntroduction\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in 1\u20132 per 1000 person-years and a further 10\u201320% of patients will recur within 10 years .

Results: 210 subjects from the Andalusian public health system will be enrolled for this investigation. 81.9% of the participants are female, with a mean age of 69.3 \u00b1 10.3, mean time of evolution of the disease 9.6 \u00b1 3.8 years, and mean Harris Hip Score of 76.9 \u00b1 9.6. The main clinical picture was the osteoarthritis of the knee, followed by the osteoarthritis of the shoulder, hip and ankle. Hip OA (44.2%) and knee Hip OA (63.8%) are the most common diagnoses in our sample. Most (75%) patients suffer from the disease for more than five years with moderate pain (53.1%) that hinders daily activities (35.9%); 78.2% of the patients suffer from some of the symptoms of the disease. 40.8% of the participants have used medication as a treatment modality, although only 12.8% have been prescribed intra-articular corticosteroids on a regular basis.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a standard treatment for patients with early breast cancer who are clinically eligible, but 20% of patients do not respond to treatment. A poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with a poor prognosis, since patients with less favorable pathological responses are known to have lower event-free and overall survival after surgery than those with residual disease \u02c2 5mm. Given that the tumor response is related to pathological outcomes, the response markers used to predict the treatment effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are key for this patient group to determine their prognosis and treatment in a timely manner. Recently, new response markers have been identified for predicting neoadjuvant treatment response and improving patient care. However, these response markers are still limited, and further identification and validation of a comprehensive response biomarker are needed. It is also necessary to develop an intervention strategy that improves the treatment response of patients with poor breast cancer by identifying factors that affect the prognosis of patients. In particular, it is essential to establish treatment strategies that improve the prognosis of patients. Exercise has been shown to contribute to cancer treatment, and the American Cancer Society recommends that patients with cancer (including neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer) should maintain physical activity as one of the effective interventions throughout their treatment. However, there have been relatively few studies on the effects of exercise on the clinical efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, so there are limited guidelines for exercise. Although most of the studies conducted so far have been exercise during the postoperative period or after treatment, there are only a few studies on the potential and effects of exercise training during the treatment period (including neoadjuvant chemotherapy), and only one study has conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a neoadjuvant",

Please proceed. \n\nAbstract:\nPURPOSE: The objective was to assess the impact of the 2003 recommendations of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) on the use of prophylactic analgesics for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery.METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. Group\u2010R received a prophylactic patient\u2010controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) infusion, which was started in the preoperative holding area postoperatively when the patient was fully awake. Group\u2010C did not receive a PCA infusion until postoperative day 1. On postoperative day 2, each patient received additional analgesics as needed. The incidence of restless leg syndrome (RLS), level of satisfaction on a visual analog scale (VAS), and postoperative pain at rest (VAS) were compared between groups.RESULTS: Ninety patients were randomized to Group\u2010R and Group\u2010C. The incidence of RLS syndrome was 34% in Group\u2010R and 61% in Group\u2010C (P < .001). The average pain VAS score for Group\u2010C was 5.3 +/\u2010 3.0 (mean +/\u2010 SD), which was higher than that for Group\u2010R (1.8 +/\u2010 1.9, P < .0001). Of those, 10.3% of Group\u2010R vs 36% of Group\u2010C required opioid analgesics on postoperative day 2 (P < .0036). Sixteen percent of Group\u2010R, vs 53% of Group\u2010C (P < .0072), received additional pain medications after the use of extra opioids failed.CONCLUSION: The use of PCA infusions before emergence is associated with significantly less RLS syndrome, reduced patient\u2010reported pain, and lower opioid use. Furthermore, this prophylactic method of analgesia decreases patient discomfort and the risk of postoperative complications.",

It involved 31 hospitals distributed throughout the country and divided into four macro\u2010areas (Lombardy, Friuli\u2010Venezia Giulia, Piedmont, and Lazio).RESULTS: In total, 5535 patients (mean age 79.5\u00b17.7 years) were admitted during the observation period. Of these, 2765 (50%) were admitted for a respiratory cause. The mean age of AECOPD patients during the observation period in 2019 and 2020 did not differ (79.6\u00b110.2 years and 79.6\u00b17.7 years, respectively, p=0.420). No significant difference was observed in terms of the percentage of admissions for AECOPD on a weekly basis in 2019 and 2020 (p=0.990, Cramer's V=0.02), but there was an increase in AECOPD admission in July\u2010August 2020 (p=0.007, Cramer's V=0.17). Moreover, the percentage of patients admitted for AECOPD in intensive care units in the four macro\u2010areas was higher in 2020 compared to 2019 (p=0.194).CONCLUSION: The data on hospitalisations for patients with AECOPD confirm a decrease in admissions for other respiratory pathologies due to the COVID\u201019 pandemic that was partially offset by an increase in admissions for AECOPD, mainly in July\u2010August 2020.

The advent of modern medicine has enabled early detection and intervention to avoid the complications of untreated disease. In breast cancer, the incidence is approximately 2.1 million cases yearly and is the most common cause of cancer death in women. Over 90% of breast cancer diagnoses are made using surgical biopsy as the only sample source. The current standard of practice for the initial surgical approach is to sample localized disease with a standard incisional biopsy, which is a relatively small wedge of breast tissue removed typically under local anesthesia using a needle and a scalpel and sent to a pathology laboratory for analysis. Although most patients at this stage have early-stage low grade cancer and undergo simple surgery and chemotherapy (if deemed necessary), some with a tumor size that appears suspicious based on ultrasound imaging are treated with a mastectomy (removal of the whole breast). In such cases, an open surgical procedure is utilized which involves enlarging the wound to remove the cancer with or without a margin of healthy tissue, often with reconstruction to restore the appearance of the breast. This is a much more complicated surgical procedure. This research protocol has been designed to explore the use of needle and suction devices, which work in a similar fashion, to evaluate whether they can successfully be used for localized and extensive (stage III and IV) breast cancers.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nPercutaneous Fine Needle Aspirate Biopsy Of Breast Tumors Using Needle And Suction Devices To Determine The Optimal Tissue Sample For Surgical Resection: A Clinical Pilot Study\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nBreast Cancer, Stage III Breast Cancer, Stage IV Breast Cancer, Breast Neoplasms, Breast Adenocarcinoma, Stage 0 Breast Cancer, Stage 1 Breast Cancer, Stage II Breast Cancer\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure: Needle & suction biopsy\n* Other: Sentinel node biopsy\n\n\nPart",

Open label cohort participants receive pre-emptive intravenous (I.V.) infusion of PF-05212370 (or placebo), 3 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), up to a maximum of 200 mg. Closed label cohort participants receive the same dose of pre-emptive PF-05212370 but with blinded randomization between PF-05212370 and placebo. Approximately 10 - 16 participants will be randomized to each dose group. The primary objective is to confirm the absence or a lower frequency of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN), assessed using the relative change in serum creatinine from baseline. In each cohort, there is an option for additional participants to enroll if desired by the PI. Participants must provide written informed consent before study enrollment. Participants will receive pre-emptive intravenous (I.V.) infusion of PF-05212370 or placebo up to a maximum of 200 mg. The single dose of PF-05212370 or placebo will be administered via a standardized, IV infusion regimen no more than 30 minutes before catheterization.

These treatments, however, only affect the disease in the 5-year postoperative period, and subsequently the disease may relapse as the disease is rarely completely cured. In some cases, cancer cell relapse may take years or even decades to occur. Since cancer cell death may produce micrometastases that can become detectable within 5-10 years, early metastatic relapses must be managed with active disease-directed therapy, while delayed recurrences should be treated with palliative care to control symptoms. Based on prognostic information, the patients could, in this regard, benefit from specific adjuvant treatment strategies. It is thus essential to detect the relapse in order to improve patient prognosis.\nIn the past, follow-up was only performed occasionally or annually. With the help of new methods for the early detection of recurrences (imaging and biochemical markers such as CA 27.29), follow-up has been accelerated and the interval has been shortened.\nFollow-up is also known to be a stress source for patients and costs associated with clinical care and medical imaging studies should be avoided.

Recently, many novel airway clearance devices (ACDs) have been investigated but not approved for clinical use. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether a mechanical vest ACD could improve clinical outcomes in patients with CF. DESIGN: We conducted a double\u2010blind, controlled crossover randomized trial for 10 days at the Shoushinwang Hospital, Seoul, Korea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients underwent 15\u2010minute ACD with vibration or air pulsing using the mechanical vest. Inspiratory capacity, FEV1, and respiratory symptom scores were measured before and after each trial. RESULTS: Inspiratory capacity, FEV1, and score for symptoms of chest congestion showed significant improvement after treatment with the vest compared with airwashing (control) (P < or =.05). FEV1 showed an increased trend toward improvement 1\u20102 days posttreatment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a mechanical vest ACD improved lung function and clinical signs of CF in this preliminary investigation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02660847.

In the United States, about 32,500 people are living with CF, with approximately 1,000 new cases diagnosed each year. The CF gene encodes a protein that regulates the transport of chloride and controls reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and water in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive epithelia. More than 50% of the CF gene is missing, and this deficiency results in the production of a dysfunctional",

            "You're welcome. I look forward to seeing the results of your study!\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is prevalent in various medical conditions including cancer. Fatigue (FT), the most common symptom in both cancer survivors (CS) and active oncology (AC) patients, has a high correlation with EDS. Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of EDS on FT in CS and AC patients. Methods: This study included patients older than 18 years of age with a previous history of cancer. Patients with fatigue who had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire score of >5 and cancer survivors with PSQI score of >5 were identified. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) questionnaire and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) survey were used to study patients with FT and EDS, respectively. Results: A total of 306 patients with cancer met the criteria for this study. These patients were sub\u2010classified to two groups as active cancer (n = 222) and cancer survivors with no recurrence within last 5 years (n = 84). The mean MFI scores (P = 0.015), and fatigue scores of the NHP sub scaled (P < 0.05), were higher in the FT group, as compared to the non\u2010FT group. When the subcategories of NHP were analyzed, significantly higher values were found in the general health (P < 0.001), vitality (P < 0.001), and mental health subscales (P < 0.001) and the sleep (P = 0.022)\u2010related subscale and the sleep disturbances question (P < 0.001) in the FT group. Mean EDS in the FT group was higher than the non\u2010FT group (P < 0.001). In multiple logistic models, EDS and ESS scores were independent risk factors for the FT. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that EDS and ESS scores were predictors of FT in cancer patients, and they may be potential targets to alleviate the symptoms of FT in patients with cancer and fatigue.",

The patients were divided into four groups (12 patients each), with each group receiving a different PEEP level (0, 5, 10 and 15 cm H2O, respectively). The measurements of pressure (PPl, Pes, Plat, PEEP, and airway pressure) and flow were obtained via esophageal pressure\u2010volume maneuver and Esophageal Doppler probe. All measurements were obtained continuously during both spontaneous ventilation and mechanical ventilation with different inspiration:expiration ratios (I:E = 0.7, 1:1 and 2:1).RESULTS: In all groups during mechanical ventilation, all PEEP levels were associated with significantly greater increases in tidal volume (P > 0.05), tidal elastance (Ers) (P > 0.05) and respiratory resistance (Rrs) (P > 0.05), and significantly lower peak inspiratory pressure (P < 0.05) compared with no PEEP. However, the differences were not significant for PPl (P = 0.216), Pes (P = 0.171) and Esophageal Doppler results (P = 0.134). The changes of these values during mechanical ventilation compared with spontaneous ventilation were not significantly different between all PEEP levels (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: The increase in tidal volume by PEEP may not represent a pathological increase in lung volume (increase of lung elastance and resistance). PEEP did not affect the cardiac output in this study.",

It is currently the most widely used form of pain relief during childbirth, and it is a popular choice for dentistry and outpatient surgeries.\nThe mechanism of action of N2O is not fully understood, but it is believed that it acts on several different pain pathways within the body. It is thought to work by inhibiting the release of certain neurotransmitters, including serotonin and norepinephrine, which play a role in pain perception.\nIn addition to its well-known analgesic effects, N2O also has several other benefits. It is a colorless, non-flammable gas that is relatively affordable and easy to administer. It is also considered to be a safe and low-risk form of pain relief, with few side effects and a rapid onset of action.\nOverall, N2O is a widely used analgesic gas that is known for its rapid onset of action, safety, and versatility.

The disease directly caused approximately 874,000 deaths in India, the largest number of any single country. Due to the rising global population, cancer cases will continue to rise in the coming years. Over the past few decades, a dramatic rise in cancer, particularly cancers of the digestive system, has been detected in several regions, particularly high GBR countries. According to the recent WHO estimates among the most common cancers worldwide are colorectal (CRC), gastric, oesophageal, pancreatic cancers. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to reduce the mortality rates of these cancers. Oral cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the world, and it is a significant cause of death in several countries and regions. Oral cancer, the squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx, is the second most common cancer in India and has a high mortality rate. It has been known for decades that oral cancer is most common in men, but now the incidence of this disease is growing in young adults and women, but its incidence and death rate is still higher than all the other cancers. Although the incidence of oral cancer is decreasing in the majority of countries, oral cancer continues to be one of the most common cancers worldwide. With regard to other parts of the world other than those of the Western world, the incidence and death rate of oral cancer have been found to be higher in India, South & Central America, Europe, and Pakistan than in other countries. Patients with digestive tract and oral cancers are seen by general practitioners or specialists in the early stages of their illness, which is where the first indication of a malignancy is observed. This first encounter has the potential to improve the prognostic results of patients with digestive tract and oral cancers by providing them with appropriate diagnostic methods and treatment.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nDiagnosing oral cancer at the primary care level is often difficult.

The neuropathological processes of AD include progressive decline of cognitive function and neuronal degeneration of cerebral cortices including the cerebral cortex . There were approximately 35.6 million people with AD worldwide in 2001, and the number is expected to reach 115.4 million by 2050, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) . The global mortality rate of AD is 67,000 deaths per year, and the number of deaths is expected to triple by 2050. It is reported that AD accounts for 60-70% of the total mortality among people with dementia . Therefore, it is important to develop an effective dementia preventive therapy.\nRecently, it has been reported that a high level of blood glucose and hyperglycemia have harmful effects on the brain, leading to accelerated formation of amyloid plaque in the brain cells . In addition, a high-sugar diet (diet with abundant sugar content) promotes AD by accelerating the accumulation of amyloid peptide, resulting in increased oxidative stress and inflammation . Some studies have shown that a high-sugar diet in human brain cells increases the accumulation of amyloid and tau, which have been reported to be biomarkers of AD .\nD-allulose is a rare ketose (ketose monosaccharide, a sugar that cannot be fermented) that is naturally present in honey and has received attention for its potential health benefits, including reducing the risk of dementia. D-allulose can be rapidly absorbed and used as a sugar replacer because it does not cause hyperglycemia . D-allulose has been found to have an anti-glycation activity by affecting the enzymes and protein glycation, as well as by suppressing the accumulation of amyloid in the brain and preventing the formation of free radicals .\nIn addition, D-allulose has been",

            "Thank you for clarifying that. Now, let's discuss the study's secondary purpose. What are your thoughts on using the study to provide better treatment for people who already have cancer? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to test the safety of giving radiation therapy with cisplatin combined with Asparaginase compared to giving radiation therapy with cisplatin alone for patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with curative intent is surgical resection, which has been associated with superior survival when compared with radiation or chemoradiation. However, for many of these patients, surgical resection is not an option due to either age or medical comorbidities or patient refusal. Furthermore, there are several risk factors associated with poor prognosis in surgically resected stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); specifically, tumor >4 cm, N2 nodal involvement, and EGFR and ALK gene mutations. These risk factors have been identified as predictors of poor prognosis in surgically resected cases, and thus for patients with advanced stage lung cancer who are unfit for surgical resection or refuse surgery, alternative treatment approaches should be considered. Neoadjuvant/concomitant treatment (RT\u2009+\u2009CT) has shown promising results in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC. Several phase II trials have shown promising response rates following treatment with chemoradiation therapy regimens. However, the overall survival (OS) rates for patients with locally advanced disease treated with concurrent chemoradiation remain poor (1-year and 2-year OS rates of 60% and 30%, respectively) and further improvements in OS are required. Preclinical studies have shown that combination therapy with cisplatin and Asparaginase can enhance the radiosensitive of pulmonary tumor cells. The combination of these agents may therefore represent an optimal approach for the treatment of advanced stage NSCLC. Currently, there are limited data on the safety of the combination therapy, thus, this pilot study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of combining Asparaginase with cisplatin",

            "Now, I'd like to know if you have any questions or concerns about the study.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Obesity affects physical and mental health and is a growing global epidemic. The COVID\u201019 pandemic has exacerbated obesity and limited access to behavioral intervention and support. Objectives: This pilot study tested the feasibility and acceptability of an online behavioral weight management intervention for children with obesity and their parents. A 3\u2010month intervention consisted of evidence\u2010based behavioral recommendations, including goal setting, increased physical activity, and changes in eating habits. A mixed\u2010methods approach was used to assess feasibility and acceptance. Materials and Methods: Overweight or obese youth (N = 57) aged 8\u201018 years and their caregivers (N = 41) completed a 3\u2010month behavioral weight management intervention. Measures of dietary intake; physical activity; sleep; screen time; and self\u2010reported weight, height, waist circumference, and health\u2010related quality of life were completed at baseline and 3 months. Intervention feasibility was evaluated by rate of completion for questionnaires and program components. Results: Most participants did not consistently complete questionnaires or program components. At baseline, parents were more likely to complete questionnaires compared to adolescents (X2(7) = 42.42, p<.00, Cohens' d = .84). Intervention acceptability was evaluated using mixed\u2010methods data across intervention sessions and interviews. Acceptability scores were generally positive (mean = 4.13, SD = 1.38). Based on qualitative data, 73% of participants reported that the program was generally helpful and positively impacted lifestyle habits, including changes in physical activity (67%), diet (57%), sleep (47%), screen time (36%), and weight (36%). Lack of motivation (83%) and time constraints (67%) were primary barriers to program participation. Conclusion: A majority of participants reported the program to be helpful; however, barriers to program completion are identified. In future studies, tailoring the program to suit the individual's lifestyle and creating an effective intervention communication plan should improve program delivery.

The intervention program, comprising of an enhanced electronic vaccination reminder system and team trainings and meetings addressing refusal to vaccination, was associated with increased rate of vaccination coverage in pediatric patients at the CHS. Using a cohort design, the study investigates the impact of the intervention program among patients who received at least 5 vaccine series recommended at ages five and younger (including Hib, DTaP, pneumococcal, rotavirus, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella and hepatitis B (Hpv) vaccination), as compared to a control group. The investigators aim to evaluate changes in patient vaccination records, as well as changes in patient-provider discussions for vaccinations to assess overall vaccine uptake and discuss any associated barriers. The study utilizes a prospective observational study design in the form of an electronic health record (EHR) review to evaluate the impact of the intervention. The investigators utilize a large data set from the CHS (>20,000 children under five years of age) to compare the rates of vaccine uptake and patient-provider discussions between baseline and intervention periods, and identify potential correlations between these outcomes and sociodemographic factors. Additionally, multivariate analysis is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, controlling for other potential factors that may impact the outcome. The investigators aim to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the intervention in improving childhood vaccination uptake and address vaccine hesitancy and refusal among pediatric patients at the CHS.

            "Right, the control arm is critical to this study. This arm will receive standard physiotherapy care without the AERO Program. The physiotherapist will also assess the barriers to exercise adherence using the COM-B model, but without any specific interventions to address these barriers. This arm will help us determine the value of the AERO Program compared to standard care.\n\nIn terms of the intervention, it's possible to include a combination of two or more active interventions along with standard care in the experimental arm. For example, you could include a home exercise program, behavioral techniques, and/or other interventions tailored to address the barriers to exercise adherence.\n\nIn terms of the sample size and group assignment, you should consider what would be most informative for your study's objectives. For example, if you want to determine the effectiveness of the program in a representative population, a large clinical trial with randomized controlled trials (RCT) design may be appropriate. If you want to address specific concerns regarding exercise adherence, you may consider a smaller clinical trial with a before-and-after design.\n\nIt's also important to consider the ethical aspects of your study. You should ensure that your research protocol is approved by an IRB or ethics committee before conducting the study. You should also obtain informed consent from all participants before enrolling them into the study.\n\nFinally, it's important to collect data on safety and efficacy outcomes to ensure that the AERO Program is safe and effective for patients with osteoporosis. This may include assessing bone mineral density, falls risk, physical function, and patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life and satisfaction with care.\n\nIn conclusion, the experimental arm of your study should include the AERO Program, which is a multi-modal exercise and behavioral intervention tailored to address the barriers to exercise adherence. The control arm should include standard physiotherapy care without any specific interventions to address the barriers to exercise adherence. The sample size and group assignment should be based on the study's objectives, and the safety and efficacy outcomes should be carefully monitored throughout the study.",

All participants will complete the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES), the World Health Organization Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL), the Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS), and a physical activity survey at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Participants in the experimental group will also receive a home exercise program tailored to manage osteoporosis. The physiotherapist would also evaluate the barriers to exercise adherence using the COM-B model and provide specific interventions during the PT sessions. In the control group, we will provide standard care for osteoporosis management. This can include home exercise programs, mobilizations, soft tissue techniques, or training with gym equipment.

Our intervention was designed based on three models: COM-B, Examination of Musculoskeletal Impairment and Osteoporosis (PROMOT), and the Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA) guidelines. The COM-B model identifies behavioral change mechanisms, i.e., Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation. Our therapist will first screen the participant for barriers and evaluate musculoskeletal impairment using the PROMOT and CPA guidelines. A personalized exercise program will be developed in order to improve physical performance and quality of life, and in order to overcome the detected barriers.

Could you please provide an overview of the study interventions?\nAbstract:\nPurpose: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an online physical therapy intervention, a smartphone application, and a rehabilitation robot system as an aid tool for shoulder exercise by evaluating their effectiveness in an RCT conducted on patients with stroke with shoulder symptoms. Methods: A randomized control test (RCT) was conducted in October 2018 to evaluate the effectiveness of an online intervention to improve shoulder symptoms in patients with stroke through an RCT. In this RCT, the participants were randomly assigned to the smartphone application group, robot sensor group, and control group. The 8\u2010week exercise period was conducted twice a week in a clinical setting. A total of 121 participants were assigned to one of the three groups at random. Results: Comparing the three groups revealed that the experimental group reported a higher number of reps on the smartphone application during the online intervention than the control group during the first online intervention. The experimental group (smartphone application) had a significantly higher number of reps, a higher number of unique exercises, a higher completion rate, and a higher improvement rate in the SOLACE than the experimental group (robot). In addition, no statistically significant differences were found between the smartphone application and robot groups. Conclusion: This study is a pilot trial of an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of an online intervention with a smartphone application and robot sensor for patients with stroke with shoulder symptoms. This study showed that the smartphone application intervention method had a higher frequency of exercise than the robot control group but did not show any increase in muscle strength from the pre\u2010to post\u2010tests. This suggests that a long\u2010term online training method using a smartphone application and robot sensors would be necessary to improve muscle strength.\n\nIntroduction\nRCT stands for Randomized Control Test. In particular, for the first time in South Korea, an RCT to evaluate the online rehabilitation effect on the shoulder exercise program for stroke patients was conducted. The purpose of this study was to analyze the rehabilitation effects of the proposed online program for patients with stroke with shoulder symptoms. Among the patients with stroke, especially in the early recovery stage when the functional hand is weak, it is difficult to perform upper body muscle training, causing shoulder joint stiffness and the impairment of the functional hand to be increased.

In this way, participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive FOLFIRI or FOLFOX plus Fruquintinib.\n\nIntervention\n=================\nIntervention 1: Intervention group: Fruquintinib plus FOLFOX/FOLFIRI. Patients received Fruquintinib 5 mg/day, given orally in 28-day cycles. Patients received FOLFOX (consisting of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, folinic acid 200 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2) given as a 2-hour intravenous bolus followed by 22 hours of infusion and 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 given as a 22-hour intravenous infusion twice a day, every 2 weeks (q2w)] every 2 weeks.

            "For the combination group, the participant group/arm should consist of patients who received fruquintinib in combination with other systemic therapies such as anti-EGFR therapy, anti-VEGF therapy, oxaliplatin (OXA), or irinotecan (CPT-11). This allows for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib in combination with existing treatment for refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nAbstract\nRationale: The median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are 6.4 and 13.8 months, respectively. Moreover, the survival rate at one year is 29% and that at five years is 6%. Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs offer only minimal benefit for previously treated patients with mCRC. Fruquintinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been shown to significantly prolong PFS compared to chemotherapy in patients with mCRC who have progressed following prior treatment. However, the effect of fruquintinib in combination with standard therapy for refractory colorectal cancer is still unknown. Method: In this phase II, single\u2010center trial, 106 eligible patients will be randomized into two groups. The first group will receive fruquintinib alone and the second group will receive fruquintinib combined with standard therapy (such as oxaliplatin (OXA), irinotecan (CPT\u201011), ramucirumab (RAM), regorafenib, or panitumumab), as determined by the investigator. The primary endpoint of the study is PFS evaluated by the investigator using RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include OS, disease control rate (DCR), and safety.

Background\n\nAcne is a common skin condition that affects up to 80% of adolescents and 5% of adults worldwide. It is characterized by the appearance of bumps on the face, chest, and back, which can be mild to severe. Acne can cause physical discomfort, scarring, and psychological distress, leading to reduced self-esteem and quality of life. The exact cause of acne is not fully understood, but it is believed to be caused by a combination of factors, such as excess production of sebum (a natural oil produced by the skin), clogged pores, and bacteria. Several treatment options are available for acne, including topical medications, oral antibiotics, and hormonal therapies. However, these treatments may not be effective for all patients or may have side effects. Recent studies have shown that prebiotic and probiotic supplementation may be effective in improving acne by reducing inflammation, balancing the microbiome, and regulating sebum production. However, no clinical trials have compared the effects of different prebiotics and probiotics in patients with acne. Therefore, the objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a multispecies prebiotic and probiotic supplement with a multispecies probiotic supplement in patients with acne.\nWe plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 168 adult patients with moderate to severe acne. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three study groups:\n1. Multispecies prebiotic and probiotic supplement group (group A): Patients will receive a dietary supplement that contains a mixture of prebiotic fiber (fructooligosaccharides) and probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus fermentum CUL60, Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20, Lactobacillus plantarum CUL34, Lactobacillus paracasei CUL31, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CUL6).\n2.

A single cell can release multiple tumor-associated RNAs and \u223c 50,000 cancer-related mutations into the bloodstream within 5 minutes after the cancer cell divides and dies. This information will be useful for the identification of cancer subtypes, especially for early detection of ovarian cancer. The purpose of our study is to use blood plasma samples collected from women with ovarian cancer to understand the feasibility and accuracy of using ctDNA in the dynamic monitoring of patients with late stage ovarian cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nIn contrast to normal cells, cancer cells present different patterns in gene expression, protein composition, and mutations of tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. The gene-expression patterns of different cancers and in different phases of cancers may be very different. Genetic material in the form of cell-free RNAs and deoxyribonucleic acid from the tumor can be isolated from the blood cells using RNAseq and the sequencing results compared with the known mutated alleles found in the cancer. This information will be useful for the identification of cancer subtypes, especially for early detection of ovarian cancer. The purpose of our study is to use blood plasma samples collected from patients with ovarian cancer at different treatment stages (initial treatment, chemotherapy, and survival) to understand the feasibility and accuracy of using ctDNA to detect the early recurrence of ovarian cancer after primary therapies to guide decision making regarding adjuvant treatments, including dose adjustment of chemotherapy, changes in surgery, and use of immunotherapy.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nDynamic Monitoring of ctDNA for Predicting Recurrence of Advanced Ovarian Cancer After Primary Treatments\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAdvanced Ovarian Cancer\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------",

And what is your expected start date? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Differential DNA methylation profiles in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) and the development of methylated biomarkers as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tools. Materials and methods: A total of 134 patients diagnosed with stage III colon cancer will be recruited. Two additional peripheral blood samples will be collected after chemotherapy and before liver resection, then the samples will be analysed by high throughput DNA methylation array (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip kit, Illumina, San Diego,USA). Differential DNA methylation analysis will be used to identify methylated genes associated to the liver metastasis of CRC. The DNA methylation of key genes will be evaluated by Bisulfite\u2010pyro\u2010sequencing validation. Results: A total of 134 patients were recruited and their DNA methylation profiles were analysed. DNA methylation profiles of 3077 genes were obtained. Among these genes, we will determine which 30 genes (or genes) associated to liver metastasis are screened through Illumina array. Genes associated to liver metastasis were selected by the following analysis method. (1) Differential analysis (Illumina array) of primary tumor and blood methylation profile data between patients with and without liver metastasis detected by baseline PET\u2010CT. (2) Differential analysis (Illumina array) of blood methylation profile data between patients with and without liver metastasis detected during followup.

Are there any exclusion criteria for this participant group? \n\nStudy design\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) are germ line-encoded PRRs which recognize components of the external pathogens. TLR2 and TLR4 are expressed on the surface of various immune cells including T lymphocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Ligation of TLR2/TLR4 activates inflammatory signaling and recruit cytokines. It had been reported that overexpression of TLR4 caused ovarian cancer through TGF-\u03b2 regulation, that downregulation of TLR4 signaling could effectively inhibit ovarian cancer. However, the mechanism of TLR2/TLR4 regulating cytokine expression in ovarian cancer remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 on the inflammatory response and development of ovarian cancer and its mechanism.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study comprised of patients with primary ovarian cancer undergoing PDS at the Reproductive Center, Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine from October 2019 to January 2020, as our institution is a major center for PDS in China. Each patient gave written consent and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital. Ovarian cancer patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A included patients with high TNF-\u03b1 levels (> 300 pg/mL), and group B included patients with low TNF-\u03b1 levels (< 300 pg/mL). The plasma samples and tumor tissues were collected from these two groups at the start of surgery for TNF-\u03b1 assay and qRT-PCR analysis. Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) and TLR4 expressions in the plasma of the two groups were evaluated using Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and their correlation with the TNF-\u03b1 levels in ovarian cancer patients was analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis. Correspondingly, the mRNA and protein expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 in tumor tissues of the",

            "Abstract:\nBackground: Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy is one of the noninvasive ventilation (NIV) methods used to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during sleep. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BiPAP treatment on OSA. Methods and materials: Twenty\u2010four patients with moderate to severe OSA with comorbid mild hypertension, obesity (BMI (Body Mass Index): 30\u201035), and type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to a study group who were treated with BiPAP therapy for 15 weeks. Also, twenty\u2010four patients with similar characteristics but without treatment were assigned as the control group. The parameters of OSA were examined using both overnight respiratory polygraphy (RPSG) and full polysomnographic (PSG) studies at baseline and after intervention. Results: In the study group, there was a significant reduction in the respiratory event index (REI) (p = 0.005), the apnea\u2010hypopnea index (AHI) (p = 0.001), the desaturation index (p = 0.005), and oxygenation index (p = 0.006) values compared to before the study. For those in the control group, a statistically significant reduction in AHI, an increase in body weight (p = 0.032), and blood pressure (p = 0.048) values were observed after the study. Conclusion: Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) therapy improved the symptoms of OSA in patients with OSA who had a history of mild hypertension following 15 weeks of therapy.

Can you elaborate on this crossover design? \n\nStudy\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCultural competency is an essential skill set for nurses who work with patients from different cultural backgrounds. However, cultural incompetence can lead to poor clinical outcomes for patients and professionals alike. This study aims to examine the efficiency of using the bibliotherapy method in developing cultural intelligence and competencies among nurses working in the intensive care unit. We hypothesize that nurses who undergo a bibliotherapy intervention will exhibit higher cultural intelligence and competency levels compared to those who do not engage in the intervention. The study will also use a crossover design, which involves combining two interventions to optimize their effects. The nurses will participate in an initial training session on intercultural nursing, followed by two intervention periods: a bibliotherapy intervention and an education intervention. The study aims to produce data that can be used to inform and improve the practice of nurses in providing care for patients from diverse cultural backgrounds.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study aims to examine the efficiency of the bibliotherapy method in developing cultural intelligence and competencies among nurses working in the intensive care unit. The study will employ a crossover design, involving two interventions: an education intervention and a bibliotherapy intervention. The participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the bibliotherapy group and the education group. The bibliotherapy group will receive specialized training to increase their cultural knowledge levels, followed by activities such as reading, watching films, and discussing cultural competency topics in the workplace. The education group, on the other hand, will receive a more traditional education intervention on the basics of intercultural nursing. After the initial intervention, both groups will switch and receive the opposite intervention. The primary outcome measure of the study is a change in cultural knowledge levels. Cultural knowledge will be assessed using a series of questionnaires designed to assess the participants' knowledge of cultural differences, communication strategies, and cultural sensitivity. Secondary outcome measures include changes in self-efficacy, attitudes towards cultural competency, and perceived barriers to cultural competence. Participants will also be asked to complete",

Are you recruiting participants through any particular method? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: Background: The World Health Organization recognizes that nurses play a key role on health care services, especially during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. Research demonstrates that the prevalence of nurses in high\u2010risk countries such as Brazil and Iran is relatively high compared to other health care workers. Nursing education includes many aspects of safety, including preventing occupational injuries and diseases. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the mental health of nurses during the pandemic due to the many stressors they face. Objective: The present study sought to verify the effects of a 10\u2010week mindfulness\u2010based cognitive therapy (MBCT)\u2010based stress management program on resilience, stress, and burnout in nurses. Methods: After obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board, a simple random sample of nurses working in COVID\u201019 intensive care units was selected (60 nurses, 30 in each group) and randomly assigned to a control group who took part in a 10\u2010week mindfulness\u2010based cognitive therapy\u2010based stress management program and a case group (usual attention, 10 classes). Data were collected using the Connor\u2010Davidson Resilience Scale (CD\u2010RISC Form), DASS\u201021 Stress Scale, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA (P <.05). Results: The mean age of the study groups was 38.3 years, and most consisted of women (>90%). Participants with a bachelor's degree made up >90% of both groups. The results of repeated measures ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups after the intervention was completed in all three outcome measures (P <.05). Conclusion: The results suggest that a 10\u2010week MBCT stress management program can be effective in increasing resilience, reducing stress, and reducing burnout. It is suggested that a stress management program based on mindfulness may be effective in preventing occupational stress and burnout in nurses during the pandemic.",

An in-depth bioinformatics analysis based on integrated transcriptomics, genomics, and proteomics of urine is proposed to investigate the molecular pathways leading to the development of permanent erectile dysfunction (PED). By exploring this association between urinary proteomics and novel candidate genes, a better understanding of the molecular basis of PED development will be achieved, thus facilitating better therapeutic strategies for this condition.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPatient eligibility will be determined according to the following criteria. Patients are required to be between the ages of 18 and 70, to have suffered a pelvic fracture, pelvic fracture-associated urethral injury, and be free of infection or tumors. The patient must have been hospitalized and received conservative treatment and intracavernosal injection therapy to determine the degree of erectile function dysfunction before and three months after the initial injury. All of the eligible patients may be included to study their baseline status and compare it with the changes in their erectile function three weeks after the initial injury. The International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) will be used to determine the patient's erectile function status. A total of 15-20 men will be included in this study. To collect urine, 50 ml will be collected first in the morning and again 3 hours after the injection therapy, and then put in a sterile urine storage container.

The study population comprised patients undergoing elective total or subtotal colectomy. A colonoscope was inspected through the lumen of the colon and antrum and samples were taken 4\u2009cm from the mucosa and the muscularis layers. One part of each sample was frozen, and the other part was embedded in paraffin to be used for immunohistochemical staining of anticytokeratins (AE1/3) and M30, and measurement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20102 and \u20109) levels. A control group consisted of patients who underwent IOC under standard conditions. The results were recorded by independent researchers, and the statistical significance of differences in expression ratios was tested by unpaired t\u2010test. The average expression ratio of AE1/3 was higher in tumor tissue than in healthy tissue, with the highest level occurring in tumor tissues of stage II and III. The expression level of MMP\u20109 decreased in the same order. With an increase in MMP\u20109 level, the AE1/3 expression level decreased in the same order (stage II, stage I, stage III, control group). The positive rate of M30 was higher in stage II/III gastric cancers. The differences in the expression of AE1/3, MMP\u20109, and M30 were statistically significant, and the order was AE1/3\u00a0>\u00a0M30\u00a0>\u00a0MMP\u20109. We propose that high MMP\u20109 level is related to increased tumor infiltration depth, which may be suitable for surgery.

As such, palliative options for patients with recurrent or metastatic disease are sorely needed to improve symptoms, quality of life, and overall survival. One such strategy to improve local control is radiation therapy, especially stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The problem with standard radiation therapy for metastases is that the radiation plans are often limited to the visible tumor burden, resulting in suboptimal treatment of invisible lesions when they are too small and of normal structures when the tumor extends beyond its margins.  By utilizing adaptive radiation therapy, it is possible to create radiation treatment plans personalized to the patient's anatomy at the time of treatment and to deliver radiation to areas outside of the visible tumor as well as the gross tumor volume.  This has the potential to improve local control rates and survival, while also minimizing toxicity due to the precise nature of the radiation delivery.   \nWe plan to evaluate the feasibility and safety of adaptive stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) in treating patients with abdominopelvic metastases. Our primary objective is to evaluate ablative radiation delivery to the abdomen and pelvis and measure toxicity rates in patients with abdominal and pelvic metastases.

What do you think?\n\n\nAbstract:\nINTRODUCTION In pediatric non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the stage of disease is a significant predictor of outcome. Patients who progress to stage \u2162 and \u2163 disease are at high risk of treatmentrelated death (TRD) and relapse. Although combination chemotherapy (eg, HD\u2010D1) could achieve CR, more than half of CR patients would eventually relapse. The investigators hypothesized that intrathecal rituximab may be an effective adjuvant therapy for pediatric non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), especially for those with stage \u2162 or \u2163 disease. METHODS We will investigate a total of 48 children with stage \u2162 or \u2163 non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) on different chemotherapy protocols (eg, HD\u2010D1) in our clinical study. Patients will be divided into two groups, control group and experimental group. The patients in the control group will only receive chemotherapy, whereas the patients in the experimental group will also receive intrathecal rituximab. Routine safety tests (physical examination, laboratory tests, etc.) will be conducted before treatment. After treatment, recurrence and survival will be evaluated for all patients. RESULTS A total of 24 patients will be randomized and received intrathecal rituximab. No TRD or treatment\u2010related deaths (TRD) were observed at the end of the study. However, recurrence was observed in four patients in the experimental group and two patients in the control group. The median follow\u2010up time was 3 years. 16 patients in the experimental group and 12 patients in the control group failed to achieve complete remission (CR). One patient in the experimental group experienced cerebral hemorrhage during treatment. The survival rates at one year, two years, and five years were 57.6%, 43.7%, and 36.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In summary, our data suggest that intrathecal rituximab is a feasible and promising strategy for treating pediatric non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma who are at high",

The control group will consist of children receiving standard treatment without intrathecal rituximab. This will help us evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RTX intrathecal therapy in treating pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma. \n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nBackground/Purpose: To investigate the safety and efficacy of rituximab (RTX) intrathecal therapy in pediatric patients with non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Methods: A prospective, open\u2010label, phase II trial of intrathecal RTX was conducted in pediatric patients (ages 6\u201017) with NHL and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) involvement. Patients received RTX intrathecally at a dose of 5 mg/m2 every 4 weeks for 3 doses. The primary outcome was the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) treatment\u2010related adverse events (AEs). Secondary outcomes included overall response rates, time to progressive disease (PD), and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 21 patients were enrolled in the study (median age: 12 years, range: 6\u201017; 61.9% male; 47.6% CNS NHL; 61.9% EBV\u2010associated lymphoma). Treatment\u2010related AEs were reported in 9.6% of patients, mostly grade 1 and 2 neurological events. No grade 4 or 5 AEs were observed. The CNS response rate was 60%, with 5 patients achieving a complete response and 10 patients achieving a partial response. The median progression\u2010free survival (PFS) and OS were 34.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.9\u201043.9 months) and 41.6 months (95% CI: 34.6\u201048.5 months), respectively. Conclusion: Intrathecal RTX therapy seems to be safe and effective in pediatric patients with NHL with CNS involvement. Larger, randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate these findings"

By comparing the results of supervised spirometry to unsupervised spirometry, researchers can determine the impact of supervision on the quality of lung function testing in children.\n\nThe second study arm, which involves unsupervised spirometry, is important to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of remote lung function testing in children. By allowing children to perform spirometry tests on their own with remote guidance, researchers can determine the reliability of unsupervised spirometry compared to traditional supervised spirometry. This arm will help assess the potential for remote lung function testing to be used in clinical practice as a convenient and accessible option for monitoring respiratory conditions in children.",

All patients are required to read and sign an Informed Consent Form prior to performing any study procedure. Patients presenting for a standard macular hole surgery with gas tamponade will receive a one page supplementary Informed Consent Form. Patients are not informed about their specific operative treatment until just prior to surgery. Patients undergoing gasless surgery with scleral resection and posterior hyaloid removal will receive a modified anaesthetic regimen. This consists of intravenous sedation with general anaesthesia achieved with a 1 ml intramuscular bolus of xylazine 1%. The anaesthesia is then completed with propofol 1% administered by a nurse anaesthetist throughout the surgery in a closed eyes position. After intramuscular injection of xylazine, the eyes will only be covered with an occlusive eyelid patch and will be fixed in a position of minimal muscle tension. The intravitreal injection of the gas bubble will immediately take place after the surgery. On the other hand, patients undergoing standard surgery with gas tamponade will receive a full general anaesthesia. Patients will be followed up according to the standard protocol until complete resolution of the macular hole which is when the macular hole closure is confirmed with optical coherence tomography in a visit after at least one month following surgery. This procedure takes place in the outpatient department with 15 minutes of observation following surgery in both groups. Patients are seen at one, three and six month following surgery by the principal investigator or the associate investigator. A visual field test is performed for all patients and is repeated at six months (standard surgery) or at one week of follow-up if patients are undergoing gasless surgery (additional visit).

The gas bubble is used as a tamponade to the help the healing process because the epithelial cells do not grow over the hole until the hole closes. The use of gas has been shown to increase the closure rate of macular holes, with an average healing time of 3 to 4 months. Patients who develop pneumatic retinopexy often experience a large increase in symptoms in the first few days due to the large volume of gas present in the eye. Second-generation scleral buckling has been shown to cause significantly greater increases in postoperative macular hole dimensions compared to the first-generation of buckling. 2nd generation buckling refers to buckling that involves the use of a rigid scleral buckle, with a gas fill.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Effects of Second-Generation Scleral Indentation Versus Parap Plana Vitrectomy on Full-Thickness Macular Hole\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nMacular Hole\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure: Scleral Indentation with Tamponade\n* Procedure: Pars Plana Vitrectomy with Gas Tamponade\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Full-thickness macular holes Patients scheduled to undergo macular hole repair Willing to return for post-operative appointments Patient 18 years or older of age.

            "Excellent. In this arm, the intervention or treatment will involve participants receiving sotatercept. \n\nSotatercept is a recombinant human Activin Receptor Type II (ActRII) ligand-binding, soluble form of follistatin (full-length FST), which sequesters Activin A and B. Activin A and B are key mediators of the systemic effects of serum Myostatin (MSTN). The sotatercept molecule is designed to bind to activin A and B in circulation and inhibit their interactions with the Activin Receptor Type II (ActRII). This will likely result in decreased MSTN levels, which can increase muscle mass, improve body composition, and reduce fat mass in PAH patients. \n\nWhat dose and formulation will be included in the study? \n\nThe dosage of sotatercept for treatment is not yet known. The study will involve a dose escalation design. We anticipate that the final dose will be based on the highest dose that is safe and well tolerated during the dose escalation study, with an expected target of a dose equivalent to approximately 400 mg of rhActivin. The formulation of sotatercept is a liquid solution that is injected subcutaneously once every two weeks, in accordance with approved methods and under the supervision of trained personnel. \n\nWhat do you think about the study arms? Can you tell me why it is important to include these specific groups in the study? \n\nI believe that it is crucial to have multiple study arms in this clinical trial to compare the effects of sotatercept in different patient groups. \n\nThe control group is the standard treatment arm, where patients will receive usual care without the addition of sotatercept. This arm aims to establish a benchmark for baseline patient health and well-being in the PAH population.\n\nThe first experimental group will receive sotatercept for 43 weeks and will be assessed for efficacy endpoints at baseline and week 42. This group will serve as a proof-of-concept model and will provide valuable information about the dose that can be safely prescribed to a larger population of participants. \n\nThe second and third experimental groups will receive sotatercept for 43 weeks, and the safety and tolerability of the drug will be evaluated",

Active Comparator: Oral steroid\nParticipant Group/Arm: Patients given prednisone 1 mg/kg for 3 days then tapered by 5mg daily for two weeks\nIntervention/Treatment: Drug: Prednisone\nReasoning: This arm serves as the active comparator to compare the efficacy of budesonide intrapolyp injection to the standard treatment of oral steroids in managing type 2 chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Prednisone is a commonly used systemic steroid in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis, so including this arm allows for a comparison of the effectiveness of budesonide intrapolyp injection.\n\n2. Experimental: Budesonide Intrapolyp injection\nParticipant Group/Arm: Patients given budesonide 0.5 mg/2ml intrapolyp injection once weekly for 5 consecutive weeks\nIntervention/Treatment: Drug: Budesonide\nReasoning: This arm is the experimental group that receives the intervention being studied in this trial. Budesonide is being investigated as a potential treatment option for type 2 chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. By administering budesonide intrapolyp injection, the researchers aim to evaluate its efficacy in reducing symptoms and improving outcomes in comparison to the standard treatment of oral steroids.\n\n3. Placebo Comparator: Saline intrapolyp injection\nParticipant Group/Arm: Patients given 2ml normal saline intrapolyp injection once weekly for 5 consecutive weeks\nIntervention/Treatment: Drug: Saline\nReasoning: The placebo comparator arm is essential to assess the specific effects of budesonide intrapolyp injection compared to a placebo. By administering saline intrapolyp injections, researchers can control for the placebo effect and evaluate the true impact of budesonide on the management of type 2 chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes. Oral screening programs have been implemented to increase detection rates, but their impact on mortality remains inconclusive. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an oral screening program, followed by an oral cancer prevention campaign, in detecting oral precancerous and cancerous lesions in individuals who are regular smokers and/or chronic alcohol users. Methods: This study will be conducted in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Programmatic Area 5.2) and will include individuals aged 35 years or older who are registered as patients at Family Clinics. Health professionals will be trained in oral cancer prevention and conduct visual oral examinations, tactile examination, and oral mucosal biopsy. The intervention group will receive education through an oral cancer prevention campaign and will be actively invited for a preventive dental consultation. The primary outcome measure will be the detection of oral precancerous and cancerous lesions. The study design will be a parallel assignment, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a control arm in which health professionals will continue providing care to users as per existing protocols without any additional intervention related to oral cancer prevention. The study population will be 9,792 patients who are regular smokers and/or chronic alcohol users, registered as patients at Family Clinics within Programmatic Area 5.2 in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Statistical analysis: We conducted a power analysis using GPower 3.1 software and determined the need for a sample of 2,100 participants for each arm, with a difference between the groups of 0.26 and a significance level of 0.05 and 70% power. Discussion: The study will involve community dental clinics that are part of the Unified Health System (SUS), the main public healthcare system in Brazil. The intervention will be delivered by community health agents, which could enhance the acceptability and dissemination of the intervention"

Thanks for your cooperation and patience throughout this process. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early detection and treatment are essential for improving prognosis and survival. Current diagnostic and staging procedures for prostate cancer rely on prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA) testing, digital rectal examination (DRE), and prostate biopsy. However, these methods have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. In recent years, positron emission tomography with choline 18 (PET\u2010Chol) has emerged as a potential novel diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. PET\u2010Chol has been shown to have a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of prostate cancer, with a low false\u2010positive rate. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of PET\u2010Chol in the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. METHODS: In this study, a total of 64 patients with prostate cancer were recruited. All participants underwent PET\u2010Chol imaging along with conventional diagnostic procedures. The diagnostic performance of PET\u2010Chol was evaluated based on its ability to detect local tumor extension, nodal involvement, and distant metastasis. RESULTS: The results showed that PET\u2010Chol had a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of local tumor extension, with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 87.5%. For nodal involvement, PET\u2010Chol had a sensitivity of 88.8% and a specificity of 100%. For the detection of distant metastasis, PET\u2010Chol had a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 94.3%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that PET\u2010Chol is a highly accurate diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. It has a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of local tumor extension, nodal involvement, and distant metastasis. PET\u2010Chol may play a critical role in the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer, and may help to improve the management and outcomes of patients with prostate cancer.",
            "Your assistance has been invaluable in designing this study arm. I'm confident that it will help us improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of choline PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer. \n\nStudy of Choline PET/CT for Detecting Early Recurrence\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe aim of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent choline F 18 combined with tomography (PET/CT) for the detection of early recurrence of prostate cancer. The investigational approach is the use of the PET/CT imaging for the detection of early recurrence of prostate cancer, to investigate the relationship between PET/CT imaging findings and histopathologic findings of surgical and biopsy findings, and to investigate the relationship between PET/CT findings and survival.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nProstate cancer is the most common male cancer in South Korea. It is the cause of 20.8% of cancer deaths in South Korea in 2019. Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease consisting of small cell carcinomas, well-differentiated cancers, and poorly differentiated cancers. Prostate cancer is mainly diagnosed by transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsies. If cancer cells are found in the needle biopsy test, it is called prostate cancer. But for prostate cancer treatment, the detection of whether it has spread to surrounding tissues or has already spread to the seminal vesicles or lymph nodes is very important. For this, many diagnostic imaging studies are carried out in advanced stages. Diagnostic imaging studies include ultrasound, CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and PET nuclear medicine imaging. It is important to note that even after negative results from these diagnostic imaging tests, prostate cancer has been found in about 25% of patients with surgery results or cancer cells in needle biopsies. This is known as occult metastasis. This study is aimed at identifying the cause and method of occult metastasis, and the aim is that choline F 18 combined with tomography (PET/CT) will be very useful for the detection of occult metastasis. The study was registered on"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2016 and 2018, 168 patients underwent SEP with our computer system. Of those, 148 underwent biopsies guided by MR fusion, 139 with trans\u2010rectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion, and 9 with MRI guidance alone. A total of 5914 prostate cores were obtained, with an average of 39 cores per patient. Biopsy\u2010free safety margins (>3T PIRADS 3 or 4) from initial biopsy MRIs were 9.35 \u00b1 5.92 mm and 13.06 \u00b1 9.80 mm for TRUS\u2010fusion and MRI\u2010fusion biopsies, respectively. Incomplete (80.47%) and inconclusive (12.34%) diagnostic results were obtained less frequently in MRI\u2010fusion groups (86.52% and 4.87%, respectively) than in the TRUS\u2010fusion groups (96.38% and 23.6%, respectively). Histopathological data are reported, as well as sensitivity and specificity of histologic results with respect to patient characteristics. We assessed patient quality of life with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) scale. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results were reported using descriptive statistics. 325 patients (51.79%: 168 cases) underwent SEPs.

However, studies on the application of adaptive radiotherapy (AR) in prostate cancer patients showed more conflicting results and most did not meet the pre\u2010planned analysis or study\u2010specific criteria. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IMRT, HDRT, and AR in the treatment of prostate cancer.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the curative RT outcomes of 206 cases from the Cancer Center of a tertiary level hospital located in Beijing that underwent RT for intermediate\u2010 and high\u2010risk prostate adenocarcinoma, and the curative effects of various RT programs were compared. Patients were divided into two groups (IMRT+HDRT group and IMRT+HDRT+AR group) according to the delivery methods of external RT: external RT alone (IMRT+HDRT group) and external RT and 2 fractions of AR (IMRT+HDRT+AR group). The main indicators of prostate cancer recurrence were evaluated to verify the efficacy and safety of the two treatments.RESULTS: The median follow\u2010up time was 5.1\u00a0years (2.0\u20106.3). Of the 206 patients, 53 patients were from the IMRT group (32 conventional fraction treatments) and 153 patients were from the IMRT+HDRT group.

Many patients with HIV are co-infected with tuberculosis (TB). This study will investigate the efficacy of the current South African TB guidelines in patients coinfected with HIV and TB. The South African guidelines recommend that TB treatment commence with 2 weeks of four drugs. This is followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to assess the viability of the proposed 2-months initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in symptomatic patients with HIV and TB by determining the efficacy of this proposal in relation to rates of TB treatment completion, HIV disease progression and HIV-related mortality in participants. Study design: The study will enroll a total of 101 HIV-positive subjects in a 2:1 ratio. It will be a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Participants will receive a 4-month course of isoniazid and rifampicin in addition to oral antiretroviral therapy (zidovudine [AZT]/lamivudine [3TC]), tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) and efavirenz for 48 weeks. The primary outcome measure is the percentage of study participants who complete antiretroviral therapy (ART) and isoniazid/rifampicin therapy. Participants are screened and evaluated by study clinic staff at the beginning of therapy, every 4 weeks for 48 weeks, then every 3 months for 4 years, and every 6-12 months for 4 years. Study visits will include recording clinical symptoms, assessment of adherence, viral load and CD4 counts, and assessments of HIV clinical disease progression and HIV-associated events, including TB events.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHIV infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in South Africa, where tuberculosis (TB) infection rates are also high, with an estimated",
            "No other key elements or secondary objectives, but I'd like to ask about the outcome measures for the trial. Are you interested in measuring improvement or change in behavioral problems and healthcare service utilization? \n\nIf so, which ones would you consider? \n\n* Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS): a measurement tool for assessing the severity of mental illness symptoms, including positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology\n* Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS): a measure of severity in psychiatric inpatients and outpatients, including general psychopathology, depression, mania, anxiety, and hostility\n* Clinical Global Impression (CGI) \u2013 Improvement Scale: a subjective measure of global improvement in individuals with mental disorders, evaluated by a clinician\n* Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale: a seven-item measure used to evaluate an individual's social, occupational, and psychological functioning\n* The European Quality of Life-5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D): a measure of health status that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression \n\n* Health Service Utilization Questionnaire: a self-report measure used to assess the use of health and social services by individuals with mental illness, including inpatient, outpatient, and emergency services\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these outcome measures? And what are the potential challenges or considerations in using them? \n\n\n\nOverall, I think it would be helpful to have outcome measures that can assess changes in both behavioral problems and healthcare service utilization. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of CoMBI-SMI in reducing behavioral problems and improving the quality of life of patients with Serious Mental Illness. However, it's important to consider potential challenges in administering these measures. For example, the BPRS and PANSS are known to be time-consuming and may require specialized training or expertise to administer. Additionally, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) - Improvement Scale and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale are both subjective measures that may be influenced by biases. The EQ-5D and Health Service Utilization Questionnaire, on the other hand, are self-report measures that may require additional",
            "Great idea! Including a control group can help us observe the effectiveness of the intervention more accurately. I suggest adding a control group that receives standard care as a comparison. This will allow us to measure the impact of the intervention and determine if it provides additional benefits beyond routine treatment protocols. \n\nWhat do you think about this inclusion of a control group?",
            "Thank you for the detailed criteria. Now, let's discuss the design details. What is the primary purpose of the trial and the intervention model being used? \n\nThe primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) versus a sleep hygiene intervention (SHI) in improving sleep quality among individuals with severe mental illness (SMI). The intervention model is experimental, and randomization will occur within treatment arms. \n\nWith that information, I suggest designing the study arm as follows:\n\nParticipant Group / Arm: Experimental: People with Severe Mental Illness\n\nPrimary Intervention: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)\n\nThe target groups for this arm will be adult (18 to 65 years) and elderly (over 65 years) patients with Severe Mental Illness who are sleep-deprived, exhibit depressive symptoms, and have a history of sleep restriction therapy (SRT). The intervention in this arm is CBT-I, which focuses on promoting healthy sleep habits and managing negative thoughts about sleep. The CBT-I program comprises five modules delivered in both small and large group formats, lasting 60 to 90 minutes. This intervention will be conducted by mental health professionals with experience in cognitive behavioral therapy. \n\nSecondary Intervention: Sleep Hygiene Intervention (SHI)\n\nThe target groups for this arm will be adult (18 to 65 years) and elderly (over 65 years) patients with Severe Mental Illness who are sleep-deprived, exhibit depressive symptoms, and have a history of SRT. The intervention in this arm is SHI, which emphasizes establishing good sleep habits such as regular sleep schedules and environment modification. This intervention will be conducted by experienced mental health professionals and will generally cover information about sleep, tips for improving sleep quality, and strategies for managing distress during sleepless nights. \n\nThe control group will be another group of adult (18 to 65 years) and elderly (over 65 years) patients with Severe Mental Illness who are sleep-deprived and exhibit depressive symptoms. They will receive routine care, excluding any interventions related to sleep. \n\nStudy time period: 9 weeks",
            "That sounds good. Now, let's discuss the specific criteria for each arm. For the experimental arm, we will include participants with Serious Mental Illness who experience behavioral problems, are between the ages of 18 and 65, and agree to participate in the study. We will exclude individuals with advanced dementia and individuals who are deemed inappropriate for participation.

The inclusion criteria for this arm are the presence of SMI and behavioral problems, as well as willingness and ability to participate in this research. The intervention, CoMBI-SMI, will involve a step-by-step process, including analyzing the behavioral problem, choosing the right core need, selecting nursing interventions, and creating a CoMBI plan. This personalized approach aims to reduce behavioral problems and burden on healthcare providers.\n\nWhat do you think about this study arm design?",
            "Absolutely! Personalized interventions are crucial in addressing the complex needs of individuals with Serious Mental Illness. It's important to focus on the patient's self-image, the image of others, triggering events, and problematic behavior to tailor the intervention effectively. Additionally, involving the entire team in the cyclical CoMBI-SMI process will ensure alignment and comprehensive evaluation of the interventions.\n\nNow, let's move on to the next step of designing the study arms. Is there any specific participant group or intervention you would like to discuss?",
            "Including a control group is a valid consideration. It would provide a basis for comparison and help assess the effectiveness of the CoMBI-SMI intervention. We can design a control group that receives standard treatment or a placebo intervention. This will allow us to evaluate the specific impact of CoMBI-SMI compared to the control group.",
            "To define the criteria for the control group, we can use similar inclusion criteria as the experimental group, such as age range and presence of Serious Mental Illness. The main difference would be that participants in the control group should not receive the CoMBI-SMI intervention. This will help us determine the specific effects of the intervention compared to standard treatment alone.",
            "That's a great addition to the study arms. By including a control group, we can obtain more robust data on the effectiveness of CoMBI-SMI. Now, let's recap the study arms we have designed so far:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. Experimental: People with Serious Mental Illness\n   Intervention/Treatment: Behavioral: CoMBI-SMI\n\n2. Control Group: People with Serious Mental Illness\n   Intervention/Treatment: Standard Treatment\n\nThese study arms will allow us to compare the impact of CoMBI-SMI to standard treatment alone. Is there anything else you would like to discuss or any other study arm you have in mind?",

As you may know, dance therapy has a long history in ancient civilizations and is often associated with rituals and community events, with its roots in shamanism, healing rituals, and healing practices. In addition, it is a natural expression that is used by children from an early age, helping them express their emotions and feelings, and can positively affect their neurobehavioral development. \n\nStudies have shown that dance therapy can be effective in improving motor performance, social skills, self-expression, and emotional and mental well-being in children with learning disabilities and can be used as a complementary treatment to reduce neurobehavioral problems. For example, in 2014, a Korean study found that dance therapy led to improvements in motor skill, executive function, and overall self-esteem in children aged three to five years old with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Dance therapy was found to be an effective treatment for improving motor skills and executive functions in children with ASD.\n\nIn 2001, another study found that dance therapy in combination with parent training helped improve motor performance and self-expression in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study found that the dance therapy program helped improve motor performance, attention, and impulse control in children with ADHD, but not in healthy control subjects. \n\nMoreover, dance therapy was found to be more effective than standard occupational therapy in children with sensory processing disorders in terms of improving motor performance, executive function, social skills, behavior, and sensory processing. In 2015, a Japanese study found that dance therapy was more effective than standard physical therapy in improving motor skill, executive function, social skills, and behavior in children with developmental disorders. The study found that dance therapy helped improve motor performance, executive function, social skills, and behavior in children with developmental disorders, and that the effects were maintained for at least five years after the end of the intervention. \n\nFinally, a study in the United States found that a dance therapy program was effective in reducing aggressive and disruptive behavior in children with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). The study found that dance therapy helped reduce aggression and frustration in children with ODD, and that the effects were maintained for at least six months after the end of the intervention. \n\nTaken together, these studies suggest that dance therapy may be an effective intervention for",

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant concern for patients undergoing radical cystectomy, with enoxaparin being the recommended anticoagulant for prophylaxis. Enoxaparin is associated with a high risk of dose dispensing errors, patient nonadherence, and poor tolerability. Apixaban, an oral anticoagulant, may be a practical therapeutic option that is well tolerated and has demonstrated efficacy in preventing VTE in high\u2010risk patients following major surgery. The primary aim of this study is to assess the effects of Apixaban on the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after radical cystectomy. The secondary aims are to assess the safety of this drug, to evaluate the patients\u2019 compliance, and to compare the cost\u2010effectiveness of Apixaban with enoxaparin. Methods. This is a randomized, double\u2010blind, controlled trial conducted at a tertiary healthcare facility in southern India. 111 patients aged 18\u201075 years undergoing radical cystectomy will be randomized into two groups: Experimental\u2010 Apixaban group and active comparator \u2010 Enoxaparin group. Both groups will receive the allocated drug for 4\u20107 days, and both drugs will be administered according to the dosage recommended by the manufacturing company. D\u2010dimer test will be performed twice to assess the development of VTE. The primary outcome measure is the development of VTE and changes in biomarkers, whereas the secondary outcome measures are safety and cost\u2010effectiveness. Results. The study will be conducted in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines, and the data will be analyzed using the STATA statistical package. Statistical methods will include Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and an independent\u2010samples t\u2010test or Mann\u2010Whitney U test for continuous variables. Ethical approval: Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Conclusion: This study will compare the efficacy and safety of Apixaban with that of enoxaparin for the prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in high\u2010risk patients undergoing radical cystect",

Can you tell me more about it? \n\nAbstract:\nLiterature has shown no study regarding the efficacy of perioperative intravenous glucose infusion on wound infection after cesarean delivery. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of perioperative intravenous glucose perfusion on wound infection after cesarean delivery. We conducted a prospective randomized control trial with a sample size of 400 patients who planned to have cesarean delivery in a tertiary general hospital. Participants were grouped into: glucose infusion (control group) and no glucose infusion (experimental group). Patients fast for four hours prior to the intervention. Patients in the experimental group will receive IV glucose infusion (containing 200 mL, 0.1% ropivacaine) after induction, while the control group received IV glucose infusion (containing 200mL sodium chloride 0.9%). The primary outcome that we measured is wound infection. Both the groups were also assessed to identify their demographic data, obstetric history (parity, gravida), history medical history, and other risk factors. Chi\u2010square test, independent t test, and Fisher exact test were performed for data analysis. The prevalence of wound infection in both groups showed no statistical significance (p = 0.817). We also performed the analysis of mean values of blood glucose, and there was no statistical difference between both groups (p = 0.067). In conclusion, our finding shows that there is no significant difference in wound infection in group 1, and there is no statistical difference in blood glucose. Therefore, there is no clinical benefit from performing IV glucose infusion on patients undergoing cesarean delivery.",

Anesthesiologists are concerned about the risk of respiratory depression and potential complications with this combination. We conducted a randomized controlled study evaluating clonidine and remifentanil in sedated children with painful intravenous catheterization. We evaluated whether it is safe for anesthesiologists to use clonidine in conjunction with remifentanil when compared with remifentanil alone for sedation. We administered 0.2 \u00b5g/kg of remifentanil intravenously in 200\u2010\u03bcg normal saline over 10 minutes for sedation. Then, 40 children were randomly assigned to Group R (remifentanil 0.2\u2009\u00b5g/kg/hour) or Group RC (0.2\u2009\u00b5g/kg/hour of remifentanil and 1 \u03bcg/kg of clonidine boluses) to compare sedation quality. Pain scores and hemodynamic responses were compared between the two groups. The duration of sedation was shorter in Group R than in Group RC (p\u2009= 0.038). However, there was no significant difference in pain response and hemodynamic parameters between the two groups. In conclusion, clonidine can be combined with remifentanil without increasing side effects.",

Children who are obese or overweight have a negative outlook on life and an increased risk of developing chronic conditions. This study aimed to determine the effect of L\u2010carnitine supplementation on appetite parameters and dietary restraint in children who are obese or overweight. Methods: This intervention study included a pretest\u2010posttest parallel control group design. The participants were randomized and allocated to intervention and control groups. The control group received a daily intake of 10 mg of vitamin E, and the intervention group received 100 mg of L\u2010carnitine per day (twice daily) in the form of powder for 60 days. The amount and type of food consumed by the children at different times of the day were assessed based on the food records before and after intervention. The participants\u2019 appetites and energy consumption were determined using subjective measures, including the visual analog scale and three\u2010factor dietary restraint scale. Results: A total of 101 participants were enrolled in the intervention group (male: n = 48; 22.2\u201324.3 years; female: n = 53;17.7\u201324.8 years).

Both groups showed a significant reduction in appetite (P < 0.001) and consumption of carbohydrates and fats (P \u2264 0.05). A significant reduction was observed in the mean appetite score in the intervention group when compared with the control group (P \u2264 0.001) and in the mean energy consumption score compared to baseline (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of perceived hunger or the need for a snack between baseline and post\u2010intervention evaluations (P > 0.05). Conclusion: We found that L\u2010carnitine decreased appetite score, calorie intake, and consumption of fat and carbohydrates.",

However, some patients experience relapse or refractory disease, which can significantly impact their quality of life and prognosis.\nR-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) is a well-established treatment regimen for FL . Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen on B cells, and it has demonstrated high efficacy and safety profiles in the treatment of FL . Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine are common chemotherapy drugs used for lymphoid malignancies , while prednisone is a corticosteroid that has been used in the treatment of various cancers for many years . The combination of these drugs in R-CHOP has resulted in improved response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients with FL.\nDespite the efficacy of R-CHOP, there are ongoing efforts to develop novel therapies for FL. One promising candidate is odronextamab. Odronextamab is an immunoconjugate consisting of the CD35 monoclonal antibody ABI-1117 (which targets the CR2 receptor on B cells) and a duocarmylin warhead. When administered to patients with relapsed/refractory FL, it",

Two children died during irradiation due to pulmonary infections, 6 patients had toxic complications resulting in significant deterioration in performance status. Pulmonary irradiation was continued in all patients, and the results were compared using the following three treatment methods. The 3\u2010year disease\u2010free survival rates were as follows: ifosfamide, 0%; methotrexate/cytarabine/doxorubicin, 33%; observation, 0%. This treatment was not effective in preventing relapse.

Are there any additional interventions or treatment options being studied? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Economic and political disparities often impact whether women can initiate and adhere to HIV/antiretroviral therapy (HIV/ART). Our objective was to assess the association between financial burden of HIV/ART and adherence. We hypothesized higher cost of medications would be associated with lower adherence rates.METHODS: Data for 427 women from an HIV/ART adherence trial conducted in 13 antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in South Africa and Botswana were pooled for analysis. Multiple imputation was used for missing data and generalized estimating equations were fitted to assess the association between a composite economic burden variable, which included the monthly cost to the patient of obtaining ART and the cost of food, and HIV adherence. We categorized adherence as 97% and above versus <97%.RESULTS: A total of 61% of the patients were in the adherence group and 39% in the nonadherence group. Women in the low\u2010cost HIV/ART arm were significantly more likely to be in the nonadherence group (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.3, p = 0.03). The cost of medications increased women's odds of being in the nonadherence group compared to those with lower costs (OR 3.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 19.9, P = 0.09). The interaction between patient cost and HIV/ART cost were not significant (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.3 to 2.5, P = 0.85).CONCLUSION: Women's nonadherence to HIV/ART is influenced by high costs for both HIV/ART and food and is often worse for those in lower cost HIV/ART arms. Costs should be considered when prioritizing treatment provision.\n\nIntroduction\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection remains a global pandemic causing over 1.7 million deaths in 2016 .

The prevalence is approximately 5 to 10% in autopsies. This tumor can have a unilateral (60%) or bilateral (40%) localization. The majority of tumors with respect to their size (80%) are benign, and the majority of patients are asymptomatic 1. Their asymptomatic nature justifies conservative management in 20% of patients who have been operated (21). In our department, the management of these tumors has evolved since 2000. Since then, laparoscopic surgery has been applied, initially in a small number of patients. Today it has become our routine practice. Method: One single-center (CHRU of Montpell",

Our goal is to assess improvement in the pulmonary function and the respiratory capacity of COVID-19 patients.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPatients with COVID-19 often experience respiratory problems as a consequence of the severity of pulmonary infection. Our research is of special interest because of the increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19 and the long-term respiratory problems that have been identified as secondary effects of the disease. Patients affected by this virus have been shown to have symptoms like dyspnea, increased respiratory rate, chest pain and prolonged cough after recovery, which can also develop into pulmonary impairment. The at-home rehabilitation program designed for our study consist of aerobic exercises, home breathing training and use of the Wirbelt device at home. Aerobic exercises can benefit patients through cardiorespiratory fitness improvement which can reduce cardiorespiratory symptoms while also improving the respiratory capacity of the participants. The breathing retraining is performed in order to reduce the diaphragmatic asymmetry and strengthen the diaphragms contractility. Aerobic exercise and breathing retraining have not yet been combined in a clinical program specifically for COVID-19. The Wirbelt device is a breathing training program that was developed in 1990 by Kirsten L\u00f6wenstein in Switzerland. It helps to improve the pulmonary function, breathing performance and respiratory control by strengthening the diaphragm. The at-home program and device are safe and easy to use, which makes it accessible to patients throughout the world. The benefits of the at-home program have been proven in patients with chronic lung diseases. We expect similar effects in patients with COVID-19. The long-term effects of COVID-19 are not well known yet, and we hope this study will contribute to developing better recovery programs.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nImplementation of the COVID-19 Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program at an Early Discharge Stage\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCOVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)",

We examined the same relationships for 110 patients before therapy and after 6 months. Methods: Patients completed measures of QOL and pain. The 16\u2010item Short\u2010Form Health Survey (SF\u201016), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for shoulder pain, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (QuickDASH), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire. Results: Patients who responded to treatment had improved QOL outcomes on all SF\u201016 measures except \"role physical.\" Pain was inversely proportional to the physical and role limitations of QOL, BDI total and somatic subscale scores, and BPI pain and interference scores. There was a strong relationship (rs = 0.51 to 0.63; P = 0.001) between shoulder pain and all domains except \"role physical\" and \"social functioning.\" There was also a weak relationship (rs = 0.20 to 0.40; P = 0.05) between shoulder pain and all SF\u201016 domains except \"role physical\" (r = 0.05) and \"role emotional\" (r = 0.09). Significant correlations (rs = 0.51 to 0.59; P = 0.001) were found regarding depression levels and QOL: physical functioning, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, and role limitations due to emotional problems. Strong correlations were found between the BPI pain and function scale and all QOL domains except for \"role physical\" (r = 0.50; P = 0.001). On the PGIC, patients who responded positively to treatment had improved QOL outcomes on all domains except for \"role physical\" (r = 0.45; P = 0.003).

            "to nonmyeloablative regimens (NMA), with a rapid increase in the use of autologous stem cell transplants since 2000. NMA have significant advantages over myeloablative regimens, in terms of being less neurotoxic and allowing for the administration of higher doses of chemotherapy. They are also associated with a lower risk of toxicity, and hence a shorter time to engraftment /transplantation. \nThe number and proportion of autologous stem cell transplants being performed for hematological malignancies continues to increase exponentially in the United States. From 1999 to 2019, there was an increase in the number of autologous HSCTs performed each year by 61%, as compared to an increase of only 10% over the same period in the total number of bone-marrow transplants performed . The use of ASCT continues to increase, with 87,023 procedures performed during 2019 alone. This included procedures for all forms of hematologic malignancies (leukemias, lymphomas, myeloma) , and this is the case even in the ageing population where most patients >68 years old are underrepresented (16%). \nStudy objectives\n=================\nAs part of the routine post-HSCT monitoring for all patients discharged from the study centre after HSCT, the patient demographics, clinical outcomes and treatment complications are routinely recorded. The data will be analysed to produce outcomes for the transplants, patient demographics and hospitalization rates. The objective of this study is to identify associations between these variables and determine if the data can be used to improve patient outcomes, both in terms of treatment efficacy (complete response at diagnosis and relapse-free survival) and hospitalization requirements.  Study hypothesis\n=================\nThe secondary objectives of this study are (1) to determine whether patients with certain patient characteristics, for instance gender, ethnicity, age, BMI, sociodemographic status, and/or clinical features, such as primary diagnosis and clinical staging, have higher rates of complications during and post HSCT, (2) to determine how these risk factors modify the response to various treatment protocols and (3) to correlate the response to treatment with outcomes, such as",
            "Ok. Could you please provide additional details about these different arms? \n\nBackground\n=================\nTreatment response is an important outcome measure in hematologic malignancies. Although complete remission is the endpoint for remission induction treatments, there are currently no validated and standardized methods to directly measure treatment response that can be used in clinical settings. Treatment response is evaluated by evaluating tumor burden using imaging. MRI can directly measure tumor burden on a quantitative scale by measuring lesion volumes. Although a variety of techniques are currently used to measure lesions in patients with hematologic malignancies, there is no consensus on the most appropriate method. To accurately measure treatment response with quantitative MRI, an automatic and reproducible software method is needed to identify and measure tumor lesions accurately, reliably, and quickly. To develop such a method, a large cross-sectional study of patients with different hematologic malignancy types measured using MRI is necessary. This project will design, test and implement an automatic segmentation method for blood-free T2 weighted MRI to overcome the segmentation difficulties of hematological malignancies. This method will then be validated and applied to assess and compare treatment response of hematologic malignancies using clinical and volumetric MRI data collected prospectively. This project will provide a segmentation pipeline that accurately and consistently measures treatment response in hematologic malignancies, thereby providing a standardized method of measuring the treatment response in this cohort.\n\nProject Description\n=================\nBackground   Treatment response is an important outcome measurement in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Various methods are currently used to estimate the treatment response of hematologic malignancies, including visual methods, quantitative measurements of tumor burden by volume or length, and volumetric measurements of tumor, body, and non-tumor compartments. Currently, these methods provide qualitative or semi-quantitative data that cannot be used in clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of standardized guidelines for measuring treatment response is a significant problem, and the use of different evaluation methods among patients makes it difficult to accurately evaluate disease progression and treatment efficacy. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive research to systematically evaluate treatment response. Purpose   The goal of this project is to systematically investigate treatment response in the context of early",

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of melatonin on the incidence of delirium and melatonin receptors in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Forty critically ill patients were randomized into melatonin and placebo groups. On the first day of ICU admission, melatonin (6 mg/day) or placebo was given twice for 5 days. Melatonin use was found to be significantly higher in terms of reducing the risk of delirium (P = 0.011). On the first day in the ICU, there was no difference between the groups in terms of delirium (P=0.450). At the beginning of the fifth day in the ICU, the frequency of delirium in the melatonin group was significantly lower than in the placebo group (P=0.024). As a result, it is determined that melatonin can prevent and reduce the frequency of delirium in patients with melatonin receptors by affecting the neurological system."

It represents a major socioeconomic problem in developed countries. Patients in pain are suffering from sleep disorders and fatigue, causing a great diminution of their quality of life and increased disability. Despite the availability of several analgesic treatments at various doses and in many forms, some patients do not respond to them. Percutaneous epidural treatment is one of the alternatives to these treatments. It causes a transient, reversible block of afferent fibers (C and A delta) and is one of the most effective treatments for intractable pain, particularly after surgery. However, despite its effectiveness, it presents a number of drawbacks: the requirement of local anesthetics, the dose of which may be difficult to find, especially in neuropathic pain, the duration, the risk of injection or puncture, the risk of local anesthetic or allergy and side effects.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nDespite the many drugs available to control pain, some patients do not respond to them.

            "Understood. Now, could you please tell me the secondary purpose of the trial? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Rigorous assessment of analgesic efficacy and safety of epidural local anesthetics or analgesics is needed to establish the clinical efficacy of these drugs. This study is designed to compare the analgesic efficacy of 6 mg/kg lidocaine compared with 10 mg/kg levobupivacaine using patient controlled intravenous analgesia after abdominal hysterectomy. Methods: The main purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety when using epidural morphine plus 6 mg/kg lidocaine to provide analgesia during elective abdominal hysterectomy, or an epidural mixture of levobupivacaine 10 mg/kg plus morphine in the same epidural volume. A total of 36 patients were randomly allocated to Group L (lidocaine) or Group B (buupivacaine) in each category of preoperative pain grade, and the level of pain relief, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, adverse responses, and side\u2010effects were assessed. Results: The two groups showed no significant differences in any of the variables studied or in any of the intra or postoperative characteristics. The mean analgesic consumption in the L group was significantly less than in the B group in patients with a VAS pain score of 4 or above (P < 0.05). In addition, the incidence of pruritus and other side\u2010effects was significantly greater in the L group in all patients receiving intravenous morphine (85% vs 27%; P = 0.005). No differences were found in the VAS pain score or the need for intramuscular morphine. Conclusions: The analgesic efficacy of epidural anesthesia with 6 mg/kg lidocaine and intravenous morphine is less than that of epidural anesthesia with levobupivacaine and intravenous morphine for the control of acute postoperative pain. In addition, pruritus appears to be more of a problem when using lidocaine.",

This is a retrospective, observational cohort study of stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion treated with intraarterial re\u2010perfusion in a large, comprehensive stroke center. The data of all patients who underwent thrombectomy for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion with IV t\u2010PA as the first step treatment between February 2013 and March 2017 were extracted from the center stroke database. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV\u2010t\u2010PA) was administered within 4.5 hours of symptoms onset, and the endovascular treatment was performed at least 60 minutes after the initiation of intravenous t\u2010PA. The study excluded patients with IV t\u2010PA intolerance and large internal carotid artery occlusions. A total of 581 patients were eligible for analysis. In 501 patients (86.2%), intra\u2010arterial re\u2010perfusion was successful (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade 2 or 3 score). The most common cause of recanalization failure was inability to cross the clot, followed by lack of contrast in the artery and unsuccessful device use. As a result, the difference in successful recanalization rates between the IV\u2010t\u2010PA group and the phenylephrine group was only 10.1%. The complication rate was 11.7%, with no significant difference in either group. The symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was 6.3%. There were no differences in mortality or National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at discharge between the two groups. There was a statistically significant difference in length of stay in intensive care unit between the IV\u2010t\u2010PA and phenylephrine groups (4.2 days vs.",

Forty patients were evaluated in the study. Two methods of epidural analgesia, EPF and EPB, were used according to a computer\u2010generated randomization schedule. Two PCA boluses of sufentanil and morphine (1 microg/kg of body weight and 0.15 mg/kg of body weight, respectively) were programmed for patients receiving EPF. Patients receiving EPB used PCA morphine as 0.15 mg/ml in a continuous background infusion of isotonic saline. Pain during postoperative day 5 was similar in both groups and mild in 47%, moderate in 31%, and severe in 22% of the patients in EPF group and in 46%, 33%, and 20%, respectively, in EPB group. There were significant differences between groups according to visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores at rest and with movement at 20th day. Postoperative morphine consumption was 40.54 +/\u2010 27.88 mg in the EPF group vs. 47.91 +/\u2010 29.05 mg in the EPB group. More patients in the EPB group still had moderate to severe pain at 20th day. Postoperative complication (hypotension in 10%) and motor block in 5% of the patients in EPF group was lower in comparison to the EPB group. Our results show that intraoperative epidural infusion with fentanyl provided effective postoperative pain control between 5th and 20th day after total hip replacement in comparison to epidural infusion with local anesthetics followed by postoperative P"

            "Great! What is the main purpose of this study, or more specifically the objective (ies) of this study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by abscesses and chronic relapsing inflammation. The main treatment is long-term treatment with antibiotics and antiseborrheics. However, side effects of long-term treatment with antibiotics and antiseborrheics are common and the effects are not well maintained.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nRecently, recent studies have shown the benefits of treatment with fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), which is the transfer of fecal bacteria from a healthy donor to a recipient. These effects include remission of inflammatory bowel disease and treatment of metabolic syndrome. However, FMT by an orally administered or infusion method may be a source of infection as well as bacteria that cause inflammatory disease in the recipient. We propose to obtain capsule-packaged lyophilized fecal bacterial granules from a single healthy donor based on the beneficial bacteria, which are likely to play a large role in the prevention of HS. The study population is limited because it is impossible to find healthy people who have not received fecal bacteria other than their own, such as delivery persons, doctors, nurses, and nursing personnel, and who have been treated for HS. Therefore, we propose to limit this study to 15 healthy people. The screening process is designed based on a questionnaire, physical examination, blood tests, stool analysis, and evaluation of psychological status. Participants who meet the above conditions will have their feces prepared and packed in capsules, and the resulting capsules called lyophilized fecal bacterial granules. HS patients will be subjected to a skin scraping test to analyze the condition of the skin microbiota before and after the trial, and HS patients with lesions will be selected and randomized. The study will compare HS patients receiving capsules containing lyophilized fecal bacterial granules with those of non-capsule FMT group to determine the efficacy and safety. The study design was developed to assess whether HS lesions such as folliculitis and abscesses decrease when compared to non",

This study will assess the feasibility of such an intervention in school settings.\n\nSecondary outcome\n=================\nThe acceptability of the intervention to high school students.\n\nAbstract\n=================\n\nBackground\n-----------------\nStigma and reduced mental health literacy have been consistently associated with greater severity of psychopathology across youth with mental illness. In addition, these stigmatic outcomes are associated with less social support (particularly school-based social support) among youth with a mental illness. Social support is a key protective factor for mental health and well-being. This study will examine the effects of a school-based educational intervention aimed at reducing stigmatizing outcomes and improving mental health literacy, on social support (via an online survey) and clinical outcome variables (via phone-based semi-structured interviews) among youth with major depression. The specific aims of this study are:  \n1. To determine the safety and efficacy of the intervention,  \n2. To examine the role of school-based social support in mental health support of youth with mental illness by evaluating its role as a mediator, and  \n3. To assess the acceptability of the intervention to high school students.\n\nObjective\n-----------------\nThe objective of this study is to examine the effects of a school-based educational intervention aimed at reducing stigma toward mental illness and improving mental health literacy, on school-based social support among youth with major depression by evaluating its role as a mediator.\n\nDesign\n-----------------\nThis pilot study will be divided into two phases: a treatment phase and an extended follow-up phase. Participants who are diagnosed with major depression will be assigned to either the intervention or a wait list control group, with 10 participants recruited in each intervention or control groups. During the treatment phase, participants will complete three online sessions related to mental health stigma and mental health literacy.

Experimental: MMT group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients with HS randomized to receive MTT\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Drug: Fecal Microbiota - lyophilized\n   - Rationale: This arm is necessary to test the efficacy and safety of oral microbiota transplant therapy (MTT) in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). By administering lyophilized fecal microbiota capsules derived from a single donor per patient, the researchers aim to alter the gut microbiome and study its effects on the cutaneous microbiota. The dosing regimen of 2 capsules daily for one week followed by one capsule daily for 2 weeks is designed to assess the potential benefits of MTT in improving HS symptoms.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator: Placebo group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients with HS randomized to receive placebo treatment\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Drug: Placebo drug\n   - Rationale: The inclusion of a placebo group is essential to evaluate the efficacy of the experimental treatment (MTT) in comparison to a control group. By administering a placebo consisting of a mixture of trehalose and crystalline methylcellulose in capsules that are visually indistinguishable from the active product, the researchers can assess the true effects of MTT on HS patients. This arm helps to control for any placebo effects and provides a baseline for comparison with the experimental group."

Subjects were evaluated 24 h after performing either a 60 min moderate to high intensity treadmill stress\u2010test protocol or practicing tai\u2010chi for the same duration of time. Cognitive performance was measured using a dual\u2010task paradigm consisting of motor function (the Purdue Peg Board Test; PPB), executive function (the Stroop tasks), and an interaction of motor and executive function (the Timed Up and Go test; TUG). Heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and electrocardiogram (lead II) were also assessed. Our results show that subjects who performed the treadmill protocol showed significant improvement in all cognition tests compared to subjects who practiced tai\u2010chi. However, the magnitude of improvement was greatest for subjects with below average PPB, Stroop, and TUG test scores and lowest for subjects with high exercise capacity. Additionally, our study found that PPB performance was significantly correlated with 24 h stress\u2010test results. In conclusion, this study suggests that exercise may improve multiple aspects of cognitive performance in older adults.

This means they will follow the treating-physician's recommendations instead of using the DIAPI algorithm. The reasoning behind this arm is to have a control group for comparison. By comparing the outcomes of patients receiving usual care to those receiving care based on the DIAPI algorithm, we can determine the efficacy and safety of DIAPI in managing peri-intervention diabetes.",
            "Of course. In the \"Experimental: DIAPI\" arm, patients will receive the care for their diabetes recommended by the DIAPI algorithm during their peri-procedural period. This means they will follow the orders generated by DIAPI. The reasoning behind this arm is to test the effectiveness and safety of the DIAPI algorithm in managing peri-intervention diabetes. By implementing DIAPI's orders, we can evaluate whether the algorithm provides optimal and personalized treatment that leads to better outcomes compared to usual care. This arm will help determine if DIAPI can simplify the complex task of peri-intervention diabetes management while ensuring patient safety.",

Patients: The study included 21 patients that underwent kidney transplantation at the University Hospital Center in Split, between 2009 and 2015. Methods: In the research group (n = 11) the predetermined therapeutic approach by transplant nephrologists included two 30 minute physical training sessions and one one hour psychotherapeutic discussion per week with a clinical psychologist. The control group (n = 10) underwent standard medical care as decided by transplant nephrologists. The patients in both groups completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the EuroQoL questionnaire (EQ\u20105D) before the initiation of the first treatment regimen and after three months of their first follow\u2010up visit. Results: After the completion of the study (after 6 months), the research group participants had better physical activity scores in the moderate activity domains (p = 0.04) and in all other activity domains except the walking domain (p = 0.11). No differences in quality of life were observed between the two groups. Conclusions: Rehabilitation is an important aspect of post\u2010operative treatment in patients who have undergone kidney transplantation and may improve their ability to participate in activities of daily living.\n\n1. Introduction\nKidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with chronic renal failure. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up of these patients has shown that patients who have undergone a transplant have a better quality of life than those who use dialysis treatment. However, kidney transplantation is not without complications. Complications may include acute rejection, infection, arteriosclerosis, and hypertension, and the incidence is particularly high in the first year after transplantation. Patients who undergo renal transplantation must endure several months of rehabilitation following the procedure. The main goals of this rehabilitation are to achieve homeostasis and prepare patients for physical activity . Some of these patients show a",

            "I'm excited to see how these modifications affect the study results.\n\nAbstract:\nThere is extensive research on the effectiveness of intra\u2010articular glucocorticoid (GC) and/or hyaluronic acid (HA) injections for knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, these studies show conflicting results. This may be because of differences in study design and cohorts. In view of these limitations, we propose a study protocol testing the effect of a single injection of GC alone, with or without concomitant HA injection, versus a saline\u2010only injection in an unblinded, single center, randomized controlled trial. The study aims to recruit at least 210 patients (aged \u226545\u2009years with grade II\u2010III medial tibiofemoral knee OA), with a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 factorial design. For this study, a novel method of stratification based on age and previous history of intra\u2010articular injection will be used. This method can better control the risk factors that may affect outcomes, thereby increasing the study power. The primary outcomes will be pain at rest and movement, while secondary outcomes will include other clinical measures such as stiffness, function, and daily living activities. We will also consider quality\u2010of\u2010life measures and patient\u2010reported outcome measures (PROMs). We aim to demonstrate that an injection of HA improves pain significantly more, compared to injections of GC, saline, and GC\u2010and\u2010HA. The results of this study will provide useful information, contributing to our understanding of the effectiveness of intra\u2010articular GC and/or HA injections for knee OA.",

In the proposed study, 3 separate clinical cohorts will be investigated: children with SLE, children with SoJIA, and children with Kawasaki disease.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nChildren with chronic systemic inflammatory diseases without a known etiology (systemic-onset Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or Kawasaki disease) often experience decreased functional capacity related to cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial injury. It is well-documented in adulthood that exercise induces a systemic anti-inflammatory response, modulates endogenous opioid systems, and modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines. There is compelling evidence for the cardiovascular benefits of exercise training in the general population. In the long-term, exercise training decreases the risk of developing coronary heart disease. However, the impact of exercise training on the cardiac myocytes of patients with systemic conditions with a known etiology has not been investigated. Therefore, we propose to determine whether a 2-week period of aerobic exercise training can improve cardiac function (measured by cardiac MRI) and body composition in children with chronic systemic inflammatory diseases. In the proposed study, 3 separate clinical cohorts will be investigated: children with systemic lupus erythematosus, children with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or children of Kawasaki disease.

            "Absolutely! The placebo comparator arm, which we'll call \"Placebo Controlled: Placebo,\" will include obese subjects with Type 2 Diabetes at risk of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis. They will receive a placebo that looks and feels exactly like the active treatment. The primary purpose of this arm is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HU6 in improving liver fat content. \nBackground\n=================\nBackground: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease in the United States and has been associated with several serious health conditions, including insulin resistance, Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and liver damage. Approximately 10-15% of individuals with NAFLD develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a form of liver injury that may lead to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Current treatments for NAFLD focus on weight management and lifestyle modifications, but these strategies are often ineffective in achieving long-term improvements in liver fat content. HU6 is a novel small molecule that has been shown to improve liver fat content in preclinical studies. HU6 activates a specific protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd), which plays a central role in the regulation of liver fat metabolism. Our study will investigate the safety and efficacy of HU6 in obese subjects with T2D at risk of NASH. We hypothesize that HU6 will improve liver fat content and reduce the risk of NASH complications. \n\nMethods: This is a phase 2, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study that will enroll 35 subjects with T2D, obesity, and increased liver fat content. All subjects will undergo a four-week screening period, followed by a twelve-week study intervention. Subjects will be randomized to receive either HU6 or placebo. For the first eight weeks, subjects will take 600 mg of HU6 or placebo daily. For weeks nine to twelve, subjects will take 800 mg of HU6 or placebo daily. All subjects will undergo extensive safety and efficacy evaluations throughout the study. The primary outcome measure will be change in liver fat content",

Energy intake (kJ) from total fat, saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids, \u03b2-OC and LCTs, \u03b2-OC:LCT ratios and \u03b2-OC and LCT content of the three main meals. Participants will be asked to complete 12 questionnaires, with the option of one phone call if a questionnaire is not completed on time. Weather, physical activity and lifestyle behaviors that could influence dietary and physical activity habits will be reported by one weekly questionnaire. The dietary data are used for nutrient analysis.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Although an overall reduction of saturated fatty acids and increases in poly unsaturated fatty acids and \u03b2-OC are recommended as healthy dietary habits, it is uncertain whether this also applies to long-chain triacylglycerols (LCTs), the precursors of \u03b2-OC.

Radiation therapy constitutes a significant part of cancer therapy. There are well\u2010proven associations between radiation exposure, DNA damage, and cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate whether genetic damage and cancer cells can be generated by low\u2010dose photon therapy (100\u2009mGy in 2 Gy fractions).MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized crossover pilot study, 12 healthy, 60\u2010year\u2010old volunteers (group 1, 4 females) were irradiated with CT scanner (group 2, 4 females) and x\u2010ray (group 3, 4 females). Blood samples were obtained the next day in order to determine lymphocyte clonogenic, chromosome, and microlesion. Peripheral venous blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, 20\u2009ml) were isolated with Ficoll\u2010Hypaque and cytokeratin and CK\u2010positive cells via positive, selective isolation with immunomagnetic microbeads and immunobeads.RESULTS: For PBMC clonogenic, chromosomal aberrations, and micronucleus were not observed. For CK\u2010positive cells, clonogenic significantly increased compared to non\u2010CK\u2010positive samples (52.3 +/\u2010 8.1 versus 17.1 +/\u2010 5.9, p\u2009<\u20090.01).CONCLUSION: The results of genetic damage after low\u2010dose radiation cannot be confirmed yet with PBMC.

Subjects will complete a 3-week run-in period with medication titration to their target/baseline treatment (Study GINA 1 or GINA 2) to ensure there is no exacerbation during the run-in period. After randomization, subjects will be instructed to continue taking their GINA 1 or GINA 2 treatment throughout the study. Subjects will be screened and randomized to one of the two doses of IBU/GLY either 100/2.5mcg or 200/2.5mg in a blinded fashion. Subjects will continue their daily IBU/GLY treatment for a period of 24-weeks. In addition to collecting the daily data on e-diary, subjects will be called 3 times during the treatment period to address any problems (e.g., lost or break in supply) and to promote daily adherence. Subjects will be required to return to clinic for 5 visits during the study (screening/baseline visit, randomization visit, IBD-Q visit 8, 16, and 24 weeks after randomization, for e-diary check).

Psychotherapy can enhance overall well-being and the experience of the world as a meaningful place to be. However, there is little evidence available to support the use of brief psychotherapies for reducing psychological distress among adults. Moreover, it is unclear whether an eight-session psychotherapy is effective compared to a six-session psychotherapy for reducing psychological distress in individuals experiencing psychological distress. To address this gap in knowledge, we are proposing a feasibility study to determine the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of eight sessions compared to six sessions of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). We will screen adults (aged 18 to 68 years) with mild depressive symptoms to participate in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups: 1) eight weeks of intervention; and, 2) six weeks of intervention.

Two months after the extraction procedure, four implants (3.3 \u00d7 12 mm, Nobel Biocare Inc., Yorba Linda, CA) per each site were placed bilaterally and restorations were delivered to subjects. The implant\u2010supported mandible overdentures were restored with a removable titanium framework after the second\u2010stage surgery (6 weeks after the implant placement). Three months after implant restoration, the titanium framework was replaced by the PEEK framework. The aesthetic and functional parameters were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 12 months.RESULT(S): A total of 23 implants were placed in 12 subjects (65 to 93 years of age; 6 males and 5 females), with a mean implant diameter and length of 4.33 mm and 10.88 mm, respectively. The overall survival rate of the implants was 100% after 1 year. The overall success rate of the implants was 100%. No significant differences were noted between the 2 sides in terms of implant survival and success rate (p>0.05). No significant changes were observed for the color match and soft tissue architecture (p>0.05).CONCLUSSION(S): PEEK copolymer framework may be a promising material for mandibular implant\u2010supported overdentures.

Low-grade inflammation has been shown in multiple studies to be associated with an increased risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event, particularly stroke. There are existing trials looking at the role of anti-inflammatory therapy in cardiovascular and diabetic atherosclerosis. A study by Chan and colleagues (Sanders et al.) showed a significant reduction in total cholesterol, inflammatory markers and stroke risk in men with hypertension on a Mediterranean diet vs. conventional lipid lowering diet. A similar trial in women with hypertension and obesity is being planned. The investigators have modified the Sanders study design which will be a multi-centred trial recruiting a total of 150 women with hypertension, obesity and systemic markers of inflammation. The trial hypothesis is that an increased intake of omega-3 fatty acid and a polyphenol-rich Mediterranean diet in women with hypertension, obesity with or without dyslipidemia and systemic markers of inflammation will lead to a 50% reduction in total cholesterol, inflammatory markers and stroke risk.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Mediterranean Diet for Inflammation and CardioVascular Events (MEDIA)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAtherosclerosis, Dyslipidaemias, Heart Failure, Atherosclerotic Disease, Hypertension, Diabetes\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Behavioral: Anti-inflammatory diet\n* Behavioral: Mediterranean diet intervention\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Healthy, sedentary, obese and hypertensive women between 45 - 60 years with inflammatory markers and no known cardio-metabolic disease Free from disease that would preclude an investigational",

The cause of anorexia in patients with CKD has not been fully explained. Cytokines play a role in the etiology of anorexia in various diseases. Our aim was to evaluate the correlation between anorexia in dialysis patients and inflammatory cytokines. Patients and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted for five months (August 2019 to February 2020) in 69 patients undergoing hemodialysis. A questionnaire survey was administered to assess appetite status and food intake. Blood samples were collected for measurement of serum tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin\u20108 (IL\u20108). A nutritional assessment with a mini\u2010nutritional assessment score (MNA) was completed. Results: The average ages of the study cohort were 53.9 \u00b1 13 , with a mean body mass index of 23.5 \u00b1 4.26 kg/m2. The anorexia score, mean MNA, and average levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1, CRP, and IL\u20108 were 16.1 \u00b1 6.83, 11.66 \u00b1 2.72, 14.61 \u00b1 30.29 pg/ml, 12.5 \u00b1 34.98 mg/L, and 89.53 \u00b1 212.01 pg/ml, respectively. Among these patients, 11 (26%) consumed <70% of their total energy requirements. Bivariate analysis indicated that anorexia was associated with lower serum MNA, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and CRP levels (P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that serum TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels were negatively correlated with MNA, energy intake, CRP, and IL\u20108 (P > 0.05), with a predictive accuracy of 76",
            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe study aims to evaluate the changes in the gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acid metabolites in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing peritoneal dialysis using a self-care technique\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nEnd-stage renal disease is a chronic illness characterized by the lack of ability to remove urea and other solutes from the body, leading to an increase in waste products in the blood. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a common dialysis treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. PD is a dialysis technique that involves inserting a catheter into the abdomen and circulating dialysate through the peritoneal cavity to cleanse the blood. A self-care technique, also known as continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), allows patients to perform their procedure at home without the need for a machine. PD has the advantage of providing more flexibility for patients, but it has been associated with bacterial peritonitis and inadequate clearance of waste products. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of PD on the gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acid metabolites, which are metabolites that are essential for the development and function of the gut microbiome. The investigators hope to gain a better understanding of the impact of PD on the gut microbiome and metabolites, which may help improve the treatment of end-stage renal disease.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvaluation of the Gut Microbiota and Short-chain Fatty Acids Before and After 6 Months of Peritoneal Dialysis Using a Self-care Technique\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nEnd Stage Renal Disease, Peritoneal Dialysis\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Peritoneal Dialysis\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis with a self-care technique Exclusion Criteria: Patients suffering from digestive disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease or malabsorption syndrome Patients taking antibiotics within the last six months Patients taking probiotics or prebi",

Are there any additional inclusion criteria or exclusion criteria for the standard follow-up arm? \nAbstract:\nBackground: Pregnancy is a common complication of thalassemia major (TM) which is one of many hematological disorders with adverse outcome for the mother and the fetus. Maternal complications comprise severe anemia and infections such as malaria and urinary tract infection. Infectious complications with adverse outcome for the fetus includes abortion, low birthweight and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). There has also been an increasing trend of intrauterine deaths. Anemia in pregnancy has also been associated with the development of iron deficiency and increased risk of infectious and non\u2010infectious complications. The objective of our study is to determine the impact of iron therapy in pregnancy on intrauterine death, adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal complications of pregnancy among thalassemic parturient at the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). Methods: A hospital\u2010based retrospective cohort study will be carried out in the antenatal clinic at MNH. Records of pregnant women diagnosed with \u03b2\u2010thalassemia major who were on iron therapy (Group A) and those not on iron therapy (group B) will be reviewed. The study period will be four months. Main outcome measures include; intra\u2010uterine death (IUD), low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB) and maternal anemia. Results: The cohort study will be used to assess the determinants and magnitude of the outcome of interest and to compare the outcomes of the exposure and non\u2010exposure group. This outcome will be presented using the appropriate summary statistics of frequencies and proportions in the two groups. We will use a p\u2010value of \u2264 0.05 for the level of statistical significance for all the analysis.\n\nBackground\nThalassemia major (TM) is a genetic hemoglobin disorder where children inherit a defective Hemoglobin S (HbS) gene from both parents .

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative treatment for aortic valve stenosis in high-risk patients. Despite TAVI is associated to a lower short-term mortality rate compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), the long-term outcome has not been investigated so far. In our retrospective study, we investigate the clinical outcome of patients with aortic insufficiency who have been treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to patients with conventional management with aortic valve replacement in a retrospective study. For this purpose, patients with or without aortic insufficiency who have undergone TAVI between January 2012 and December 2017 at Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin have been identified from our database. Patients with concomitant percutaneous coronary interventions, heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, aortic valve stenosis, or valve reoperations have been excluded.

While it is becoming increasingly important to manage the functional decline and maintain the functional level of older adults to promote their AIP, effective interventions to prevent the functional decline still remain elusive. Objective : To develop a novel intervention system based on a deep learning model for CDOAs which could accurately estimate their physical function and ADLs. We also aim to explore the intervention effects of this intervention system and compare its effect with traditional questionnaires. Methods : This research employed a three\u2010group, quasi\u2010experimental study utilizing a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. The study subjects were recruited from a long\u2010term care insurance system and randomized into three groups. The three groups included the following: intervention group with a combined intervention of the APP, a wearable, and a smart pill case that provides gamified training and monitors the medication\u2010taking process; the control group with a gamified APP only; and the self\u2010care group with a wearable + smart pill case, in which the participants would undergo a self\u2010management intervention using a wearable device to monitor their activities and a smart pill case to monitor their medication\u2010taking process. The data of the intervention group and the control group were analyzed using various statistical methods and evaluated according to the predetermined outcome indicators to determine the effectiveness of the proposed intervention system. Results : The results of the intervention and control groups were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank test and t\u2010test to examine the effect of the intervention system. The results of the TUG test and the Barthel Index showed that the intervention group had significant improvements compared to the self\u2010care and control groups. Conclusion : It is concluded that the proposed intervention system can effectively prevent the functional decline of older adults and enhance their ADLs. Additionally, incorporating digital technologies like wearables and smart pill cases can help individuals with functional disabilities remain independent by allowing them to live at home with the assistance of technology.",

            "My pleasure! I'm glad to help and I hope this has provided you with the information you need to create the best possible study design.\n\nBackground\n=================\nDespite the availability of effective interventions to prevent HIV acquisition, HIV infection rates remain high in Kenya, particularly among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). This study aimed to pilot-test a school-based program designed to increase knowledge about HIV prevention among AGYW in Kenya.\nMethods\n=================\nA double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 7 high schools in Western Kenya. Eligible students (n = 569) were randomized to receive either a school-based HIV prevention intervention (n = 300) or standard school-based education (n = 269). The intervention was delivered in 13 groups of 10\u201320 female students by trained peer educators. The intervention focused on increasing knowledge about HIV prevention, including the benefits of HIV testing and condom use. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 3 months post-intervention. The primary outcome was knowledge about HIV prevention. Secondary outcomes included self-efficacy for HIV prevention and reported sexual behavior.\nResults\n=================\nThe study showed that the intervention had a significant impact on the primary outcome of knowledge about HIV prevention. Adolescents who received the intervention had significantly higher knowledge scores compared to the control group (average knowledge score = 54.0% for the intervention group and 39.8% for the control group, p < 0.001). The intervention also had a significant impact on secondary outcomes, including self-efficacy for HIV prevention and reported sexual behavior. Conclusions\n=================\nThe study demonstrated that a school-based HIV prevention intervention had a significant impact on knowledge, self-efficacy, and reported sexual behavior among AGYW in Kenya. The intervention was found to be effective in increasing knowledge about HIV prevention, and it was well-accepted by the students and was found to be feasible to implement. These findings suggest that school-based HIV prevention interventions represent an effective and scalable strategy for reducing HIV acquisition rates among AGYW in Kenya and elsewhere.\n\nIntroduction\nAdolescent girls and young women (AGYW) are at increased risk of HIV acquisition compared to other age groups due to biological, social, and economic factors [1\u20133"

            "Abstract:\nHouse of Representatives investigators determined that 86 percent of U.S. veterans with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) receive regular treatment for neuropathic pain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of pregabalin as an adjunct to standard drug and physical medicine regimens. We enrolled 28 veterans with chronic SCI with neuropathic pain and randomly assigned them to one of two groups. Group 1 received pregabalin up to 150 mg/d for 12\u2010weeks, and group 2 received pregabalin for 4 weeks and then received placebo for 8 weeks. We compared measures of pain, sleep, depression, and functional mobility at week 12 and at week 20. This report focuses on the primary outcome measure at week 12. Secondary outcomes at week 12, secondary analyses, and comparisons of postponed effects over 20 weeks will be addressed in future writings. A significant reduction in pain was achieved only in the pregabalin group. Although several outcomes showed improvement in each group, few differences between groups were statistically significant. In the randomized patients with SCI who receive regular treatment for neuropathic pain, the daily use of up to 150 mg of pregabalin provided statistically significant pain relief at 12 weeks, compared with placebo, but at 12 weeks pregabalin and placebo did not show significant differences for other measured outcomes. This treatment did not appear to be superior to placebo on secondary outcomes, and 26.1% of patients in the pregabalin group had moderate or severe adverse events. These results do not support using pregabalin to treat subjects with chronic SCI.",

A single\u2010blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted with forty women aged 25\u201060 years old with TMD symptoms, in which they were randomized into either control or treatment groups. Forty patients were randomly assigned into two groups: 20 controls (CG) and 20 treatment (TT). Both groups received a standard education about the temporomandibular joints (TMJs), the temporomandibular muscles, and exercises recommended for the TMJs and TM muscles, three times a week for four weeks. The TT group received additional mindfulness training once a week for four weeks. The pain intensity, pain pressure threshold, and pain pressure tolerance were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the fourth week. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied to investigate whether pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, or pain pressure tolerance change was affected by the mind\u2010body intervention. The results of ANCOVA showed that there was a significant effect for mind\u2010body intervention on pain intensity (p=0.001, F=57.123) and pain tolerance (p=0.001, F=51.336). The mean (SD) reduction from baseline to post\u2010intervention for the CG (pain intensity: \u00b17.91\u00b10.35; pain pressure threshold: \u00b15.97\u00b10.28; pain pressure tolerance: \u00b117.99\u00b10.48) and TT (pain intensity: \u00b15.19\u00b10.48; pain pressure threshold: \u00b11.13\u00b10.23; pain pressure tolerance: \u00b123.62\u00b10.53) groups showed to be significantly different (p<0.05).

The first step will be a physical evaluation to assess the initial fitness level and medical history. Each participant will receive three different training sessions. At the start of the study, the participants will perform pre-training exercises for three consecutive weeks, which will be followed by supervised training sessions for 12 weeks. The second step will be nutrition education, including information pamphlets, individualized dietary charts, and weekly telephone coaching. Participants will learn what to eat to help them maintain their ideal weight. They will be encouraged to incorporate foods rich in lutein, such as dark green leafy vegetables, broccoli, corn, orange peppers, and kale, into their daily diets. The third step will be a consultation with the patient and caregiver. The purpose of this consultation is to discuss the importance of lutein and supplements, recommend sources of lutein, and advise participants on when to take their supplements. Lastly, follow-up consultations will allow participants to assess their progress and continue to ensure their success with the VIVIFRAIL\u00ae program. Intervention Group Controlling (Suggestions for a Healthy Life): The second group will not receive the VIVIFRAIL\u00ae exercise program but will receive suggestions for simple movements at home for one day per week for eight weeks (4-5 days a week).

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is primarily based on clinical, radiological, and histological findings, with lung biopsy being the reference standard for diagnosis. However, conventional transbronchial lung biopsy samples primarily the upper lobes of the lung parenchyma, overlooking peripherally located sites, which are often associated with histopathological findings of sarcoidosis. Peripheral (i.e., extrabronchovascular) airway biopsy (EAB) has emerged as a potential diagnostic tool in sarcoidosis, as it may provide access to these more peripheral sites. This study aims to assess the diagnostic yield of EAB in patients with an existing suspicion of sarcoidosis. The trial is a multi-center, prospective, open-label, diagnostic trial that will enroll patients with an existing suspicion of sarcoidosis. Patients will undergo standard transbronchial lung biopsy and EAB during the same bronchoscopic session. The primary outcome is the diagnostic yield of EAB in patients with a presumptive diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The secondary outcomes are: (1) the diagnostic yield of EAB in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis; (2) the diagnostic yield of EAB in patients with extra-thoracic involvement; (3) the safety and tolerability of EAB. The study will enroll a minimum of 100 patients with clinical suspicion of sarcoidosis. This study will help assess the diagnostic yield of EAB in patients with sarcoidosis and improve the efficacy of EAB in diagnosing and managing this disease. \n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Observational Study\nObservational Study Model:: Case-control\nTime Perspective:: Prospective\nTarget Number of Participant:: 100\nCohort/Group Number:: 1\nCohort/GroupDescription:: Patients undergoing bronchoscopy for suspected sarcoidosis\nCohort"

We divided patients into two groups depending on the strategy used. The combination group was treated with DAPT for 12 months and with anti\u2010Xa therapy if they had no contraindications to it. The monotherapy group was treated with DAPT alone. In the combination group, bleeding and cardiovascular events were significantly less (33.7% vs. 25.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and net clinical benefit was significantly more (94.3% vs. 80.4%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) compared with the monotherapy group. Furthermore, a higher rate of stent thrombosis was seen in the monotherapy group compared with the combination group (0.3% vs. 0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.028). We also determined that there was an increased risk of bleeding in combination group patients with active cancer and low body weight.CONCLUSION: The combination of dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulant therapy was effective and safe in patients with left main coronary artery disease, stent implantations in two or more vessels, and high risk factors.",

Imatinib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking their abnormal signaling activity. Giving combination chemotherapy together with imatinib may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib in treating patients who have c-KIT positive or MET gene mutation positive cancer that has come back (recurrent) or has not responded to treatment (refractory).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nOBJECTIVES: Primary Determine the most appropriate dose (schedule and dose level), if any, of oral imatinib when combined with a chemotherapy regimen previously shown to demonstrate activity against tumors in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Secondary Determine the toxicity of the combined regimen. Determine the response rate of the combined regimen in patients who have c-kit positive or MET gene mutation positive cancer. OUTLINE: This is a phase I trial. Patients receive oral imatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Patients also undergo chemotherapy every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo disease assessment every 2-4 weeks. Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Patients are then treated at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the effects of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation in addition to sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on treatment-resistant depression. The study consists of two stages. The investigators will first examine the effects of rTMS on depressive symptoms and brain activity. They will then evaluate the effects of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation along with rTMS on depressive symptoms and brain activities. There is a possibility that the effects of this stimulation may differ according to sex. Therefore, the investigators will also analyze these effects according to sex.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nTreatment-resistant depression (TRD) refers to a depression that does not respond to treatment in an average of 2-3 months, and its prevalence is approximately 30 %. The causes of depression are not fully understood and there are still many difficulties in the treatment of depression. Therefore, depression is an important disease in the development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic methods. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), an emerging treatment option, is a type of brain stimulation therapy that has been found to be effective for depression. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, previous studies show that not all patients respond well to rTMS and some patients do not show clinical improvement. This suggests that new therapies with different mechanisms of action are needed for patients with depression who do not benefit from rTMS. One possible reason for the reduced efficacy of rTMS and the difficulty in selecting the optimal site for rTMS, the non-specific stimulation of rTMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) which is not targeted to any specific brain area, and the fact that brain wave activity and brain region activity vary depending on sex cannot be controlled by sex-specific analysis. In addition, when the efficacy of rTMS is examined, it is necessary to consider age-related changes in brain activity as well as sex-dependent changes. Therefore, the researchers are conducting this study in order to examine the effects of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation on brain activity as",

            "[STUDY] For the primary outcome measure, it would be appropriate to assess the central retinal thickness (CRT) as a measure of DME reduction. I would recommend comparing the CRT reduction at month 3 between the two study arms. For the primary comparison, I suggest considering the proportion of participants with a greater than or equal to 20% reduction in CRT at the 3-month visit. [/STUDY]\nIn terms of the statistical analysis, I recommend using a generalized linear mixed model to assess the effect of dexamethasone implant and ranibizumab, with time and study arm as fixed effects. This will allow for an adjustment for any baseline imbalances in measured CRT between the groups. Additionally, I recommend analyzing and presenting the mean and standard deviation of the CRT changes from baseline. This will provide a clear understanding of the clinical impact of the treatment on DME and help evaluate the efficacy of the study intervention. [/ANALYSI]",

            "The switch from aVEGF (Bevacizumab) to RBZ0.5 was proposed due to reports that RBZ0.5 (a fixed dose of intravitreal ranibizumab) may be superior to Bevacizumab, with less risk of complications like endophthalmitis and less need for multiple injections. We are interested in comparing the effects of DEX and RBZ0.5 on choroidal thickness and functional outcomes, specifically in patients with DME. Our hypothesis is that DEX would be more effective than RBZ0.5 in reducing choroidal thickness and improving visual acuity. \n\nThe study arms include: Dexamethasone arm: Participants in the dexamethasone arm will receive intravitreal injections with DEX (Ozurdex) every 4 months for one year. Blood (serum) samples will be collected 9 month after starting the treatment. \n\nBevacizumab arm: Participants in the bevacizumab arm will receive intravitreal injections of bevacizumab 1.25 mg per 0.05 ml (Avastin) every 4 months for 12 months following washout with Lucentis (ranibizumab 0.5 mg per 0.05 ml).

Blood (serum) samples will be collected 9 month after starting the treatment and just before receiving the first injection of Lucentis. \n\nTo summarize, the two study arms will compare the effects of DEX and RBZ0.5 on choroidal thickness and functional outcomes, specifically in patients with DME.

The participants for this additional arm will be divided into 3 equal groups, with the low dose group receiving a 1mL application of a 1/3 dilution (0.5mL) of the DA-OTC-002 solution, the medium dose group receiving the same size application of the full-strength DA-OTC-002 solution (1mL), and the high dose group receiving a 3x concentration of the DA-OTC-002 solution (3mL). The participants should visit the study site twice per week for a total of 8 weeks. We will compare the results from each group to identify any dose-response effects and determine the optimal concentration for use in future trials.

And does this intervention or treatment have a standard of care you are comparing it to? \n\nAbstract:\nFibroblast growth factor\u201023 (FGF23) is a vitamin D regulated phosphaturic hormone involved in mineral homeostasis. Previous studies in patients with advanced malignancy and primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) showed that FGF23 is suppressed by PTH, supporting a potential therapeutic effect as a treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). In this Phase 2, single\u2010arm study, adults with PHPT with serum calcium >10.3 mg/dL receiving active cancer treatment and/or SHPT were treated with low\u2010dose monthly FGF23 (1.6 g). FGF23 levels did not significantly change with treatment, and FGF23 suppression was not correlated with changes in serum phosphorus or PTH. The frequency of dosing with FGF23 was positively correlated with the change in serum calcium. FGF23 treatment had modest antitumor activity, with stable disease in 55% of patients and a median duration of respond was 22 weeks. Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria were the most common treatment\u2010related adverse events (AEs), which were all Grade 1 or 2 in severity. There were no events of hypercalcemic crisis. No deaths occurred, and the most serious AEs (SAEs) were due to underlying cancer. In this study, FGF23 did not suppress blood phosphorus or PTH. It also had modest antitumor activity with no added safety signals when added to cancer therapeutics. FGF23 should not be used to treat patients with PHPT.",

After obtaining ethical committee approval, a total of 50 consecutive patients complaining of variceal hemorrhage and confirmed with upper endoscopy were randomized into Group I (N = 25, open DSRS plus pSAE) and Group II (N = 25, endoscopic ultrasonography\u2010guided pSAE and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). Preoperative and postoperative variables were analyzed. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to sex, age, child\u2010pugh classification, tumor size, and diameter of the splenorenal ligament. All patients were followed up at postoperative 2\u2010week intervals until the 6th week. Complete variceal obliteration was achieved in 48 patients (96%) in Group l and in 20 patients (80%) in Group II (P = 0.376), but endoscopic sclerotherapy was performed in 4 patients (16%) in Group I and in 4 patients (16%) in Group II (P = 0.714). The complications rates were 12% for group I and 6.7% for group II.

In the future, it may be useful in the management of patients with diabetes, as well as in the general population of patients with other cardiometabolic diseases. Diabetes and prediabetes cause damage to blood vessels and organs throughout the body, and many patients experience diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy.\nRecent evidence suggests that foot ulceration is associated with renal insufficiency, anemia, and arterial damage (arteriosclerosis).  Recent epidemiological studies in Japan have shown that diabetic ultrasound is a strong independent predictor of mortality caused by arteriosclerosis in Japanese and non-Japanese populations. In the present study, we will measure the extent of ultrasound damage and the changes in ultrasound after the start of treatment using an ultrasound machine that is easily accessible in Japan and abroad, and we will attempt to reduce the load on patients by using the most simplified procedure for measuring blood flow and by using simplified image data for analysis and diagnosis.\n\nHealth condition(s) or problem(s) studied\n=================\nSubjects with diabetes\n\nCondition category\n=================\nDiabetes\n\nPrimary outcome\n=================\n1.

Participation in the trial consists of two phases: pre-intervention and intervention. In the pre- intervention phase, each participant will undergo a series of diagnostic evaluations, which will determine the location and severity of their cellulite. The standard 3D photographs taken before and after each treatment will be used to quantify and assess the severity of the cellulite using the following measures: the presence or absence of cellulite, the size and number of cellulite dimples, the extent of the dimples, their distribution, and the degree of skin elasticity.\nThe intervention phase of the trial consists of 9 weekly wearings of the compression apparel for 45 minutes each. Each use of compression pants on a particular day includes an initial evaluation of the buttock and/or thigh using a lymph scanner, followed by active and passive compression using the Cell-u-Light apparel, culminating in post-intervention lymph measurement. \nIn addition, subjective improvements in appearance, comfort or discomfort, and willingness to continue using the compression apparel will be assessed at each visit. These assessments will be conducted by trained research staff using an established set of standardized questions. \nTo assess the impact of the compression apparel on the appearance of cellulite, participants will be asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the product on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being very unsatisfied and 10 being very satisfied. Additionally, photos will be taken using cellphone cameras positioned on a tripod to avoid angle variations in the images. These photos will be used to measure and compare the severity of cellulite dimples before and after the intervention. \nAll images captured during the trial will be anonymized and will not contain any patient identifiers.

However, a low-fat diet that still allows for some dietary fat and has no calorie limits would likely improve compliance since this diet would not need to be started gradually. The purpose of the current proposal is to evaluate the weight loss effects of a low-fat, energy-restricted diet compared with a conventional low-fat, calorie reduced diet on weight loss and other health parameters. Subjects will be randomized to either a low-fat, low-calorie diet or a low-fat, fixed (but lower) energy diet.

Materials and Methods: This prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. In this study, 104 patients undergoing THA were randomly assigned to either intradural LBP (n = 53) or conventional postoperative pain therapy (n = 51). A 7\u2010cm midline incision was made, and the plexus was identified inside the lumbar dura by blunt dissection using a neurodissector. After confirming that the target nerve was not punctured, 0.25% bupivacaine 7 ml and 2 ml adrenaline were injected under high\u2010frequency ultrasound guidance. After the procedure, fentanyl 0.5 \u03bcg/kg was administered and patients were transferred to the post\u2010anesthesia care unit (PACU). At PACU, intravenous patient\u2010controlled analgesia (PCA) with fentanyl was initiated. The primary outcome was the duration of intravenous PCA use (hours) while the secondary outcomes were patient satisfaction, visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain intensity (maximum: 10; 0 is no pain, and 10 is the worst pain imaginable), the number of rescue morphine doses, postoperative sedation scores (maximum: 5; 0 is awake and alert, and 5 is unresponsive to verbal or physical stimulation), complications, as well as the incidence of opioid\u2010induced adverse effects.

If you have any additional questions or need further assistance in planning your trial, please don't hesitate to contact me. \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVE: To present a protocol for a randomized clinical trial to determine the effect of acetazolamide (AZA) on intraoperative cerebral oxygen (icC(2))\u2010sensitive transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow velocity (FV). BACKGROUND: The role of vasoconstrictive pharmacological agents in general anesthesia is discussed controversially. Acetazolamide has been shown as being effective to stabilize cerebral autoregulation and improve icC(2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a randomized, single\u2010center, double\u2010blind, prospective, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trial. Adult patients undergoing scheduled major elective spine operation were included. AZA at a dose of 15 mg/kg bolus with standard of care or placebo, 5 mg lidocaine i.v. was administered after skin incision, before spinal anesthesia. Neuromonitoring was performed through both TCD probes and standard of care. Outcomes analyzed are the effect of AZA on FV, perfusion reserve index (PRi), and TCD\u2010derived pulse pressure (TCD\u2010PP) in early anesthesia. RESULTS: Primary endpoint of our study was the FV. At baseline, FV was not statistically significantly different between the two study arms. During induction of spinal anesthesia FV increased compared to the baseline. In comparison to placebo AZA administration was associated with a significant decrease in the FV and thus better cerebral oxygenation, especially during and after administration of muscle relaxants. The PRi and TCD\u2010PP were significantly lower without statistical differences between the study arms. CONCLUSIONS: AZA has a protective effect on the brain microcirculation without causing significant changes in the arterial blood pressure or heart rate.",

Experimental and control group students were asked to submit a pre\u2010test, post\u2010test, and follow\u2010up post\u2010test assignment consisting of a clinical case written in the form of a scenario. Students were then randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. The treatment group's clinical cases were reviewed individually by nursing and occupational therapy professors as part of a class exercise in a simulation lab; each student received personalized feedback on their written clinical case report. In the control group, students were asked to turn in their written clinical case report to receive the graded assignment and no further interaction was conducted between the professor and the student. The students in the experimental group demonstrated growth in knowledge scores while receiving personalized mentorship with their instructors through the provision of feedback on the written clinical case report. In contrast, students in the control group demonstrated decreased knowledge scores with no individualized feedback.

Mechanical thrombectomy (MT), a minimally invasive procedure, reduces disability in acute ischemic stroke patients by the removal of blockages of the brain blood vessels. The transfer time of stroke patients from primary stroke centers to central neurological centers within the study network is on average two hours and 10 minutes, which is too long. The study network is spread over the north of the Netherlands. Several factors influence transfer times. One factor is the use of alarming systems. Currently, many primary stroke centers use their own way of alerting and transferring patients for MT, delaying treatment starts. The standardization of alerting procedures will improve the quality of alarms, provide better coordination between prehospital emergency and receiving neurological centres, and decrease transfer times.Hypothesis:By implementing and using a standardized alarming system and standardized workflow protocol, transfer times and treatment starts of acute ischemic stroke patients will decrease.

The study will enroll patients with a pancreatic cyst larger than 2cm found during a radiology exam, and with or without other relevant clinical findings, with an expected cyst fluid volume to support the sample analysis for various biomarkers. The goal is to test the effectiveness of glucose levels in discriminating between a mucinous and non-mucinous cyst, and also investigate the diagnostic value of CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and amylase levels in pancreatic cyst fluid.

IC3: Fluid in the cystic fluid analysis is greater than or equal to 1mm2/hour for analysis. Participants excluded where EUS evaluation was not possible due to medical factors, or where informed consent was not obtained to participate in the research study. For the purposes of IC, EUS is a minimally invasive endoscopy method, which is used to visualize the pancreatic cysts, while a fine needle is inserted through the tip of the endoscope to collect fluid samples for analysis. IC2 is the second part of the IC, where the collected fluid samples are analyzed within 30 minutes of collection, and the results of the analysis are used to determine the suitability of the participant for participation in the study. IC2 can be omitted if IC3 is met. IC3 is the third and final part of the IC, where a biopsy of the cystic wall is performed to obtain a tissue sample for further analysis. Participants excluded where the biopsy is not performed, or if the tissue sample is not suitable for analysis. Additional exclusion criteria: prior history of invasive malignancy within 5 years, end-stage renal disease, hypersensitivity to the EUS device, contraindication to FNA, inability to consent to the study, and lack of English fluency.\nIntervention 2, non-mucinous arm: Inclusion criteria (IC): radiologically identified pancreatic cyst(s",

In the first phase, a comparison of the physical and biological aspects is made through a single visit lasting up to 7 hours, between the group of patients operated on with conventional techniques: sternum surgery in supine position with manual traction (Group P) and the ROTEM group: anterolateral surgery with the aid of a heart-lung machine (Group S). The two groups will undergo an evaluation at baseline and upon arrival at the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), as an in-hospital assessment. In the second phase, 24 hours later, all patients will receive either conventional antibiotic therapy with oral intake or antibiotic therapy with inhalation treatment. After 5 days of therapy, we will proceed with an efficacy evaluation through an assessment of the patient's state of health. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether a new method for heart surgery, in particular the one using extracorporeal circulation without retractors, is more efficient in patients compared to the conventional method. In particular, the primary endpoint is the evaluation of postoperative pain in the PACU with a numerical rating scale (NRS). \n\nIn addition, the following endpoints will be collected. The hemodynamic parameters will be collected during the two steps of the surgery (preoperative, intraoperature, and postoperative). Post-operative morbidity will also be monitored using standard protocols, including respiratory variables and body temperature. The study will also assess the degree of stress experienced by patients through the evaluation of psychological parameters and cortisol levels.

The case group was divided into two sub\u2010groups (n=15 from each gender). The first group (n=15 from each gender) received 2 g per day of L\u2010Citrulline (aspartate salt of L\u2010Citrulline) after a 60\u2010minute rest, while the second received the same dose after 30 minutes of cycling. The control group was composed of 30 male and 30 female healthy individuals receiving 0.9% sodium chloride. Blood samples were taken from all subjects before and after the challenge to assess clinical safety, hematology, renal safety, blood gasometry, metabolic parameters, Nrf2/HO\u20101 translocation, oxidative stress and nitric oxide production levels, vascular endothelium, and adipokines. In conclusion, a single oral administration of 2g \u2022 L\u2010Citrulline / kg body wt / dose in subjects with type 2 diabetes showed an increased circulating level within a single day. This supplement did not alter the concentration of all the other parameters, including HO\u20101 translocation and 8\u2010iso\u2010PGF.

            "Thank you for providing those details. Now, let's move on to the design of the study arms. Based on the information you've provided, I suggest considering two study arms: Part A - Escalation and Part B - Expansion.",
            "Certainly! In Part A - Escalation, we will enroll patients who have either not received systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC or have received at least one line of systemic anticancer therapy for metastatic disease. This arm will help us assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of Tepotinib and Pembrolizumab. We will start with a small number of patients and gradually escalate the dose of Tepotinib to evaluate any potential adverse effects and determine the optimal dosing regimen.",
            "In Part B - Expansion, we will focus on patients with NSCLC and MET exon 14 skipping mutations who have not responded well to previous treatments. This arm aims to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Tepotinib and Pembrolizumab in a larger group of patients. By targeting patients with specific genetic mutations associated with NSCLC, we can assess the potential benefits of this targeted therapy approach in a population that may have limited treatment options.",
            "In Part A - Escalation, patients will receive Tepotinib daily for three weeks. After three weeks, they will be given Pembrolizumab immunotherapy on a 21-day cycle alongside Tepotinib daily. Dose de-escalation of Tepotinib will be performed if necessary, based on the safety and tolerability assessments.",
            "In Part B - Expansion, patients will receive the combination of Tepotinib and Pembrolizumab throughout the study. The safety run-in of Tepotinib will be tested in the first cycle, followed by the introduction of Pembrolizumab from cycle 2 onwards. This will allow us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy in a larger group of patients with NSCLC and MET exon 14 skipping mutations.",
            "Certainly! Here are the full study arms for the POTENT trial:\n\n1. Experimental: Part A- Escalation\n   - Participant Group/Arm: This arm includes patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have either not received systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC or have received at least one line of systemic anticancer therapy for metastatic disease.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Patients will receive Tepotinib daily for three weeks, followed by Pembrolizumab immunotherapy on a 21-day cycle alongside Tepotinib daily. Dose de-escalation of Tepotinib will be performed if necessary.\n\n2. Experimental: Part B- Expansion\n   - Participant Group/Arm: This arm includes patients with NSCLC and MET exon 14 skipping mutations who have not responded well to previous treatments.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Patients will receive the combination of Tepotinib and Pembrolizumab throughout the study. The safety run-in of Tepotinib will be tested in the first cycle, followed by the introduction of Pembrolizumab from cycle 2 onwards.",
