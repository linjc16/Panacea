It is expected that various effects (such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-infection, protective effects, etc.) are obtained by eating honey. Although a large amount of studies have been conducted, there is still little evidence in Japan to support those expectations. Since honey is a fermented food, there may be a difference in efficacy between each type of honey due to the difference in the species of the honey bee from which it is made, the pollen in the honey, the degree of ripening (fermentation), and other factors. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of types of honey on the prevention or treatment of the common cold have been conducted.\nObjective\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to clarify the effects of honey species on the prevention or treatment of the common cold by conducting a systematic review using Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Joanna Briggs Institute, Efficacy Review Database, LIVIVELink, ClinicalTrials, DART-Europe, Korea Research Index, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. For the treatment of the common cold, the effect of honey on the duration of cold symptoms and honey on the degree of improvement of symptom severity will be investigated. As for the prevention of the common cold, the effects on the prevention of colds, the number of days away from work, missed workdays, and days absent from school will be investigated.\nMethods\nWe will conduct a literature search using the following search terms: Honey OR honey species OR honey quality OR honey composition* OR nectar. We will include studies that are randomized controlled trials and observe the treatment or prevention effect of honey, as well as studies that meet the following three criteria: 1) honey, 2) cold, 3) preventive or curative effect of honey, and 4) study conducted in Japan, North America, Europe, South America, Australia, Oceania, and Asia.

Due to the relatively low incidence of pediatric lung cancer, and because most children diagnosed with the disease are not eligible for prospective trial enrollment, it is unclear how best to treat this malignancy. This is especially applicable to patients with Stage III disease. It has been shown that advanced stage metastatic lung cancer patients have substantially improved survival when treated with hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), rather than conventional radiotherapy (RT), for lung lesions. The efficacy of this treatment in improving overall survival when applied to pediatric lung disease is not known. It is our hypothesis that pediatric lesions will be comparable to adults in terms of responsiveness to both SBRT and conventional RT.

HIV incidence among Black women, the fastest growing at\u2010 risk group, is four times the national average with little decreases seen over the last fifteen years. This highlights an urgent need for development, evaluation, and implementation of interventions for Black women who have or are at risk for HIV. One approach to achieving this is the Five Point Initiative, a community\u2010based participatory research (CBPR) intervention developed with and for Black women at high risk for HIV. This novel community\u2010based participatory intervention will empower the voice of the community and engage community members to be a part of identifying solutions for the greatest challenges that face Black women living in Black communities. Methods: Community\u2010based events, held bimonthly in the community from July 2020 to June 2021, will be utilized to deliver Five Point Initiative\u2010based interventions. Events will take place at pre\u2010existing venues throughout five points in African\u2010American communities in Miami\u2010Dade County and will target key community stakeholders, such as religious leaders, business owners, community organizations, and other Black women. These key community stakeholders will also play a part in co\u2010designing and providing feedback on the content at the events. Findings. This approach will serve to strengthen the partnership between community stakeholders, researchers, and community members to decrease stigma of getting tested for HIV, increase testing for HIV and STIs and linkage to services through the Community Navigation Center. We will work in collaboration with community stakeholders to increase screening, treatment and retention in HIV care, while empowering them to use their leadership skills to provide support for the community.",

The objective of this exploratory study is to assess the frequency and nature of these malignancies in patients being treated with prostatectomy or radiotherapy in order to inform the design of a clinical trial.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nProstate cancer represents a significant public health problem in the United States, where it is the most common malignancy in males. Approximately 233,000 new cases are diagnosed each year and, despite improvements in surgical techniques and therapeutic regimens, it is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in males. Prostate cancer is frequently associated with tumors from other epithelial sites. This comorbidity may be a function of a field effect attributable to shared common carcinogens, or may reflect an increased inflammatory state in the prostate with an increased risk for cancer in other tissues. Understanding the relationship between prostate cancer and malignancies in other sites may improve the long-term understanding of their underlying pathogenesis, and may inform new approaches for screening and diagnosis, as well as for more appropriate use of existing treatments. Recent studies have established that a large percentage of men with prostate cancer under a common genetic alteration in chromosome 8q24 that predisposes to urothelial tumors; the presence of this chromosome alteration may have a role in the increased risk for malignancies associated with prostate cancer. In addition, patients with prostate cancer are at an increased risk for other malignancies including renal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and urothelial cancer. This cohort will focus on evaluating the presence of concurrent gastrointestinal malignancies in men undergoing curative treatment for localized prostate cancer. The primary hypothesis is that the frequency and extent of concurrent gastrointestinal malignancies in this population are higher when compared to the general population.

The use of a trained clinical research coordinator to deliver the educational intervention ensures standardized delivery of information to all participants, regardless of their risk group or family history. This approach will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention in a real-world setting, regardless of patient characteristics. Furthermore, the comparison between the study group and the control group will help us to understand the impact of the educational intervention on genetic testing uptake even when patients have a different genetic predisposition, either through a positive family history or through their own genetic mutations. This will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the educational intervention and its applicability to different populations.

And how do you plan to evaluate the study endpoints? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Lung cancer is one of the top most morbidity causes and the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.. Early lung tumors (LTE) with a diameter of 1\u20103 cm have a very high risk of becoming malignant and are challenging to treat as well as difficult to diagnose. This paper outlines the study design of a Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of Padeliporfin Vascular Targeted Photodynamic Therapy (VTP) in patients with peripheral lung tumors (PLTs) who are at high risk of malignant neoplasms. Methods: The study will have two parts: Part A, a dose escalation/de\u2010escalation study which will employ a modified 3+3 design for Part A. Part B will evaluate the MTD and RP2D for Padeliporfin VTP therapy. We will enroll 14\u201036 patients in each of the Part A dosage stratum cohorts. Conclusion: VTP will be delivered through robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB), a technique that is increasingly being utilized in the evaluation and treatment of patients with lung nodules. The use of RAB is minimally invasive in diagnosis and treatment and can reduce morbidity and mortality. The study design will provide a novel approach to early lung tumors using VTP and may revolutionize the treatment of these tumors.",

The study will include all patients admitted to the surgery department at Stavanger University Hospital for urgent surgery due to colon perforation. The study is a quality assurance evaluation of the results of traditional and artificial intelligent radiographic imaging. The diagnosis of colon perforation is based on CT scan, ultrasound, contrast enemas, and surgical findings at surgery. In short, a small sample of water will be removed and examined for the presence of bacteria, using a new, digital and automated tool.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe study is a quality assurance evaluation of the diagnosis of perforated colon. Patients undergoing surgery for acute colon perforation are eligible for inclusion. 2-5 cm of colon will be sampled, to be examined for the presence of bacteria and other organisms. This study includes an additional and new quality assessment method, which is a digital, fast and precise detection method (Molecular Diagnostics). The traditional way of quality assurance in detecting a perforation is to open the abdominal cavity and examine visually whether there is a fluid pocket, which is considered a sign of a perforation in the wall of the colon. This method cannot be completed with absolute certainty due to the limited visibility of surgical areas, which may lead to undetected colon perforations. With the introduction of new and more advanced digital methods for radiography and artificial intelligence, it becomes easier to find a perforation in the patient's abdominal scan. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are living bacteria and other organisms in the lumen of the colon all the time, although it is unclear how far they move from the colon. In addition, it is unclear whether it is possible for bacteria to cross the digestive system wall and colonize it, or cause peritonitis. In this study, the aim is to investigate whether the digestive tract wall has been perforated, how far back into the gastrointestinal tract it went, and whether there are bacteria in the liquid from the gastrointestinal tract. This will be examined",

We hypothesize that this method will be able to detect differences in rates of bone formation in surgically treated spine fractures post-posterior decompression and posterolateral fusion. As part of this feasibility assessment, we will use the DEXA measurements to investigate if changes in bone metabolism are associated with improvements in subjective strength and functionality as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire. In addition, we will compare postoperative radiographic results on serial x-rays to determine if the novel method is accurate. Lastly, we will explore the relationship between subjective and objective measurements of bone healing (such as the SF-36).

And you plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial, correct? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nIn recent years, more and more attention has been paid to individual patient preferences, mainly focusing on providing patients with patient-specific information, such as presenting the probability of the occurrence of complications and the success rate of treatment alternatives in a simple and intelligible way. However, this approach has not been fully developed to support patients in making treatment decisions. For example, it is unclear how the preferences of cancer patients for the risk of recurrence after curative treatment of colon cancer compare to the recurrence risk reported in literature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to study what the preferred recurrence risk is, and how this risk can be communicated so that it can be easily understood by patients.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nClinicians Communication Preference for Recurrence Risk Information in Low Risk ColoRectal Cancer\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nColorectal Cancer\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Discussion\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients diagnosed with low-risk colorectal cancer (stages II-III) Patients who understand Dutch and are able to fill out questionnaires independently Patients without cognitive impairments (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score > 24 points) Patients who agree to participate in the study Exclusion Criteria: People who have been diagnosed with cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score < 24 points) People who are unable to provide consent themselves People who have been treated for colorectal cancer before\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nMinimum Age: 18 Years\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nAll\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n-----------------\nNo\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\nHow is the study designed?\n-----------------\n\nArms and Interventions\n\n| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |\n| --- | --- |\n| Colorectal cancer patients<br> | Other: Discussion<br>* Clinical consult about recurrence risk information<br>|",
            "Okay, excellent. Can you tell me whether you will conduct a blinded or a non-blinded study? \n\nAbstract:\nIt is becoming recognised by the public that there is a strong link between cancer and poor dietary intakes of fruit and vegetables. This view is not supported by strong evidence but by the fact that some fruits, including pomegranates, are known to affect genes involved in cancer development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of pomegranate supplementation on the expression of genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms. In a randomised, double\u2010blind placebo controlled parallel group study, 190 newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) patients consumed 2.5 mL concentrated pomegranate juice or a placebo daily for six months following surgery to obtain CRC specimens for microarray analysis. Microarray analysis was undertaken following the selection of differentially expressed genes using statistical software. In addition, candidate gene expression was confirmed using real time PCR. Overall, there was a significant reduction in gene expression of 22 genes in participants treated with pomegranate compared to those who consumed a placebo. Further analysis of these candidate genes showed that pomegranate treatment increased the expression of 12 genes involved in DNA repair pathways and decreased the expression of 10 genes involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. As pomegranate juice consumption could reduce tumour progression via modulation of various genes involved in cancer progression, it has considerable potential as a chemopreventive dietary agent for CRC.",

Now, could you please rate the participants' risk of bias and the overall risk of bias in your study? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Many studies on endothelial function in patients with hypertension exist on the basis of cross\u2010sectional evaluation. The data of these studies are scarce and of poor generalization potential. The aim is to assess the endothelial function in hypertensive patients receiving standard therapy and to evaluate the effect of calcium antagonists on endothelial function.METHODS: The study was conducted as a prospective, open, randomized, controlled, single\u2010blind, clinical study. We included 59 male patients with mild hypertension who were being treated with enalapril for at least 6 months. After the randomization, the patients received (i) enalapril and isradipine, standard therapy, ii) enalapril and the placebo, or (iii) isradipine and the placebo. The parameters evaluated included pulse wave velocity (PWV), intima\u2010media thickness, endothelin\u20101, soluble CD40 ligand, soluble ET receptors A and B, s-fms\u2010like tyrosine kinase activity, soluble P\u2010selectin, s\u2010E\u2010selectin, and adhesion molecules on endothelial cells \u2010 soluble intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101 (s\u2010ICAM\u20101) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (s\u2010VCAM\u20101).RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in initial values of PWV and other variables in the groups. As far as the mean changes in the PWV are concerned, in the group of enalapril, PWV decreased significantly (from 8.60 +/\u2010 0.77 to 8.04 +/\u2010 0.88 mm/s; p = 0.001), while on isradipine PWV increased significantly (from 8.19 +/\u2010 0.79 to 8.50 +/\u2010 0.77 mm/s; p = 0.001).

            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the HAIC-Reg-C cohort. This arm will involve patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma initially deemed unsuitable for radical therapy. They will receive combined HAIC, Regorafenib, and Tislelizumab as conversion therapy for downstaging. The HAIC procedure will be the same, and Regorafenib will be administered at a dose of 80mg daily. Tislelizumab will be given intravenously at a dose of 200mg every 2 weeks. What are your thoughts on this study arm? \nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and is often associated with a poor prognosis. Advanced liver cancer is difficult to treat, and the overall survival rate is low. Interventional therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and other treatments have been used in recent years to improve the effectiveness of HCC treatment. However, no single treatment can effectively eradicate HCC, and drug resistance is a major problem. Some patients who initially have favorable treatment responses will eventually relapse. In recent years, research has shown that the use of drugs to reduce drug resistance in HCC can improve the treatment outcome. This study aims to explore the efficacy of adding apatinib and camrelizumab (Apa\u2010Cam) to the treatment of advanced liver cancer, further providing reference for the treatment of advanced liver cancer. METHODS: This is a single\u2010center, single\u2010arm, open\u2010label, phase II clinical trial. A total of 18 participants with advanced liver cancer who meet the inclusion criteria and are taking apatinib plus camrelizumab will be recruited, and the primary endpoint is tumor response rate. The secondary endpoints include disease control rate, progression\u2010free survival rate, overall survival rate, adverse events, and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: By February 2021, a total of 36 participants had been included in the study, all of whom were over 18 years old, diagnosed with HCC, and received the treatment for two months. Among the 36 participants, 17 participants showed complete response and the average tumor response rate was 53.9%. After two months of treatment",

Let me know if you have any further suggestions. \n\nAbstract:\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with high recurrence rate and poor prognosis after radical resection or local therapies. Therefore, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and chemotherapy is an effective treatment for advanced HCC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab combined with regorafenib in the treatment of advanced HCC. We will also investigate the mechanism of action of this combination therapy. The primary endpoint is progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and toxicity. Patients with AFP\u2265400ng/ml, ECOG score 0\u20101, and BCLC stage B\u2010C will be enrolled and randomized to regorafenib alone (armA) or regorafenib plus nivolumab (armB)."

There was a significant decrease in the incidence of falls over the trial period and this was greater in those patients with the highest baseline fall risk. There was a significant reduction in the number of ADLs missed due to physical reasons following the intervention.

The incidence and prevalence of obesity is alarmingly increasing, as is the health impact of obesity and T2DM, both in adults and children. The prevalence of obesity has doubled between 1970 and 2014 globally in adults and in 2018, 2 billion adults were overweight or obese. In children and adolescents aged 5-19, 18.5%(overweight) and 13%(obese) in boys, 17.6%(overweight) and 13.5%(obese) in girls were reported In the UK in 2018. The BMI is an indicator of obesity and obesity prevalence has consistently increased over the years, both in adults and children. The 2022 report of the National Obesity Forum(NOF) showed that UK obesity prevalence is 27% in both males and females. Overweight and obesity is reported to have increased during Covid-19 pandemic. A report on the trend of the prevalence of obesity and the impact of lockdown restriction shows a more alarming scenario with a higher prevalence of obesity in both males and females. In 2018-2019, 62% of adults in the UK were overweight or obese. In 2021, the prevalence increased to 65% of adults with obesity. Data for adults aged 16-24 indicate an increase from 25.4% in 2018 to 31% in 2021. Similarly, for children and adolescents, the data shows a deterrent scenario. The prevalence of obesity in UK was 19% in 2018 and it increased to 24% by 2020-2021. The Covid-19 pandemic poses a serious health",

            "For the experimental arm, I recommend using the Cold EMR technique. This involves an initial submucosal injection of physiologic solution followed by 'piece-meal' resection using a plastic covered basket snare. This experimental arm will use the novel cold EMR technique, while the above-mentioned active comparator arm will serve as a reference point for the conventional hot EMR technique. The primary endpoint of the trial was complete resection of the target lesion at the initial procedure with the exception of specimen fragment retention. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground & Aims: Endoscopic resection of large colonic lesions is a relatively recent topic in the field of polyp endoscopic resection. Among several different endoscopic procedures, conventional hot EMR or en bloc endoscopic mucosal resection, remains the standard technique for the en\u2010bloc removal, regardless of the lesion endoscopic appearance or size. Hot EMR involves piece\u2010meal dissection and resection of the polyps, followed by ablation of the lateral and deep margins with an electrocoagulation probe. The aim of the study was to compare the feasibility of conventional Hot EMR and novel Cold EMR with respect to the specimen resection rate, complete resection rate, polyp sizes, lesion locations, number of endoscopic procedures, and hospital stay. Materials and Methods: This randomized trial was conducted in 100 patients who were randomly allocated to hot or cold EMR from May 2017 to September 2020 at a single institute. The primary endpoint was the complete resection of the target lesion at the first attempt with the exception of fragmenting, while maintaining feasibility within \u00b1\u200920% of previous studies. Results: A total of 180 lesions (102 lesions in the cold EMR group and 78 lesions in the hot EMR group) were included. The complete resection rate was significantly higher in the hot EMR group than in the cold EMR (96.2 vs. 89.1%, respectively). When the polyp sizes and lesion locations were analyzed, the complete resection rate in the hot EMR group was significantly higher in lesions larger than 20\u00a0mm (93.8% vs. 80.0%",

The intervention is a structured ACP session for older adults who have been chronically homeless that will utilize principles of facilitation and narrative gerontology. Participants in the intervention group will receive facilitated group sessions and participants in the control group will receive facilitated one to one sessions.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis will be the first feasibility study to examine the efficacy of a facilitated ACP intervention for older formerly homeless adults who currently reside in Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH). This intervention is needed as this population is at a greater risk of chronic, life-limiting illnesses than their housing-stable counterparts.

            "That makes sense. Can you tell me a bit more about the interventions that you plan to use? \n\nBrief summary in scientific language\n=================\nThe clinical problem is that most individuals with depression do not respond to an antidepressant after treatment for 8 weeks. Depression is a common disease that is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The consequences of depression include an increase in mortality, comorbidities, suicide, and reduced quality of life and work capacity. Although there are many available antidepressant drugs, 30-40% of individuals with depression experience inadequate treatment outcomes. Although the clinical practice guidelines recommend a switch to a different antidepressant if the first antidepressant fails after 8 weeks, there is uncertainty regarding an alternative when this option is not effective. The proposed solution to this problem is to target the pathophysiology of the disease. The hypothesis that we want to test is that cognitive biases associated with depression can help to predict medication response or lack thereof. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it will lead to an approach based on the underlying pathophysiology of depression, rather than trial and error, which will improve treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of treatment failure. This can also help to reduce costs. We propose a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether a psychological treatment that targets cognitive biases is more effective than a placebo in preventing relapse in MDD or BP. This trial also aims to explore whether the effect of this intervention is mediated by cognitive biases. \n\nBrief summary in easily understood language\n=================\nTreatment with antidepressant medications is a common treatment option for depression, but approximately one-third of individuals do not respond. This can lead to further research to find ways to improve treatment. Some of these approaches focus on finding the right medication for an individual, while others focus on understanding the causes of this lack of improvement. The proposed solution to this problem is to target the underlying mechanisms that are related to the disease and the medication. The investigators want to test if a psychological intervention that trains individuals to change their thoughts (cognitive biases) can improve the effectiveness of medication. \n\n\nHealth condition or problem studied\n=================\nICD10:: F32.2 - Recurrent moderate or severe depressive episode, current episode\nHealthy volunteers:: No Entry\n\n\nInterventions, Observational Groups",

DESIGN/METHODS: We evaluated 130 patients with ICH for clinical and laboratory characteristics, prognosis, and death causes. After obtaining informed consent, patients were randomized into four groups (n=32 each) for intravenous rosuvastatin (20 mg), oral rosuvastatin (20 mg), intravenous atorvastatin (20 mg), or oral atorvastatin (20 mg) as the first\u2010line drugs against ICH. The other two drugs served as the control. Serum lipid levels and inflammatory indicators were evaluated at T0 (on admission), T7, and T30 (at 7 and 30 d of treatment). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Barthel Index (BI) were assessed on admission and at 3\u2010 and 6\u2010mo after discharge. The 1\u2010, 3\u2010, and 6\u2010mo mortality and 2\u2010 and 6\u2010mo recurrent ICH were compared. RESULTS: The onboarding time of rosuvastatin groups was 12h shorter than in the atorvastatin groups (T0, p<0.05).

Pre\u2010block consists of injecting the local anesthetic solution between the skin and the subcutaneous tissue at the site of epidural needle puncture. In this study, we compared the effects of pre\u2010block with the traditional anesthetic techniques performed in the labor room before epidural analgesia.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective randomized study was conducted at the labor room of Benha University maternity hospital between October 2016 and February 2017. The study included 120 parturients. 60 parturients in each group were randomly assigned to pre\u2010block or a conventional anesthetic technique.RESULTS: Pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS) before puncture, after the epidural needle was inserted through the skin, after the epidural catheter had been inserted, and five minutes after the injection of the local anesthetic solution. At these four assessment times, pain was assessed in the conventional group and pre\u2010block group. The VAS scores for pain, post\u2010blocking nausea, and overall satisfaction levels were compared between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: For epidural analgesia, the pre\u2010block technique reduces pain compared to a conventional technique.

Although IPAP is associated with worse outcomes compared to those with uninfected AAP, including a worse mortality and longer hospital stays, this condition has remained challenging to diagnose in the acute setting of AP.\nThe diagnosis of IPAP and timely intervention within the first week of AP may potentially prevent worsening of disease severity, although no single method has proven superior in this regard.3,4 In the case of pancreatic necrosis, which develops in \u223c30% of cases, early assessment of pancreatic microbiota is critical.\nIn addition, early initiation of antimicrobial therapy has been shown to be essential in acute pancreatitis-associated necrotizing infection (APA-NI) due to the development of pancreatic gas gangrene, which is also associated with a significantly worse prognosis.5,6\nRapid improvement in molecular techniques and the introduction of multiplex next-generation sequencing (NGS) have greatly improved our understanding of bacterial communities in infected acute pancreatitis over the past decade.\n7\u201310\nNGS has since been applied widely to identify microorganisms and characterize their relationship to health and disease in many different biological samples.11,12\nWe believe that the time is right to apply NGS to a larger group of bacteremia patients with",

It may be that after a few days of high training volume, athletes would not be able to replace their energy stores (e.g. glycogen) through the amount of carbohydrates provided from their diet. Therefore, certain athletes may experience fatigue if the amount of carbohydrates provided from the diet is not enough for a number of days following training. Dietary strategies such as reducing the amount of carbohydrates in the diet while increasing the amount of fat may be beneficial for restocking energy stores (glycogen). We hypothesise that a diet low in carbohydrate with higher fat would be more effective in restoring glycogen (stored energy) in athletes following a heavy training period compared to a diet high in carbohydrate.Who can participate?You may be eligible to participate in this study if you:are a male athlete between 16 and 40 years of ageare able to maintain low-carbohydrate daily intakes, are in good health and do not have any chronic illness"

We developed a novel museum intervention in older adults with controlled AF, using mindful awareness and sensory stimulation. In older adults with AF, we hypothesize that the novel intervention will improve QoL, cognitive function, cardiovascular (CV) functions, as well as promote psychological well-being. The main objectives of this study are to: 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel museum intervention in older adults with controlled AF.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nWe developed the novel Museum Visit and Interactive Talk (MiVIT) intervention. It is a 2.8-hour museum intervention that utilizes mindful awareness and sensory stimulation to provide participants with experiential learning and social interactions. This museum intervention consists of two different experiences. It aims to promote positive feelings and sense of belonging, reduce loneliness in older adults, resulting in improved physical and mental health status. In the current study, we will recruit 40 participants and enroll them in either a control or an experimental group, with 20 participants in each group. The experimental group will receive the museum intervention in a pre-determined order to avoid bias, while the control group will receive the intervention in a reverse order. A third group (n=5) will not receive any type of intervention. All participants will be assessed on the primary and secondary outcomes at T0, T3 and T6. Assessments for T3 follow-up will be performed within 2 weeks after the first intervention for the experimental group and within one month after the intervention for the control group. Assessments for T6 will be performed 4 weeks after the intervention for both groups.

By focusing on patients who have received this specific treatment regimen as their first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC, the study can provide valuable insights into the outcomes of this combination therapy. Excluding patients with EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 variants ensures a more homogeneous patient population for analysis, allowing for more accurate assessment of the treatment's effects.",

This may include collecting data on the rate of intravesical recurrence, duration of recurrence-free survival, and overall mortality. To minimize bias, we should collect data consistently and follow a standardized protocol for data collection. We need to consider the time frame for data collection. It should be long enough to accurately assess the impact of the intervention on patient outcomes and short enough to avoid the risk of the disease progressing or the patients experiencing other complications. We need to consider the population size that will be required to achieve the desired precision in the estimates. We may need to conduct a power analysis or pilot a smaller sample size to test the feasibility of the study. We should define the statistical significance and define how we will interpret the results. We should also define the statistical methods for analyzing the data.

Objective. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PerQdisc Nucleus Replacement System in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with compressive radiculopathy. Methods. This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, non\u2010inferiority clinical trial. Adult patients with lumbar disc herniation with compressive radiculopathy were randomized into two groups. One group underwent routine discectomy (control group), and the other underwent disc\u2010height\u2010preserving nucleus replacement (experimental group).

Could you tell me more about this drug? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe study will be performed in the Outpatient Heart Failure Clinic at Mie University Hospital. Patients with heart failure will be recruited among those who visit the outpatient clinic. Patients will be randomly assigned to take or not to take the standard drugs (SGLT2 inhibitors, sGC stimulator, and ARNI).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body. The standard drugs for the treatment of heart failure include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and more recently sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. ARBs and SGLT2 inhibitors are used in the treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). SGLT2 inhibitors are believed to reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular causes and hospitalization for heart failure. The standard care for patients with heart failure includes the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. sGC stimulator (PDE5 inhibitor) is a new drug for the treatment of heart failure with preserved EF. ARNIs, which combine the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, have superior efficacy and safety. The use of ARNIs in the standard treatment of heart failure will have a significant impact on the morbidity and mortality of patients with heart failure. However, the mechanisms by which these drugs improve heart failure and other cardiovascular conditions are not well understood. The mechanisms of action of these drugs are also not well understood. It is therefore important to study the mechanisms of action of these drugs in order to improve the treatment of heart failure. This study will be the first of its kind in Japan and will provide important insights into the mechanisms of action of these drugs.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nImpact of SGLT2 Inhibitor, SGC Stimulator, and ARNI on Lithogenic Parameters in Heart Failure Patients\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHeart Failure:Reduced Ejection Fraction, Heart Failure:Preserved Ejection Fra",

The study will enroll up to 32 consecutive patients who agree to kidney biopsy and initiate SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground Sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLT), including 2 (SGLT2) and 9 (SGLT9) are expressed in the kidney. Both SGLT2 and SGLT9 inhibition have been shown to reduce filtration fraction by 10-15% which is not associated with any significant change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over 16 weeks in the setting of type 2 diabetes. In animal models, SGLT2 inhibitors have been found to reduce tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which may be a common target in the treatment of CKD. Thus, the primary specific aim of the proposed study will test if SGLT2 inhibition has any early effect on tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation, as early markers of kidney disease progression in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The second specific aim explores the possibility that SGLT2 inhibition may not increase the rate of decline in GFR. The tertiary aims investigate the effects of SGLT2inhibitors on podocyte function and endothelial function, which may be associated with decrements in kidney function. This is the first study to explore how SGLT2 inhibitors may affect kidney structure and kidney function in patients with HF.

In patients with a matched sibling donor, high\u2010dose methotrexate and cyclophosphamide were administered 24 hours before TP, and in patients without an HLA\u2010identical sibling, cytarabine and fludarabine were co\u2010given with TP. Cyclosporine and methotrexate were administered within 100 days after TP in both groups. The patients were randomized to receive disutis mali 300 mg every day from the day before TP for a total of 104 inpatient days or placebo until day 90. Results: The CTL rate was 76.7% in the disutis mali arm and 62.9% in the control arm, and there was no statistical difference between these two groups (P = 0.159). Acute GVHD was observed in only three cases without differences between the two groups. There were seven treatment\u2010related deaths in the disutis mali arm and four in the control arm. The 2\u2010year overall survival rate was 78.6%. The non\u2010relapse mortality rate was no significant difference between disutis mali and control arms, but the relapse\u2010free survival rate was significantly lower in the control arm (37.4%) than in the disutis mali arm (75.6%) (P =",

The intervention is the consumption of a low- and high-fat meal. The low-fat meal consists of bread, cheese, and sausage (348 kcal, 13.5g fat, 11.6 g protein, 36.3 g carbohydrates), while the high-fat meal consists of fat-rich sausage (393 kcal, 33.6 g fat, 14.2 g protein, 21.2 g carbohydrates).

Blood samples will be collected over 12 weeks.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study will investigate the albumin catabolic rate (ACR) in healthy adults, 25 years of age and older. ACR is a measure of how quickly albumin is broken down by the body. Albumin is the most abundant blood protein in humans, and its levels can drop due to various conditions such as severe burns, injuries or illnesses. It's important for the body to maintain adequate albumin levels as it plays a vital role in maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. Lower ACR can be an indication of systemic inflammation. In this study, we will assess ACR by administering a beverage containing 2H5-Phenylalanine, a stable isotope that is not harmful and is naturally occurring in our environment. A small number of participants will also receive a regular foodstuff containing the stable isotope labeled amino acid in addition to regular food. Blood samples will be collected over 12 weeks to determine albumin concentrations, ACR and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), an indicator of kidney function. Ultimately, the results of this study may help us understand more about diseases or metabolic disorders that might be associated with low ACR.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nStable Isotope-Labeled Phenylalanine Provides a Novel Method to Quantify Albumin Catabolic Rate and Assess Liver Function in Healthy Adults\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHuman, Kidney, Dysfunction, Liver Cirrhosis, Liver Disease, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, Hepatitis, Kidney Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Stable isotope labeled phenylalanine\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria",

However, the optimal ratio of local anesthetics is not yet determined. Although it is assumed that the optimal mixture of ropivacaine and bupivacaine has some anesthetic synergic effects, no studies have evaluated the effects of the different ratios of ropivacaine and bupivacaine on postoperative pain \n[7,8]. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of bupivacaine and ropivacaine mixture at different concentration on postoperative pain.\n2. Methods\nA total of 90 patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists I to III, aged over 20 years undergoing surgery under spinal anesthesia were recruited into this study. All surgeries were scheduled as elective surgery and were performed in the operating room over 14 months. Patients with a history of peripheral nerve disease or drug allergies were ineligible for this study.

Are there multiple arms or do all the participants get the same treatment? \n\nAbstract:\nIn 1993, the American Association of Health Plans reported results of a survey of 1,839 respondents with congestive heart failure. The question was asked in what setting patients first presented with congestive heart failure. Forty\u2010nine percent reported that their initial medical contact was in an emergency department (ED), and 52% reported that it was in an internist's or family physician's office. The study also showed that patients who saw a cardiologist first had a shorter delay between symptom onset and first medical contact than those with no delay. The patients receiving specialty care received a diagnosis of congestive heart failure more rapidly than those who were not treated by a cardiologist. These findings suggest that the sooner a cardiologist is consulted, the earlier the diagnosis and the more likely the use of appropriate treatment measures. The benefits of early diagnosis cannot be exaggerated because 2\u2010year survival rates for those diagnosed with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate heart failure average greater than 80%, whereas patients diagnosed with heart failure while presenting in advanced congestive heart failure have survival rates that are less than 50%.",

The cause of this condition is not well\u2010understood, and the treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Conservative treatment modalities include rest, antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention. This prospective, randomized, controlled study aimed to evaluate functional outcomes in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis treated with ultrasound therapy guided by electromyography\u2010triggered electrical stimulation and compare these results with those treated with ultrasound therapy and electrotherapy alone, or with extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT). Methods: A total of 48 patients suffering from chronic lateral epicondylitis were randomized into three groups in a prospective controlled trial. Group 1 was treated with ultrasound therapy guided by EMG\u2010triggered electrical stimulation; group 2 received ultrasound therapy and electrotherapy only and group 3 received ESWT. Clinical Evaluation: The patients were evaluated pretreatment and at 2 and 4 weeks after the first treatment. The assessment consisted of both subjective and objective evaluations, including Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) and Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) were used as objective measures. Results: No significant difference was observed between groups 1 and 2 (p\u2010value = 0.50, 0.17, respectively). This lack of difference was maintained at 4 weeks of follow\u2010up. The results obtained in the ultrasound therapy groups showed no difference compared with the ESWT group (p\u2010value = 0.81, 0.60, respectively). Conclusion: Ultrasound therapy guided",

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AND017 (epothilone) in treating cancer-related anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy. The study will involve two arms: experimental and control. Patients in the experimental arm will receive AND017, while patients in the control group will receive a placebo. The administration of AND017 will help stabilize red blood cells and prevent their destruction. The study will be conducted in three cycles, each consisting of 21 days. The study participants will be evaluated based on their hemoglobin levels at the beginning and end of each cycle, as well as blood counts. The main measure of success will",

For each arm, please note that the intervention/treatment includes 3 times weekly oral administration of the 400mg, 600mg, or 800mg dose of the drug AND017 for 4 weeks.\nIt's important to emphasize that this was an open-label study, meaning that both the healthcare professionals and participants were aware of the intervention that was being administered. This might have biased the results in favor of the intervention due to the placebo effect or other factors related to the expectation of treatment effectiveness. As such, the findings of the study should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, the study duration of 4 weeks was relatively short, which might have limited the ability to detect long-term efficacy and adverse events.\nIn conclusion, the study design and arms were focused on investigating the potential benefit of AND017 in managing anemia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The open-label nature of the study and the short study duration are potential limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results.\nThis information can now be used to guide future research and help inform clinical decision-making regarding the potential use of AND017 in this patient population.",

Do you also have any preliminary thoughts in mind about the study design, such as the duration and number of participants? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: Aflibercept (EYLEA) administered at a dosage of 2 mg was evaluated previously in adults with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (n = 754; VIVID Dosed Phase II Study) and has demonstrated efficacy in improving vision in this patient population. The present phase III study evaluated aflibercept at a lower 2\u2010mg dosage as well as two different dosage schedules of 2 mg over 52 weeks. Methods: In this multicenter, phase III, doublemasked, active\u2010controlled study, 501 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with monthly aflibercept 8 mg (n = 167), bi\u2010monthly aflibercept 8 mg (n = 165) or monthly aflibercept 2 mg intraocular injections. The end\u2010point measurewas the mean change from baseline visual acuity at study week 48. Results: The treatment groups were well balanced for demographic characteristics and baseline characteristics. At week 48 (primary study timepoint), all treatment groups showed marked improvements in best corrected visual acuity compared with baseline. The least squares mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity at 48 weeks was 13.9 letters for the monthly 2\u2010mg dose group, 15.8 letters for the monthly 8\u2010mg dose group, and 16.6 letters for the bi\u2010monthly 8\u2010mg dose group (all P < 0.001). The 8\u2010mg dose groups (both monthly and bi\u2010monthly) maintained significant improvements in visual acuity compared with baseline through week 52. Adverse events included conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, retinal vein occlusion, and eye infection. Conclusion: Both monthly and bi\u2010monthly dosing with aflibercept 2 and 8 mg provided sustained improvements in visual acuity and were generally well tolerated in patients with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion over 52 weeks.

Without a control arm, we cannot determine whether the observed differences between the study groups are due to the supplementation or other factors. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 3 months of aerobic exercise training during hospitalization on the immune function, clinical outcomes, and post\u2010hospitalization physical fitness of hospitalized children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using the Wii Fit balance board. Materials and Methods: The study included 20 hospitalized boys aged 5\u201017 years diagnosed with ALL who were randomly assigned to a control (n = 10) or exercise intervention (n = 10) group. Results: The groups, in terms of patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, were similar. No clinically significant differences were observed between the groups regarding their serum concentrations of C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), IgG, IgA, and IgM. Although there was no difference between the groups in terms of hemoglobin and hematocrit values, the leukocyte and platelet counts as well as neutrophil values were significantly higher in the control group compared to the intervention group. In addition, although there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of Karnofsky Performance Status scores, body composition measurements and physical fitness tests before the intervention, at the end of the intervention, the patients in the exercise intervention group had higher physical fitness results (p=0.035), and they were found to have lost body weight, fat mass, total body water and had decreased body mass index. Conclusions: During hospitalization, physical fitness training with the Wii Fit was well tolerated by hospitalized children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and was associated with improved physical fitness and reduced body weight and fat mass. In the future, prospective studies should investigate the efficacy of long\u2010term inpatient physical fitness training on immune system function and clinical outcomes in hospitalized children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

What was the rationale for choosing this type of experimental design? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nTo assess the safety of prophylactic antibiotics in patients at high risk of surgical site infection after elective colorectal cancer surgery in a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nFollowing recruitment of 4000 patients in the CRYO study and randomisation of 3500, the rate of surgical site infection will need to be assessed against historic control rates. These are available for both NHS and non-private providers, and are both close to 5% with no obvious differences between them. Given the lack of any substantial benefits (and increased costs) seen in the CRYO study, a simple difference of 1% between the study arms seems unlikely. However, if this were to occur then it would represent an improvement of 40% of control rates. Thus, a sample size of 4000 patients (2000 per arm) will be required to detect this with a power of 80% and 2-sided alpha of 0.05. Assuming 10% attrition (e.g. censoring due to withdrawal of consent, lack of access to medical records, death of patient prior to discharge), and a total recruitment time of 18 months, this amounts to a recruitment rate of 60patients/month. In each of 20 NHS and 20 private hospitals, the rate of consented patients should be at least one per week, if resources and infrastructure permits.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Phase 3 Randomised Non-Inferiority Study in the Safety of the GORE\u00ae SYNECOR Intraperitoneal Biomaterial When Used as a Surgical Site Infection Prophylaxis in Colorectal Cancer Patients in High Risk For Infection\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nColorectal Cancer, Postoperative Wound Infection\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: cefuroxime\n* Drug: intraperitoneal saline\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria:",

In a recent retrospective study, our group observed that the rate of permanent hypothyroisim is higher after completion thyroidectomy than after lobectomy. It is not clear whether this phenomenon is due to damage to the thyroid remnant during completion thyroidectomy.

When present, the condition can be treated medically, since its most common cause is autoimmune thyroiditis secondary to resection-induced thyroid tissue damage. It is considered fully reversible in most cases. After this form of thyroiditis has healed, a permanent need for levothyroxine is very rare. The study hypothesis is that an increased rate of post-surgical hypothyroidism is related to the removal or destruction of the thyroid during completion thyroidectomy rather than to the autoimmune process linked to the development of thyroiditis. This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that some normal thyroid tissue remains after thyroid lobectomy, or by the difference between the anatomical and the functional thyroid remnants left after completion thyroidectomy. It is not clear whether this phenomenon is due to damage to the thyroid remnant during completion thyroidectomy or to the lack of normal thyroid tissue left after lobectomy for multinodular goiters with benign adenomatous nodules.

            "Thank you for the description. Now, let's move on to the second study arm. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\n\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nWe are conducting a study to investigate the impact of commercial native starch and processed starch on postprandial glycemic control in healthy adults compared with glucose. The current literature on starch processing and postprandial glucose management is weak, and our study aims to address this gap through a controlled trial in healthy adults. Our research objective is to determine whether processing native starch through extrusion, as done in the commercial marketplace, has a clinically meaningful impact on glycemic control measured postprandially in healthy individuals. Furthermore, we aim to evaluate whether commercial processing can attenuate postprandial glycemic spikes, and whether starch processing affects the gut microbiome and acute fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nWe will conduct a parallel crossover randomized clinical trial of healthy adults investigating the glycemic responses to two starch formulations as a function of extrusion-based processing. This will be a proof-of-concept study in which glucose, insulin, and SCFA concentrations will be measured as surrogate markers for starch digestion, absorption and gut microbiome activity in a fasted and postprandial state. Participants will consume a standardized meal mixed with 1.5 g/kg body mass of corn starch in one of two forms: commercial and raw. On two separate occasions, 12 to 18 hours apart, each participant will receive both starch formulations in random order. Fasting and postprandial blood samples will be collected over 3 hours, and fecal samples will be collected over 96 hours, including 48 hours after the last meal.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nImpact of Commercial Native vs. Raw Starch on Postprandial Glycemic Control, Gut Microbiome, and SCFAs in Healthy Adults\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nNon-Communicable Disease, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Native Starch\n* Other: Modified Starch\n\n\nPart",

Methods: The study was a prospective, randomized, comparative case series. Thirty patients with macular edema associated with diabetic retinopathy were randomly assigned to receive a single 0.4 mg intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide or 3 injections 1 month apart or 6 at a time interval of 1 month. Clinical examinations were performed at 1\u2010, 2\u2010, and 3\u2010month follow\u2010ups. The primary outcome measures were change in central macular thickness (CMT) after 60 days and adverse effects. Results: The mean time from baseline to the last follow\u2010up visit was 122 \u00b1 25 days. All patients completed the study. Mean CMT in the 1\u2010month interval group was 165 \u00b1 24 \u03bcm (P = .05), in the 3\u2010month interval group was 166.67 \u00b1 25.67 \u03bcm (P = .001), and in the 6\u2010month interval group was 153.4 \u00b1 29. \u03bcm (P = .002). There were significant differences among these groups. Visual acuity after 120 days showed a trend toward improvement in all groups: 1\u2010month interval group, + 0.52 \u00b1 2.6; 3\u2010month interval group, + 3.89 \u00b1 2.98; and the 6\u2010month interval group, + 4.83 \u00b1 3. Adverse reactions included intraocular pressure increase, glaucoma, and cataract. Conclusions: Results show that intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide therapy is more beneficial when the injection interval is gradually increased in patients with DME.

            "Very interesting. How will the exercise program be implemented? Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Although the addition of radiation therapy after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NSCT) leads to more favorable survival outcomes in women with breast cancer, it can increase the risk of local toxicity. PURPOSE: The aim of this analysis was to assess the role of the addition of postoperative radiotherapy in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST).METHODS AND MATERIALS: This randomized phase III study enrolled patients with breast cancer who were eligible for surgical treatment. There were 424 patients in the radiation therapy group and 412 in the no\u2010radiation group in each cohort. A propensity score methodology was used to control treatment\u2010related effects; patients were matched by risk\u2010of\u2010relapse score and estrogen receptor status.RESULTS: The survival curve analysis of the entire study population showed no difference between the experimental and control groups at the 15\u2010year follow\u2010up (7% vs 10%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73\u20102.03; P = .43). In a stratified analysis by low\u2010 and high\u2010risk grouping with the 15\u2010year disease\u2010free survival rate as the primary outcome variable, we found that the radiation therapy group had a better survival outcome than the control group (disease\u2010free survival rate of 32.7% vs 23%, respectively [HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05\u20101.97; P = .03) and better overall survival rate than the control group (hazard ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.07\u20101.87; P = .02). However, the addition of postoperative radiotherapy was associated with more acute and late adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: After neoadjuvant systemic therapy, postoperative radiation therapy may be considered an option for high\u2010risk patients. In the low\u2010risk group, no obvious benefit was observed by the administration of radiation therapy.",

However, it is unclear whether antibiotics improve outcomes, and the practice may contribute to the increased risk of antibiotic resistance. In a randomized control trial, we evaluated if oral surgeon residents would benefit from using prophylactic antibiotics during third molar surgery.METHODS: We included 58 patients with mandibular third molars for removal by dental residents in a randomized double\u2010blind two\u2010arm trial. We compared the amount of pain, swelling and function of mandible with antibiotics administered postoperatively. The primary outcome of the study was pain experienced at 3\u201015 months postoperatively. The intervention group was administered 500 mg amoxicillin and 500 mg clarithromycin once postoperatively.RESULTS: There was no difference in pain or other parameters between the groups during the first 4 weeks postoperatively. Our results show that pain experienced postoperatively has a mean score of less than 1 on a numeric scale of 0 to 10, and pain is not statistically significant from baseline at any time point.CONCLUSION: We did not find any beneficial effect of antibiotic prophylaxis after third molar surgery on either pain, swelling or function. The effect of antibiotics on pain was minimal and short\u2010lived and did not benefit surgical patients.PRACTITIONER'S POINT: We conclude that there is no indication for antibiotic prophylaxis after third molar surgery.",

By injecting hyaluronic acid into the implant socket before implantation, the researchers can assess if this method is more effective in pain reduction compared to traditional treatment. This arm allows for a direct comparison between the use of hyaluronic acid and no intervention.\n\n2. No Intervention: Traditional treatment\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants in this group will undergo traditional treatment without any additional intervention such as hyaluronic acid injection.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: N/A\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as the control group to compare the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid injection. By not injecting any material into the implant socket, researchers can evaluate the natural course of post-implantation pain and compare it to the experimental group. This arm is necessary to assess the true impact of hyaluronic acid on pain relief in this clinical trial setting.",

In patients with HF, AF is independently associated with an increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity rate. Atrial arrhythmia burden is a significant prognostic factor for CVDs and death in HF. Hypothermia, particularly core temperature <36\u00b0C, is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in patients with HF. AF was recently shown to be associated with 6.7% increased odds of hypothermia in HF patients. The prognostic and pathophysiological roles of hypothermia and AF in patients with HF have not been fully elucidated. AF-related factors, including neurohormonal activation and inflammation, may be a cause of hypothermia in HF; however, the potential role of hypothermia in AF triggering in patients with HF remains unclear. It is unknown whether hypothermia alters the severity of AF and its associated factors, including neurohormonal activation and inflammation, in patients with HF.

It involves scoring the extent of visible damage to the corneal epithelium in the form of staining. Corneal staining scores will be graded on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of damage. A higher score means a worse outcome. The outcome is measured using slit-lamp examination and flourescein staining. The mean corneal staining score will be calculated by averaging the staining scores across four quadrants of the eye. | 12 months | \n| Change from baseline in the Schirmer's test scores at 12 months | Schirmer's test evaluates the amount of tears produced by the eye in a specific time period. The test involves placing a special strip of paper in the lower eyelid which is then removed after 5 minutes. The length of paper wetness is a measure of tear secretion, with shorter lengths indicating a lower tear secretion. A higher score means a worse outcome. | 12 months | \n| Change from baseline in the conjunctival lymph flow rate at 12 months | The conjunctival lymph flow rate is a measure of tear drainage. This test involves placing a small clip on the eyelids to inhibit drainage and then administering a fluorescein dye in the eye. The amount of drainage that occurs in a specific time period is then measured using a special camera. A higher score means a worse outcome. | 12 months | \n| Change from baseline in the Oxford grading scale at 12 months | The Oxford grading scale is a comprehensive assessment method that includes evaluation of symptoms, signs, and tear film features, to determine the severity of dry eye disease.

Thirty volunteers (15 males and 15 females) were recruited. The volunteers were randomly divided into 2 groups: passive heating (PH) and control group (CG). The PH group used the heating device during inactivity. The CG consisted of static stretching on quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteal muscles, followed by 5\u2010minutes of lying on a bed in a room with a constant temperature of 22\u00b12\u2103. Before and after the intervention, a thermal sensitivity test, heart rate (HR) and peripheral peripheral skin temperature (Tsk) were measured in both groups. Muscle temperature was measured in both legs and thighs of lower limbs as the main outcome variable. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Bonferroni post\u2010hoc or Student t\u2010test. The results showed that Tsk value was higher in the PH group (p<0.05). The heart rate decreased after the intervention in the PH group compared to before the intervention (p<0.05). In the CG, muscle temperature was not significantly different compared to before the intervention (p>0.05). Vessyl Heat Wave\u00ae may increase blood circulation, improving overall blood microcirculation during bedrest (cooling). As a result, the heart rate decreases due to a decrease in body temperature. Therefore, the PH group is recommended for nursing care environments to maintain the temperature of bedridden patients.",

One hundred and ninety four subjects with rheumatoid arthritis with symptom duration between 12 and 24 months were randomized to treatment with sulfasalazine and methotrexate (n = 110), or with placebo (n = 84). The main outcome measure was functional disability, measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire. We analysed data in a multivariable regression model with disability as the outcome after 1 and 2 years.RESULTS: Of the patients, 20% were on methotrexate monotherapy, 8% on sulfasalazine monotherapy, and 26% on both. In the multivariable model we included disease activity, and the following variables: baseline age, female gender, high educational level, and smoking. For all patients we found that education, disease activity, and female gender were independent predictors of disability at 12 months, with female gender having the greatest detrimental effect (OR = 4.2 (1.5, 12.0)). After 24 months we found that education, disease activity and smoking still showed independent prognostic value, but female gender no longer did.CONCLUSION: We conclude that female gender is a strong predictor of functional disability at 12 months, while in the longer term, education, disease activity, and smoking are important determinants of disease evolution. 2004 The Author(s)."

Blood pressure measurements, routine laboratory assessment, and determination of carbohydrate\u2010induced glucose metabolism were done at baseline and after 3 months of intervention. Results: It is well known that chronic inflammation is related to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Hesperetin, catechin, and carnosic inhibit the production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and ROS (reactive oxygen species) activity. The activity of \u03b1\u2010amylase and \u03b1\u2010glucosidase, which affect carbohydrate metabolism in the body, were reduced in the treatment group. A significant increase in the antioxidant enzyme activity, the levels of nitric oxide ( NO), and insulin sensitivity index is reported.

Typical treatment plans for radioembolization of pancreatic cancer with Yttrium-90 microspheres involve a single injection session with a maximum of 50 Gy administered per session. However, since the Intratumoral device can deliver the radiation more directly to the tumor tissue, we may need to adjust the dosage and session frequency accordingly. The maximum tolerated dosage for holmium-166 microspheres is not well established yet, but we may start with a dosage of around 7 to 11 Gy per session and adjust it based on the patient's response and tolerance.

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe use of ketamine to treat anxiety in schizophrenia is a relatively new area. Many patients with schizophrenia and psychosis experience significant distress from anxiety symptoms, with many patients unable to benefit from a standard SSRI treatment. Ketamine has been studied in acute treatment of anxiety in this patient population, but we need to better understand whether such benefits are sustained. Therefore, we plan to examine the effects of low-dose (0.2 mg/kg) weekly ketamine treatment in patients suffering with schizophrenia and anxiety.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPsychosis and/or bipolar disorder is frequently accompanied by anxiety, which is associated with functional impairment and poor outcomes. Anxiety has been consistently shown to be an enduring feature of schizophrenia, with an incidence of 30% in early phases of psychosis (Strawn et al., 2017). In fact, anxiety is often a better predictor of functional outcomes than psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and positive delusions (Gelkopf, Leweke, & Zohar, 2013). Additionally, patients with anxiety and poor functioning are also at an increased risk for the development of psychosis and other severe mental illness later in life (Goodman et al., 2011). Importantly, many anxiety symptoms have been shown to persist in psychosis despite normalization of delusions and hallucinations after treatment with antipsychotic medications (Perry et al., 2015). Further, treatment with antipsychotics can increase anxiety and the rate of dropouts in psychotic patients, suggesting a need for complimentary approaches (Perry et al., 2015). Therefore, new strategies to treat anxiety in patients with schizophrenia are urgently needed. Ketamine has emerged as a novel and potentially promising treatment for anxiety, as there is a growing body of literature in support of its efficacy and safety in this population of patients (Mortensen & Farahbakhsh, 2018). Although the use of ketamine as a therapeutic agent for major depressive disorder is well documented (Berman et al., 2000), multiple studies have also shown that a single intr",

This study aims to determine if treatment-as-usual approach for the treatment of alcohol use disorders in Canada, that has been proven effective for moderate-to-severe alcohol use disorders, will be as effective when provided in a virtual environment.The primary object of this pragmatic cohort study will therefore be to: (a) Estimate the effectiveness of the Intensive Virtual Treatment for alcohol use disorders. (b) Identify predictive factors regarding individual treatment response and (c) Determine whether virtual treatment is equally effective in different types of participants.For the first objective, it is proposed to compare the number of consecutive days of alcohol abstinence over the 28-day period prior to the trial and at 1-year after the trial.

To alleviate pain and improve healing in non-healing wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous ulcers (VU), medical professionals often need to resort to topically applied, invasive and time-consuming treatments. In this study we develop a safe, non-invasive method to deliver an advanced and innovative therapeutic system directly within the wound tissue. Hereby our goal is to reduce wound related pain and to enable enhanced wound healing, by precisely controlled delivery of pharmaceutical molecules into the wound tissue of diabetic wounds. This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy of a wound healing system based on an active substance, nanocapsulations and electrostimulation on diabetic wounds. To test the effects, the study will compare patient groups treated with the advanced wound dressing to placebo and conventional dressings. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that wounds heal faster, and that the wound associated pain is reduced, when compared to placebo and conventional dressings. The primary study objective is therefore, to compare the time to healing of diabetic wounds treated with the wound healing system (WH-sys) in relation to conventional wound dressings. The secondary study objective is to examine any difference in wound related pain of diabetic wounds treated with the WH-sys in relation to conventional wound dressings.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Phase 2, Multi-center, Prospective, Blinded, Randomized, Crossover Study, Comparing the Time to Healing of Non-healing Diabetic Wounds Treated With and Without Electrostimulation of Nanocapsules\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDiabetes, Venous Ulcers, Diabetic Foot Ulcers, Wound Healing Disorder\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Novaspectra\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: 18-85 years old Has both feet Exclusion Criteria:",

Introduction\nNeuroblastoma is a cancer that affects infants and children, and it is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. It develops from immature cells in the sympathetic nervous system, which is part of the autonomic nervous system . Neuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most commonly found in the adrenal glands, neck, chest, and spine . Patients with neuroblastoma are typically diagnosed at a young age, with most cases occurring before the age of 5.\nThe standard treatment for patients with neuroblastoma consists of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. The goal of treatment is to shrink the tumor and kill the cancer cells.\nThe National Cancer Institute has classified neuroblastoma into different stages depending on the severity of the disease and the likelihood of achieving a complete response to treatment. This classification system is based on several factors, including the location of the tumor, the age of the patient, and the extent of the tumor.\nHigh-risk patients have a poor prognosis and are at a higher risk of relapse after initial treatment. This group of patients requires more aggressive treatment, such as intensive chemotherapy, stem cell transplants, radiation therapy, or other targeted therapy . Despite advances in treatment, the overall survival rate for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma is still low, highlighting the need for more effective therapies .\nNaxitamab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the disialoganglioside (GD2) antigen, which is expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma cells. It has been shown to have antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against neuroblastoma cells . GM-CSF, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, is a protein that stimulates the growth and differentiation of immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, which can also have antitumor activity. It is commonly used as a supportive therapy in patients receiving",

The first one is primary surgical tumor resection with anastomosis or only tumor resection without anastomosis. The intervention/treatment for this arm is primary tumor resection. This arm is crucial as it represents the standard approach for treating obstructive left colon cancer. It allows for the comparison between patients undergoing primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis or without an anastomosis (Hartmann's procedure).

In each study, researchers will find the highest tolerable dose of AKL-T04 in people who have been treated before or whose blood disease has come back (relapsed). In the relapsed study, a total of 54 patients will be enrolled; in the relapsed/refractory study, the 18 patients will be enrolled. T04 will be given by intravenous (IV) infusion (an injection through a thin flexible tube into a vein) at doses ranging from 0.3 to 3 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight per hour for a maximum of 12 continuous hours for six consecutive days or seven continuous hours per day for six consecutive days. On Day 7, patients who have completed AKL-T04 are followed until the end of the treatment phase of the study.

This would provide a reference point for understanding the clinical significance of elevated Vasorin levels in patients with septic shock and AKI. \n\nAbstract:\nObjectives: To assess the value of early sepsis\u2010related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (the primary outcome) and new score predicting septic shock (SAPS III score, the secondary outcome) (as well as procalcitonin (PCT), the exploratory outcome) as predictors of mortality over the entire ICU stay in septic patients. Methods: Data from over 2000 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with sepsis were analysed. Using a retrospective cohort analysis, the impact of the new SOFA score was studied in comparison with the standard SOFA score and the SAPS III score. Afterwards, patients were randomly divided into three strata of high, medium and low severity of illness (with mortality rate > 30%, 20\u201030% and 0\u201010%, respectively) on the first day for the development of mortality predictive scores based on admission data which were combined with 4\u2010h lactate measurement. Results: Patients with high, medium and low predicted mortality had a mortality rate of 68.29% vs. 25% vs. 0%, with a respective mortality risk ratio of 1\u2010severity score of 2.56 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39 to 4.71). 4\u2010h lactate measurement predicted mortality independently of severity of illness, adding prognostic information to the severity score (p < 0.0001). Combined sepsis\u2010related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, SAPS III score and lactate value predicted mortality in a more accurate way than admission\u2010only admission scores. Conclusion: A combined model based on sepsis\u2010related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, SAPS III score and 4\u2010h lactate measurement is more accurate in predicting mortality over the entire ICU stay than admission\u2010only scores.

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of young coconut water, dark chocolate bar, and Ibuprofen in reducing the intensity of primary dysmenorrhea. Methods: A prospective, randomized, open\u2010label study was conducted in 30 female undergraduate students aged between 17 and 24 years who were diagnosed with primary dysmenorrhea. The patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 received young coconut water, Group 2 received a dark chocolate bar, and Group 3 received Ibuprofen. The primary outcome was the intensity of menstrual pain, measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) scored from 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most severe pain imaginable. The differences between the groups' VAS scores were compared using a multivariate covariance analysis adjusted for age, study group, and menstrual cycle phase. Results: There was no significant difference in the menstrual pain intensity between Group 1 and Group 2, but a significant difference was found between Group 2 and Group 3.

What ideas do you have for the participant group/arm and intervention/treatment? \n\nAbstract:\nObjective: Osteoporosis is a common clinical problem, affecting up to 20% of the population. It causes one in three hip fractures and one in five vertebral fractures, with significant morbidity and mortality. Although current therapies are effective in many cases, they have important limitations related to side effects, cost and lack of effect in certain patients (e.g. those with predominantly vertebral fractures or those with multiple vertebral fractures despite therapy). It is therefore imperative that new treatments are found, and in particular, an agent that is affordable. MAPK pathway inhibitors have already yielded beneficial effects for the treatment of cancers and may also be beneficial for osteoporosis. MAPK pathway kinase inhibition also produces loss of bone mass. This could potentially lead to adverse effects on bone formation, resulting in a negative effect on bone health. However, the loss of bone mass is not necessarily related to loss of bone quantity, density or fracture risk (i.e. secondary hyperparathyroidism), and in some cases, it may reduce bone resorption without reducing bone density (osteomalacia). Such therapeutic strategies appear to be preferable for individuals who are at risk of severe fractures but have normal or near\u2010normal bone mass, bone mass density, fracture risk or overall bone health. The aim of the current study is to determine if sotorasib reduces bone resorption in healthy males, and if a higher dose results in superior efficacy. Methods This will be a phase 1b, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, 38\u2010day study (with 35\u2010day follow\u2010up) of sotorasib in healthy male subjects, 18 to 55 years of age.

In patients with prior TIA or stroke, anticoagulants and aspirin are often prescribed to prevent stroke recurrence. However, anticoagulants increase the risk of haemorrhagic complications in the brain. Aspirin treatment is associated with dyspepsia, ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, aspirin monotherapy is not recommended in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation and history of stroke, while anticoagulant treatment is contraindicated in high-risk situations. This study will verify whether the safety and feasibility of using Chinese herbal medicine for prevention of stroke recurrence in these patients. Previous studies have shown that Chinese herbal medicine with anti-platelet effect could increase blood flow to the brain and decrease the risk of stroke by increasing the blood pressure in the brain. Chinese herbal medicines such as Danshen and Tianqingkang were shown to reduce the thickness of the capillary in the brain and improve platelet function. In this study, we will evaluate the effects of Chinese medicine on the safety and feasibility of using Chinese medicine in the prevention of stroke recurrence in patients with prior TIA or stroke who are currently taking anticoagulants.

METHODS: 1. Study Design: This was a double blinded, randomized controlled trial. Three sessions of BoNT\u2010injections were performed with three different substances (Botox, Dysport and placebo) for the study participants. In order to evaluate the subjective improvement of gait pattern with BoNT\u2010injections, a questionnaire survey was conducted before and after the three sessions of injections. Two raters also evaluated static equilibrium and gait pattern in a blinded fashion using an online video analysis program. Participants who were not diagnosed with cerebellar disorders prior to participation in our study were included in the control group. These individuals underwent a baseline evaluation at our facility but did not use the study drug and therefore, did not receive BoNT\u2010injections. RESULTS: Thirty\u2010seven patients with CA were included in the study. The mean age was (63.7 \u00b1 8.7) years. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics such as age and sex. The control group did not change in regard to static equilibrium and gait pattern from the baseline through week 12. When the study period (pre\u2010 and post\u2010three sessions of BoNT\u2010injection) was compared as a whole, the following findings were obtained: (1) There were no significant differences noted with a questionnaire survey prior and after three sessions of BoNT\u2010injection, and no significant differences were noted for any of ratings in static equilibrium. (2) Statistically significant differences were not noted between Dynamic Movement Syndrome Rating Scale (DMSRS) and the Tinetti Gait item among the 3 BoNT\u2010injection types. Intrarater and interrater reliability analysis revealed good\u2010to\u2010excellent reliability for all items. CONCLUSION: This study was successful in performing a blinded evaluation of the three BoNT\u2010in",

Experimental: real-rTMS\nParticipant Group/Arm: This arm includes individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease who will undergo real repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) sessions.\nIntervention/Treatment: The intervention involves 4 daily 25-minute high-frequency rTMS sessions over one week using a 70-mm figure-eight coil at 20Hz. Target localization will be performed with a stereotaxic neuronavigation system.\nReasoning: This arm is essential to test the efficacy of non-invasive stimulation techniques, specifically real rTMS, in modulating the default mode network (DMN) in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. By targeting this specific population with a known genetic risk factor for AD, the study aims to assess the potential benefits of this intervention in early stages of the disease.\n\n2. Sham Comparator: sham-rTMS\nParticipant Group/Arm: This arm serves as the control group in the study.\nIntervention/Treatment: Participants in this arm will undergo 4 daily 25-minute sham-rTMS sessions over one week, where the sham condition will mimic the real rTMS protocol but with a sham coil.\nReasoning: The inclusion of a sham comparator arm is crucial to establish the efficacy of the real rTMS intervention. By comparing the outcomes of the experimental arm with the control arm, researchers can determine whether the observed effects are due to the specific intervention or simply a placebo effect. This design helps ensure the validity and reliability of the study results.",

            "Certainly. The experimental treatment involves the use of tumor treating fields (TTFields) through the NovoTTF-200T portable system. The system consists of a generator and the transducer arrays that deliver the TTFields. The generator is worn outside the body, providing a low-intensity, intermediate frequency (150-200 kHz) electric field to the tumor site. The transducer arrays, which are placed on the skin with the assistance of ultrasound guidance, generate the electric field, which is delivered directly to the tumor. The electrical current in the field is thought to alter the microtubule formation within the tumor cells, leading to a reduction in their reproductive capacity and ultimate necrosis of the cells. \n\n\nI'd also suggest adding the information about the frequency and duration of the TTFields treatment. What is the duration of the TTFields treatment? \n\n\nThe TTFields treatment will be given for a duration of 18-24 hours per day, 7 days per week, for 2-6 months or until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or any other reason. The patients will also receive digital photographic documentation of the placement of the transducer arrays on their body, which will be taken before and after the TTFields treatment. \n\n\nThanks for the additional information.

Data will be monitored according to predetermined criteria. The committee will evaluate all non\u2010routine, unexpected adverse events (AEs) and suspected adverse reactions that potentially relate to Nesina and its excipients, for which AEs or suspected adverse reactions occur in more than 10% of study patients, or in patients under 18\u2009years of age (all dose levels), or in the event of a serious AE that potentially relates to Nesina, or that is serious in and of special interest to the pediatric population. Further, the committee will evaluate significant changes in ECG parameters, vital signs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests in clinical studies that occur in >10% of study patients (all dose levels), or in patients under 18\u2009years of age, or in the event of serious AE that potentially relates to Nesina. The committee will evaluate potential changes in ECG parameters, vital signs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests in clinical studies in the pediatric population. In clinical studies in which new safety information emerges, the committee will assess and review the data in a timely manner and recommend appropriate modification(s) of the study. Clinical study reports will be presented to the committee for each clinical study in which new safety information emerges or the number of study patients who experience an AE or suspected adverse reaction increases significantly. The committee will review each clinical study report and will make recommendations with respect to Nesina and its excipients, based on a balanced interpretation of the new information, the characteristics of the clinical study, and a review of the relevant literature. The committee may also discuss relevant information on relevant marketed products. The committee will not consider any administrative, scientific, or legal aspects other than safety.

Donor specific anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) antibodies (DSA) are a known risk factor for TRALI and transfusion-related acute lung injury, leading to reduced patient outcomes. This is problematic since in Europe and especially Italy, there is still a high rate of incompatibility at the ABO group. A study conducted in the 1990s showed that using A-A blood in ABO compatible transplants decreased the risk of TRALI and TRALI-associated complications at 15 days. It also enhanced survival at 15 days. In addition to lowering the risk of TRALI, the use of A-A blood is more cost-effective in the context of transplantation. However, this previous evidence was solely based on adult donors and was collected before the blood storage procedures were modified. In addition, the use of A-A",

            "Abstract:\nBackground: Early detection of pancreatic cancer (PC) offers a chance for curative treatment. In resectable PC, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) has been shown to be safe and feasible. However, LDP may not be suitable for some patients. Laparoscopic radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (LRAMPS) is a less invasive technique for resection of early\u2010stage left\u2010sided PC, which is a potentially curable approach to patients with pancreatic head and uncinate tumors and those who are candidates for central pancreatectomy. However, few studies have investigated LRAMPS for early\u2010stage left\u2010sided PC. The aim of our study was to compare the perioperative outcomes of LRAMPS and LDP in patients with early\u2010stage left\u2010sided PC. Methods: This study is a single\u2010center, prospective, comparative study including patients with early\u2010stage left\u2010sided PC who underwent LRAMPS or LDP from November 2018 to May 2022. The primary outcomes were conversion to open surgery and surgical complications. The secondary outcomes included operation time, operating cost, length of hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss, pathological tumor size, and tumor staging. Results: 21 patients were excluded because they declined or failed to participate, whereas 86 patients were included (49 males, 37 females; Median age 60 years, range 34\u201085 years). 43 patients underwent LRAMPS and 43 patients underwent LDP. The characteristics and perioperative outcomes of the two groups were compared. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of age, sex, body mass index, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, conversion to open surgery, pathological tumor size, tumor staging, or surgical complications. However, there was a significant difference in operating costs between the two groups (P=0.015). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary data on the feasibility and safety of LRAMPS for early\u2010s age left\u2010sided PC and compares perioperative outcomes with LDP.

            "Excellent job! Here are the full study arms:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. Experimental: Colchicine\n- Participant Group/Arm: Experimental: Colchicine\n- Intervention/Treatment: Patients in this arm will receive colchicine starting from the evening before the surgical procedure until the third postoperative day, following a specific dosing schedule.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator: Control (Placebo)\n- Participant Group/Arm: Placebo Comparator: Control (Placebo)\n- Intervention/Treatment: Patients in this arm will undergo the same perioperative procedures and treatment as the experimental group, with the only difference being the administration of a placebo instead of colchicine. The dosing schedule of the placebo will mimic that of the colchicine group.\n\nIs there anything else I can assist you with?"
