It is expected that various effects (such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-infection, protective effects, etc.) are obtained by eating honey. Although a large amount of studies have been conducted, there is still little evidence in Japan to support those expectations. Since honey is a fermented food, there may be a difference in efficacy between each type of honey due to the difference in the species of the honey bee from which it is made, the pollen in the honey, the degree of ripening (fermentation), and other factors. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of types of honey on the prevention or treatment of the common cold have been conducted.\nObjective\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to clarify the effects of honey species on the prevention or treatment of the common cold by conducting a systematic review using Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Joanna Briggs Institute, Efficacy Review Database, LIVIVELink, ClinicalTrials, DART-Europe, Korea Research Index, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. For the treatment of the common cold, the effect of honey on the duration of cold symptoms and honey on the degree of improvement of symptom severity will be investigated. As for the prevention of the common cold, the effects on the prevention of colds, the number of days away from work, missed workdays, and days absent from school will be investigated.\nMethods\nWe will conduct a literature search using the following search terms: Honey OR honey species OR honey quality OR honey composition* OR nectar. We will include studies that are randomized controlled trials and observe the treatment or prevention effect of honey, as well as studies that meet the following three criteria: 1) honey, 2) cold, 3) preventive or curative effect of honey, and 4) study conducted in Japan, North America, Europe, South America, Australia, Oceania, and Asia.

Due to the relatively low incidence of pediatric lung cancer, and because most children diagnosed with the disease are not eligible for prospective trial enrollment, it is unclear how best to treat this malignancy. This is especially applicable to patients with Stage III disease. It has been shown that advanced stage metastatic lung cancer patients have substantially improved survival when treated with hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), rather than conventional radiotherapy (RT), for lung lesions. The efficacy of this treatment in improving overall survival when applied to pediatric lung disease is not known. It is our hypothesis that pediatric lesions will be comparable to adults in terms of responsiveness to both SBRT and conventional RT.

HIV incidence among Black women, the fastest growing at\u2010 risk group, is four times the national average with little decreases seen over the last fifteen years. This highlights an urgent need for development, evaluation, and implementation of interventions for Black women who have or are at risk for HIV. One approach to achieving this is the Five Point Initiative, a community\u2010based participatory research (CBPR) intervention developed with and for Black women at high risk for HIV. This novel community\u2010based participatory intervention will empower the voice of the community and engage community members to be a part of identifying solutions for the greatest challenges that face Black women living in Black communities. Methods: Community\u2010based events, held bimonthly in the community from July 2020 to June 2021, will be utilized to deliver Five Point Initiative\u2010based interventions. Events will take place at pre\u2010existing venues throughout five points in African\u2010American communities in Miami\u2010Dade County and will target key community stakeholders, such as religious leaders, business owners, community organizations, and other Black women. These key community stakeholders will also play a part in co\u2010designing and providing feedback on the content at the events. Findings. This approach will serve to strengthen the partnership between community stakeholders, researchers, and community members to decrease stigma of getting tested for HIV, increase testing for HIV and STIs and linkage to services through the Community Navigation Center. We will work in collaboration with community stakeholders to increase screening, treatment and retention in HIV care, while empowering them to use their leadership skills to provide support for the community.",

The objective of this exploratory study is to assess the frequency and nature of these malignancies in patients being treated with prostatectomy or radiotherapy in order to inform the design of a clinical trial.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nProstate cancer represents a significant public health problem in the United States, where it is the most common malignancy in males. Approximately 233,000 new cases are diagnosed each year and, despite improvements in surgical techniques and therapeutic regimens, it is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in males. Prostate cancer is frequently associated with tumors from other epithelial sites. This comorbidity may be a function of a field effect attributable to shared common carcinogens, or may reflect an increased inflammatory state in the prostate with an increased risk for cancer in other tissues. Understanding the relationship between prostate cancer and malignancies in other sites may improve the long-term understanding of their underlying pathogenesis, and may inform new approaches for screening and diagnosis, as well as for more appropriate use of existing treatments. Recent studies have established that a large percentage of men with prostate cancer under a common genetic alteration in chromosome 8q24 that predisposes to urothelial tumors; the presence of this chromosome alteration may have a role in the increased risk for malignancies associated with prostate cancer. In addition, patients with prostate cancer are at an increased risk for other malignancies including renal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and urothelial cancer. This cohort will focus on evaluating the presence of concurrent gastrointestinal malignancies in men undergoing curative treatment for localized prostate cancer. The primary hypothesis is that the frequency and extent of concurrent gastrointestinal malignancies in this population are higher when compared to the general population.

The use of a trained clinical research coordinator to deliver the educational intervention ensures standardized delivery of information to all participants, regardless of their risk group or family history. This approach will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention in a real-world setting, regardless of patient characteristics. Furthermore, the comparison between the study group and the control group will help us to understand the impact of the educational intervention on genetic testing uptake even when patients have a different genetic predisposition, either through a positive family history or through their own genetic mutations. This will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the educational intervention and its applicability to different populations.

And how do you plan to evaluate the study endpoints? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Lung cancer is one of the top most morbidity causes and the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.. Early lung tumors (LTE) with a diameter of 1\u20103 cm have a very high risk of becoming malignant and are challenging to treat as well as difficult to diagnose. This paper outlines the study design of a Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of Padeliporfin Vascular Targeted Photodynamic Therapy (VTP) in patients with peripheral lung tumors (PLTs) who are at high risk of malignant neoplasms. Methods: The study will have two parts: Part A, a dose escalation/de\u2010escalation study which will employ a modified 3+3 design for Part A. Part B will evaluate the MTD and RP2D for Padeliporfin VTP therapy. We will enroll 14\u201036 patients in each of the Part A dosage stratum cohorts. Conclusion: VTP will be delivered through robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB), a technique that is increasingly being utilized in the evaluation and treatment of patients with lung nodules. The use of RAB is minimally invasive in diagnosis and treatment and can reduce morbidity and mortality. The study design will provide a novel approach to early lung tumors using VTP and may revolutionize the treatment of these tumors.",

The study will include all patients admitted to the surgery department at Stavanger University Hospital for urgent surgery due to colon perforation. The study is a quality assurance evaluation of the results of traditional and artificial intelligent radiographic imaging. The diagnosis of colon perforation is based on CT scan, ultrasound, contrast enemas, and surgical findings at surgery. In short, a small sample of water will be removed and examined for the presence of bacteria, using a new, digital and automated tool.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe study is a quality assurance evaluation of the diagnosis of perforated colon. Patients undergoing surgery for acute colon perforation are eligible for inclusion. 2-5 cm of colon will be sampled, to be examined for the presence of bacteria and other organisms. This study includes an additional and new quality assessment method, which is a digital, fast and precise detection method (Molecular Diagnostics). The traditional way of quality assurance in detecting a perforation is to open the abdominal cavity and examine visually whether there is a fluid pocket, which is considered a sign of a perforation in the wall of the colon. This method cannot be completed with absolute certainty due to the limited visibility of surgical areas, which may lead to undetected colon perforations. With the introduction of new and more advanced digital methods for radiography and artificial intelligence, it becomes easier to find a perforation in the patient's abdominal scan. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are living bacteria and other organisms in the lumen of the colon all the time, although it is unclear how far they move from the colon. In addition, it is unclear whether it is possible for bacteria to cross the digestive system wall and colonize it, or cause peritonitis. In this study, the aim is to investigate whether the digestive tract wall has been perforated, how far back into the gastrointestinal tract it went, and whether there are bacteria in the liquid from the gastrointestinal tract. This will be examined",

We hypothesize that this method will be able to detect differences in rates of bone formation in surgically treated spine fractures post-posterior decompression and posterolateral fusion. As part of this feasibility assessment, we will use the DEXA measurements to investigate if changes in bone metabolism are associated with improvements in subjective strength and functionality as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire. In addition, we will compare postoperative radiographic results on serial x-rays to determine if the novel method is accurate. Lastly, we will explore the relationship between subjective and objective measurements of bone healing (such as the SF-36).

And you plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial, correct? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nIn recent years, more and more attention has been paid to individual patient preferences, mainly focusing on providing patients with patient-specific information, such as presenting the probability of the occurrence of complications and the success rate of treatment alternatives in a simple and intelligible way. However, this approach has not been fully developed to support patients in making treatment decisions. For example, it is unclear how the preferences of cancer patients for the risk of recurrence after curative treatment of colon cancer compare to the recurrence risk reported in literature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to study what the preferred recurrence risk is, and how this risk can be communicated so that it can be easily understood by patients.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nClinicians Communication Preference for Recurrence Risk Information in Low Risk ColoRectal Cancer\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nColorectal Cancer\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Discussion\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients diagnosed with low-risk colorectal cancer (stages II-III) Patients who understand Dutch and are able to fill out questionnaires independently Patients without cognitive impairments (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score > 24 points) Patients who agree to participate in the study Exclusion Criteria: People who have been diagnosed with cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score < 24 points) People who are unable to provide consent themselves People who have been treated for colorectal cancer before\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nMinimum Age: 18 Years\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nAll\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n-----------------\nNo\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\nHow is the study designed?\n-----------------\n\nArms and Interventions\n\n| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |\n| --- | --- |\n| Colorectal cancer patients<br> | Other: Discussion<br>* Clinical consult about recurrence risk information<br>|",
            "Okay, excellent. Can you tell me whether you will conduct a blinded or a non-blinded study? \n\nAbstract:\nIt is becoming recognised by the public that there is a strong link between cancer and poor dietary intakes of fruit and vegetables. This view is not supported by strong evidence but by the fact that some fruits, including pomegranates, are known to affect genes involved in cancer development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of pomegranate supplementation on the expression of genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms. In a randomised, double\u2010blind placebo controlled parallel group study, 190 newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) patients consumed 2.5 mL concentrated pomegranate juice or a placebo daily for six months following surgery to obtain CRC specimens for microarray analysis. Microarray analysis was undertaken following the selection of differentially expressed genes using statistical software. In addition, candidate gene expression was confirmed using real time PCR. Overall, there was a significant reduction in gene expression of 22 genes in participants treated with pomegranate compared to those who consumed a placebo. Further analysis of these candidate genes showed that pomegranate treatment increased the expression of 12 genes involved in DNA repair pathways and decreased the expression of 10 genes involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. As pomegranate juice consumption could reduce tumour progression via modulation of various genes involved in cancer progression, it has considerable potential as a chemopreventive dietary agent for CRC.",

Now, could you please rate the participants' risk of bias and the overall risk of bias in your study? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Many studies on endothelial function in patients with hypertension exist on the basis of cross\u2010sectional evaluation. The data of these studies are scarce and of poor generalization potential. The aim is to assess the endothelial function in hypertensive patients receiving standard therapy and to evaluate the effect of calcium antagonists on endothelial function.METHODS: The study was conducted as a prospective, open, randomized, controlled, single\u2010blind, clinical study. We included 59 male patients with mild hypertension who were being treated with enalapril for at least 6 months. After the randomization, the patients received (i) enalapril and isradipine, standard therapy, ii) enalapril and the placebo, or (iii) isradipine and the placebo. The parameters evaluated included pulse wave velocity (PWV), intima\u2010media thickness, endothelin\u20101, soluble CD40 ligand, soluble ET receptors A and B, s-fms\u2010like tyrosine kinase activity, soluble P\u2010selectin, s\u2010E\u2010selectin, and adhesion molecules on endothelial cells \u2010 soluble intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101 (s\u2010ICAM\u20101) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule\u20101 (s\u2010VCAM\u20101).RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in initial values of PWV and other variables in the groups. As far as the mean changes in the PWV are concerned, in the group of enalapril, PWV decreased significantly (from 8.60 +/\u2010 0.77 to 8.04 +/\u2010 0.88 mm/s; p = 0.001), while on isradipine PWV increased significantly (from 8.19 +/\u2010 0.79 to 8.50 +/\u2010 0.77 mm/s; p = 0.001).

            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the HAIC-Reg-C cohort. This arm will involve patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma initially deemed unsuitable for radical therapy. They will receive combined HAIC, Regorafenib, and Tislelizumab as conversion therapy for downstaging. The HAIC procedure will be the same, and Regorafenib will be administered at a dose of 80mg daily. Tislelizumab will be given intravenously at a dose of 200mg every 2 weeks. What are your thoughts on this study arm? \nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and is often associated with a poor prognosis. Advanced liver cancer is difficult to treat, and the overall survival rate is low. Interventional therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and other treatments have been used in recent years to improve the effectiveness of HCC treatment. However, no single treatment can effectively eradicate HCC, and drug resistance is a major problem. Some patients who initially have favorable treatment responses will eventually relapse. In recent years, research has shown that the use of drugs to reduce drug resistance in HCC can improve the treatment outcome. This study aims to explore the efficacy of adding apatinib and camrelizumab (Apa\u2010Cam) to the treatment of advanced liver cancer, further providing reference for the treatment of advanced liver cancer. METHODS: This is a single\u2010center, single\u2010arm, open\u2010label, phase II clinical trial. A total of 18 participants with advanced liver cancer who meet the inclusion criteria and are taking apatinib plus camrelizumab will be recruited, and the primary endpoint is tumor response rate. The secondary endpoints include disease control rate, progression\u2010free survival rate, overall survival rate, adverse events, and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: By February 2021, a total of 36 participants had been included in the study, all of whom were over 18 years old, diagnosed with HCC, and received the treatment for two months. Among the 36 participants, 17 participants showed complete response and the average tumor response rate was 53.9%. After two months of treatment",

Let me know if you have any further suggestions. \n\nAbstract:\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with high recurrence rate and poor prognosis after radical resection or local therapies. Therefore, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and chemotherapy is an effective treatment for advanced HCC. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab combined with regorafenib in the treatment of advanced HCC. We will also investigate the mechanism of action of this combination therapy. The primary endpoint is progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and toxicity. Patients with AFP\u2265400ng/ml, ECOG score 0\u20101, and BCLC stage B\u2010C will be enrolled and randomized to regorafenib alone (armA) or regorafenib plus nivolumab (armB)."

There was a significant decrease in the incidence of falls over the trial period and this was greater in those patients with the highest baseline fall risk. There was a significant reduction in the number of ADLs missed due to physical reasons following the intervention.

The incidence and prevalence of obesity is alarmingly increasing, as is the health impact of obesity and T2DM, both in adults and children. The prevalence of obesity has doubled between 1970 and 2014 globally in adults and in 2018, 2 billion adults were overweight or obese. In children and adolescents aged 5-19, 18.5%(overweight) and 13%(obese) in boys, 17.6%(overweight) and 13.5%(obese) in girls were reported In the UK in 2018. The BMI is an indicator of obesity and obesity prevalence has consistently increased over the years, both in adults and children. The 2022 report of the National Obesity Forum(NOF) showed that UK obesity prevalence is 27% in both males and females. Overweight and obesity is reported to have increased during Covid-19 pandemic. A report on the trend of the prevalence of obesity and the impact of lockdown restriction shows a more alarming scenario with a higher prevalence of obesity in both males and females. In 2018-2019, 62% of adults in the UK were overweight or obese. In 2021, the prevalence increased to 65% of adults with obesity. Data for adults aged 16-24 indicate an increase from 25.4% in 2018 to 31% in 2021. Similarly, for children and adolescents, the data shows a deterrent scenario. The prevalence of obesity in UK was 19% in 2018 and it increased to 24% by 2020-2021. The Covid-19 pandemic poses a serious health",

            "For the experimental arm, I recommend using the Cold EMR technique. This involves an initial submucosal injection of physiologic solution followed by 'piece-meal' resection using a plastic covered basket snare. This experimental arm will use the novel cold EMR technique, while the above-mentioned active comparator arm will serve as a reference point for the conventional hot EMR technique. The primary endpoint of the trial was complete resection of the target lesion at the initial procedure with the exception of specimen fragment retention. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground & Aims: Endoscopic resection of large colonic lesions is a relatively recent topic in the field of polyp endoscopic resection. Among several different endoscopic procedures, conventional hot EMR or en bloc endoscopic mucosal resection, remains the standard technique for the en\u2010bloc removal, regardless of the lesion endoscopic appearance or size. Hot EMR involves piece\u2010meal dissection and resection of the polyps, followed by ablation of the lateral and deep margins with an electrocoagulation probe. The aim of the study was to compare the feasibility of conventional Hot EMR and novel Cold EMR with respect to the specimen resection rate, complete resection rate, polyp sizes, lesion locations, number of endoscopic procedures, and hospital stay. Materials and Methods: This randomized trial was conducted in 100 patients who were randomly allocated to hot or cold EMR from May 2017 to September 2020 at a single institute. The primary endpoint was the complete resection of the target lesion at the first attempt with the exception of fragmenting, while maintaining feasibility within \u00b1\u200920% of previous studies. Results: A total of 180 lesions (102 lesions in the cold EMR group and 78 lesions in the hot EMR group) were included. The complete resection rate was significantly higher in the hot EMR group than in the cold EMR (96.2 vs. 89.1%, respectively). When the polyp sizes and lesion locations were analyzed, the complete resection rate in the hot EMR group was significantly higher in lesions larger than 20\u00a0mm (93.8% vs. 80.0%",

The intervention is a structured ACP session for older adults who have been chronically homeless that will utilize principles of facilitation and narrative gerontology. Participants in the intervention group will receive facilitated group sessions and participants in the control group will receive facilitated one to one sessions.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis will be the first feasibility study to examine the efficacy of a facilitated ACP intervention for older formerly homeless adults who currently reside in Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH). This intervention is needed as this population is at a greater risk of chronic, life-limiting illnesses than their housing-stable counterparts.

            "That makes sense. Can you tell me a bit more about the interventions that you plan to use? \n\nBrief summary in scientific language\n=================\nThe clinical problem is that most individuals with depression do not respond to an antidepressant after treatment for 8 weeks. Depression is a common disease that is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The consequences of depression include an increase in mortality, comorbidities, suicide, and reduced quality of life and work capacity. Although there are many available antidepressant drugs, 30-40% of individuals with depression experience inadequate treatment outcomes. Although the clinical practice guidelines recommend a switch to a different antidepressant if the first antidepressant fails after 8 weeks, there is uncertainty regarding an alternative when this option is not effective. The proposed solution to this problem is to target the pathophysiology of the disease. The hypothesis that we want to test is that cognitive biases associated with depression can help to predict medication response or lack thereof. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it will lead to an approach based on the underlying pathophysiology of depression, rather than trial and error, which will improve treatment outcomes and reduce the risk of treatment failure. This can also help to reduce costs. We propose a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether a psychological treatment that targets cognitive biases is more effective than a placebo in preventing relapse in MDD or BP. This trial also aims to explore whether the effect of this intervention is mediated by cognitive biases. \n\nBrief summary in easily understood language\n=================\nTreatment with antidepressant medications is a common treatment option for depression, but approximately one-third of individuals do not respond. This can lead to further research to find ways to improve treatment. Some of these approaches focus on finding the right medication for an individual, while others focus on understanding the causes of this lack of improvement. The proposed solution to this problem is to target the underlying mechanisms that are related to the disease and the medication. The investigators want to test if a psychological intervention that trains individuals to change their thoughts (cognitive biases) can improve the effectiveness of medication. \n\n\nHealth condition or problem studied\n=================\nICD10:: F32.2 - Recurrent moderate or severe depressive episode, current episode\nHealthy volunteers:: No Entry\n\n\nInterventions, Observational Groups",

DESIGN/METHODS: We evaluated 130 patients with ICH for clinical and laboratory characteristics, prognosis, and death causes. After obtaining informed consent, patients were randomized into four groups (n=32 each) for intravenous rosuvastatin (20 mg), oral rosuvastatin (20 mg), intravenous atorvastatin (20 mg), or oral atorvastatin (20 mg) as the first\u2010line drugs against ICH. The other two drugs served as the control. Serum lipid levels and inflammatory indicators were evaluated at T0 (on admission), T7, and T30 (at 7 and 30 d of treatment). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Barthel Index (BI) were assessed on admission and at 3\u2010 and 6\u2010mo after discharge. The 1\u2010, 3\u2010, and 6\u2010mo mortality and 2\u2010 and 6\u2010mo recurrent ICH were compared. RESULTS: The onboarding time of rosuvastatin groups was 12h shorter than in the atorvastatin groups (T0, p<0.05).

Pre\u2010block consists of injecting the local anesthetic solution between the skin and the subcutaneous tissue at the site of epidural needle puncture. In this study, we compared the effects of pre\u2010block with the traditional anesthetic techniques performed in the labor room before epidural analgesia.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective randomized study was conducted at the labor room of Benha University maternity hospital between October 2016 and February 2017. The study included 120 parturients. 60 parturients in each group were randomly assigned to pre\u2010block or a conventional anesthetic technique.RESULTS: Pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS) before puncture, after the epidural needle was inserted through the skin, after the epidural catheter had been inserted, and five minutes after the injection of the local anesthetic solution. At these four assessment times, pain was assessed in the conventional group and pre\u2010block group. The VAS scores for pain, post\u2010blocking nausea, and overall satisfaction levels were compared between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: For epidural analgesia, the pre\u2010block technique reduces pain compared to a conventional technique.

Although IPAP is associated with worse outcomes compared to those with uninfected AAP, including a worse mortality and longer hospital stays, this condition has remained challenging to diagnose in the acute setting of AP.\nThe diagnosis of IPAP and timely intervention within the first week of AP may potentially prevent worsening of disease severity, although no single method has proven superior in this regard.3,4 In the case of pancreatic necrosis, which develops in \u223c30% of cases, early assessment of pancreatic microbiota is critical.\nIn addition, early initiation of antimicrobial therapy has been shown to be essential in acute pancreatitis-associated necrotizing infection (APA-NI) due to the development of pancreatic gas gangrene, which is also associated with a significantly worse prognosis.5,6\nRapid improvement in molecular techniques and the introduction of multiplex next-generation sequencing (NGS) have greatly improved our understanding of bacterial communities in infected acute pancreatitis over the past decade.\n7\u201310\nNGS has since been applied widely to identify microorganisms and characterize their relationship to health and disease in many different biological samples.11,12\nWe believe that the time is right to apply NGS to a larger group of bacteremia patients with",

It may be that after a few days of high training volume, athletes would not be able to replace their energy stores (e.g. glycogen) through the amount of carbohydrates provided from their diet. Therefore, certain athletes may experience fatigue if the amount of carbohydrates provided from the diet is not enough for a number of days following training. Dietary strategies such as reducing the amount of carbohydrates in the diet while increasing the amount of fat may be beneficial for restocking energy stores (glycogen). We hypothesise that a diet low in carbohydrate with higher fat would be more effective in restoring glycogen (stored energy) in athletes following a heavy training period compared to a diet high in carbohydrate.Who can participate?You may be eligible to participate in this study if you:are a male athlete between 16 and 40 years of ageare able to maintain low-carbohydrate daily intakes, are in good health and do not have any chronic illness"

We developed a novel museum intervention in older adults with controlled AF, using mindful awareness and sensory stimulation. In older adults with AF, we hypothesize that the novel intervention will improve QoL, cognitive function, cardiovascular (CV) functions, as well as promote psychological well-being. The main objectives of this study are to: 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel museum intervention in older adults with controlled AF.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nWe developed the novel Museum Visit and Interactive Talk (MiVIT) intervention. It is a 2.8-hour museum intervention that utilizes mindful awareness and sensory stimulation to provide participants with experiential learning and social interactions. This museum intervention consists of two different experiences. It aims to promote positive feelings and sense of belonging, reduce loneliness in older adults, resulting in improved physical and mental health status. In the current study, we will recruit 40 participants and enroll them in either a control or an experimental group, with 20 participants in each group. The experimental group will receive the museum intervention in a pre-determined order to avoid bias, while the control group will receive the intervention in a reverse order. A third group (n=5) will not receive any type of intervention. All participants will be assessed on the primary and secondary outcomes at T0, T3 and T6. Assessments for T3 follow-up will be performed within 2 weeks after the first intervention for the experimental group and within one month after the intervention for the control group. Assessments for T6 will be performed 4 weeks after the intervention for both groups.

By focusing on patients who have received this specific treatment regimen as their first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC, the study can provide valuable insights into the outcomes of this combination therapy. Excluding patients with EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 variants ensures a more homogeneous patient population for analysis, allowing for more accurate assessment of the treatment's effects.",

This may include collecting data on the rate of intravesical recurrence, duration of recurrence-free survival, and overall mortality. To minimize bias, we should collect data consistently and follow a standardized protocol for data collection. We need to consider the time frame for data collection. It should be long enough to accurately assess the impact of the intervention on patient outcomes and short enough to avoid the risk of the disease progressing or the patients experiencing other complications. We need to consider the population size that will be required to achieve the desired precision in the estimates. We may need to conduct a power analysis or pilot a smaller sample size to test the feasibility of the study. We should define the statistical significance and define how we will interpret the results. We should also define the statistical methods for analyzing the data.

Objective. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PerQdisc Nucleus Replacement System in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation with compressive radiculopathy. Methods. This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, non\u2010inferiority clinical trial. Adult patients with lumbar disc herniation with compressive radiculopathy were randomized into two groups. One group underwent routine discectomy (control group), and the other underwent disc\u2010height\u2010preserving nucleus replacement (experimental group).

Could you tell me more about this drug? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe study will be performed in the Outpatient Heart Failure Clinic at Mie University Hospital. Patients with heart failure will be recruited among those who visit the outpatient clinic. Patients will be randomly assigned to take or not to take the standard drugs (SGLT2 inhibitors, sGC stimulator, and ARNI).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHeart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body. The standard drugs for the treatment of heart failure include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and more recently sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. ARBs and SGLT2 inhibitors are used in the treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). SGLT2 inhibitors are believed to reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular causes and hospitalization for heart failure. The standard care for patients with heart failure includes the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. sGC stimulator (PDE5 inhibitor) is a new drug for the treatment of heart failure with preserved EF. ARNIs, which combine the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, have superior efficacy and safety. The use of ARNIs in the standard treatment of heart failure will have a significant impact on the morbidity and mortality of patients with heart failure. However, the mechanisms by which these drugs improve heart failure and other cardiovascular conditions are not well understood. The mechanisms of action of these drugs are also not well understood. It is therefore important to study the mechanisms of action of these drugs in order to improve the treatment of heart failure. This study will be the first of its kind in Japan and will provide important insights into the mechanisms of action of these drugs.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nImpact of SGLT2 Inhibitor, SGC Stimulator, and ARNI on Lithogenic Parameters in Heart Failure Patients\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHeart Failure:Reduced Ejection Fraction, Heart Failure:Preserved Ejection Fra",

The study will enroll up to 32 consecutive patients who agree to kidney biopsy and initiate SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground Sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLT), including 2 (SGLT2) and 9 (SGLT9) are expressed in the kidney. Both SGLT2 and SGLT9 inhibition have been shown to reduce filtration fraction by 10-15% which is not associated with any significant change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over 16 weeks in the setting of type 2 diabetes. In animal models, SGLT2 inhibitors have been found to reduce tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which may be a common target in the treatment of CKD. Thus, the primary specific aim of the proposed study will test if SGLT2 inhibition has any early effect on tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation, as early markers of kidney disease progression in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The second specific aim explores the possibility that SGLT2 inhibition may not increase the rate of decline in GFR. The tertiary aims investigate the effects of SGLT2inhibitors on podocyte function and endothelial function, which may be associated with decrements in kidney function. This is the first study to explore how SGLT2 inhibitors may affect kidney structure and kidney function in patients with HF.

In patients with a matched sibling donor, high\u2010dose methotrexate and cyclophosphamide were administered 24 hours before TP, and in patients without an HLA\u2010identical sibling, cytarabine and fludarabine were co\u2010given with TP. Cyclosporine and methotrexate were administered within 100 days after TP in both groups. The patients were randomized to receive disutis mali 300 mg every day from the day before TP for a total of 104 inpatient days or placebo until day 90. Results: The CTL rate was 76.7% in the disutis mali arm and 62.9% in the control arm, and there was no statistical difference between these two groups (P = 0.159). Acute GVHD was observed in only three cases without differences between the two groups. There were seven treatment\u2010related deaths in the disutis mali arm and four in the control arm. The 2\u2010year overall survival rate was 78.6%. The non\u2010relapse mortality rate was no significant difference between disutis mali and control arms, but the relapse\u2010free survival rate was significantly lower in the control arm (37.4%) than in the disutis mali arm (75.6%) (P =",

The intervention is the consumption of a low- and high-fat meal. The low-fat meal consists of bread, cheese, and sausage (348 kcal, 13.5g fat, 11.6 g protein, 36.3 g carbohydrates), while the high-fat meal consists of fat-rich sausage (393 kcal, 33.6 g fat, 14.2 g protein, 21.2 g carbohydrates).

Blood samples will be collected over 12 weeks.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study will investigate the albumin catabolic rate (ACR) in healthy adults, 25 years of age and older. ACR is a measure of how quickly albumin is broken down by the body. Albumin is the most abundant blood protein in humans, and its levels can drop due to various conditions such as severe burns, injuries or illnesses. It's important for the body to maintain adequate albumin levels as it plays a vital role in maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. Lower ACR can be an indication of systemic inflammation. In this study, we will assess ACR by administering a beverage containing 2H5-Phenylalanine, a stable isotope that is not harmful and is naturally occurring in our environment. A small number of participants will also receive a regular foodstuff containing the stable isotope labeled amino acid in addition to regular food. Blood samples will be collected over 12 weeks to determine albumin concentrations, ACR and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), an indicator of kidney function. Ultimately, the results of this study may help us understand more about diseases or metabolic disorders that might be associated with low ACR.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nStable Isotope-Labeled Phenylalanine Provides a Novel Method to Quantify Albumin Catabolic Rate and Assess Liver Function in Healthy Adults\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHuman, Kidney, Dysfunction, Liver Cirrhosis, Liver Disease, Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, Hepatitis, Kidney Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Stable isotope labeled phenylalanine\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria",

However, the optimal ratio of local anesthetics is not yet determined. Although it is assumed that the optimal mixture of ropivacaine and bupivacaine has some anesthetic synergic effects, no studies have evaluated the effects of the different ratios of ropivacaine and bupivacaine on postoperative pain \n[7,8]. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of bupivacaine and ropivacaine mixture at different concentration on postoperative pain.\n2. Methods\nA total of 90 patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists I to III, aged over 20 years undergoing surgery under spinal anesthesia were recruited into this study. All surgeries were scheduled as elective surgery and were performed in the operating room over 14 months. Patients with a history of peripheral nerve disease or drug allergies were ineligible for this study.

Are there multiple arms or do all the participants get the same treatment? \n\nAbstract:\nIn 1993, the American Association of Health Plans reported results of a survey of 1,839 respondents with congestive heart failure. The question was asked in what setting patients first presented with congestive heart failure. Forty\u2010nine percent reported that their initial medical contact was in an emergency department (ED), and 52% reported that it was in an internist's or family physician's office. The study also showed that patients who saw a cardiologist first had a shorter delay between symptom onset and first medical contact than those with no delay. The patients receiving specialty care received a diagnosis of congestive heart failure more rapidly than those who were not treated by a cardiologist. These findings suggest that the sooner a cardiologist is consulted, the earlier the diagnosis and the more likely the use of appropriate treatment measures. The benefits of early diagnosis cannot be exaggerated because 2\u2010year survival rates for those diagnosed with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate heart failure average greater than 80%, whereas patients diagnosed with heart failure while presenting in advanced congestive heart failure have survival rates that are less than 50%.",

The cause of this condition is not well\u2010understood, and the treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Conservative treatment modalities include rest, antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy, and surgical intervention. This prospective, randomized, controlled study aimed to evaluate functional outcomes in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis treated with ultrasound therapy guided by electromyography\u2010triggered electrical stimulation and compare these results with those treated with ultrasound therapy and electrotherapy alone, or with extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT). Methods: A total of 48 patients suffering from chronic lateral epicondylitis were randomized into three groups in a prospective controlled trial. Group 1 was treated with ultrasound therapy guided by EMG\u2010triggered electrical stimulation; group 2 received ultrasound therapy and electrotherapy only and group 3 received ESWT. Clinical Evaluation: The patients were evaluated pretreatment and at 2 and 4 weeks after the first treatment. The assessment consisted of both subjective and objective evaluations, including Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) and Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) were used as objective measures. Results: No significant difference was observed between groups 1 and 2 (p\u2010value = 0.50, 0.17, respectively). This lack of difference was maintained at 4 weeks of follow\u2010up. The results obtained in the ultrasound therapy groups showed no difference compared with the ESWT group (p\u2010value = 0.81, 0.60, respectively). Conclusion: Ultrasound therapy guided",

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AND017 (epothilone) in treating cancer-related anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy. The study will involve two arms: experimental and control. Patients in the experimental arm will receive AND017, while patients in the control group will receive a placebo. The administration of AND017 will help stabilize red blood cells and prevent their destruction. The study will be conducted in three cycles, each consisting of 21 days. The study participants will be evaluated based on their hemoglobin levels at the beginning and end of each cycle, as well as blood counts. The main measure of success will",

For each arm, please note that the intervention/treatment includes 3 times weekly oral administration of the 400mg, 600mg, or 800mg dose of the drug AND017 for 4 weeks.\nIt's important to emphasize that this was an open-label study, meaning that both the healthcare professionals and participants were aware of the intervention that was being administered. This might have biased the results in favor of the intervention due to the placebo effect or other factors related to the expectation of treatment effectiveness. As such, the findings of the study should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, the study duration of 4 weeks was relatively short, which might have limited the ability to detect long-term efficacy and adverse events.\nIn conclusion, the study design and arms were focused on investigating the potential benefit of AND017 in managing anemia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The open-label nature of the study and the short study duration are potential limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results.\nThis information can now be used to guide future research and help inform clinical decision-making regarding the potential use of AND017 in this patient population.",

Do you also have any preliminary thoughts in mind about the study design, such as the duration and number of participants? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: Aflibercept (EYLEA) administered at a dosage of 2 mg was evaluated previously in adults with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (n = 754; VIVID Dosed Phase II Study) and has demonstrated efficacy in improving vision in this patient population. The present phase III study evaluated aflibercept at a lower 2\u2010mg dosage as well as two different dosage schedules of 2 mg over 52 weeks. Methods: In this multicenter, phase III, doublemasked, active\u2010controlled study, 501 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with monthly aflibercept 8 mg (n = 167), bi\u2010monthly aflibercept 8 mg (n = 165) or monthly aflibercept 2 mg intraocular injections. The end\u2010point measurewas the mean change from baseline visual acuity at study week 48. Results: The treatment groups were well balanced for demographic characteristics and baseline characteristics. At week 48 (primary study timepoint), all treatment groups showed marked improvements in best corrected visual acuity compared with baseline. The least squares mean change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity at 48 weeks was 13.9 letters for the monthly 2\u2010mg dose group, 15.8 letters for the monthly 8\u2010mg dose group, and 16.6 letters for the bi\u2010monthly 8\u2010mg dose group (all P < 0.001). The 8\u2010mg dose groups (both monthly and bi\u2010monthly) maintained significant improvements in visual acuity compared with baseline through week 52. Adverse events included conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, retinal vein occlusion, and eye infection. Conclusion: Both monthly and bi\u2010monthly dosing with aflibercept 2 and 8 mg provided sustained improvements in visual acuity and were generally well tolerated in patients with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion over 52 weeks.

Without a control arm, we cannot determine whether the observed differences between the study groups are due to the supplementation or other factors. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 3 months of aerobic exercise training during hospitalization on the immune function, clinical outcomes, and post\u2010hospitalization physical fitness of hospitalized children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using the Wii Fit balance board. Materials and Methods: The study included 20 hospitalized boys aged 5\u201017 years diagnosed with ALL who were randomly assigned to a control (n = 10) or exercise intervention (n = 10) group. Results: The groups, in terms of patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, were similar. No clinically significant differences were observed between the groups regarding their serum concentrations of C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), IgG, IgA, and IgM. Although there was no difference between the groups in terms of hemoglobin and hematocrit values, the leukocyte and platelet counts as well as neutrophil values were significantly higher in the control group compared to the intervention group. In addition, although there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of Karnofsky Performance Status scores, body composition measurements and physical fitness tests before the intervention, at the end of the intervention, the patients in the exercise intervention group had higher physical fitness results (p=0.035), and they were found to have lost body weight, fat mass, total body water and had decreased body mass index. Conclusions: During hospitalization, physical fitness training with the Wii Fit was well tolerated by hospitalized children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and was associated with improved physical fitness and reduced body weight and fat mass. In the future, prospective studies should investigate the efficacy of long\u2010term inpatient physical fitness training on immune system function and clinical outcomes in hospitalized children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

What was the rationale for choosing this type of experimental design? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nTo assess the safety of prophylactic antibiotics in patients at high risk of surgical site infection after elective colorectal cancer surgery in a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nFollowing recruitment of 4000 patients in the CRYO study and randomisation of 3500, the rate of surgical site infection will need to be assessed against historic control rates. These are available for both NHS and non-private providers, and are both close to 5% with no obvious differences between them. Given the lack of any substantial benefits (and increased costs) seen in the CRYO study, a simple difference of 1% between the study arms seems unlikely. However, if this were to occur then it would represent an improvement of 40% of control rates. Thus, a sample size of 4000 patients (2000 per arm) will be required to detect this with a power of 80% and 2-sided alpha of 0.05. Assuming 10% attrition (e.g. censoring due to withdrawal of consent, lack of access to medical records, death of patient prior to discharge), and a total recruitment time of 18 months, this amounts to a recruitment rate of 60patients/month. In each of 20 NHS and 20 private hospitals, the rate of consented patients should be at least one per week, if resources and infrastructure permits.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Phase 3 Randomised Non-Inferiority Study in the Safety of the GORE\u00ae SYNECOR Intraperitoneal Biomaterial When Used as a Surgical Site Infection Prophylaxis in Colorectal Cancer Patients in High Risk For Infection\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nColorectal Cancer, Postoperative Wound Infection\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: cefuroxime\n* Drug: intraperitoneal saline\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria:",

In a recent retrospective study, our group observed that the rate of permanent hypothyroisim is higher after completion thyroidectomy than after lobectomy. It is not clear whether this phenomenon is due to damage to the thyroid remnant during completion thyroidectomy.

When present, the condition can be treated medically, since its most common cause is autoimmune thyroiditis secondary to resection-induced thyroid tissue damage. It is considered fully reversible in most cases. After this form of thyroiditis has healed, a permanent need for levothyroxine is very rare. The study hypothesis is that an increased rate of post-surgical hypothyroidism is related to the removal or destruction of the thyroid during completion thyroidectomy rather than to the autoimmune process linked to the development of thyroiditis. This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that some normal thyroid tissue remains after thyroid lobectomy, or by the difference between the anatomical and the functional thyroid remnants left after completion thyroidectomy. It is not clear whether this phenomenon is due to damage to the thyroid remnant during completion thyroidectomy or to the lack of normal thyroid tissue left after lobectomy for multinodular goiters with benign adenomatous nodules.

            "Thank you for the description. Now, let's move on to the second study arm. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\n\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nWe are conducting a study to investigate the impact of commercial native starch and processed starch on postprandial glycemic control in healthy adults compared with glucose. The current literature on starch processing and postprandial glucose management is weak, and our study aims to address this gap through a controlled trial in healthy adults. Our research objective is to determine whether processing native starch through extrusion, as done in the commercial marketplace, has a clinically meaningful impact on glycemic control measured postprandially in healthy individuals. Furthermore, we aim to evaluate whether commercial processing can attenuate postprandial glycemic spikes, and whether starch processing affects the gut microbiome and acute fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nWe will conduct a parallel crossover randomized clinical trial of healthy adults investigating the glycemic responses to two starch formulations as a function of extrusion-based processing. This will be a proof-of-concept study in which glucose, insulin, and SCFA concentrations will be measured as surrogate markers for starch digestion, absorption and gut microbiome activity in a fasted and postprandial state. Participants will consume a standardized meal mixed with 1.5 g/kg body mass of corn starch in one of two forms: commercial and raw. On two separate occasions, 12 to 18 hours apart, each participant will receive both starch formulations in random order. Fasting and postprandial blood samples will be collected over 3 hours, and fecal samples will be collected over 96 hours, including 48 hours after the last meal.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nImpact of Commercial Native vs. Raw Starch on Postprandial Glycemic Control, Gut Microbiome, and SCFAs in Healthy Adults\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nNon-Communicable Disease, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Native Starch\n* Other: Modified Starch\n\n\nPart",

Methods: The study was a prospective, randomized, comparative case series. Thirty patients with macular edema associated with diabetic retinopathy were randomly assigned to receive a single 0.4 mg intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide or 3 injections 1 month apart or 6 at a time interval of 1 month. Clinical examinations were performed at 1\u2010, 2\u2010, and 3\u2010month follow\u2010ups. The primary outcome measures were change in central macular thickness (CMT) after 60 days and adverse effects. Results: The mean time from baseline to the last follow\u2010up visit was 122 \u00b1 25 days. All patients completed the study. Mean CMT in the 1\u2010month interval group was 165 \u00b1 24 \u03bcm (P = .05), in the 3\u2010month interval group was 166.67 \u00b1 25.67 \u03bcm (P = .001), and in the 6\u2010month interval group was 153.4 \u00b1 29. \u03bcm (P = .002). There were significant differences among these groups. Visual acuity after 120 days showed a trend toward improvement in all groups: 1\u2010month interval group, + 0.52 \u00b1 2.6; 3\u2010month interval group, + 3.89 \u00b1 2.98; and the 6\u2010month interval group, + 4.83 \u00b1 3. Adverse reactions included intraocular pressure increase, glaucoma, and cataract. Conclusions: Results show that intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide therapy is more beneficial when the injection interval is gradually increased in patients with DME.

            "Very interesting. How will the exercise program be implemented? Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Although the addition of radiation therapy after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NSCT) leads to more favorable survival outcomes in women with breast cancer, it can increase the risk of local toxicity. PURPOSE: The aim of this analysis was to assess the role of the addition of postoperative radiotherapy in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST).METHODS AND MATERIALS: This randomized phase III study enrolled patients with breast cancer who were eligible for surgical treatment. There were 424 patients in the radiation therapy group and 412 in the no\u2010radiation group in each cohort. A propensity score methodology was used to control treatment\u2010related effects; patients were matched by risk\u2010of\u2010relapse score and estrogen receptor status.RESULTS: The survival curve analysis of the entire study population showed no difference between the experimental and control groups at the 15\u2010year follow\u2010up (7% vs 10%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73\u20102.03; P = .43). In a stratified analysis by low\u2010 and high\u2010risk grouping with the 15\u2010year disease\u2010free survival rate as the primary outcome variable, we found that the radiation therapy group had a better survival outcome than the control group (disease\u2010free survival rate of 32.7% vs 23%, respectively [HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05\u20101.97; P = .03) and better overall survival rate than the control group (hazard ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.07\u20101.87; P = .02). However, the addition of postoperative radiotherapy was associated with more acute and late adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: After neoadjuvant systemic therapy, postoperative radiation therapy may be considered an option for high\u2010risk patients. In the low\u2010risk group, no obvious benefit was observed by the administration of radiation therapy.",

However, it is unclear whether antibiotics improve outcomes, and the practice may contribute to the increased risk of antibiotic resistance. In a randomized control trial, we evaluated if oral surgeon residents would benefit from using prophylactic antibiotics during third molar surgery.METHODS: We included 58 patients with mandibular third molars for removal by dental residents in a randomized double\u2010blind two\u2010arm trial. We compared the amount of pain, swelling and function of mandible with antibiotics administered postoperatively. The primary outcome of the study was pain experienced at 3\u201015 months postoperatively. The intervention group was administered 500 mg amoxicillin and 500 mg clarithromycin once postoperatively.RESULTS: There was no difference in pain or other parameters between the groups during the first 4 weeks postoperatively. Our results show that pain experienced postoperatively has a mean score of less than 1 on a numeric scale of 0 to 10, and pain is not statistically significant from baseline at any time point.CONCLUSION: We did not find any beneficial effect of antibiotic prophylaxis after third molar surgery on either pain, swelling or function. The effect of antibiotics on pain was minimal and short\u2010lived and did not benefit surgical patients.PRACTITIONER'S POINT: We conclude that there is no indication for antibiotic prophylaxis after third molar surgery.",

By injecting hyaluronic acid into the implant socket before implantation, the researchers can assess if this method is more effective in pain reduction compared to traditional treatment. This arm allows for a direct comparison between the use of hyaluronic acid and no intervention.\n\n2. No Intervention: Traditional treatment\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants in this group will undergo traditional treatment without any additional intervention such as hyaluronic acid injection.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: N/A\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as the control group to compare the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid injection. By not injecting any material into the implant socket, researchers can evaluate the natural course of post-implantation pain and compare it to the experimental group. This arm is necessary to assess the true impact of hyaluronic acid on pain relief in this clinical trial setting.",

In patients with HF, AF is independently associated with an increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity rate. Atrial arrhythmia burden is a significant prognostic factor for CVDs and death in HF. Hypothermia, particularly core temperature <36\u00b0C, is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in patients with HF. AF was recently shown to be associated with 6.7% increased odds of hypothermia in HF patients. The prognostic and pathophysiological roles of hypothermia and AF in patients with HF have not been fully elucidated. AF-related factors, including neurohormonal activation and inflammation, may be a cause of hypothermia in HF; however, the potential role of hypothermia in AF triggering in patients with HF remains unclear. It is unknown whether hypothermia alters the severity of AF and its associated factors, including neurohormonal activation and inflammation, in patients with HF.

It involves scoring the extent of visible damage to the corneal epithelium in the form of staining. Corneal staining scores will be graded on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of damage. A higher score means a worse outcome. The outcome is measured using slit-lamp examination and flourescein staining. The mean corneal staining score will be calculated by averaging the staining scores across four quadrants of the eye. | 12 months | \n| Change from baseline in the Schirmer's test scores at 12 months | Schirmer's test evaluates the amount of tears produced by the eye in a specific time period. The test involves placing a special strip of paper in the lower eyelid which is then removed after 5 minutes. The length of paper wetness is a measure of tear secretion, with shorter lengths indicating a lower tear secretion. A higher score means a worse outcome. | 12 months | \n| Change from baseline in the conjunctival lymph flow rate at 12 months | The conjunctival lymph flow rate is a measure of tear drainage. This test involves placing a small clip on the eyelids to inhibit drainage and then administering a fluorescein dye in the eye. The amount of drainage that occurs in a specific time period is then measured using a special camera. A higher score means a worse outcome. | 12 months | \n| Change from baseline in the Oxford grading scale at 12 months | The Oxford grading scale is a comprehensive assessment method that includes evaluation of symptoms, signs, and tear film features, to determine the severity of dry eye disease.

Thirty volunteers (15 males and 15 females) were recruited. The volunteers were randomly divided into 2 groups: passive heating (PH) and control group (CG). The PH group used the heating device during inactivity. The CG consisted of static stretching on quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteal muscles, followed by 5\u2010minutes of lying on a bed in a room with a constant temperature of 22\u00b12\u2103. Before and after the intervention, a thermal sensitivity test, heart rate (HR) and peripheral peripheral skin temperature (Tsk) were measured in both groups. Muscle temperature was measured in both legs and thighs of lower limbs as the main outcome variable. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Bonferroni post\u2010hoc or Student t\u2010test. The results showed that Tsk value was higher in the PH group (p<0.05). The heart rate decreased after the intervention in the PH group compared to before the intervention (p<0.05). In the CG, muscle temperature was not significantly different compared to before the intervention (p>0.05). Vessyl Heat Wave\u00ae may increase blood circulation, improving overall blood microcirculation during bedrest (cooling). As a result, the heart rate decreases due to a decrease in body temperature. Therefore, the PH group is recommended for nursing care environments to maintain the temperature of bedridden patients.",

One hundred and ninety four subjects with rheumatoid arthritis with symptom duration between 12 and 24 months were randomized to treatment with sulfasalazine and methotrexate (n = 110), or with placebo (n = 84). The main outcome measure was functional disability, measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire. We analysed data in a multivariable regression model with disability as the outcome after 1 and 2 years.RESULTS: Of the patients, 20% were on methotrexate monotherapy, 8% on sulfasalazine monotherapy, and 26% on both. In the multivariable model we included disease activity, and the following variables: baseline age, female gender, high educational level, and smoking. For all patients we found that education, disease activity, and female gender were independent predictors of disability at 12 months, with female gender having the greatest detrimental effect (OR = 4.2 (1.5, 12.0)). After 24 months we found that education, disease activity and smoking still showed independent prognostic value, but female gender no longer did.CONCLUSION: We conclude that female gender is a strong predictor of functional disability at 12 months, while in the longer term, education, disease activity, and smoking are important determinants of disease evolution. 2004 The Author(s)."

Blood pressure measurements, routine laboratory assessment, and determination of carbohydrate\u2010induced glucose metabolism were done at baseline and after 3 months of intervention. Results: It is well known that chronic inflammation is related to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Hesperetin, catechin, and carnosic inhibit the production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines and ROS (reactive oxygen species) activity. The activity of \u03b1\u2010amylase and \u03b1\u2010glucosidase, which affect carbohydrate metabolism in the body, were reduced in the treatment group. A significant increase in the antioxidant enzyme activity, the levels of nitric oxide ( NO), and insulin sensitivity index is reported.

Typical treatment plans for radioembolization of pancreatic cancer with Yttrium-90 microspheres involve a single injection session with a maximum of 50 Gy administered per session. However, since the Intratumoral device can deliver the radiation more directly to the tumor tissue, we may need to adjust the dosage and session frequency accordingly. The maximum tolerated dosage for holmium-166 microspheres is not well established yet, but we may start with a dosage of around 7 to 11 Gy per session and adjust it based on the patient's response and tolerance.

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe use of ketamine to treat anxiety in schizophrenia is a relatively new area. Many patients with schizophrenia and psychosis experience significant distress from anxiety symptoms, with many patients unable to benefit from a standard SSRI treatment. Ketamine has been studied in acute treatment of anxiety in this patient population, but we need to better understand whether such benefits are sustained. Therefore, we plan to examine the effects of low-dose (0.2 mg/kg) weekly ketamine treatment in patients suffering with schizophrenia and anxiety.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPsychosis and/or bipolar disorder is frequently accompanied by anxiety, which is associated with functional impairment and poor outcomes. Anxiety has been consistently shown to be an enduring feature of schizophrenia, with an incidence of 30% in early phases of psychosis (Strawn et al., 2017). In fact, anxiety is often a better predictor of functional outcomes than psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and positive delusions (Gelkopf, Leweke, & Zohar, 2013). Additionally, patients with anxiety and poor functioning are also at an increased risk for the development of psychosis and other severe mental illness later in life (Goodman et al., 2011). Importantly, many anxiety symptoms have been shown to persist in psychosis despite normalization of delusions and hallucinations after treatment with antipsychotic medications (Perry et al., 2015). Further, treatment with antipsychotics can increase anxiety and the rate of dropouts in psychotic patients, suggesting a need for complimentary approaches (Perry et al., 2015). Therefore, new strategies to treat anxiety in patients with schizophrenia are urgently needed. Ketamine has emerged as a novel and potentially promising treatment for anxiety, as there is a growing body of literature in support of its efficacy and safety in this population of patients (Mortensen & Farahbakhsh, 2018). Although the use of ketamine as a therapeutic agent for major depressive disorder is well documented (Berman et al., 2000), multiple studies have also shown that a single intr",

This study aims to determine if treatment-as-usual approach for the treatment of alcohol use disorders in Canada, that has been proven effective for moderate-to-severe alcohol use disorders, will be as effective when provided in a virtual environment.The primary object of this pragmatic cohort study will therefore be to: (a) Estimate the effectiveness of the Intensive Virtual Treatment for alcohol use disorders. (b) Identify predictive factors regarding individual treatment response and (c) Determine whether virtual treatment is equally effective in different types of participants.For the first objective, it is proposed to compare the number of consecutive days of alcohol abstinence over the 28-day period prior to the trial and at 1-year after the trial.

To alleviate pain and improve healing in non-healing wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous ulcers (VU), medical professionals often need to resort to topically applied, invasive and time-consuming treatments. In this study we develop a safe, non-invasive method to deliver an advanced and innovative therapeutic system directly within the wound tissue. Hereby our goal is to reduce wound related pain and to enable enhanced wound healing, by precisely controlled delivery of pharmaceutical molecules into the wound tissue of diabetic wounds. This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy of a wound healing system based on an active substance, nanocapsulations and electrostimulation on diabetic wounds. To test the effects, the study will compare patient groups treated with the advanced wound dressing to placebo and conventional dressings. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that wounds heal faster, and that the wound associated pain is reduced, when compared to placebo and conventional dressings. The primary study objective is therefore, to compare the time to healing of diabetic wounds treated with the wound healing system (WH-sys) in relation to conventional wound dressings. The secondary study objective is to examine any difference in wound related pain of diabetic wounds treated with the WH-sys in relation to conventional wound dressings.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Phase 2, Multi-center, Prospective, Blinded, Randomized, Crossover Study, Comparing the Time to Healing of Non-healing Diabetic Wounds Treated With and Without Electrostimulation of Nanocapsules\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDiabetes, Venous Ulcers, Diabetic Foot Ulcers, Wound Healing Disorder\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Novaspectra\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: 18-85 years old Has both feet Exclusion Criteria:",

Introduction\nNeuroblastoma is a cancer that affects infants and children, and it is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. It develops from immature cells in the sympathetic nervous system, which is part of the autonomic nervous system . Neuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most commonly found in the adrenal glands, neck, chest, and spine . Patients with neuroblastoma are typically diagnosed at a young age, with most cases occurring before the age of 5.\nThe standard treatment for patients with neuroblastoma consists of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. The goal of treatment is to shrink the tumor and kill the cancer cells.\nThe National Cancer Institute has classified neuroblastoma into different stages depending on the severity of the disease and the likelihood of achieving a complete response to treatment. This classification system is based on several factors, including the location of the tumor, the age of the patient, and the extent of the tumor.\nHigh-risk patients have a poor prognosis and are at a higher risk of relapse after initial treatment. This group of patients requires more aggressive treatment, such as intensive chemotherapy, stem cell transplants, radiation therapy, or other targeted therapy . Despite advances in treatment, the overall survival rate for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma is still low, highlighting the need for more effective therapies .\nNaxitamab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the disialoganglioside (GD2) antigen, which is expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma cells. It has been shown to have antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against neuroblastoma cells . GM-CSF, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, is a protein that stimulates the growth and differentiation of immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, which can also have antitumor activity. It is commonly used as a supportive therapy in patients receiving",

The first one is primary surgical tumor resection with anastomosis or only tumor resection without anastomosis. The intervention/treatment for this arm is primary tumor resection. This arm is crucial as it represents the standard approach for treating obstructive left colon cancer. It allows for the comparison between patients undergoing primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis or without an anastomosis (Hartmann's procedure).

In each study, researchers will find the highest tolerable dose of AKL-T04 in people who have been treated before or whose blood disease has come back (relapsed). In the relapsed study, a total of 54 patients will be enrolled; in the relapsed/refractory study, the 18 patients will be enrolled. T04 will be given by intravenous (IV) infusion (an injection through a thin flexible tube into a vein) at doses ranging from 0.3 to 3 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight per hour for a maximum of 12 continuous hours for six consecutive days or seven continuous hours per day for six consecutive days. On Day 7, patients who have completed AKL-T04 are followed until the end of the treatment phase of the study.

This would provide a reference point for understanding the clinical significance of elevated Vasorin levels in patients with septic shock and AKI. \n\nAbstract:\nObjectives: To assess the value of early sepsis\u2010related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (the primary outcome) and new score predicting septic shock (SAPS III score, the secondary outcome) (as well as procalcitonin (PCT), the exploratory outcome) as predictors of mortality over the entire ICU stay in septic patients. Methods: Data from over 2000 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with sepsis were analysed. Using a retrospective cohort analysis, the impact of the new SOFA score was studied in comparison with the standard SOFA score and the SAPS III score. Afterwards, patients were randomly divided into three strata of high, medium and low severity of illness (with mortality rate > 30%, 20\u201030% and 0\u201010%, respectively) on the first day for the development of mortality predictive scores based on admission data which were combined with 4\u2010h lactate measurement. Results: Patients with high, medium and low predicted mortality had a mortality rate of 68.29% vs. 25% vs. 0%, with a respective mortality risk ratio of 1\u2010severity score of 2.56 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.39 to 4.71). 4\u2010h lactate measurement predicted mortality independently of severity of illness, adding prognostic information to the severity score (p < 0.0001). Combined sepsis\u2010related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, SAPS III score and lactate value predicted mortality in a more accurate way than admission\u2010only admission scores. Conclusion: A combined model based on sepsis\u2010related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, SAPS III score and 4\u2010h lactate measurement is more accurate in predicting mortality over the entire ICU stay than admission\u2010only scores.

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of young coconut water, dark chocolate bar, and Ibuprofen in reducing the intensity of primary dysmenorrhea. Methods: A prospective, randomized, open\u2010label study was conducted in 30 female undergraduate students aged between 17 and 24 years who were diagnosed with primary dysmenorrhea. The patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 received young coconut water, Group 2 received a dark chocolate bar, and Group 3 received Ibuprofen. The primary outcome was the intensity of menstrual pain, measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) scored from 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most severe pain imaginable. The differences between the groups' VAS scores were compared using a multivariate covariance analysis adjusted for age, study group, and menstrual cycle phase. Results: There was no significant difference in the menstrual pain intensity between Group 1 and Group 2, but a significant difference was found between Group 2 and Group 3.

What ideas do you have for the participant group/arm and intervention/treatment? \n\nAbstract:\nObjective: Osteoporosis is a common clinical problem, affecting up to 20% of the population. It causes one in three hip fractures and one in five vertebral fractures, with significant morbidity and mortality. Although current therapies are effective in many cases, they have important limitations related to side effects, cost and lack of effect in certain patients (e.g. those with predominantly vertebral fractures or those with multiple vertebral fractures despite therapy). It is therefore imperative that new treatments are found, and in particular, an agent that is affordable. MAPK pathway inhibitors have already yielded beneficial effects for the treatment of cancers and may also be beneficial for osteoporosis. MAPK pathway kinase inhibition also produces loss of bone mass. This could potentially lead to adverse effects on bone formation, resulting in a negative effect on bone health. However, the loss of bone mass is not necessarily related to loss of bone quantity, density or fracture risk (i.e. secondary hyperparathyroidism), and in some cases, it may reduce bone resorption without reducing bone density (osteomalacia). Such therapeutic strategies appear to be preferable for individuals who are at risk of severe fractures but have normal or near\u2010normal bone mass, bone mass density, fracture risk or overall bone health. The aim of the current study is to determine if sotorasib reduces bone resorption in healthy males, and if a higher dose results in superior efficacy. Methods This will be a phase 1b, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, 38\u2010day study (with 35\u2010day follow\u2010up) of sotorasib in healthy male subjects, 18 to 55 years of age.

In patients with prior TIA or stroke, anticoagulants and aspirin are often prescribed to prevent stroke recurrence. However, anticoagulants increase the risk of haemorrhagic complications in the brain. Aspirin treatment is associated with dyspepsia, ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, aspirin monotherapy is not recommended in Asian patients with atrial fibrillation and history of stroke, while anticoagulant treatment is contraindicated in high-risk situations. This study will verify whether the safety and feasibility of using Chinese herbal medicine for prevention of stroke recurrence in these patients. Previous studies have shown that Chinese herbal medicine with anti-platelet effect could increase blood flow to the brain and decrease the risk of stroke by increasing the blood pressure in the brain. Chinese herbal medicines such as Danshen and Tianqingkang were shown to reduce the thickness of the capillary in the brain and improve platelet function. In this study, we will evaluate the effects of Chinese medicine on the safety and feasibility of using Chinese medicine in the prevention of stroke recurrence in patients with prior TIA or stroke who are currently taking anticoagulants.

METHODS: 1. Study Design: This was a double blinded, randomized controlled trial. Three sessions of BoNT\u2010injections were performed with three different substances (Botox, Dysport and placebo) for the study participants. In order to evaluate the subjective improvement of gait pattern with BoNT\u2010injections, a questionnaire survey was conducted before and after the three sessions of injections. Two raters also evaluated static equilibrium and gait pattern in a blinded fashion using an online video analysis program. Participants who were not diagnosed with cerebellar disorders prior to participation in our study were included in the control group. These individuals underwent a baseline evaluation at our facility but did not use the study drug and therefore, did not receive BoNT\u2010injections. RESULTS: Thirty\u2010seven patients with CA were included in the study. The mean age was (63.7 \u00b1 8.7) years. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics such as age and sex. The control group did not change in regard to static equilibrium and gait pattern from the baseline through week 12. When the study period (pre\u2010 and post\u2010three sessions of BoNT\u2010injection) was compared as a whole, the following findings were obtained: (1) There were no significant differences noted with a questionnaire survey prior and after three sessions of BoNT\u2010injection, and no significant differences were noted for any of ratings in static equilibrium. (2) Statistically significant differences were not noted between Dynamic Movement Syndrome Rating Scale (DMSRS) and the Tinetti Gait item among the 3 BoNT\u2010injection types. Intrarater and interrater reliability analysis revealed good\u2010to\u2010excellent reliability for all items. CONCLUSION: This study was successful in performing a blinded evaluation of the three BoNT\u2010in",

Experimental: real-rTMS\nParticipant Group/Arm: This arm includes individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease who will undergo real repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) sessions.\nIntervention/Treatment: The intervention involves 4 daily 25-minute high-frequency rTMS sessions over one week using a 70-mm figure-eight coil at 20Hz. Target localization will be performed with a stereotaxic neuronavigation system.\nReasoning: This arm is essential to test the efficacy of non-invasive stimulation techniques, specifically real rTMS, in modulating the default mode network (DMN) in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. By targeting this specific population with a known genetic risk factor for AD, the study aims to assess the potential benefits of this intervention in early stages of the disease.\n\n2. Sham Comparator: sham-rTMS\nParticipant Group/Arm: This arm serves as the control group in the study.\nIntervention/Treatment: Participants in this arm will undergo 4 daily 25-minute sham-rTMS sessions over one week, where the sham condition will mimic the real rTMS protocol but with a sham coil.\nReasoning: The inclusion of a sham comparator arm is crucial to establish the efficacy of the real rTMS intervention. By comparing the outcomes of the experimental arm with the control arm, researchers can determine whether the observed effects are due to the specific intervention or simply a placebo effect. This design helps ensure the validity and reliability of the study results.",

            "Certainly. The experimental treatment involves the use of tumor treating fields (TTFields) through the NovoTTF-200T portable system. The system consists of a generator and the transducer arrays that deliver the TTFields. The generator is worn outside the body, providing a low-intensity, intermediate frequency (150-200 kHz) electric field to the tumor site. The transducer arrays, which are placed on the skin with the assistance of ultrasound guidance, generate the electric field, which is delivered directly to the tumor. The electrical current in the field is thought to alter the microtubule formation within the tumor cells, leading to a reduction in their reproductive capacity and ultimate necrosis of the cells. \n\n\nI'd also suggest adding the information about the frequency and duration of the TTFields treatment. What is the duration of the TTFields treatment? \n\n\nThe TTFields treatment will be given for a duration of 18-24 hours per day, 7 days per week, for 2-6 months or until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or any other reason. The patients will also receive digital photographic documentation of the placement of the transducer arrays on their body, which will be taken before and after the TTFields treatment. \n\n\nThanks for the additional information.

Data will be monitored according to predetermined criteria. The committee will evaluate all non\u2010routine, unexpected adverse events (AEs) and suspected adverse reactions that potentially relate to Nesina and its excipients, for which AEs or suspected adverse reactions occur in more than 10% of study patients, or in patients under 18\u2009years of age (all dose levels), or in the event of a serious AE that potentially relates to Nesina, or that is serious in and of special interest to the pediatric population. Further, the committee will evaluate significant changes in ECG parameters, vital signs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests in clinical studies that occur in >10% of study patients (all dose levels), or in patients under 18\u2009years of age, or in the event of serious AE that potentially relates to Nesina. The committee will evaluate potential changes in ECG parameters, vital signs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests in clinical studies in the pediatric population. In clinical studies in which new safety information emerges, the committee will assess and review the data in a timely manner and recommend appropriate modification(s) of the study. Clinical study reports will be presented to the committee for each clinical study in which new safety information emerges or the number of study patients who experience an AE or suspected adverse reaction increases significantly. The committee will review each clinical study report and will make recommendations with respect to Nesina and its excipients, based on a balanced interpretation of the new information, the characteristics of the clinical study, and a review of the relevant literature. The committee may also discuss relevant information on relevant marketed products. The committee will not consider any administrative, scientific, or legal aspects other than safety.

Donor specific anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) antibodies (DSA) are a known risk factor for TRALI and transfusion-related acute lung injury, leading to reduced patient outcomes. This is problematic since in Europe and especially Italy, there is still a high rate of incompatibility at the ABO group. A study conducted in the 1990s showed that using A-A blood in ABO compatible transplants decreased the risk of TRALI and TRALI-associated complications at 15 days. It also enhanced survival at 15 days. In addition to lowering the risk of TRALI, the use of A-A blood is more cost-effective in the context of transplantation. However, this previous evidence was solely based on adult donors and was collected before the blood storage procedures were modified. In addition, the use of A-A",

            "Abstract:\nBackground: Early detection of pancreatic cancer (PC) offers a chance for curative treatment. In resectable PC, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) has been shown to be safe and feasible. However, LDP may not be suitable for some patients. Laparoscopic radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (LRAMPS) is a less invasive technique for resection of early\u2010stage left\u2010sided PC, which is a potentially curable approach to patients with pancreatic head and uncinate tumors and those who are candidates for central pancreatectomy. However, few studies have investigated LRAMPS for early\u2010stage left\u2010sided PC. The aim of our study was to compare the perioperative outcomes of LRAMPS and LDP in patients with early\u2010stage left\u2010sided PC. Methods: This study is a single\u2010center, prospective, comparative study including patients with early\u2010stage left\u2010sided PC who underwent LRAMPS or LDP from November 2018 to May 2022. The primary outcomes were conversion to open surgery and surgical complications. The secondary outcomes included operation time, operating cost, length of hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss, pathological tumor size, and tumor staging. Results: 21 patients were excluded because they declined or failed to participate, whereas 86 patients were included (49 males, 37 females; Median age 60 years, range 34\u201085 years). 43 patients underwent LRAMPS and 43 patients underwent LDP. The characteristics and perioperative outcomes of the two groups were compared. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of age, sex, body mass index, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, conversion to open surgery, pathological tumor size, tumor staging, or surgical complications. However, there was a significant difference in operating costs between the two groups (P=0.015). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary data on the feasibility and safety of LRAMPS for early\u2010s age left\u2010sided PC and compares perioperative outcomes with LDP.

Burn injuries are very common, with 100 burn injuries per 100,000 people per year. The resulting functional disabilities, pain, depressive thoughts, and decreased quality of life pose a great challenge for patients and are associated with psychosocial and economic complications. Furthermore, the increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder in adults compared to the rest of the population is frequently observed. In addition, many patients experience stigmatization or psychological suffering due to long-term effects of a burn. Furthermore, patients often cope poorly with the fact that their physical appearance is no longer the same, leading them to feel more distant from others. Previous studies have shown that peer-education can positively impact the health and well-being of people with cancer, as well as mental health and behavioral problems in adolescents. In order to increase the quality of life, the integration into society and the treatment of depression and anxiety, which is typical for patients with burns, in the past few years the Department of Dermatology in Freiburg has been using a peer-assisted education model (Peer Support Center) in the context of treatment and rehabilitation after a severe burn.

It will be compared with the non-personalized traditional face-to-face nutritional intervention approach followed by these patients (control group). 36 adult patients with a previous diagnosis of an IBD at Hospital Cl\u00ednic of Barcelona (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) and who have been diagnosed with a nutritional impairment will be recruited. The control group (n=18) will receive the conventional nutritional intervention, the NIP-1 group (n=18) will receive a personalized nutritional intervention through a platform, NIP-1, and both groups will be assessed after 3 months, in order to confirm or reject the effectiveness of the NIP-1 program.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe NIP-1 clinical trial proposes a personalized nutritional intervention (group NIP-1) that will be carried out through an innovative system called 'Virtual Nutritionist', through which patients will be able to receive customized and personalized nutritional information on the internet. We have developed a specific module to patients with IBD who have been diagnosed with a nutritional impairment that uses the most advanced nutritional assessment tool (Nutritional Assessment Tool with Comorbidities), designed by our research group. In order to validate the effectiveness of the NIP-1 intervention protocol, a controlled parallel randomized clinical trial will be carried out with patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (NIP-1 and control groups), who have been identified with a nutritional impairment (NUTRICAL 2002 classification; 1 or 2).

Currently there is no defined standard for grading microvascular lesions (MVL) by NVC. The goal of this study was to develop a NVC grading system for assessing the activity of the skin microvasculature and to evaluate different antiphospholipid and complement (PLC) markers in association with MVL.METHODOLOGY: Forty APS patients, 20 of whom were on treatment, underwent a baseline skin biopsy; NVC was performed within the following 1 year. Four consecutive NVC frames from each patient were independently graded by four observers on a scale from 0 to 4 for the presence of leukocyte\u2010activated endothelium (LE), necrotic fragments (NF), red blood cell aggregation (RBC), and fibrin thrombi (FT). The highest score (of the four frames) was reported for each patient. The scores obtained for each biopsy were combined to generate a composite grade of MVL (LE score + NF score \u00d7 RBC score \u00d7 FT score). Cutoff points for high and low composite grade were determined based on Youden's index in all APS patients and in APS patients on treatment. Samples from 40 non\u2010APS controls and 50 patients with other small vessel vasculitis syndromes were used as positive and negative controls.RESULTS: NVC composite grade (n = 40 patients) differed between treatment and untreated APS patients and was superior to each single NVC score. Treatment in APS patients and anti\u2010beta(2)\u2010glycoprotein I antibody levels, but not anticardiolipin antibody levels, were associated with disease activity according to the NVC composite grade.

The purpose of this prospective study is to describe biomarkers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), in ALL and compare changes in these biomarkers during the course disease.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study prospectively collects prospective clinical data, biospecimens, and outcomes of children and adults with ALL at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and other sites to answer the question of the impact of inflammatory processes and circulating inflammatory markers, such as CRP, on clinical outcomes in ALL. Biomarker measurements were recorded prospectively from consenting pediatric and adult patients with ALL who started therapy at MSKCC between January 2014 to December 2018 (clinical study phase). A separate study phase of molecular biomarker analysis was undertaken retrospectively in pediatric and adult ALL patients treated between 2012 and 2014. This study has also been approved by Western University of Health Science Institutional Review Board and by the Ethics Committee of French National Cancer Institute (INCa) [IRB #00004437-44].

The investigators are interested in studying the effects of the Ekso Robotic Exoskeleton system as a mechanism for providing high quality, high intensity, high repetition walking intervention and improving physical function and independence for individuals with Parkinson's disease.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground: Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurological condition affecting approximately 1 million individuals in the US and 10 million individuals globally. The effects of Parkinson's disease on the individual's quality of mobility are some of the most limiting, especially as the disease progresses.

These investigators will prospectively enroll patients undergoing interval surgeries for primary-advanced epithelial ovarian cancer and histologically verified non-malignant disease. Each patient will undergo a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis. The investigators will use software to segment the volume of interest and create a 3-D model using 3-D printing technology. The 3-D models will then be compared to the actual surgical pathology specimens to determine the accuracy of staging and margins. The investigators will also use the 3-D model to measure tumor volumes and estimate the amount of free peritoneal fluid and fluid tumor burden. A multivariable model to predict recurrent disease based on model-derived measurements will be created and validated. Patients will be followed for up to two years to determine the disease-free survival rate based on",

Monitoring ctDNA in this group can help detect minimal residual disease and predict recurrence, providing valuable information for clinical decision-making.\n\n2. Participant Group/Arm: Patients undergoing interval debulking surgery (IDS)\nIntervention/Treatment: Dynamic monitoring of ctDNA during and after chemotherapy\nReasoning: This arm targets patients undergoing IDS, who may have residual disease after initial treatment. Monitoring ctDNA in this group can help assess the response to chemotherapy and predict recurrence, guiding further treatment strategies.\n\n3. Participant Group/Arm: Control group\nIntervention/Treatment: Standard monitoring methods (e.g. CA125 levels)\nReasoning: Including a control group that receives standard monitoring methods allows for comparison with the ctDNA dynamic monitoring approach.

In this context, cervical cytology is the most commonly used screening method in countries where the costs of using it are limited. This study aims to assess the efficacy and acceptability of a new cervical cytology screening model with the simultaneous collection of HPV and cytology samples.

Ninety consecutive high-risk adult obese patients scheduled for gastrointestinal endoscopy under deep sedation were included. Data on demographics, sedation depth, cardio-respiratory changes and complications, post-sedation recovery and satisfaction, complications of the post anesthetic care unit (PACU), and the incidence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) were collected. In group A and B, supplemental oxygen was provided with oxygen cannula, while there was no oxygen support in group C. No patients were allocated in group D because of the ethical dilemma of not providing oxygen. The primary outcome was the incidence of desaturation (defined as the lowest recorded O2 saturation in the study period <90% SpO2). All consecutive patients were monitored with pulse oximetry during and immediately after the procedure for 1 hour. Adverse events were recorded during the entire study period. Satisfaction was measured by a self-reported recovery questionnaire and a short-question post-sedation recovery assessment tool. Statistical analysis was done using the Mann Whitney U test and the Chi-square test. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nComparison of 3 Different Modules of Supplemental Oxygen for the Avoidance of Desaturation During Deep Sedation in Obese High-risk Patients Undergoing Gastrointestinal Endoscopy: An Open-label Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nObesity, High-risk Patients Undergoing Gastrointestinal Endos",

As in other chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) one of its main components seems to be microbial dysbiosis. Therefore, microbiome research focuses on increasing and stabilising bacterial diversity as an approach to treat patients with MC. A specific group of bacteria consists of different bacteriophage groups which have an important role in gut health. However, little is known about phage diversity in the gut. The investigators aim to find out whether the phageome of patients with Active Lupus Enteritis with a normal diversity of gut bacteria could be normalised without causing side effects by bacteriophage treatment in Crohn patients.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is a single-center, open-label, single-arm, single-dose, multi-target phase II clinical trial. 8 patients with moderately active but well controlled luminal Crohn's Colitis will be enrolled and treated with a single intake of bacteriophage cocktail AKU-001. The participants will be followed up for one year with follow-up visits at 3, 8, 12 week, 6 months (m), 9 m, and 12 m. They will be assessed clinically and through gut microbiome composition analysis. Primary endpoint is the safety and tolerability of bacteriophage cocktail AKU-001. Secondary endpoints are a composite of the reduction of inflammation as measured by ultrasound and endoscopy of gut inflammation. Secondary endpoints are bacteriophage abundance (composition of the bacteriophages and bacteriophage diversity) at day 7 and 1 week, improvement of symptoms as assessed with subjective questionnaires, and the microbiome diversity at day 7 and 1 week.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nOpen-label, Single Dose, Single-Arm, Multi-Target Study Featuring the Effects of a Single Intake of Phage Cocktail AKU-001 on the Active Lupus Enteritis and"

            "Abstract:\nBackground: Kidney disease is a growing public health issue worldwide. It is a chronic disease that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Non\u2010communicable diseases including diabetes and hypertension often cause kidney disease. Increasing evidence suggests that these two diseases may share a common underlying mechanism that contributes to the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aimed to assess if a specific circulating biomarker of beta\u2010cell dysfunction, islet\u2010 Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP), is associated with the deterioration of kidney function in subjects with T2DM complicated with hypertension. Method: We conducted a cross\u2010sectional study in 955 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. These patients were divided into three groups according to their eGFR (eGFR <60ml/min/ 1.73m2, 60\u201090ml/min/ 1.73m2, and >90mL/min/ 1.73m2). We determined the levels of IAPP, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urinary albumin\u2010creatinine ratio (UACR) for each group. Results: The mean value of UACR was significantly higher in both eGFR <60 ml/min/ 1.73m2 group and eGFR>90ml/min/ 1.73m2 group than in eGFR60\u201090ml/min/ 173m2 group. The mean levels of IAPP in all groups were significantly different [p< 0.05]. There was a positive correlation between the levels of IAPP and eGFR. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that elevated levels of IAPP were associated with an increased risk of eGFR <60ml/min/ 1.73m2, which after further adjustment by known risk factors for kidney damage associated with diabetic patients, the results still showed that high levels of IAPP were associated with an increased risk of reduced eGFR [adjusted OR 2.48 (95% CI: 1.49 \u2010 4.09), p<0.05). Conclusion: Elevated",

Current guidelines recommend biopsychosocial treatment interventions for optimizing patient outcomes. Most current interventions are delivered by physical or mental health professionals in clinical settings and are not sustainable or accessible to many patients with LBP. Innovation Description: Online tele\u2010rehabilitation interventions have the potential to increase accessibility and utilization of treatment. This study will evaluate both feasibility and efficacy of an innovative approach to providing patient\u2010tailored treatment for LBP via telephone and the internet. This study aims to enhance and maintain patient activation, self\u2010efficacy, pain, functioning, and well\u2010being following the completion of a 6\u2010week self\u2010management treatment, a 12\u2010week health behavior counseling maintenance intervention, and a 6\u2010week telephone/internet booster intervention for patients referred to generalized adult pain clinics. Methods: Participants will be referred from generalized adult pain clinics to a pilot randomized controlled trial. Participants will receive a 6\u2010week self\u2010management program and/or a telephone\u2010based health behavior change counseling program. Participants will be trained to use the intervention technology, complete self\u2010management goals, and engage with the study team and coaches for 6 weeks. Outcome measures will be collected at screening, post\u2010intervention, and at 6\u2010month follow\u2010up to evaluate intervention feasibility, acceptance, and efficacy. Discussion: Results will determine whether a telephone and online self\u2010management\u2010oriented intervention model is feasible and acceptable. A larger follow\u2010up trial will test the efficacy."

Despite initial success, many patients relapse after CAR\u2010T cell treatment. Studies have shown that relapse in MM frequently occurs due to heterogeneity and genomic changes. Therefore, individualized treatment strategies are needed to address the challenges of relapsed MM. Recently, ICI201, a GPRC5D\u2010targeting CAR\u2010T cell therapy, has achieved significant anti\u2010tumor activity in some patients with relapsed MM. However, many patients relapse after ICI201 treatment. We propose a randomized, controlled study to investigate the efficacy of two treatment strategies for relapsed MM after ICI201 treatment: a proteasome inhibitor plus bortezomib vs. lenalidomide. Methods: This is a prospective, single\u2010center study designed to investigate the efficacy of two treatment strategies for relapsed MM after ICI201 treatment: a proteasome inhibitor plus bortezomib (arm A) vs. lenalidomide (arm B). Inclusion criteria: 18\u201075 years old; relapsed MM after ICI201 treatment; ECOG score 0\u20102; adequate organ function; informed consent. The primary endpoint of this study is the overall response rate (ORR) between two treatment strategies. The secondary endpoints are progression\u2010free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety and adverse events. Discussion: This study investigates the efficacy of two treatment strategies for relapsed MM after ICI201 treatment, which has important clinical implications for individualized treatment of MM.

CAR-T cells are genetically engineered T cells redirected to target specific antigens expressed by cancer cells. In the case of MM, GPRC5D, a highly expressed surface antigen, has emerged as an attractive target for CAR-T cell therapy. Preclinical studies of GPRC5D-targeted CAR-T cells have demonstrated potent antitumor activity against MM cell lines and patient-derived xenografts.\n\nRecent clinical trials of GPRC5D-targeted CAR-T cell therapies have"

            "Thank you for the information. Now, let's discuss the study type and phase. What type of study is it, and in which phase is it currently? \n\nAbstract:\nAims: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most frequent male genital sexual dysfunction, with approximately 52% of men over 40 years old. Current ED treatments include oral drugs, penile injection, vacuum pump, implantable rod, and surgical techniques. There are no studies evaluating the use of an innovative vacuum assistance device (P\u2010shot pump) in the treatment of ED. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to analyze in primary care the effects of the P\u2010shot pump on the intensity of sexual desire, in men with ED at the time of prostate resection (P0) and during the healing process (P30). For recruitment, patients with symptomatic BPH submitted to surgical treatment (transurethral adenomectomy) by the surgeon were randomly distributed into two groups: Group 1 (G1) received the P\u2010shot pump intervention (n=10) and group 2 (G2) did not receive any intervention (control group) (n=10). All participants answered the Sexual Desire Scale developed by Bancroft before surgery (P0), and 30 days after surgery (P30). Participants answered questions on the presence or absence of difficulty in sexual activity and the degree of difficulty. These questions were used to compare the intensity of sexual desire between participating groups and to identify the influence of surgery in the course of sexual desire. The results obtained during the study were compared using descriptive and bivariate analytical methods. The level of significance adopted was 5%. Results: The result of the chi\u2010squared test showed a significant difference between the groups (p=0.021), both when the total sexual desire score was measured and for each question (p=0.003, p=0.012, and p=0.041). Conclusions: Patients with a history or previous risk factors for sexual desire decreased after prostate resection. The use of the P\u2010shot pump contributed to sexual rehabilitation and helped maintain the intensity of sexual desire in these patients.",

The current standard of care for the treatment of completely resected pIB-IIIA NSCLC with common EGFR mutations (Del19 or L858R) is adjuvant chemotherapy followed by osimertinib. Osimertinib is approved as a second-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC that has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. However, some patients experience resistance to osimertinib treatment, leading to disease progression. The development of resistance mechanisms to osimertinib is known to occur in up to 60% of patients who have been treated with osimertinib for a long duration. The proposed research is aimed at identifying molecular prognostic factors and resistance mechanisms to osimertinib adjuvant treatment in completely resected pIB-IIIA NSCLC with common EGFR mutations. The study seeks to determine specific genetic mutations that may affect patient survival, disease recurrence, and the ability of osimertinib to control the disease. By collecting samples of tumor and plasma at different time points, we will study the genetic profile of the tumor and the development of resistance mechanisms to osimertinib. These findings could help researchers in the development of new treatment strategies to prevent disease recurrence and improve patient outcomes. Therefore, the study will be of great significance in exploring the development of targeted therapies for lung cancer and will further enhance our knowledge of the biological behavior of EGFR-mutated lung cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBACKGROUND: Approximately 80% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is adenocarcinoma. This study is aimed at examining the molecular mechanisms of disease progression in patients with EGFR mutations treated with osimertinib as part of routine clinical practice during adjuvant treatment. OBJECTIVES: Primary: To determine whether there are specific genetic mutations in the DNA of the primary tumor and distant metastases that predict subsequent relapse,",

What are the primary and secondary outcomes of this study? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) affects 10 to 20% of premature newborns. The administration of betamethasone (BTM) for the treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, an approach commonly used in neonatology, is associated with an increased risk of PDA. Methodology: The objective of this monocenter cohort study is to examine the impact of repeated administration of systemic BTM on the closure of DA in premature infants with PDA and bronchopulmonary dysplasia by measuring the evolution of DA diameter according to administration routes of BTM. Results: From January 2018 to December 2022, 247 subjects were included in our study group. A comparison of baseline characteristics between the BTM and non\u2010BTM groups showed significant differences in gestational age (31.8 \u00b1 0.8 versus 29.8 \u00b1 0.8, P = .03) and duration of surfactant therapy (13.4 \u00b1 0.3 versus 7.4 \u00b1 0.2, P < .0001). A comparison of the distribution of baseline characteristics between subjects in whom the DA closed and those in whom the DA persisted showed significant differences in gestational age (31.9 \u00b1 0.5 versus 29.3 \u00b1 0.6, P < .001) and surfactant treatment (13.0 \u00b1 1.1 versus 8.0 \u00b1 0.9, P < .001). The probability of the DA closing was higher in the BTM group (90% versus 61.7%, P = .02). Conclusion: Betamethasone, which is commonly used in neonatology, increases the chances of PDA closure in premature infants. Further investigation is needed to assess whether the repeated use of BTM reduces the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in these infants.",

            "Sure, you can include infants that are born before 37 weeks of gestation, as this is typically the criteria for determining premature birth and also a known risk factor for PDA. \n\nAlso, I would recommend including neonates born after 28 weeks of gestation, as this is commonly the point of viability and therefore those with PDA may also require treatment with BTM. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the inclusion criteria may vary depending on local standards, so you may want to consult with your colleagues or your IRB (Institutional Review Board) to confirm the appropriate criteria for your study. \n\nHope this helps, and feel free to reach out if you have any further questions. \n\n[OUTCOME] The primary outcome is the incidence of DA closure after betamethasone treatment before discharge or death after treatment, and the secondary outcome is to determine whether the administration of betamethasone is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a reduction in the use of vasoactive drugs during hospitalization. [/OUTCOME]\nThis is an interesting question. We would advise that the outcomes should be carefully thought through and clearly defined before starting the study. \n\nIn general, the primary outcome of a clinical trial should be measurable, objective, and relevant to the research question being addressed. In this case, as you mentioned, the outcome could be the incidence of DA closure after betamethasone treatment. The treatment should be well-defined and documented, and the measurement of DA closure should be standardized and reliable. Additionally, the time frame for outcome assessment should be clearly specified. \n\nFor the secondary outcome, it is crucial to consider the endpoints that would be most closely related to the treatment. In this case, hospitalization length and use of vasoactive drugs are two possible outcomes, and they should be directly related to the treatment and feasible to measure. \n\nWhen defining the outcomes, it is also necessary to consider the statistical power of the study. It is always important to have a sufficient sample size to detect clinically meaningful differences between treatment and control groups, while avoiding excessive costs and resources. \n\nHope this helps, and feel free to reach out if you have any further questions. \n\n[STUDY DURATION] The study will have a duration of one month, from January 1st, 20",

The revised selection criteria will help us to address the research question more effectively. \n\nAbstract:\nObjective : To assess the effect of percutaneous closure using collagen plug for closing the patent ductus arteriosus on aortopulmonary collateral flow in neonates with pulmonary hypertension. Methods : A prospective clinical investigation conducted on randomly selected term and preterm infants with persistent patent ductus arteriosus admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Mansoura University Children's Hospital was included. They were undergone balloon\u2010occlusion to occlude the ductus arteriosus (DA) using collagen plug. Aortic coarctation and branch pulmonary artery stenosis were found by transthoracic echocardiography using two\u2010dimensional, color Doppler ultrasonography and three different views. The presence of aortopulmonary collateral flow was assessed using two\u2010dimensional, color Doppler ultrasound. Results : The study included 30 cases. The mean age at admission was 5 days. The mean gestational age at delivery in the cases assigned the duct treatment was 26.5 \u00b1 1.48 weeks, and in the cases assigned the coarctation treatment was 35.26 \u00b1 1.07 weeks (P < 0.05). There was a difference between the two groups as to the mode of delivery, which was 58.3% caesarean section in the DA group, while none of the patients in the coarctation group was delivered by caesarean section (P < 0.05). No aortopulmonary collateral flow was detected in the patient treated for patent ductus using collagen plug to occlude the patent ductus. Conclusion : No aortopulmonary collateral flow was detected using the percutaneous collagen plug to occlude the patent ductus arteriosus in the term and preterm neonates.",

Methods: Forty patients with recurrent ankle sprains were included in the study. The patients consisted of the 20 patients in the functional group and the 20 patients in the no brace group, randomly chosen. The patients were evaluated through range of motion (ROM). A functional ankle stabilizer was applied for 2.5 hours per day for 5 weeks to the patients in the control group. In the control group, the participants were asked to wear FAB during daily activities. Proprioception and balance tests were applied. The results were evaluated with the Wilcoxon test. Results: There was no difference between the functional group and the control group in terms of proprioception and balance (proprioception p=0.951, balance p=0.198) and in terms of active and passive range of motion (p>0.05).

Experimental Arm (CM313 Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 30 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive CM313.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of CM313 injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: This arm is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of CM313 in treating immune thrombocytopenia. By administering CM313 to a subset of patients, researchers can evaluate the drug's effectiveness in improving platelet counts and reducing symptoms. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design ensures unbiased results and allows for comparison with the placebo arm.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator Arm (Placebo Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 15 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive placebo.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of placebo injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: The placebo comparator arm is essential to establish the baseline for comparison with the CM313 intervention arm. By including a placebo group, researchers can assess the true effects of CM313 beyond any placebo effects. This arm helps to control for confounding variables and provides a more accurate assessment of the drug's efficacy and safety.",

The shortage is predicted to worsen with the aging out of thousands of current technicians. Hundreds of pharmacy educational programs have been established in the past 20 years, but it is difficult to predict the exact number of new pharmacy technicians graduating and available to fill the position of practicing technician. Pharmacy technician students do not require completion of an educational program nor registration to begin practicing as a pharmacy technician. This lack of educational and training standards makes it difficult to estimate the number of future pharmacy technicians. To accurately estimate workforce projections for pharmacy technicians, enrollment data for new pharmacy technician graduates can be used with population growth, and job-related turnover (i.e., attrition) and retirement can be used with job-related transition (i.e., advancement) rates. This protocol is designed to describe the enrollment of pharmacy technician students in the first semester of 2016-2017 through 2020-2021 to estimate the future number of newly trained technicians who can be expected to register, seek employment, and become working pharmacy technicians in the US.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nProjecting the Future Pharmacy Workforce: An Analysis of Current and Future Pharmacy Technician Enrollment\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nPharmacy Workforce\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: pharmacy technician enrollment at accredited programs in the United States\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Pharmacy technician students enrolled in the first semester of 2016-2017 through 2020-2021 Exclusion Criteria: Pharmacy technician students enrolled in any other semester than the first semester\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nMinimum Age: All\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nAll\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n-----------------\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\nHow is the",

However, the efficacy of these tailored interventions among women who abuse drugs in the real world of diverse outpatient treatment settings is unknown. Aim 1 of this study will test the efficacy of a tailored gender-focused brief intervention (TGFi-B), compared to a non-tailored intervention (B), to reduce alcohol use among women being treated for opioid use disorder. Women will be randomized 1:1 (50-50) to either receive TGFi-B or B in addition to the usual care treatment protocol at the New Hanover County Treatment Outpatient Program (TOP). Aim 2 of this study will test the efficacy of the intervention using an implementation-effectiveness trial design, in which the intervention is delivered by treatment staff (therapy assistants or substance abuse counselors) according to a manualized treatment protocol. All participants will receive a standard behavioral intervention at baseline, followed by motivational enhancement therapy-like sessions. The Aim 1 hypotheses are that compared to B, TGFi-B will: (1) lead to greater reductions in alcohol use; (2) lead to greater improvements in risk risky sex; (3) lead to greater increases in self-efficacy for refusing alcohol in gender-typical social situations; and (4) lead to lower HIV risk attitudes. The Aim 2 hypotheses are as follows: (1) treatment staff will adequately deliver the intervention; (2) receipt of the TGFi-B intervention (versus B only) will reduce alcohol use; (3) receipt of the TGFi-B intervention will reduce risky sex and increase condom use; (4) receipt of the TGFi-B intervention will increase self-efficacy for refusing alcohol and reduce HIV risk attitudes; (5) receipt of the TGFi-B intervention will achieve a similar clinical dose as the BI with fewer sessions for participants in the TGFi",

            "Ahn et al.\nBrief summary in scientific language\n=================\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent and serious condition, and there are currently no proven effective therapies for patients with OSA who have failed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) due to intolerance or non-adherence. Moreover, the majority of patients prefer surgery to CPAP. Recent studies have demonstrated that the tonsils and adenoids are important sites for the treatment of OSA. Tonsillectomy is commonly performed for the treatment of tonsillitis. But endoscopic tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy causes pain, hemorrhage, and fever, which decreases the compliance of surgery. Partial tonsillectomy is less damaging to the palatine arch tissues, and the recovery is less painful than total tonsillectomy. In previous studies, partial tonsillectomy has been shown to reduce the adenoid tissue volume in the nasopharynx and improve subjective symptoms and objective findings of OSA in children. Therefore, we want to study the effect of partial tonsillectomy on adults with OSA. The aim of this pilot study is to assess the therapeutic effect of partial tonsillectomy on adult OSA. \n\nBrief summary in lay language\n=================\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleeping disorder in which a person's breathing stops and starts repeatedly during sleep. This can happen hundreds of times a night. The cause of OSA is a blockage in the airway (narrowest opening in the neck) causing an obstruction to the flow of air at the top of the throat. OSA has been linked with daytime fatigue, high blood pressure, an increased risk of heart disease, and depression. CPAP therapy, which involves wearing a mask over the nose while sleeping, is often prescribed for patients with OSA. In fact, CPAP therapy is the first treatment recommended for these patients. However, some patients do not respond to CPAP therapy because they have intolerance or non-adherence to CPAP, in which case treatment is necessary. Currently, there are no proven effective therapies for these patients, and they often require surgery. The most common surgery is adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for the treatment of OSA in children. An",

The mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains poorly understood. Sympathetic overactivity and impairment of neurovascular function have been proposed as potential contributors to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. This study aims to investigate the role of the sympathetic nervous system and neurovascular function in patients with SCAD using quantitative measurement and ultrasound-based imaging with a control group of healthy volunteers. The study will include participants with SCAD and healthy controls matched for age, gender and body mass index (BMI). The study participants will undergo a series of tests to assess their sympathetic nervous system and neurovascular function including an arterial stiffness test, an echocardiogram, carotid ultrasounds, elastography, Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) and microneurography with sympathoexcitatory maneuvers. By comparing the results of these tests, the study hopes to elucidate the role of the sympathetic nervous system and neurovascular function in the development and progression of SCAD. The findings of this study may identify novel therapeutic targets for the management of SCAD and potentially other cardiovascular conditions.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare but life-threatening cause of acute coronary syndrome. The exact pathophysiology of SCAD remains poorly understood, and there is growing evidence to suggest that sympathetic nerve hyperactivity and impaired neurovascular function may contribute to the development and progression of the disease. The current proposed research aims to investigate the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and neurovascular function in patients with SCAD using quantitative measurement and ultrasound-based imaging.

The women were subjected to a standardized exercise regimen and were randomly partitioned into two groups. The experimental group took 1200 mg of ESCC every day for 4 months, while the control group took a placebo. At the beginning and conclusion of the study, as well as at randomization points, blood samples and visual analogue scale (VAS) evaluation of the participants' pain levels were taken.Results: Our investigation revealed that ESCC consumption for four months resulted in considerable decreases in the VAS scale for pain. As a consequence, ESCC was discovered to have anti\u2010inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which are associated with chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis. Conclusion: In this particular group of women, the use of ESCC for four months resulted in significant benefits in terms of pain severity, with improvements in the antioxidant and anti\u2010inflammatory processes and pain\u2010related hormones."

When do you plan to start? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study is being conducted, simultaneously, at the University of California San Diego, Shands Jackson-ville Hospital/University of Florida, Medical College of Wisconsin/Froedtert Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital. The purpose of this study is to understand whether the VQm PHM correctly measures the respiratory-related physiologic parameters and to observe whether the VQm PHM can be used effectively with hospitalized patients. The VQm PHM is a new, non-invasive device that estimates respiratory system function. The VQm PHM is used by placing it on the fingers of the hand. When this is accomplished, the VQm PHM automatically obtains respiration rates and heart rates. When placed on the hand, the VQm PHM estimates total ventilation, exhaled tidal volume, exhaled dead space, and exhaled dead space-to-tidal volume ratio. In addition, exhaled CO2 is estimated. We will use the data collected by the VQm PHM and the data collected routinely by ICUs in the respective institutions to test the accuracy of the VQm PHM. These analyses will be done both at the bedside and at the clinical center in an off-line manner. We will also compare the VQm PHM values at bedside and off-line to see if they are concordant. In addition, we will see if there is a significant change in respiratory function (compared to the usual clinical measures obtained at the bedside) and/or cardiac function (compared to echocardiography) when patients exhibit clinical changes such as the development of hypoxemia, the development of atelectasis, and the presence of new pneumonia. We will also observe whether the VQm PHM can be used by ICU personnel for the following purposes: evaluating hemodynamic stability, identifying the early signs of inadequate oxygenation or ventilation, detecting the early signs of atelectasis, and detecting the early signs of hypoxemia and pneumonia. For the purposes of this study, we will examine one VQm PHM per subject. Subjects will receive their routine clinical care",

GIB is the second most common complication of EMR after ulcer formation. It has been suggested by previous studies that preprocedural steroid therapy decreases the incidence of GIB. However, the evidence for preprocedural steroid therapy in the prevention of GIB is scarce. So, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of preprocedural intranasal dexamethasone on the incidence and severity of GIB following EMR for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of 120 patients scheduled to undergo EMR for gastrointestinal tumors at the Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital from June 2022 to June 2024. The patients will be randomly divided into two groups. Those in the intervention group will receive intranasal dexamethasone once a day one day prior to EMR, while the control group will not receive any drugs. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of GIB within one month after EMR. Secondary endpoints include the incidence of GIB within 30 and 90 days after EMR, the severity of GIB, the incidence of ulcer formation, and the incidence of adverse reactions. Conclusion: This is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of preprocedural intranasal dexamethasone in the prevention of GIB after EMR. If effective,",

            "Thank you for the design details. Now, based on the information provided, I can assist you in designing the study arms. Let's start with Dose Level -1. The participant group/arm for this dose level is patients receiving 1x10(7) TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The intervention/treatment is TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells. This arm is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a lower dose of TmPSMA-02 CAR T cells in patients with mCRPC. Starting at a lower dose allows for the assessment of any potential adverse effects or toxicities associated with the treatment. It is a necessary step in the dose escalation design of the trial to ensure patient safety and determine the optimal therapeutic dose. What do you think?",
            "For Dose Level 1, the participant group/arm is patients receiving 5x10(7) TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The intervention/treatment remains as TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells. This arm aims to assess the safety and efficacy of a slightly higher dose of TmPSMA-02 CAR T cells compared to Dose Level -1. By increasing the dose incrementally, we can observe any dose-dependent effects on patient outcomes and determine the maximum tolerated dose. This arm helps to establish the dose-response relationship and inform future treatment strategies. What are your thoughts?",
            "Excellent! For Dose Level 2, the participant group/arm is patients receiving 1x10(8) TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The intervention/treatment remains as TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells. This arm investigates the safety and potential efficacy of a higher dose of TmPSMA-02 CAR T cells. The escalation to Dose Level 2 allows us to further explore the therapeutic window of the treatment and gather more data on the optimal dose for maximum benefit. It is a crucial step in the dose escalation process to determine the most effective dose for potential future use. What do you think?",
            "Great! For Dose Level 3, the participant group/arm is patients receiving 3x10(8) TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The intervention/treatment remains as TmPSMA-02 CAR T Cells. This arm evaluates the safety and efficacy of the highest dose of TmPSMA-02 CAR T cells in this trial. By testing Dose Level 3, we can assess the upper limit of tolerability and efficacy of the treatment. This dose level allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the therapeutic potential of TmPSMA-02 CAR T cells and provides valuable information for future clinical development. It helps to determine the maximum achievable benefit while minimizing potential risks. What are your thoughts on this final dose level?",

In addition, the withdrawal symptoms for opioids are less tolerable than those for alcohol. The development of safe withdrawal medications has therefore been deemed extremely important. Although the effectiveness of buprenorphine as an outpatient anti-withdrawal medication for alcohol abuse has been reported in previous studies, its application as an outpatient treatment for withdrawal symptoms of opioids has not been sufficiently studied, and its pharmacokinetics in this setting are unknown. In this study, the pharmacokinetics (PK),safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine were investigated in patients suffering from opioid withdrawal at 6, 12, 24, and 36 hours after administration.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nApplication of Buprenorphine Hydroch",

We'll have four arms in this phase: Expansion-1 Cohort 1, Expansion-1 Cohort 2, Expansion-2 Cohort 1, and Expansion-2 Cohort 2. \nIt sounds like a lot of arms, but each arm has its purpose. For example, in Cohort 1 of Expansion-1, the goal is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NKT2152 in combination with palbociclib and sasanlimab at an RDE dosage, while in Cohort 2 of Expansion-1, the goal is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NKT2152 in combination with palbociclib and sasanlimab at an RDE-1 dosage. Can you tell me more about the Expansion-2 Cohort 1 and 2 arms? \n\nWhat about the control arms in the Study? \nAre there any plans for a placebo or control group in the clinical trial? \n\n\n\nThe Study is not expected to have a placebo or control group. As there is no standard therapy for metastatic ccRCC, it is a complex disease that is difficult to treat, and there are limited treatment options available, this is a trial evaluating a new treatment option with a combination of NKT2152, palbociclib, and sasanlimab. The primary purpose of the trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NKT2152 in combination with the other two drugs in participants with locally advanced or metastatic ccRCC. \n\n\n\n\nIf there are no other treatment options, why are you not including a placebo or control group in the study? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no other treatment options available to participants in the study, and the study drug combination of NKT2152, palbociclib, and sasanlimab is a novel and potentially effective treatment option.

Thanks for taking part in this study. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis trial of the Voyager intravascular ultrasound system aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with the Voyager system for atherosclerotic renal and peripheral arterial disease (AR/PAD) patients with an angiographic lesion located within the superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal artery, or tibial artery. Lesion location determines treatment protocol. This is to be the first randomized trial of IVUS-guided percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) versus standard percutaneous therapy for AR/PAD patients. Enrolment is planned for up to approximately 30 AR/PAD patients in the United States who are presenting without symptoms at the time of elective revascularization. Randomization will be accomplished during the procedure and stratified by the location of study lesions. The study subjects will be followed up for 12 months.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nTreatment of atherosclerotic disease (ASD) with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was approved by the FDA in 1996 for coronary applications. IVUS-guided treatment with coronary stenting was first performed in 1995. Currently no FDA-approved indication for peripheral applications of IVUS exists. In a previously completed un-randomized prospective single-center clinical trial using the Voyager system to guide stenting (the 'MARLON' trial), a 100% success rate was achieved with all endovascular lesions treated. Moreover, a significant reduction of technical complications was demonstrated when Voyager-guided stenting was performed. Thus the investigators now propose to conduct a randomized investigation of the safety, and efficacy of IVUS-guided treatment versus best medical therapy using standard percutaneous interventional techniques (e.g. balloon angioplasty and stent placement) for the treatment of atherosclerotic renal and peripheral arterial disease (AR/PAD) patients with an SFA, popliteal artery, or tibial artery lesion."

It is a pilot study with 90 participants who will receive either nicotine gum, electronic cigarette, or placebo patch. The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of using ECs in the same manner as that of nicotine gum (a medically accepted smoking cessation aid) to assist users to quit smoking, relative to a placebo patch.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe study will test the hypothesis that electronic cigarette (EC) and nicotine gum will yield higher rates of 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA 7) than placebo, but with comparable adverse effects. The primary outcome for this study is the 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates (PPA-7). Secondary outcomes include continuous abstinence rates (CAR), smoking reduction rates, expired carbon monoxide (CO) levels, number of cigarettes per day (CPD), and adverse effects.

Participant Group/Arm: Healthy Control Group\n   Intervention/Treatment: Participants in this arm will serve as healthy controls to provide baseline data for comparison with renal tumor patients undergoing 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT imaging. This arm is important to establish normal ranges and patterns of 18F-FAPI-RGD uptake in healthy individuals, which can aid in interpreting the results of the imaging studies in renal tumor patients. This arm will help differentiate normal physiological uptake from pathological uptake in renal tumors, enhancing the diagnostic utility of 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT in this patient population."

Patients will be centrally randomized based on their eligibility status at the time of randomization, using an unstratified computer-generated block randomization scheme with variable block sizes to ensure a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients are stratified by the following factors: MRI/PET positivity/negativity, MSS/SD/Hi-R- ISS stage, and cytogenetics status (normal or abnormal).\nBlinding\nThe participants will enroll in this protocol on the basis that neither they nor the staff that conducts the trial will know whether they received lenalidomide or iberdomide until after all the data have been collected.\nIntervention\nThe control arm employs the current standard of care (SOC) for the newly diagnosed MM population, based on the findings from the TCVP (thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, dexamethasone) regimen combined with high-dose melphalan and ASCT consolidation.\nFor patients who are ineligible for full-dose lenalidomide, the protocol allows dose reduction to a 15\u201325\u2009mg dose as tolerated, which is standard practice for lenalidomide and similar drugs in all diseases treated by the NMTRD. If a patient is unable to tolerate the reduced dose (either intolerable adverse events or laboratory toxicity), he/she may be administered no lenalidomide or placebo.\n\nAdditionally, this control arm consists of cyclophosphamide (1\u2009g/m2 day",

However, this treatment regimen also has many patients who relapse within two years, and approximately half of them eventually die of MM. To reduce relapse and to improve survival, new agents with an effective mechanism of action must be explored.

The use of pneumoperitoneum to distend the peritoneal cavity can reduce postoperative pain and hospital stays. However, intra-abdominal bacterial translocation during surgery can affect wound integrity and has been associated with an increase in wound infections and abdominal insufficiency syndromes. The use of antibiotics peri-operatively is recommended by the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products to reduce the burden of pathogenic bacteria in the abdominal cavity. However, the best regimen is not well established and is not adapted to all procedures. Oral antimicrobials have the advantage of an antibacterial efficacy that is independent of the duration of the drug level in the bloodstream and of the peritoneal compartment. An oral dose 1 hour before skin incision is likely to be taken up by the peritoneal cavity during surgery. Propylaxis of abdominal insufficiency syndrome should not be forgotten. Its frequency varies between 0 and 24%. It is a complication often associated with bacterial translocation. Treatments are symptomatic and only supportive. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a prophylactic regimen with ciprofloxacin on the reduction of surgical site infection rates based on the CDC definition: infection that occurs within a radius of 30 days from the beginning of surgery.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nUse of Oral Prophylactic Ciprofloxacin for All Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery: A Multicentre, Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------",

Do you have information about the estimated sample size? \n\nAbstract:\nPatients who are unable to undergo the surgical treatment of chronic pancreatitis due to various medical comorbidities often require medication treatment. Treatments such as ursodeoxycholic acid, octreotide acetate, and antioxidants are used in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. The aim of the study was to observe postprandial pain of the patients with chronic pancreatitis in the group who received vitamin E and ursodeoxycholic acid combined medication therapy after failure of previous treatments, and to make an estimation. A total of 31 patients with chronic pancreatitis who applied to outpatient clinic in our clinic between October 2018 and April 2022 were included in the study. The patients were evaluated using the visual analog scale. The patients were divided into 2 groups. 20 patients who received treatment with 800 mg/day Ursodeoxycholic Acid and 400 mg/day of vitamin E were included in Group 1, while 11 patients who received combination therapy with 800 mg/day Ursodeoxycholic Acid and 400 mg/day of vitamin E were included in Group 2. Patients in Group 2 were more severely symptomatic compared to Group 1. It was determined that the visual analog scale score of the Group 2 was significantly lower compared to the Group 1 (p=0,004). It was determined that there was a significant improvement in patient quality of life after 6 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, this results suggest that combination therapy with Ursodeoxycholic and Vitamin E in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis patients with intractable pain may be beneficial."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We randomly assigned 310 patients into a normal culture group (NC group) and a modified culture group (MC group). Oocytes were inseminated with 5\u00d710(6) motile spermatozoa in 500 \u03bcL Ham's F\u201010 medium and 100 \u03bcL modified culture medium, respectively, and cultured for 4 hrs. The fertilization rates were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS: The fertilization rate was significantly higher in the MC group than in the NC group (51.6 vs. 44.2%, P < 0.05). The fertilization rates of zygotes with 3PN were significantly higher in the former group (65.7 vs. 51.4%, P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the fertilization rate was significantly influenced by culture medium, but not affected by maternal age, the total number of mature oocytes, the total motile sperm count, or the presence of 3PN embryos in each patient (P < 0.05). However, after adjusting for other confounding factors, the fertilization rate in the MC group was still significantly higher (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A modified medium of culture",

The Inside Clinical Trial Study (ICTS) is designed to understand the experiences, barriers, facilitators, and drivers that influence decisions related to clinical trials. The goal of the study is to leverage the lessons learned to improve the clinical trial process for patients, improve clinical trial access, and enhance patient\u2010centricity of cancer clinical trials. Methods: Using the PRECEDE model, a qualitative study of a single\u2010site, phase II, open\u2010label, multicenter, randomized, active\u2010controlled trial evaluating the safety and activity of cabozantinib in the neoadjuvant treatment of sarcoma was conducted. A total of 140 semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with adult patients and/or caregivers of patients with specific rare cancer diagnoses. Results: The median age of participants was 57 years and most were white, female with a 12th\u2010grade education. Participants perceived clinical trial participation to be challenging due to: (1) the lack of patient support; (2) the perceived risk of cancer recurrence; (3) barriers in the clinical trial process and associated expectations of clinical trial participation; and (4) the inconvenience of time and location. The overall experiences patients had with their clinical trials were overwhelmingly positive. Specifically, participants expressed: (1) an appreciation for the availability of clinical trials and their accessibility; (2) satisfaction with the study nurses and physicians; (3) appreciation for study\u2010provided social support and emotional and psychological support; (4) improved access to cancer information and clinical trial information and (5) improved communication between physicians and patients. Conclusion: While most study participants experienced positive effects of clinical trial participation, they identified challenges associated with clinical trial participation. The results of this research provide the opportunity to tailor information and improve patient support to address the challenges identified so that patients make informed treatment decisions.

            "That's interesting. Comparing patients' engagement patterns and participation trends between the two groups will provide further insights into the differences between patients enrolled in clinical trials and those who are not. Now, last but not least, for the third study arm, what would be the participant group/arm and intervention/treatment? \n\n\n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nBackground and Rationale: Lung cancer is a major cause of mortality worldwide and the incidence of lung cancer is increasing among never-smokers. The overall 5-year survival rate is about 15%. The discovery of oncogenic driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has enabled the targeting of these oncogenic drivers using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Despite the improved effectiveness of TKIs in treatment of lung cancer, a significant proportion of patients treated with TKIs develop resistance and subsequently relapse. It is unknown when and why resistance develops. Methods: We propose to leverage a unique database of patients treated with TKI as part of a phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00753346) to evaluate whether there is an association between clinical outcome and longitudinal measures of TKI resistance. This retrospective cohort study will leverage existing patient data, including longitudinal plasma and tissue biopsies, pre- and post-treatment radiologic response data, and clinical outcome data (time on treatment, progression free survival , and overall survival). A multi-step approach will be utilized to identify prognostic and resistance markers by combining machine learning and immunoassay technologies. Discovery and validation will be conducted using blood samples. We will leverage the translational component of the parent study to examine the translatability of the model to a new patient cohort and its clinical utility. The study will examine mechanisms of early TKI resistance to optimize future treatment strategies for patients.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in the United States with an overall 5 year survival rate of about 15%. The incidence of lung cancer has been increasing in younger patients across all gender and race and ethnicity subgroups. The overall survival rate for patients younger than 50 years has increased significantly over time",

However, limited research has characterized the current online public discourse surrounding rheumatic diseases. This study aims to comprehensively describe an online discussion landscape regarding social awareness of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).METHODS: We used Vantage Social's global dataset of 140 billion posts from 10 January 2014 to 20 November 2015 obtained from 696 million Facebook users. The posts were categorized based on contextual and content information to extract a set of 128,685 discussions around RA from a total of 71 million unique users. These posts, classified as user\u2010generated discussions, were analyzed using machine learning classification models. We determined the proportion of discussions focused on each category's main theme. We identified two themes in the dataset: (1) personal accounts related to the illness itself and (2) conversations related to how the illness impacts the user's life and their experiences with those who have RA. These themes and subcategories were used to derive a set of five categories to characterize the social media posts: (1) seeking knowledge and information, (2) physical or mental health burden, (3) social burden, (4) social experiences, and (5) personal experiences. Top three main topics were identified within each category.RESULTS: The study found that the proportion of discussions focused on personal experiences (44.8%, 57,924 posts) was overwhelmingly dominant compared to the proportion of discussions focused on information\u2010seeking/gathering (21.8%, 28,312 posts), physical or mental health (7.9%, 10,513 posts), social burden (12.4%, 15,698 posts), and social experiences (9.1%, 11,705 posts).

Periodontitis is one of the most common, chronic, bacterial infections of mankind. It is estimated that 75% of the population over 35 years of age has or is at risk of developing this disease. Current treatment usually involves scaling and root planing (SRP), but in the presence of diseased soft tissue, pockets depth 6-7mm, deep infrabony defects, or severe bone destruction, surgical treatment is required. Open flap debridement (OFD) is the current gold standard for the treatment of periodontitis, with high success rates reported when the correct amount and quality of scaling and root planing (SRP) are applied properly. The conventional therapy includes: 1. Preoperative antibiotics to reduce the level of disease-causing bacteria before surgery and help prevent bacterial regrowth; 2. Removal of all bacterial calculus within the periodontal pocket; 3. Reduction and recontouring of inflamed tissue in the affected teeth; 4. Local administration of antibiotics directly into periodontal pockets; 5. Fiberoptic curettage to remove loose connective tissue and other debris. Conventional periodontal therapy involves: 1. Systemic administration of antibiotics to inhibit the growth of microorganisms; 2. Local debridement of diseased soft tissue; 3. Systemic or local administration of anti-inflammatory agents to reduce inflammation; 4. Excision of tissue; 5. Filling of pockets with fibrin clot.

There is a need to develop effective interventions which are low in cost and easily accessible to promote sustained engagement in physical activity. This study examines the effect of the provision of feedback from a fitness tracker on physical activity and health outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: We conducted a 2\u2010arm parallel trial in China from 2019 to 2021. Participants were recruited through community posts and social media, and informed consent was obtained from over 1,000 participants in 3 Chinese towns in Hunan province. Random assignment was stratified by age (< 40 and \u2265 40 years), sex, and employment status. Participants were randomly assigned to receive motivational feedback or educational feedback. The intervention was implemented over 3 months, and participants received daily online video feedback based on their daily activity level. The main outcome measures were daily steps and exercise minutes per week by physical activity monitors which participants wore over 3 months. Results: In total, 1,133 participants (60.9% female) completed the trial, with an average age of 37.3 (range 18\u201090).

There was a significant difference between the two groups in the mean number of days per week wearing the device (1.6 days versus 1.4 days, p < 0.001). At the end of the intervention, daily steps and exercise minutes per week were significantly higher in the motivational feedback group than in the educational feedback group (difference 238 steps/day, p < 0.001 and difference 11 exercise minutes/week, p < 0.01, respectively).

Objectives: To determine if using a nasopharyngeal adapter for mechanical ventilation in adults is associated with lower levels of end\u2010tidal sevoflurane (ETS) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) compared with an orotracheal tube. Methods: The ventilator settings used for mechanical ventilation were collected prospectively in adult patients for 4 h. Patients were randomly assigned to be ventilated via either an orotracheal tube (n = 62), a nasopharyngeal adapter (n = 57), or both. The differences in ETS and PSV were used as a dependent variable, and ventilator settings, age, and sex were used as independent variables. Results: Patients who used a nasopharyngeal adapter had higher ETS (mean, 20.1 +/\u2010 13.2) than patients ventilated with either an orotracheal tube (20.9 +/\u2010 14.9; t = 1.88; p > 0.05) and a bronchus tube with a nasopharyngeal adapter (19.6 +/\u2010 13.8; t = 2.40; p < 0.05).

What kind of outcomes are you measuring in this study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a non-invasive method that allows for the real-time monitoring of neural activity by measuring the Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) contrast. It is possible to see the area of increased neural activity before and after the drug administration, and if a difference in the activity before and after the drug administration exists, it demonstrates the therapeutic impact of the drug. The study's goal is to demonstrate the therapeutic effect through the increased activation of the brain region, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), by applying theta-burst TMS (TBS) over the left prefrontal cortex to the DLPFC, in participants with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who are experiencing motor impairments or a decline in executive function. The TBS-induced brain activity changes will be determined by comparing the fMRI results before and after drug administration, in both the participants with the application of TBS and the control group who only received drug administration without the TBS method.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nFour healthy controls and one participant with PD each were selected to participate in the study. The clinical evaluation was performed for all participants at all visits.

The Comprehensive Coordination Scale (CCS) is a specific evaluation tool used to assess the coordination of muscle activity and postural control and provide an objective measure of movement disorders. Although the CCS has been validated and adapted to Turkish, there are limited studies on the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the CCS in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. The overall goal of this study is to validate and establish the reliability of the Turkish version of the Comprehensive Coordination Scale (CCS) in patients with Parkinson's disease at 40g, 60deg, and 80deg angular velocities. In total, 80 patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease will be enrolled in the study. To determine the validity of the CCS, data will be compared between the modified Bologna scale and the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale in patients with PD. Intra-rater, inter-rater, and test-retest reliability will be assessed to compare the total scores and 12 sub-scale scores collected from the study participants.

The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of LTs with the aid of a liver support system (LSS) with conventional liver resection or living donor liver transplantation in patients with de novo liver failure. We carried out a cohort study on adult patients with severe non hepatitis viral liver failure. We divided the patients into the following 3 groups: Group I: LT with LSS treatment using the Maquet LF 100 device before LT. Group II: LT after conventional liver resection performed before LT. Group III: Living donor liver transplantation. There were no differences among the 3 groups regarding the presence of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), jaundice, or coagulopathy. Complications after operations were 29 % in Group I, 40 % in Group II, and 26 % in Group III. The incidence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was 13 % at LT, and the rates showed no differences among the 3 groups. Although no patients died within 3 months after LT, 2 patients in Group I experienced HE and a high mortality rate due to systemic infection because of the use of the LSS. To reduce the mortality rate and adverse events related to the use of LSS, we recommend living donor liver transplantation or liver resection to facilitate LT at the acute stage of liver failure.",

Each subject visits the measurement site twice for a period of 2 minutes on day 1 and between 16.00 and 17.00 on day 2. The BGMS to be tested will be randomly assigned to each subject. At the time of measurement, the blood will be collected within 3 seconds using one of the fourteen BGMS for each measurement site. For each measurement site there is a reference measurement method (RMM) in use which performs the blood sugar measurement using venous blood via gas analysis at the medical institute. After each measurement the BGMS data and the reference values will be transferred directly from the test sites to the database. Each subject serves as his/her own control and will be measured four times at day 1 and once at day 2 after the fasting time of 8 hours. The results of the measurements will be analyzed in conjunction with the reference system via a statistical procedure.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nAssessment of the System Accuracy of 14 Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems in Hypo, Eu and Hyperglycemic Conditions (15197 GLUCOMETER BGM)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDiabetes, Type 1, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: YES\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: male or female patient aged > 18 years; written informed consent to participation; hypo-, eu- or hyperglycemic blood glucose levels Exclusion Criteria: pregnancy or nursing period",
            "Yes, you are correct. The control arm should have a separate group of participants to ensure that the results obtained from the different blood glucose monitoring systems are compared against a reliable reference standard. This would prevent potential data bias or systematic errors that could be introduced by the participants used in the experimental arm. For example, participants who are initially enrolled in the experimental arm may become less motivated to participate after several experimental visits. By having a separate group of participants, we can control for any potential bias that may arise from repeated participation. Additionally, the control arm participants should be matched with the experimental arm participants based on their age, gender, and any relevant demographic or clinical characteristics to ensure comparability. \n\n [Institution] Study Arms:\n1.

The prevalence of tobacco use in rural populations presents a severe public health challenge, increasing the need for tailored, mobile treatments. This study evaluates the use of a novel text-message smoking cessation intervention, Take a Break, in conjunction with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) sampling in rural Pennsylvania. This study aims to examine the effects of tailored text messages and NRT sampling in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSmoking has decreased in the U.S. but remains prevalent among rural populations. Smokers in rural areas are less likely to make use of cessation services such as counseling, pharmacotherapy, or both, when compared to their urban counterparts. Treatment for smoking cessation aims to address the complex issue of tobacco addiction to address the behavioral and psycho-social needs of smokers. Rural and low-income smokers may present with more severe addiction than others, making them more difficult to treat. This research aims to evaluate the use of a novel text-message smoking cessation intervention that uses adaptive challenges and an app-based program for rural Pennsylvania residents. This project aims to 1) Examine the efficacy of a behavioral intervention: text-message based cessation support with or without NRT sampling (TAKE AB) to engage tobacco users into quitting and 2) Test the effect of TAKE AB and NRT sampling versus NRT sampling only on tobacco use, abstinence, negative consequences of tobacco use, and negative reinforcement of tobacco use.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nSmoking Cessation Study for Rural Populations\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nSmoking\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Behavioral: Take a Break plus NRT Sampling\n* Behavioral: NRT Sampling\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: To be included in the study, participants must meet the following criteria: Participants must be adult smokers (defined as consuming at least",

Typically, these actions are aimed at addressing a specific problem or need, and they may involve different healthcare professionals working together to provide care. An example of a standard program might be a set of actions or steps designed to improve the management of an illness or condition, such as diabetes. Such a program might involve regular check-ups and blood tests, as well as education and counseling to help patients manage their diabetes effectively. The standard program may be delivered by healthcare professionals such as doctors, nurses, and dietitians working together.\n- The enhanced implementation program, on the other hand, is a type of program that aims to support healthcare professionals in implementing the standard program effectively. This might involve additional training or resources, as well as ongoing support and monitoring.

We are recruiting in five counties, so we are aiming to recruit 160 smokers per county across the five counties. This sample size distribution will be determined by geographic distribution across the target counties based on the rurality of the area. We will follow up with the participants 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 8 months, 10 months, and 12 months after their enrollment and compare the difference in the quit rates and other outcomes among the participants. Quit rates will be measured by confirming the outcome with pharmacy prescription data and validated quitlines data. Self-reported quit rates will also be analyzed by telephone follow-up.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nRATIONALE: Rural smokers are less likely to get access to smoking cessation services than urban smokers. Community paramedicine programs have potential to bridge the gap in access to smoking cessation services for disadvantaged populations, such as rural residents. In addition, gamified interventions have recently shown promising results in the field of smoking cessation. The aim of this study is to address the challenges of limited access to smoking cessation services and low motivation for cessation among rural smokers. To do so, we designed a community paramedicine program with a 13-week personalized interactive text messaging intervention using gamification strategies. We will recruit 800 rural smokers (total) across five counties and assess the impact of the intervention on the cessation rate, relapse rate, and motivation to quit smoking, as well as other biomarkers (carbon monoxide, exhaled carbon monoxide, and cotinine), and quality of life. We plan to conduct a longitudinal pilot study including a 1-month pre-intervention, a 13-week intervention, and a 12-month follow-up period to assess the effects of the community paramedicine program on our primary and exploratory outcomes.

CPs were equipped with \"Smoking Intervention Cards\" (SICs) containing information about cigarette warning signs, cessation, and referral and were guided through pre-planned scripts to help them to carry out the smoking intervention in the field. The intervention was expected to take the roles of raising patient awareness of the health hazards of cigarette smoking, smoking cessation, and how to quit smoking successfully. Through smoking intervention cards with predefined scripts, community paramedics were able to effectively raise patient awareness of the dangerousness of smoking and smoking cessation and give smoking cessation information without burdening themselves and reducing their operational capabilities. Data collection during the visit includes the smoking status of participants, the number of cigarettes and their cigarette warning signs, the smoking-related patient characteristics, and the smoking status of their family members.

The intervention for this arm could be Shear Wave Dispersive Imaging (SWDI). This arm will help evaluate the diagnostic performance of SWDI in distinguishing benign from malignant breast lesions. \n\nAbstract:\nTo estimate the diagnostic accuracy of shear wave dispersion imaging (SWDI) for detecting suspicious breast lesions, we prospectively recruited 182 patients with suspicious calcifications and microcalcifications on breast tomosynthesis (BT). SWDI results were blindly correlated with histology results based on the area underneath the curve (AUC) and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. SWDI provided an AUC of 0.78 (95% c.i. 0.72\u20100.85) for the detection of malignancy compared with microcalcifications (0.62 (0.55\u20100.69)) and BT (0.58 (0.51\u20100.66)). SWDI showed a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 81%. The combination of SWDI and BT significantly enhanced the AUC (0.87 (0.81\u20100.92), p = 0.001).

Do you have any specific research questions that you would like to address with this study? \n\nAbstract:\nINTRODUCTION: Intramucosal carcinomas (IMCs) of the stomach represent a distinct type of mucosal gastric carcinoma with a unique pattern of invasion and infiltration into the gastric folds. They have high incidence rates among young people and in the distal stomach. They are different from other gastric carcinomas both for their clinical features and their therapeutic and prognostic implications. The purpose of this study was to characterize the endoscopic appearance of these cancers to better define them as a separate entity. METHODS: Prospectively, the diagnostic yield and the clinical and endoscopic differences between IMCs of the stomach and other types of gastric carcinomas were analyzed by retrospectively reviewing the endoscopic features of 186 gastric carcinomas (136 non\u2010neoplastic lesions, 50 non\u2010IMCs, and 125 IMCs) with the endoscopic appearance and histologic findings. RESULTS: Of the 186 gastric cancer cases, 53.2% were IMCs and 46.8% were non\u2010IMCs. Histologically, 95.4% of the IMCs and 42.9% of the non\u2010IMCs were well\u2010differentiated tubular adenocarcinomas. In endoscopic mucosal classification, a white or yellow friable mucosal lesion was the most common presentation, with a frequency of 95.2%. Among the IMCs, 34.8% were type 1 (small\u2010size, single) and 8.0% were type IV (spread beyond the submucosa). CONCLUSIONS: The most common endoscopic aspects of gastric IMCs are white or yellow friable mucosal lesions in a protruded, irregular, small\u2010sized, or multi\u2010pedicled polypoidal form. These endoscopic findings can aid in the early detection of IMCs, reducing under"

Previous studies demonstrated that the clinical course and outcomes for patients with NAFLD or obesity were different from those without. However, the specific effect of obesity and NAFLD on HFpEF patients remains to be elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the clinical profiles, characteristics, and prognosis of HFpEF patients with NAFLD and obesity. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients with HFpEF who were enrolled in a prospective database. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of the 2\u2010year all\u2010cause mortality rate between the normal weight group, obese group, and NAFLD group. The secondary outcomes included the occurrence of all\u2010cause death, all\u2010cause hospitalization, heart failure hospitalization, stroke, and cardiac arrest among HFpEF patients. Results: A total of 2064 HFpEF patients were included. There was a significant difference in the incidence of cardiac arrest in normal\u2010weight patients with NAFLD (2.5% in obese group, 5.8% in NAFLD, and 1.5% in the normal\u2010weight group, P<0.001), but the 2\u2010year all\u2010cause death did not differ among the normal\u2010weight group, obese group, and NAFLD group (P=0.147). The cumulative risk of all\u2010cause death at 2 years was greatest for obese patients with NAFLD (7.9%) compared with normal\u2010weight patients with NAFLD and obese patients (P=0.027).

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of PL with outcome of high\u2010risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with chemotherapy in childhood.METHODS: In the 17 randomized CHILD\u2010BFM (2005; NCT00382408; final follow\u2010up 2015) and HD\u20108 B\u2010acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B\u2010ALL) trials, children with high\u2010risk B\u2010ALL received standard risk\u2010intensive treatment. Children with very low myeloid/very low erythroid lineage (VL\u2010ML), defined as PL below the third percentile and both low erythroid and myeloid lineage counts, received prophylactic erythroid growth factor (EGF) and myeloid growth factor (MGF). We retrospectively evaluated the incidence and time to development of MDS and its acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation.RESULTS: We identified 1989 patients with VL\u2010ML B\u2010ALL at diagnosis who did or did not receive EGF or MGF. After a median follow up of 5.4 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2\u20105.6 years), myeloid/erythroid leukemias (AML, MDS + AML) developed in 42 patients (2.1%, 95% CI, 1.4\u20103.0%). After adjustment for major risk factors in multivariate analysis, PL was the only significant determinant (hazard ratio [HR], 3.8; P\u2009 < .001; 4\u2010year cumulative incidence, not estimated) when both EGF and MGF were administered.

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions or comments.\n\nAbstract:\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of isometric handgrip exercises and lower\u2010limb exercises in community\u2010dwelling older adults in Taiwan. This randomized controlled trial was conducted with a parallel\u2010group design. A total of 95 older adult volunteers were randomly divided into a control group and an intervention group. The intervention group performed unilateral and bilateral isometric handgrip exercises at 4 positions of the hand, and one\u2010legged weight\u2010bearing lower\u2010limb exercises for 2 sets at 50% of each participant's voluntary maximum. The control group participated in social educational activities. Both groups underwent 36\u2010week training sessions twice a week, for a total of 32 sessions. The primary outcome was grip strength, and the secondary outcomes were walking speed, sit\u2010to\u2010stand (STS), five times sit\u2010to\u2010stand (FTS), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and dynamic balance, as measured by the Single Leg Reaching Test (SLRT). All outcomes were assessed at a 6\u2010month follow\u2010up. Both groups showed improvements from baseline in the measured outcomes compared to the pretest. However, the intervention group showed better improvements in posttest performance for all assessments. The intervention group's outcomes were significantly better than the control group for both the TUG and FTS tests. Isometric handgrip exercise and weight\u2010bearing lower\u2010limb exercise are both useful for improving function in older adults. The results of this study suggest that isometric handgrip exercise and weight\u2010bearing lower\u2010limb exercise may be effective non\u2010pharmacological interventions for improving the function and quality of life of older adults.\n\nIntroduction\nSarcopenia is the gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. It occurs due to the simultaneous effect of decreased muscle mass and reduced muscle strength, which can lead to reduced mobility, decreased physical activity, and poor quality of life.\nIncreased physical activity, muscle strength, and muscle mass can improve the physical and cognitive abilities of older adults.1 In addition, engaging in physical activity can prevent sarcopenia,"

            "In the Adalimumab with optimisation arm, the participants will receive intensification of the dosing regimen of their adalimumab treatment. This could mean higher doses of adalimumab administered more frequently, or switching to a different anti-TNF medication. Does that make sense? \n\nBackground\n=================\nA high proportion of patients with Crohn\u2019s Disease (CD) experience loss of response (LOR) to adalimumab (ADA) treatment. Several approaches to intensify antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy have been studied in patients (pts) with LOR on ADA, including adalimumab dose escalation and optimization, as well as switching to another biologic agent. Currently, the 2019 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines recommend dose intensification for pts who have a clinical response to first-line biotherapy but have experienced LOR without biomarker evidence of loss of response upon ADA discontinuation. However, these recommendations are based on a small number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including the recently published STOP-CD  trial. Additional RCT evidence is needed to validate guidelines, assess the optimal treatment sequence, and identify predictive biomarkers to guide the most effective approach. \n\nThis trial is designed to compare the efficacy of vedolizumab (Ved), a gut-tropic, integrin \u03b14\u03b27 antagonist, with adalimumab with dose enhancement (ADE), which involves adjusting the dose in patients losing response. \n\nIntervention\n=================\nThe study will have treatment arms based on adalimumab dose intensification, including dose escalation and dose optimization.

Hypothesis This study aims to evaluate the superiority of a continuous low dose therapy over treatment interruption. \nMain research questions (1) Is continuous drug administration superior to treatment by treatment interruptions in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease? (2) Is continuous drug administration associated with a greater risk of drug withdrawal due to adverse events? Methodology A prospective randomized controlled cross-over study that includes a treatment regimen according to the current standard (80 mg subcutaneously every two weeks at the time of inclusion) or a high dose followed by intensive maintenance administration of 108 mg subcutaneously every 14 days for 6 months during a cessation period (no drug administration). Both treatment strategies will be followed by 6 months of treatment with open control of the investigator's choice. The treatment regimen has been selected according to the current guidelines: If, after 6 months of induction therapy, a good response is noted, the drug is switched in the second year to one of the 2 treatment strategies (either high dose or cessation). After 6 months of the treatment strategy the therapy will be changed to the other strategy and the patients will again be randomly assigned to one of the treatment strategies. At the end of the 24-month treatment period, the patients are again randomly allocated to one of the 2 treatment strategies and undergo endoscopic investigation.

VES did not alter arousal or mood as a function of time when compared to Red Bull. Plasma L\u2010Carnitine and caffeine concentrations were elevated at 6\u2010hrs relative to the baseline for Red Bull and VES conditions, respectively.DISCUSSION: VES was effective at increasing ratings of alertness and maintaining this effect for at least 4\u00a0hrs post\u2010consumption. Both beverages resulted in elevations of L\u2010Carnitine and caffeine. The observed differences in cognitive outcomes between VES and Red Bull may reflect the lower levels of L\u2010Carnitine and caffeine observed following the VES.IMPLICATIONS: The current results indicate that the VES results in increased cognition and may be a less concentrated alternative for healthy adults seeking acute cognitive enhancing effects relative to the leading commercial energy drink.",

We can evaluate whether the intervention is more effective or harmful compared to the natural course. Does that sound like a good idea? \n\nStudy details\n=================\nBrief summary in scientific language\n=================\nBackground: Non-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS) are a significant challenge in patients following liver transplantation. The gold standard management is endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) with stent placement, with conflicting evidence on optimal timing and frequency of ERCP interventions. This observational patient registry study aims to evaluate the effect of endoscopic-intervention timing on clinical outcomes in patients with NAS following liver transplantation. Methods: In this single-center prospective observational study, patients with NAS following liver transplantation will be evaluated using biliary endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) procedures during a 12-month follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint is 1-year biliary clinical complications requiring re-interventions, including cholangitis, recurrent strictures, or liver transplant rejection in patients with NAS identified by biliary endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. The primary safety endpoint is mortality during the follow-up. Secondary endpoints include adverse events, cost-effectiveness assessment, biliary stricture resolution, and impact on quality of life. The study will be conducted at a tertiary referral center in Canada, and the statistical analysis will be based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox-regression models, and univariate and multivariate correlations analysis. The registry is anticipated to enroll 150 patients, with funding provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. \n\nHealth condition or problem studied\n=================\nICD10:: T79.00\nICD10:: K72.21\nHealthy volunteers:: No Entry\n\n\nInterventions, Observational Groups\n=================\nArm 1:: Intervention group:",

By comparing the outcomes of these patients with those in the other two study arms, we can evaluate the effectiveness of ERCP with stent placement as a first-line treatment for non-anastomotic biliary strictures following liver transplantation. What are your thoughts on this? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground/Objectives\n-----------------\nWith the introduction of liver transplantation, the number of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has increased rapidly in Korea, accounting for 75% of all liver transplantations in 2020. LDLT is considered a treatment option with low risk for graft and patient survival compared to de-novo liver transplantation (D\u2010LT) . While the primary graft non-function (PNG) rate is significantly lower in LDLT than in D\u2010LT, the development of biliary complication is a major problem that can lead to serious complications such as liver cirrhosis, hepatic abscess, and even mortality . Among the factors that lead to biliary complications after LDLT, ischemia\u2010reperfusion injury of the bile duct is known to be the main cause, with about 40~ 60% of cases reported . These biliary complications can be divided into early and late biliary complications, with early onset occurring within 30\u00a0days of surgery and late onset occurring 30\u201390\u00a0days after surgery . The incidence of biliary complications after LDLT is high, with an average of 10\u201370% , and is more common in LDLT than in D\u2010LT due to the smaller caliber of the bile duct . There is also a regional difference in the incidence, as the annual incidence of",

The main treatment option is a high dose of oral steroids, with slow steroid tapering to keep inflammation of the vessel wall under control. A major unmet need is the need for a pharmacological treatment to allow early, and possibly rapid, dose reduction of steroids, while maintaining disease control over the long term. STARTER is a phase 2/3 study of tocilizumab in patients with GCA. Part A of this study is a 68 week, randomized, double-blind (drug & placebo), active-controlled, multicenter study of tocilizumab 162 mg (iv or sc) vs placebo (iv) + background standard of care (SoC), and tocilizumab 86 mg (iv) + background SoC. Approximately 270 patients with active GCA who are on oral SoC with a 17-item disease activity score (DAS17) \u2265 2, (at Screening) and \u2265 1.5 despite oral SoC for > 6 months will be randomized in Part A. Aside from investigational therapy (IT), all patients will receive SoC, which include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or prednisone. Primary objective of the study is to determine maintenance of GCA remission through the end of week 68 (EoW 68) as defined by DAS17 \u22641 AND modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) polyarteritis nodosa \u2264 1 AND C-reactive protein (CRP) \u2264 3 mg/L.

What is the comparator group/arm, and what is the intervention/treatment? \n\nStudy\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPilot study of an internet-based communication aid intervention for couples with Primary Progressive Aphasia. PPA is a neurodegenerative speech and language disorder that involves gradual loss of language ability, often accompanied by a decline in behavioral and cognitive function. Aphasia is also known as language disorder. Individuals with PPA experience changes in speech and language that interfere with communication and daily life activities, such as reading, writing, and speaking. The intervention will be provided by speech-language pathologists. The intervention is designed to enhance the participation in activities of daily living of people with PPA by using personalized training stimuli and online-video interactions. The intervention is delivered via the internet, so it can be provided from a distance through web-based platforms such as Skype and Facetime. The study hypothesis is that the new intervention will improve people's ability to communicate with their spouse, improving their quality of life and the quality of their relationship. The study consists of two arms: Treatment group: All participants will participate in the intervention during the study period. The treatment involves using online-video interactions using personally salient training stimuli and participation in activities of daily living. The treatment will be provided by speech-language pathologists trained in treating PPA. Control group: The control group will receive usual care during the study period. This arm is only designed as a control group for this study and will not be given a treatment. The control group will not be involved in any experimental procedures.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPPA describes a disease characterized by a chronic progressive loss of ability to form and use language. The course of the disease depends on various individual factors. The disease can run for five years but with varying degrees of severity and in different ways. Some people may lose a lot of their language capacity early on, quickly reaching a steady state. Others go on to a gradual deterioration over many years. There are differences in how language development occurs in children with various types of aphasia. In children, the speech and language difficulties are usually the same type as in adults. The intervention will be provided by speech-language pathologists. The intervention is designed to enhance the participation in activities of daily living",

Are there any specific exclusion criteria for this study arm? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Although the impact of intrauterine reperfusion of ovarian stimulation (OS) cycles for the treatment of female infertility has been studied in meta\u2010analysis, it remains unclear whether reperfusion improves the pregnancy and implantation rates among high responder patients. Thus, we aimed to assess the clinical impact of early intrauterine reperfusion in high responder patients. Patients and methods: This study was retrospectively performed using the clinic's data for patients who were treated with frozen embryo transfer (FET) between January 2011 and December 2015. A total of 1182 high response patients who underwent first FET cycles were randomly assigned to two groups, including 684 patients in the reperfusion group and 527 patients in the no\u2010reperfusion group. The clinical outcomes and perinatal outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results: Among the 1182 patients, 99.1% of them had a total of 2\u20104 transfers while 63.6% of them had undergone one transfer. In the no\u2010reperfusion group, the transfer interval (median of days, 21.0 versus 7 days, P < 0.0001) and the number of thawed embryos (two embryos, 75.7% versus 83.5%, P < 0.0001) were significantly shorter than in the reperfusion group. The cumulative clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) was significantly higher in the reperfusion group than in the no\u2010reperfusion one within 1 year (33.2% versus 28.3%, P = 0.01). Although the perinatal outcomes were similar between the two groups, the abortion rate of the reperfusion group was significantly higher (15.3% versus 8.9%, P = 0.01). Conclusions: Early intrauterine reperfusion could not improve the pregnancy outcomes in high response patients.",

An anticipated benefit of this study is that it would provide information regarding the success rates of the ECV procedure in this specific population while accounting for demographic and medical factors.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the external cephalic version (ECV) procedure is more effective in women with non-vertex presenting twin. During the second trimester of pregnancy, between 32 and 35 weeks gestational age, the ECV procedure can be performed in conjunction with tocolysis with the intent of inducing a fetal head-down position. The procedure is performed by applying gentle traction and pressure to the uterus while the fetal head is in the vaginal canal. While there is evidence that the ECV procedure is effective in a general population of pregnant women with a singleton fetus, there is limited evidence that the procedure is effective in women with twin pregnancies.

The cold compressing group will wear cold compresses on their hands and feet before and after chemotherapy, hoping to reduce the thermal damage to peripheral nerves and reduce the damage caused by chemotherapy. The design of each group was based on the scientific literature and expert consultation. The temperature control for the hot compressing group was set based on the results of in vitro experiments and animal experiments, which showed that temperature control in the range of 37-38 degrees Celsius could improve microcirculation, increase blood flow, and reduce oxidative stress. The temperature control for the cold compressing group was set based on the studies of other scholars, which showed that temperature control in the range of 12-18 degrees Celsius could reduce thermal damage and reduce the risk of peripheral nerve damage.",
            "It will involve hot compresses applied to the hands and feet for 20 minutes. Heat application is believed to increase blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and relieve pain and discomfort associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The use of hot compresses has been found to be effective in managing various forms of pain, including neuropathic pain, which is the type often experienced by chemotherapy patients. Research suggests that heat application can increase blood flow to the nerve endings, allowing for faster healing and reducing sensitivity to pain. Moreover, it has been found that applying heat to the lower extremities can help reduce muscle spasms and increase mobility. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCIPN is the most common chronic chemotherapy toxicity in outpatients, and it is associated with impairments in various areas of quality of life. In this study, patients diagnosed with CIPN were randomly assigned to a control group and an experimental group to perform thermal compress therapy after administration of oxaliplatin. The results showed that in comparison with the control group, the experimental group showed significant improvement in nerve-related symptoms and quality of life, and the incidence of CIPN was reduced. In addition to the above results, this study also provided a basis for the prevention and treatment of CIPN, and this study may provide some clinical evidence for clinical nursing and treatment. The results show that the incidence of severe CIPN was reduced from 15.9% to 7.0%.The incidence of low-grade neuropathy was also reduced from 25% to 14.4%, and the incidence of medium-grade neuropathy was reduced from 25% to 9.7%.\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nChemotherapy\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure: thermal pad\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Age >= 18 years old; Meet the diagnostic criteria for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy; Willing and able to comply with all study requirements.
