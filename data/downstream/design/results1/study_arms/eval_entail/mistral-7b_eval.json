            "Sure!\n\nThe experimental study arm will include participants who will receive the HU6 treatment in one of three dose levels. This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three HU6 dose levels or the placebo. Each participant will receive the same dose of HU6 for a set period of time (e.g., 12 weeks), after which they will complete the study. The dose levels will be determined based on the preclinical data and pilot studies, and the doses will be determined by a medical officer.\n\nThe placebo comparator arm will include participants who will receive a placebo for the same duration as the experimental arm. The placebo will mimic the physical appearance of the HU6 drug and will be given to the participants who are assigned to this arm. Participants in both arms will be monitored closely during the trial and will be asked to follow specific study protocols.\n\nBoth arms will be assessed for the efficacy and safety of HU6 compared to the placebo. The primary endpoints will be measured using non-invasive diagnostic tests such as ultrasound and MRI, as well as blood tests. The secondary endpoints will also be measured using non-invasive tests and may include information on quality of life and other measures. The trial will be monitored closely by a medical officer and a data monitoring board.",
            "The placebo comparator arm will include obese subjects with Type 2 Diabetes at risk of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis. They will receive the placebo instead of HU6. The primary purpose of this arm is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the placebo in improving liver fat content.\n\nThe placebo will be the same physical form as HU6, such as a sugar pill or placebo in the form of the drug, but it will contain no active ingredient. The placebo will be the same strength and administered at the same frequency as HU6 in the experimental arm. This way, we can compare the effects of HU6 to placebo to determine if HU6 is better at improving liver fat content in obese subjects with Type 2 Diabetes at risk of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.",
