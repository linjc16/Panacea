This type of system delivers physiological fluid, oxygen, and CO2 to the submucosal tissue during the EMR procedure. The flow rate of the system can be adjusted to maintain the submucosal tissue at a temperature of 39\u00b0C throughout the procedure to help avoid submucosal nerve injury and pain.

First, a thorough ultrasound examination of the gallbladder will be done to confirm the diagnosis and identify any stones that need to be removed. Then, the doctor will insert a flexible tube (catheter) through the mouth and into the stomach and duodenum (food pipe) to reach the area of the gallbladder. Through this tube, a special instrument (endoscope) will be inserted to inflate the gallbladder and visualize the stones. The doctor will use a high-frequency ultrasound device at the end of the endoscope to break the stones up into smaller pieces. The broken stones will then be removed or left to pass through the duodenum. This procedure can be done on an outpatient basis or as an emergency intervention.

The best way to measure O2 Sat is by using pulse oximetry.

            "A control group of renal tumor patients undergoing standard imaging techniques would be a good control arm to compare against the first arm. The objective is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT imaging, so a comparison against a standard of care control arm is crucial. So, what should be the intervention/treatment for this arm?",
            "Perfect! The control group will provide a baseline for comparison with 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT imaging, allowing us to more accurately assess the diagnostic accuracy of the new technique.\nTogether, we have outlined the key components of a clinical trial protocol for evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT imaging in renal tumors. At this point, you may want to provide some additional instructions for any next steps or queries you have so that I can accurately reflect them in the protocol.",
            "That's a great idea. Incorporating a healthy control group can help to rule out any pre-existing abnormalities or differences that may affect the sensitivity of the 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT. Are there any other aspects of your study that we should discuss?",
            "Great! By including a healthy control group, we can compare the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT with healthy controls, which will help to determine if there are any false positives or negatives. Finally, let's discuss the fourth arm. How would you like to define the participant group for the fourth arm?",
            "Sure! Here is the completed outline of the study arms: 1. Study Arm 1: Patients undergoing 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT for suspected renal tumors 2. Study Arm 2: Healthy controls undergoing no treatment for renal tumors 3. Study Arm 3: Patients with renal tumors undergoing no treatment 4. Study Arm 4: Patients with renal tumors undergoing 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT. 18F-FAPI-RGD, a new fluorodeoxyglucose analogue of 18F-FDG, has increased tumor uptake and might enhance diagnostic accuracy in the detection and characterization of renal tumors. By combining its high specificity with standard diagnostic techniques including CT-scan abdominal imaging, and comparison with healthy controls, we hope to demonstrate this potential. 18F-FAPI-RGD will also be compared with current standard of care for renal tumor detection and characterization."

Pre- to post-treatment change: Patients assigned to the treatment group are treated with the experimental treatment, so the change between the two assessments is due to the treatment.

A pilot study found the inter-rater reliability to be 0.64. As the novel test is being evaluated in a diagnostic setting, a difference of 0.36 in sensitivity and specificity should be adequate to find a significant difference in accuracy between the test and current standards of care.

Why do you choose every 21 days for the administration of QL1706H in the dose escalation study arm? Is every-other-week administration preferred for this type of drug? This is the commonly used administration interval for medications with the similar mechanism of action, which leads to the assumption that a similar efficacy and safety profile can be expected. 3. Why QL1706H will be administered by subcutaneous injection in the dose escalation study arm, but by IV infusion in the dose exploration study arm? In the dose escalation study, subcutaneous administration is tried to evaluate the possibility of minimizing side effects, such as anti-drug antibodies, for QL1706H. IV is typically used for drugs that function by direct targeting to their site of action. 4. How are the treatment and evaluation phases of this clinical trial designed? In the first 21 days of treatment, the dose and schedule will be evaluated. In the following 42 days, treatment will be administered according to the pre-established schedule.\n5. Does the dose-escalation study continue until a particular dose of QL1706H is administered without DLTs or until a particular response rate is achieved? This study will continue until 3 cohorts have reached their highest tolerated dose without any DLTs.

Is this a first-in-human or first-in-man study? 3. Will the study subjects be healthy volunteers or patient volunteers? 4. Is an IRB approval obtained or planned for this study? 5. What are the anticipated adverse events, if any? 6. Do you have a timeline and budget for the study?",

            "Thank you for your help with this design.\nI believe the Study Plan below addresses your research question and meets the objectives. Would you agree?\nIn summary, the goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Topical DA-OTC-002 for the treatment of female pattern baldness. The study includes a total of four treatment arms: a high concentration arm, a low concentration arm, and two placebo arms (controlled with sham application or vehicle). The study duration is 8 weeks, with 24 subjects per arm. All subjects will undergo baseline, week 2, week 4, and week 8 assessments. A washout period of 8 weeks is included between treatment discontinuation and the 8-week assessment. The primary endpoint is changes in hair count and thickness in the target area. Secondary endpoints are based on other hair metrics assessed throughout the study. We plan to conduct a power analysis prior to study initiation to determine the number of subjects required to achieve 80% power for the study's primary endpoint at \u03b1=0.05. The study is designed as a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical trial. The trial will be performed at multiple clinical sites in the US."

The secondary outcome measures would include days alive without mechanical ventilation, length of stay, healthcare costs, adverse events, and survival. What about the number of days alive and ventilator free? I'm sorry, we don't have experience with that measure for clinical trials. So, I'd prefer to use days alive without mechanical ventilation. How about the length of stay? Is it okay if it's assessed as inpatient days or length of hospital stay? That's a great question. The length of stay could be assessed in days or as inpatient days. I'll talk to my team and get back to you. For the cost measure, do you prefer to measure total healthcare costs or other costs, such as out-of-pocket costs or lost income due to illness? Can you tell me more about the adverse events? Are there any adverse events that would be common in ALS or related to long term mechanical ventilation support? And for the survival measure, would it be okay if it is assessed from hospital discharge or is there a preferred time point? I prefer to use the time of consent for long-term mechanical ventilation. In that case, we would need to wait until all patients in the study have consented. That's okay. However, for the survival measure, we would need to assess survival from date of consent or from date of study enrollment. I prefer to assess survival from date of consent.

            "Yes, the treatment intervention for the comparator study group will involve immunohistochemistry to assess the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors, P53, and L1CAM. Further treatment will be decided after testing. Now, I will share the entry and exit criteria for your trial. First, the entry criteria will be limited to female patients aged 36 to 72 who have been diagnosed with endometrial endometrial carcinoma. The exclusion criteria will be patients without tumor tissue for intervention or tumor tissue with insufficient paraffin blocks for testing, histology with no evidence of endometrial carcinoma, patients with incomplete medical history data, patients with missing biomarker information, and patients with a documented prior history of any neoplasm. Patients will enter the trial within 72 hours of signing the informed consent. And, you mentioned that the trial duration is from day 0 to 24 hours. Therefore, patients will be followed up for a duration of 24 hours. And you mentioned that you will be doing immunohistochemistry for the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors, P53, and L1CAM. So, these biomarkers should be tested before the trial begins and after administration of the biomarker. Does this sound right?",

Recently, an extension of the original statement was released to help ensure rigor and transparency in the reporting of studies of measurement and diagnostic accuracy, the so-called \"The CONSORT ESA.\"\nAnother similar initiative is the \"The Recommendations for Reporting Urological Protective Equipment (RReME) checklist\" which \"provides a framework for authors to report the design and conduct of urological protective equipment trials, including single centre studies and multi-center studies, randomized trials, observational studies and non-comparative studies, in the form of a pre-registration form, as a checklist, or in the form of a structured abstract.\nAn extension to the RReME consensus statement was developed at the 2nd International MEta-Analysis Of Urologic PROtective Equipment (META-UROPE) Workshop.

            "Certainly! The intervention in the experimental arm will involve participants using the ISO-101 device. This is a wearable wrist device that aims to improve orthostatic hypotension by minimizing the postural change in blood pressure. This trial will take place at a single center and participants will be recruited from the outpatient hypertension clinic. Eligible participants include those with a clinically diagnosed orthostatic hypotension, as detected by a drop in systolic blood pressure of \u226520 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing up, as well as those with a resting diastolic blood pressure \u226450 mmHg. Participants will be excluded if they have a prior history of syncope, a recent history of heart attack, renal disease, a pacemaker, pregnant or breastfeeding women, or any other contraindications for isosceles, such as severe claustrophobia, depression, or fever at the time of assessment. Participants in both arms will be instructed to maintain their usual antihypertensive medications throughout the trial. During the study, the participants will be asked to wear the device for 14 days. On visit 1, the participants will undergo a 10-minute battery of tests, which will include measurements of vital signs, calibration of the isosceles, and then a tilt test, where the participant will stay still for five minutes, then stand up and their blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded over the next 10 minutes. They will get to wear the blood pressure monitor for another 3~ days and keep a diary of each 30-minute period where they get up from a sitting or lying down position to stand. On their final visit, which will be at day 14, they will have another round of the above tests and they will take home the isosceles and will be asked to return it by mail. Participants will be asked not to modify their physical activity or medication intake during the trial. They will also be asked to complete the Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Short form of the EQ-5D Health Status Questionnaire, the Short Physical General Health Scale and the Nottingham Facial Cognitive Impair",

Ethical considerations and informed consent In addition to obtaining informed consent, an assessment of psychological status in the form of a questionnaire will be conducted at frequent intervals in all the groups.

Both the arms will follow the protocols suggested by the physiotherapist. Our rationale for choosing these study arms was based on previous studies that had demonstrated the efficacy of video-game based therapy in improving upper limb function in individuals with cerebral palsy.

Female sex workers are often marginalized and their vulnerability and vulnerability to HIV infection is heightened due to their profession. In the context of Kazakhstan, research has documented low levels of access to health care and limited knowledge about HIV testing among this population.

The reasoning behind this arm is to examine the impact of food on the extent of inhibition of BMS-986368 drug level by reducing stomach pH.

Primary ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecologic malignancies in the United States. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, 40% of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed at a point of platinum resistance. We previously identified a combination of Dostarlimab, an anti- PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, and Niraparib as a promising therapeutic combination in preclinical models of platinum resistant ovarian cancer. We are investigating this combination in a Phase 1b study.  In the proposed first cohort of the study, eligible participants will receive Dostarlimab at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in combination with Niraparib (3PARP, 200mg bid) for 21 days every 28 days. Participants will receive up to 5 doses of Dostarlimab/Niraparib every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of Dostarlimab, Bevacizumab, and Niraparib in participants with platinum resistant ovarian cancer.",

It is definitely not intended as advice for \"first-time\" posters, i.e. those who are just preparing to submit their first poster presentation. There's plenty of other good sites to check for \"beginner\" advice.\nThese posts are presented as-is, with no additional editing or further explanation.\nDesigning a poster is an interactive process in which the poster \"tells the story\" of a scientific project or study.

            "Excellent suggestion! A second participant group related to regional anesthesia is a great idea. In fact, we might want to include a third participant group related to a control or comparator intervention/treatment. Let's focus on designing the study arms and include additional anesthesia-related groups. Would a participant group receiving general anesthesia with or without adjunct medications be helpful for this research question? It would be valuable to see a study arm with regional anesthesia alone or with or without adjunct medications, too. Adding these study arms would help differentiate among the potential causes of desflurane rise time variation.",
            "Another good idea! Including a comparison to a different inhalational anesthetic will provide even more information about the effects of desflurane. Now, how should we design this study arm?",
            "That's great! Let's move on to another study arm - what would you like to include here?",
            "Sure thing! How about designing a study arm examining a different anesthesia technique? For example:\nStudy Arm 3:\n- Participant Group/Arm: Patients scheduled for general anesthesia who agree to participate in the study and sign the informed consent form.\n- Intervention/Treatment: General anesthesia using sevoflurane.\n- Reasoning: Including a participant group related to general anesthesia allows for a comparison between different anesthesia techniques. By using sevoflurane as the inhalational agent, the researchers can observe the differences in desflurane onset time with respect to the other methodology.",
            "Of course! A great candidate for the participant group would be patients with renal insufficiency. For the intervention/treatment, we could study desflurane induction, as desflurane may have different effects in kidney-insufficient patients compared to other inhaled anesthetics.  With this information, the 3-arm design for this study would look like this:  \n- Participant Group/Arm: Patients with renal insufficiency scheduled for elective surgery.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Desflurane induction.\n- Control/Arm: sevoflurane induction or alternative anesthetic agent (eg, propofol, nitrous oxide, etc.)\n- Comparator/Arm: sevoflurane induction.\nThe idea is to compare the impact of desflurane on end-tidal desflurane level in subjects with renal insufficiency versus control subjects with different inhaled anesthetics. I think that this design is not only scientifically interesting, but may also be clinically relevant, as some inhaled anesthetics may have different pharmacokinetics in patients with renal insufficiency.  \nI hope this formula can be improved and fine tuned by you and/or other users.
