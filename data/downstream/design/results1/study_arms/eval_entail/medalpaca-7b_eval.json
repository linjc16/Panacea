            "Sure thing. The treatment arm will receive HU6, which is an investigational drug. The control arm will receive placebo, a pill that looks the same as HU6 but without the active ingredient. We'll randomly assign participants to either arm to make sure that they are assigned to the group they have the greatest chance of benefiting from. Once all participants have completed the study, we'll compare the relative efficacy of HU6 versus placebo.  [inst=0] Awesome. Do you have any further questions before I move forward with the design?",
            "The placebo comparator arm, which we'll call \"Placebo,\" will also include obese subjects with Type 2 Diabetes at risk of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis. Participants will receive a placebo, rather than HU6, and the primary purpose of this arm is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the placebo relative to HU6.",

The descriptions of the interventions/treatments in the model's output match the corresponding entries in the groundtruth table, indicating that the study arms are accurately represented.",

The groundtruth table clearly shows a \"Placebo Comparator: Placebo Comparator\" arm, which matches the \"Placebo\" arm described in the model's output. Therefore, the study arms from the model's output are present in the full table of groundtruth study arms, and the match prediction is 1.",

These two study arms are fully present in the groundtruth study arm table, which includes the \"Placebo Comparator: Placebo Comparator Non-active study drug\" arm and the \"Experimental: Active Treatment: HU6 Planned doses of HU6\" arm. The descriptions of the study arms in the model output match the descriptions in the groundtruth study arm table, indicating that the study arms mentioned in the model output are present in the full table of groundtruth study arms."
