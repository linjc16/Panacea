            "Sure.\n\nStudy Arm #1: HU6 Dosing\n\nParticipants in this arm will receive HU6 in 3 different dosing levels: 5mg/kg, 10mg/kg, and 15mg/kg, depending on their body weight. The drug will be administered twice daily for 28 days, with a total of 420mg / day in the 5mg/kg arm, 840mg / day in the 10mg/kg arm, and 1,260mg / day in the 15 mg/kg arm. This is a total of 28 days of treatment with HU6 after a 14-day washout period after completion of the baseline diet.",
            "The placebo comparator arm will be titled \"Placebo: Matching Placebo.\" This arm will be similar to the Active Treatment: HU6 arm, with the exception that participants will receive matching placebo instead of the active drug, HU6. This comparator arm is necessary to allow us to evaluate the effects of HU6 against a control condition. \n\nStudy design\n=================\nRandomized interventional\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Subjects, male or female, at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent (IC).\n2. BMI [Body Mass Index] of at least 25 to under 40 kg/m2 (kg/m2 = weight (kg)/height (m)2).\n3. Subjects with fasting glucose level of at least 110 to under 250 mg/dL (mg/dL = milligram [mg] per deciliter [dL]).\n4. Subjects with ALT [Alanine Aminotransferase] level of at least 20 to under 300 IU/L (International Unit [IU] per liter [L]).\nMinimum age: 18Y\nMaximum age: 80Y\nGender: Both\n\nExclusion criteria\n=================\nExclusion Criteria:\nNote for exclusion criteria of NAFLD 7. Subjects with a history of chronic liver disease (Chronic Liver Disease [CLD]).\n8. Subjects with a history or findings suggesting autoimmune liver disease.\n9. Subjects with a history of significant alcohol intake.\nNote for exclusion criteria of NAFLD 10. Subjects with a history of use of or addiction to alcohol which includes 15 units of alcohol or more per week for men and 10 units of alcohol or more per week for women for a period of at least six months. (1 unit of alcohol is equivalent to 360 mL of beer, 150 mL of wine, or 45 mL of liqueur/hard liquor.)\n11. Subjects with a history of clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) illness.\n12. Subjects with a history of cirrhosis.",
            "Yes, you've got it! We'll be testing two different doses of the study drug in the experimental part of the trial. One arm will be receiving a lower dose of HU6 and the other will be receiving a higher dose. The aim is to evaluate which dose will be the most effective for improving liver fat content, while still being well-tolerated by the participants."

            "Match prediction: 1\n\nExplanation:\nThe model output describes a study arm called \"Study Arm #1: HU6 Dosing\" which includes three different dosing levels of HU6: 5mg/kg, 10mg/kg, and 15mg/kg. This study arm is fully included in the groundtruth study arm table, which has an \"Experimental: Active Treatment: HU6 Planned doses of HU6\" arm that matches the description in the model output.\n\nThe groundtruth study arm table also includes a \"Placebo Comparator: Placebo Comparator Non-active study drug\" arm, which is not explicitly mentioned in the model output. However, the model output does state that the purpose of the study is to \"compare the safety and efficacy of HU6 to the placebo\", indicating that a placebo comparator arm is present, even though it is not described in detail.\n\nTherefore, the study arms mentioned in the model output are fully included in the groundtruth study arm table, and the match prediction is 1.",
