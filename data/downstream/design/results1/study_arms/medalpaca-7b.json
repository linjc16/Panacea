By including this arm, researchers can determine if any observed effects are specific to aerobic exercise or simply the result of increased physical activity.\n\n2. Experimental: 75 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 75 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is designed to test the effects of a low dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity in colon cancer survivors.

Experimental: 150 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 150 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm aims to evaluate the effects of a moderate dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity. By comparing this arm to the 75 min/wk arm, researchers can assess the impact of increasing the exercise duration on the outcomes of interest.\n\n4. Experimental: 225 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 225 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is designed to test the effects of a high dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity. By including a higher dose arm, researchers can assess whether increasing the duration of exercise further improves outcomes compared to the lower dose arms.\n\n5. Experimental: 300 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 300 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is included to evaluate the effects of a very high dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity.

If you have previous reports/studies to support the mode of delivery, I would proceed accordingly.  Feasibility is subjective. For example, if you are considering a treatment group where the participants are asked to travel long distances and stay for a long time, they may not deem it feasible due to time commitments and financial costs. In this case, you could add a question about the feasibility in the consent form or do teleconsultations. How many weeks do you require the participants to complete the program? What about participants with limited digital literacy? Is the time a barrier for participants, or is it the knowledge required?

The study will not involve any specific interventions for this arm, as it is an observational study looking at real-world data.\n\nReasoning: This study arm is essential for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of cemiplimab in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in a real-world setting. By focusing on patients who have received this specific treatment regimen as their first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC, the study can provide valuable insights into the outcomes of this combination therapy.

For example, the Shared Medical Decision-Making intervention would be offered to all participants in the Intervention Group. We explored several possibilities and discussed them until we arrived at an arm allocation plan that we felt was feasible and acceptable, taking into account practical and ethical considerations (e.g., there may be logistical challenges in delivering a treatment intervention only via video/phone for some population groups, there may be insufficient staffing or participant interest in implementing a particular approach, and so on).  We included all of the intervention(s) and control(s) that made it through this process and were logistically feasible, even if one or more might be deemed more or less attractive or promising than others.  We then chose an arm-group allocation scheme that seemed most appropriate to the research question. For example, if the aim/hypothesis were only modestly interesting insofar as to see if the Shared Medical Decision-Making intervention is feasible, we would include only the Intervention Group (Shared Decision-Making+Provider guidance) as we wanted to keep the design as simple as possible. In this example, the study would be a 2-arm crossover (or perhaps better a 3-arm crossover with the addition of a control group receiving no Shared Decision-Making intervention) RCT with the control being a form of usual care-plus-patient's existing decision-making.

Based on the information you've given me so far, I would suggest considering a single-arm design for this trial. The intervention arm could involve the use of the Intratumoral device for single or multiple injections of holmium-166 microspheres (up to 150 Gy) in a single session. This approach would allow for a standardized treatment approach to assess the safety and feasibility of the intervention. What do you think?",

As for the session frequency, I would recommend a single session for the intervention, without repetition. This approach would help streamline the study process and minimize confounding variables. Does that align with your goals for the trial?",

The first one is primary surgical tumor resection with anastomosis or only tumor resection without anastomosis. The intervention/treatment for this arm is primary tumor resection. This arm is crucial as it represents the standard approach for treating obstructive left colon cancer. It allows for the comparison between patients undergoing primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis or without an anastomosis (Hartmann's procedure). This comparison will help determine the optimal surgical approach for these patients in terms of outcomes such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.

We can modify the intervention/treatment description to specify primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis, associated with or without a diverting loop ileostomy. This modification will allow us to analyze the impact of diverting loop ileostomy on stoma rate and quality of life. Thank you for your input! Now, let's move on to the second participant group/arm. This arm involves endoscopic stent positioning. The intervention/treatment is staged resection after endoscopic stenting with Self-expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS). This arm is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic stenting as a bridge to surgery for patients with obstructive left colon cancer. By comparing this approach with primary surgical tumor resection, we can assess the outcomes and benefits of each strategy, such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and timing of chemotherapy initiation. This comparison will provide valuable information for clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment option for these patients. What are your thoughts on this arm?",

For the intervention, access to the gallbladder will be performed from the stomach or duodenum using a LAMS with an electrocautery-enhanced delivery system such as Hot Axios or Hot Spaxus. The size of the stent used will depend on the size of the largest gallstone, with a 10 mm diameter stent used for gallstones smaller than 10 mm and a larger diameter (\u226515 mm stent) used for gallstones larger than 10 mm. Additionally, if needed, colecystoscopy lithotripsy will be performed using mechanical lithotripsy and/or laser lithotripsy.

Experimental: real-rTMS\nParticipant Group/Arm: This arm includes individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease who will undergo real repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) sessions.\nIntervention/Treatment: The intervention involves 4 daily 25-minute high-frequency rTMS sessions over one week using a 70-mm figure-eight coil at 20Hz. Target localization will be performed with a stereotaxic neuronavigation system.\nReasoning: This arm is essential to test the efficacy of non-invasive stimulation techniques, specifically real rTMS, in modulating the default mode network (DMN) in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. By targeting this specific population with a known genetic risk factor for AD, the study aims to assess the potential benefits of this intervention in early stages of the disease.\n\n2.

Choose an outcome for the superiority trial It depends on what the sponsor wants to tell the world at the end of the day, but the most likely candidate is Oxygen saturation of arterial blood (O2 Sat). The best way to measure O2 Sat is by using pulse oximetry. SpO2 is a great, but it is not the best measure of O2 Sat, because it only looks at two parameters of oxygenation, rather than the total oxygen content of arterial blood. 2. Choose an equipoise-generating noninferiority margin In high-risk patients scheduled for GI endoscopy, what is the clinically relevant noninferiority difference in O2 Sat between nasal CPAP and nasal cannula oxygen? It is often agreed upon that a difference of less than 5% is clinically insignificant and that a difference of at least 10% is worth publishing. This difference also depends on what level of oxygenation is required for a task (i.e., sleep vs. GI endoscopy). 3.

Experimental Arm (CM313 Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 30 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive CM313.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of CM313 injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: This arm is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of CM313 in treating immune thrombocytopenia. By administering CM313 to a subset of patients, researchers can evaluate the drug's effectiveness in improving platelet counts and reducing symptoms. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design ensures unbiased results and allows for comparison with the placebo arm.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator Arm (Placebo Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 15 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive placebo.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of placebo injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: The placebo comparator arm is essential to establish the baseline for comparison with the CM313 intervention arm. By including a placebo group, researchers can assess the true effects of CM313 beyond any placebo effects. This arm helps to control for confounding variables and provides a more accurate assessment of the drug's efficacy and safety.",

This allows us to directly compare the performance of the systems in real-world conditions.

            "That is correct. The inclusion criteria are women who are 18 years old or older, multiparous, have no previous cesarean delivery, and have a non-vertex presenting twin in a term dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy. Now, let's move on to the intervention or treatment for this study arm. What do you suggest?",
            "Excellent choice. The ECV procedure involves attempting to manually turn the non-vertex presenting twin to a vertex presentation. This arm will help assess the effectiveness and safety of ECV in this specific population of women with twin pregnancies.",

            "Thank you for providing those details. Based on the information you've shared, let's discuss the design of each study arm. We can start with Arm A, which involves the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab. This arm is crucial to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in treating advanced NSCLC. By comparing this combination with cemiplimab alone, we can determine if the addition of fianlimab provides any additional benefit in terms of treatment outcomes. Additionally, using different doses of fianlimab in Phase 2 and Phase 3 allows for dose optimization based on initial results. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now let's move on to Arm B. This arm also involves the combination of fianlimab and cemiplimab. However, a lower dose of fianlimab is used in Phase 2, followed by the chosen dose in Phase 3. This design allows us to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy at different dose levels, providing valuable information on dose-response relationships. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "I'm glad you see the value in exploring different dose levels. Lastly, let's discuss Arm C. This arm serves as the control group in the study. Participants in this arm will receive cemiplimab monotherapy along with a placebo. Including a placebo allows us to assess the specific contribution of fianlimab to the treatment outcomes without the confounding effects of an active intervention. What are your thoughts on this arm?",

            "Sure! For the hot compressing group, we expect warming the hands and feet before administration of Oxaliplatin to reduce the peripheral side effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea, vomiting, and neuropathy. As for the cold compressing group, we expect cooling the hands and feet before administration of Oxaliplatin to reduce systemic vasomotor symptoms such as shivering and shakes during chemotherapy. Additionally, we will look at psychological effects, such as anxiety, in both groups as a secondary outcome. Finally, we'll measure nausea, vomiting, and neuropathy rates within 24-hours of chemotherapy. For the cold compressing group, we'll measure these symptoms again at 72-hours to see if the effects of the intervention persist or resolve. For the control group, we expect no change in symptoms.",

This temperature is within a range that has been shown to be comfortable for many participants, and is also not extreme enough to cause burns or other physical harm. Hot compresses are commonly used as a treatment for a variety of conditions, including nerve pain and muscle spasms. Applying warmth to the affected limbs has been shown to reduce pain, numbness, and tingling, as well as improve grip strength and muscle control.",
            "In the cold compressing group, patients will receive cool compresses on their hands and feet before and after Oxaliplatin administration. The temperature of the compresses will be kept within a range of 12-18 degrees Celsius. By using cold compresses, we aim to minimize peripheral neuropathy symptoms and improve the quality of life for those receiving chemotherapy. Adverse reactions will also be monitored to ensure safe use of the intervention.",
