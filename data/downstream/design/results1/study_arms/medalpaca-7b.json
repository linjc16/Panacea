By including this arm, researchers can determine if any observed effects are specific to aerobic exercise or simply the result of increased physical activity.\n\n2. Experimental: 75 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 75 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is designed to test the effects of a low dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity in colon cancer survivors.

Experimental: 150 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 150 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm aims to evaluate the effects of a moderate dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity. By comparing this arm to the 75 min/wk arm, researchers can assess the impact of increasing the exercise duration on the outcomes of interest.\n\n4. Experimental: 225 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 225 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is designed to test the effects of a high dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity. By including a higher dose arm, researchers can assess whether increasing the duration of exercise further improves outcomes compared to the lower dose arms.\n\n5. Experimental: 300 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 300 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is included to evaluate the effects of a very high dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity.

If you have previous reports/studies to support the mode of delivery, I would proceed accordingly.  Feasibility is subjective. For example, if you are considering a treatment group where the participants are asked to travel long distances and stay for a long time, they may not deem it feasible due to time commitments and financial costs. In this case, you could add a question about the feasibility in the consent form or do teleconsultations. How many weeks do you require the participants to complete the program? What about participants with limited digital literacy? Is the time a barrier for participants, or is it the knowledge required?

The study will not involve any specific interventions for this arm, as it is an observational study looking at real-world data.\n\nReasoning: This study arm is essential for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of cemiplimab in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in a real-world setting. By focusing on patients who have received this specific treatment regimen as their first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC, the study can provide valuable insights into the outcomes of this combination therapy.

For example, the Shared Medical Decision-Making intervention would be offered to all participants in the Intervention Group. We explored several possibilities and discussed them until we arrived at an arm allocation plan that we felt was feasible and acceptable, taking into account practical and ethical considerations (e.g., there may be logistical challenges in delivering a treatment intervention only via video/phone for some population groups, there may be insufficient staffing or participant interest in implementing a particular approach, and so on).  We included all of the intervention(s) and control(s) that made it through this process and were logistically feasible, even if one or more might be deemed more or less attractive or promising than others.  We then chose an arm-group allocation scheme that seemed most appropriate to the research question. For example, if the aim/hypothesis were only modestly interesting insofar as to see if the Shared Medical Decision-Making intervention is feasible, we would include only the Intervention Group (Shared Decision-Making+Provider guidance) as we wanted to keep the design as simple as possible. In this example, the study would be a 2-arm crossover (or perhaps better a 3-arm crossover with the addition of a control group receiving no Shared Decision-Making intervention) RCT with the control being a form of usual care-plus-patient's existing decision-making.

Based on the information you've given me so far, I would suggest considering a single-arm design for this trial. The intervention arm could involve the use of the Intratumoral device for single or multiple injections of holmium-166 microspheres (up to 150 Gy) in a single session. This approach would allow for a standardized treatment approach to assess the safety and feasibility of the intervention. What do you think?",

As for the session frequency, I would recommend a single session for the intervention, without repetition. This approach would help streamline the study process and minimize confounding variables. Does that align with your goals for the trial?",

The first one is primary surgical tumor resection with anastomosis or only tumor resection without anastomosis. The intervention/treatment for this arm is primary tumor resection. This arm is crucial as it represents the standard approach for treating obstructive left colon cancer. It allows for the comparison between patients undergoing primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis or without an anastomosis (Hartmann's procedure). This comparison will help determine the optimal surgical approach for these patients in terms of outcomes such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.

We can modify the intervention/treatment description to specify primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis, associated with or without a diverting loop ileostomy. This modification will allow us to analyze the impact of diverting loop ileostomy on stoma rate and quality of life. Thank you for your input! Now, let's move on to the second participant group/arm. This arm involves endoscopic stent positioning. The intervention/treatment is staged resection after endoscopic stenting with Self-expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS). This arm is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic stenting as a bridge to surgery for patients with obstructive left colon cancer. By comparing this approach with primary surgical tumor resection, we can assess the outcomes and benefits of each strategy, such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and timing of chemotherapy initiation. This comparison will provide valuable information for clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment option for these patients. What are your thoughts on this arm?",

For the intervention, access to the gallbladder will be performed from the stomach or duodenum using a LAMS with an electrocautery-enhanced delivery system such as Hot Axios or Hot Spaxus. The size of the stent used will depend on the size of the largest gallstone, with a 10 mm diameter stent used for gallstones smaller than 10 mm and a larger diameter (\u226515 mm stent) used for gallstones larger than 10 mm. Additionally, if needed, colecystoscopy lithotripsy will be performed using mechanical lithotripsy and/or laser lithotripsy.

Experimental: real-rTMS\nParticipant Group/Arm: This arm includes individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease who will undergo real repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) sessions.\nIntervention/Treatment: The intervention involves 4 daily 25-minute high-frequency rTMS sessions over one week using a 70-mm figure-eight coil at 20Hz. Target localization will be performed with a stereotaxic neuronavigation system.\nReasoning: This arm is essential to test the efficacy of non-invasive stimulation techniques, specifically real rTMS, in modulating the default mode network (DMN) in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease. By targeting this specific population with a known genetic risk factor for AD, the study aims to assess the potential benefits of this intervention in early stages of the disease.\n\n2.

Choose an outcome for the superiority trial It depends on what the sponsor wants to tell the world at the end of the day, but the most likely candidate is Oxygen saturation of arterial blood (O2 Sat). The best way to measure O2 Sat is by using pulse oximetry. SpO2 is a great, but it is not the best measure of O2 Sat, because it only looks at two parameters of oxygenation, rather than the total oxygen content of arterial blood. 2. Choose an equipoise-generating noninferiority margin In high-risk patients scheduled for GI endoscopy, what is the clinically relevant noninferiority difference in O2 Sat between nasal CPAP and nasal cannula oxygen? It is often agreed upon that a difference of less than 5% is clinically insignificant and that a difference of at least 10% is worth publishing. This difference also depends on what level of oxygenation is required for a task (i.e., sleep vs. GI endoscopy). 3.

Experimental Arm (CM313 Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 30 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive CM313.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of CM313 injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: This arm is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of CM313 in treating immune thrombocytopenia. By administering CM313 to a subset of patients, researchers can evaluate the drug's effectiveness in improving platelet counts and reducing symptoms. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design ensures unbiased results and allows for comparison with the placebo arm.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator Arm (Placebo Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 15 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive placebo.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of placebo injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: The placebo comparator arm is essential to establish the baseline for comparison with the CM313 intervention arm. By including a placebo group, researchers can assess the true effects of CM313 beyond any placebo effects. This arm helps to control for confounding variables and provides a more accurate assessment of the drug's efficacy and safety.",

This allows us to directly compare the performance of the systems in real-world conditions.

            "Including a control group is a valid consideration. It would provide a basis for comparison and help assess the effectiveness of the CoMBI-SMI intervention. We can design a control group that receives standard treatment or a placebo intervention. This will allow us to evaluate the specific impact of CoMBI-SMI compared to the control group.",
            "To define the criteria for the control group, we can use similar inclusion criteria as the experimental group, such as age range and presence of Serious Mental Illness. The main difference would be that participants in the control group should not receive the CoMBI-SMI intervention. This will help us determine the specific effects of the intervention compared to standard treatment alone.",
            "That's a great addition to the study arms. By including a control group, we can obtain more robust data on the effectiveness of CoMBI-SMI. Now, let's recap the study arms we have designed so far:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. Experimental: People with Serious Mental Illness\n   Intervention/Treatment: Behavioral: CoMBI-SMI\n\n2. Control Group: People with Serious Mental Illness\n   Intervention/Treatment: Standard Treatment\n\nThese study arms will allow us to compare the impact of CoMBI-SMI to standard treatment alone.

A domiciliary visit within 24-48 hours of referral will be conducted by a team member who will act as the case coordinator. Referrals for domiciliary care will be made based on patient needs, with individualized interventions prescribed.

The primary outcome is the time till a clinician has to increase the FiO2 to maintain an O2 saturation of 90% in the desaturating patients. A number of non-invasive techniques have been evaluated and shown that increasing the resistance of the breathing circuit reduces the FiO2 requirements during invasive TEE. The reduction in FiO2 is proportional to the resistance to airway. The safety concern regarding the HEPA filter of the MEA has been evaluated and deemed acceptable based on prior experiences with bronchoscopic procedures.

            "The goal of this study is to determine the impact of non-tailpipe air pollution on asthma symptoms. However, we have no way of knowing with certainty the precise concentration of air pollutants that will be present at each of the three air quality environments. By exposing participants to different air quality environments, we can determine the effect of different levels of non-tailpipe emissions on asthma symptoms. Since air quality varies greatly across different environments, and it is nearly impossible to control for all potential contaminants, this approach is the most effective way to determine the impact of non-tailpipe emissions on adults with mild-moderate asthma.",
            "Well, it's hard to say. We haven't really considered other study arms yet in this trial, but I can certainly provide some suggestions for other types of exercises or environments that might be good alternatives to the static bike. Maybe a treadmill or a stationary bicycle or even a cross-trainer? The study could also have a control arm with no intervention to compare the results to. I could also suggest assessing lung function before and after exercise, as well as throughout the trial, to provide data on changes in lung function that are specific to exercise. How about blood pressure and other heart rate measurements to assess any changes that might arise from the exercise?",

Many trials in the physical exercise setting compare the effects of exercise to a control group who do not exercise, while exposing the intervention group to different environments, such as high altitude or cold temperatures. Such a design would assess the effect of the exercise on physiology and performance in these different conditions.",

They will cycle on static exercise bikes at a standardized intensity of 60% estimated VO2max for a duration of 2.5 hours. This intervention is necessary to assess the impact of short-term exposure to increased non-tailpipe course mode PM on adults with asthma. By exposing participants to different air quality environments and monitoring their lung function and other health parameters, the study aims to determine the respiratory responses to varying levels of non-tailpipe emissions.",

By exposing participants to different air quality environments and measuring their lung function and other health parameters, the researchers can evaluate the effects of short-term exposure to non-tailpipe air pollution on adults with asthma. Cycling on static exercise bikes at a standardized intensity allows for controlled exposure to different air quality environments, providing valuable data on the respiratory responses to varying levels of non-tailpipe emissions.

Experimental: Intervention Group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Intervention group\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Well-Being Promotion Program\n   - Reasoning: This arm is necessary as it is the main focus of the study, aiming to examine the efficacy of the Well-being Promotion Program in enhancing subjective well-being, positive affect, life satisfaction, and reducing emotional/behavioral problems among adolescents. The intervention is designed to improve subjective well-being and is expected to assist in managing emotional and behavioral problems among the participants.\n\n2. No Intervention: Control Group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Control group\n   - Intervention/Treatment: None\n   - Reasoning: This arm is essential to compare the outcomes of the intervention group with a group that does not receive any intervention. By having a control group, researchers can assess the effectiveness of the Well-being Promotion Program in comparison to no intervention. This helps to determine the impact of the program and establish its efficacy in managing emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents.",

I have one question though: is this intervention supported by strong evidence? Can you please comment on the evidence of its effectiveness, preferably with links to published literature?  [/SQ] Hi, Myofunctional therapy is not as popular as the other therapeutic modes like CPAP, surgery or lifestyle measures; but it is gaining momentum due to increasing reports of effectiveness in certain patient populations. A recent Cochrane analysis has also provided positive results for myofunctional therapy in pediatric patients. The summary of the study is as follows: \"There is low\u2010 quality evidence that children who received myofunctional therapy had better outcomes than control groups in objective sleep parameters, use of CPAP, parent\u2010reported snoring, nocturnal en",

Participants will also receive guidance on physical activity. The training program is inspired by the WHO's recommendations for physical activity. Initially, there will be a 14-day introductory period where the goal is to achieve 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per day. After 14 days, the patient will receive physiotherapeutic guidance in physical activity and progress to the next period of 14 days, aiming for 2 sessions of 20 minutes of high-intensity physical activity per week. After one month of training, the patient will be guided on maintaining and possibly progressing physical activity.

This route of administration allows us to directly deliver the drug into the cerebrospinal fluid and assess its effects. Additionally, we will also administer placebo-matching ION717 by IT injection to serve as a control for comparison with the active drug. This will help us evaluate the specific effects of ION717 compared to the placebo.",

This consistent administration route allows for a direct comparison between the two regimens and helps in assessing the consistency of results. Additionally, we will administer placebo-matching ION717 by IT injection as a control for this regimen.

This arm will compare the efficacy of the 89Zr-DFO-trastuzumab PET scan with that of an alternative imaging modality, such as CECT (computed tomography) scan or ultrasound. The choice and specifics of the imaging modality will depend on each patient's individual characteristics, tumor type, and site.

Based on the information you've given me so far, I suggest the following study arms:\n\n1. Experimental: VR-TrAC\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the VR-TrAC group will follow the Virtual Reality Training for Aggression.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The VR-TRAC group will undergo a 16-session training program focused on aggression control using virtual reality technology. The training is based on the Virtual Reality Aggression Prevention Training (VRAPT) protocol developed by Klein Tuente et al. The sessions are structured to target different stages of information processing related to aggressive behavior, including early and late stages. Participants will practice handling aggressive-inducing situations in virtual reality scenarios.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is essential to assess the effectiveness of the VR-TRAC intervention in reducing aggression among the prison-based population. The structured training program using virtual reality technology allows for a controlled and immersive environment to practice aggression control strategies. By comparing the outcomes of this group with the control group, researchers can evaluate the impact of VR-TRAC on aggression regulation.\n\n2. Other: Care as Usual\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the Care as Usual group will receive standard care provided in the prison setting.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Care as Usual (CAU) in prison consists of treatments aimed at stabilizing psychological states, such as pharmacological treatment, supportive contact, or transfer to a Penitentiary Psychiatric Centre for necessary interventions.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as the control group for comparison with the VR-TRAC intervention group. By including a group that receives standard care practices in the prison environment, researchers can evaluate the additional benefits of the VR-TRAC program in reducing aggression beyond what is typically provided. This arm helps assess the incremental value of the VR-TRAC intervention in improving aggression control outcomes compared to standard care practices.",

This will provide more detailed insights into the underlying biology of urologic conditions and may lead to new therapeutic approaches. I think our design is now complete. It includes three study arms, with the first two arms having the same intervention of biological data collection and the third arm having no intervention. Is there anything else we need to include?",
            "Including patients with infertility will allow us to study potential underlying causes of infertility and explore new avenues for assisted reproductive technologies. The collection of biological data from these patients will help us identify important biomarkers for infertility and aid in developing new treatment options.",
            "You can use the full trial arms as follows:   Study Arm 1: Patients with urological diseases Study Arm 2: Patients with urologic cancer Study Arm 3: Healthy controls Study Arm 4: Patients with infertility\nCongratulations! You have just designed a research study with four study arms. Was it easy? Did you make any errors? Why or why not? What is your next step? \nThe COMET initiative\nThere are several key aspects to consider when designing a randomized clinical trial in urologic medicine. One set of criteria that has been used for many years is the \"Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Extension Statement\". These include items aimed at improving the reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a particular focus on clinical trials of medicinal products.\nThe CONSORT Extension Statement aims to improve reporting of the design, conduct, and reporting of RCTs of nonpharmacological, noninterventions trials, such as surgical trials. Recently, an extension of the original statement was released to help ensure rigor and transparency in the reporting of studies of measurement and diagnostic accuracy, the so-called \"The CONSORT ESA.\"\nAnother similar initiative is the \"The Recommendations for Reporting Urological Protective Equipment (RReME) checklist\" which \"provides a framework for authors to report the design and conduct of urological protective equipment trials, including single centre studies and multi-center studies, randomized trials, observational studies and non-comparative studies, in the form of a pre-registration form, as a checklist, or in the form of a structured abstract.\nAn extension to the RReME consensus statement was developed at the 2nd International MEta-Analysis Of Urologic PROtective Equipment (META-UROPE) Workshop. [2] This new statement aims to provide guidance for the reporting of urological protective equipment trials (i.e., non-pharmacological interventions), as well as studies of measurement and diagnostic accuracy, of which urological protective equipment is an integral part.\nThe MET",

            "That sounds like a reasonable choice. Including patients with urological diseases will allow us to study the underlying pathologies and potential biomarkers associated with these conditions. Collecting biological data from these patients will provide valuable insights. Let's move on to the next study arm.",
            "Excellent suggestion! Focusing on patients with urologic cancer will enable us to study the tumor biology, genetic mutations, and potential therapeutic targets associated with urologic malignancies. The collection of biological data from these patients will be crucial in our research.",
            "That's a great addition to the trial design. Including healthy donors as a control group will help us compare the biological samples obtained from patients with urological diseases and urologic cancer. This will allow us to identify any disease-specific biomarkers and differentiate normal variations from pathological changes. Now, let's move on to the final study arm.",
            "Including patients with infertility is a valuable choice. By collecting biological samples from this group, we can investigate potential biological markers and genetic factors associated with infertility in both male and female patients.

            "Certainly! Here are the study arms we have designed:\n\n1. Participant Group/Arm: Patients with urological diseases\n   Intervention/Treatment: Collection of biological data\n   Reasoning: This study arm is necessary to collect fresh biological material from patients with urological diseases in order to study the underlying pathologies and potential biomarkers associated with these conditions.\n\n2. Participant Group/Arm: Patients with urologic cancer\n   Intervention/Treatment: Collection of biological data\n   Reasoning: This study arm is important to specifically focus on patients with urologic cancer in order to study the tumor biology, genetic mutations, and potential therapeutic targets associated with urologic malignancies.\n\n3. Participant Group/Arm: Healthy donors\n   Intervention/Treatment: Collection of biological data\n   Reasoning: This study arm is essential to collect biological samples from healthy individuals to serve as a control group for comparison with the samples obtained from patients with urological diseases and urologic cancer.
