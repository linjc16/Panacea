Do you have any other questions? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe investigators have developed a research proposal to study the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibition in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). The investigators hypothesize that SGLT2 inhibition will provide benefits such as reduced worsening heart failure (HF), improved quality of life (QoL), reduced hospital re-admissions, and improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 6 months, as compared to placebo, in patients presenting with ADHF. The investigators have designed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof of concept study to investigate this hypothesis. In this study, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: 1) SGLT2 inhibitor group where patients will receive dapagliflozin 5 mg daily plus standard care; or 2) Placebo group where patients will receive placebo plus standard care. After 6 months, the investigators will evaluate the changes in serum proBNP, NYHA class, 6-min walk distance (6 MWD), LVEF, and hospital re-admissions between the 2 groups.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nSafety and Efficacy of Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibition in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF): A Single-Center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Proof Of Concept Study\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAcute Decompensated Heart Failure\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Dapagliflozin\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Men or women aged \u226518 years Patients admitted with ADHF Exclusion Criteria: Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin or sulfonylurea treatment within 2 months prior to randomization Impaired",

Are there any other outcomes you would like to include in the secondary parameters? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground and Aims: Previous clinical studies have reported a significant decrease in intestinal microbiota diversity by anti\u2010TNF treatment. However, no studies have evaluated the influence of ustekinumab (UST) on FMT treatment using a fecal enema kit (FEK) and intestinal microbiota composition and diversity. Methods: This pilot study was a double\u2010blind, double\u2010dummy, parallel study. Patients with CD who had previously undergone intestinal resection for strictures or obstruction were enrolled and divided into two groups to receive 90 mg of UST or adalimumab (ADA). FMT using a FEK was performed at baseline and every 12 weeks after admission. Microbiota composition and diversity were evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Results: 12 patients were analyzed for FMT treatment. The CDAI significantly decreased 12 weeks after intestinal resection. UST (90 mg) and ADA (40 mg) groups decreased the CDAI by 101.1 and 111.2, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the groups. The 16S rRNA V3\u2010V4 region sequencing showed that the Shannon index decreased immediately after resection in both groups, but the decrease was lower in the UST group than in the ADA group. However, the Simpson indices significantly increased at the same time point in both groups. The Simpson index was significantly higher in the ADA group, but the increase was significantly lower in both groups 8 weeks after intestinal resection. In this study, there was no significant correlation between CDAI, intestinal microbiota diversity, and FMT. Conclusion: This study suggests that UST does not significantly affect intestinal microbiota diversity during FMT treatment using a FEK and that FMT using a FEK is effective for patients with intestinal resection.\n\n1.

Anything else you would like to add? \nAbstract:\nBackground: The COVID\u201019 pandemic has exacerbated mental health problems in many adolescents and children. It is well\u2010documented that children and adolescents with siblings with developmental disabilities (DDs) experience similar problems and increased stress, so the role of siblings in promoting mental wellness has been highlighted. This study explores the potential for the use of a web\u2010based behavioral intervention, SIBTime, which is aimed at improving the relationship between young typically developing (TD) siblings and their DD siblings, and increasing the TD siblings\u2019 well\u2010being and adjustment. Methods: Young TD siblings (N = 100) and their parents/caregivers were randomly assigned to the intervention arm (n = 50) and control arm (n = 50) of the study. The intervention was designed to increase TD siblings\u2019 understanding of DDs and their impact on the family. The study used qualitative methods (semi\u2010structured interviews) and quantitative methods (self\u2010report measures), with 11 interviews conducted with 100 family members over 21 months. Results: Qualitative analysis showed that most young TD siblings were aware of their DD siblings\u2019 disability and its impact on the family, and reported feeling overwhelmed, concerned, and responsible for their siblings. However, through the intervention and the use of the SIBTime app, their attitude towards disability changed, and they reported feeling proud and responsible for providing support to their families. Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into how young TD siblings can be supported and included in the lives of children with DDs. The findings highlight the potential of using the SIBTime program to enhance the well\u2010being of TD siblings while also strengthening their relationship with their siblings with DDs."

All the best!\nAbstract:\nWe propose to study the effect of three different levels of vitamin D supplementation on bone resorption marker serum C\u2010telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) in type 1 diabetic female participants. Methods: We propose to conduct a double\u2010blind randomized controlled trial in which 40 type 1 diabetic females (aged 18\u201040 years) with bone mineral density (BMD) z\u2010score \u2264\u20101 at the spine and/or femur, will be randomized to (a) 20 000 IU vitamin D3 per os per month, (b) 20 000 IU vitamin D3 twice monthly and (c) control (calcium and vitamin D) for 6 months. Measurements will include serum C\u2010telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) at baseline and end of treatment (one year). CTX will be measured using a commercially available EIA method. Results: This 12\u2010month trial requires recruitment of 40 female diabetic subjects. Power analysis shows that for CTX differences of at least 50%, 44 subjects are required. This sample size will allow detection of statistically significant differences in serum C\u2010telopeptide of type I collagen concentrations with 80% power at 5% level of significance. Conclusions: This manuscript includes a detailed description of a biomarker endpoint, i.e. serum C\u2010telopeptide of type I collagen, for a clinical trial. Serum C\u2010telopeptide of type I collagen is an ideal biomarker endpoint to monitor bone turnover in this trial. Using 6 months of vitamin D3 administration at 3 dosages, this trial will provide information on the dose\u2010 response relationship between vitamin D3 status and C\u2010telopeptide of type I collagen."

Although COPD patients have different symptoms, exercise intolerance is most prominently reported. COPD is a risk factor in developing depression. Previous studies have demonstrated the negative effect of depression on exercise capacity, respiratory function recovery, and exercise intolerance. We hypothesized that a tailored pulmonary rehabilitation program focused on depression symptoms could be effective in enhancing physical function and endurance in patients with severe COPD. This trial is designed as a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. We evaluated depressive symptoms before, after, and 6 months following participation in either a tailored pulmonary rehabilitation program focused on depressed mood or a conventionally run pulmonary rehabilitation program. The primary outcome is the distance covered in the 6\u2010min walking test. Secondary outcomes include patient related outcomes, such as the St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and exercise tolerance, such body mass index, lung function using spirometry, and leg strength measured by hand\u2010grip.",

Prognosis in ALL depends on features including the type of fusion gene identified and the leukemia stage; about 50% of ALL patients with a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) or BCR\u2010ABL1+ do not achieve any significant remission with currently available chemotherapy. Recent research has shown that about 40% of adult ALL patients with Ph+ BCR\u2010ABL1+ have poor responses to treatment and are considered to be triple resistant (TP\u201053, FLT3, NPM1/MLL). The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in combination with all\u2010trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for the treatment of patients with TP\u201053, FLT3, NPM1/MLL+ BCR\u2010ABL1+ adult ALL. Materials and methods: The study included 70 patients with newly diagnosed BCR\u2010ABL1+ Ph+ adult ALL, 35 (50%) of whom were triple resistant. We used a combination of imatinib 600 mg (qd, days 1\u201028), dasatinib 100 mg/day (qd, days 1\u201028), and 2 cycles (from 1st cycle, days 1\u201014) of daily ATRA 100 mg/m2/day (from 2nd cycle, days 1\u20103) of induction treatment and maintenance treatment. We administered 100 mg/m2/day ATRA for 28 consecutive days of each cycle until complete remission. In complete remission, we administered ATRA, 50 mg/m2/day (for 28 days in every 28\u2010day cycle, up to 20 cycles), in combination with imatinib 400 mg/day (qd) or dasatinib 80 mg/day",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 33 young healthy human subjects volunteered for the study, were randomly subdivided into three groups (experimental group A, experimental group B or control group), and underwent training in visual search. Subjects filled in a questionnaire before and after training. They performed three tasks, one in which a fixation point was given (visual acuity), one with the aim of examining horizontal gaze saccades (horizontal saccades) and a third in which vertical gaze saccades were compared (vertical saccades).RESULTS: Following training A, a 6.4% significant improvement was obtained for vertical saccades (p <0.001) compared with the control group. Following training B, a 10.7% improvement was observed for the same test (p <0.001) compared with the control group. With regard to horizontal saccades, training A resulted in a 22.5% improvement, training B in an 11.4% improvement and the control group had a 20.3% improvement (p <0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that training subjects under 25 years of age resulted in a significant improvement in the performance of vertical gaze saccades.

            "Yes, there are a few other secondary outcome measures. Researchers will also evaluate patient satisfaction with the treatment using the Bladder Pain Syndrome / Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index. This measure assesses the severity of symptoms and their impact on daily activities. It will be evaluated at the initial appointment and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. \n\nAnother measure used to assess the impact of the treatment on quality of life is the Short Form 36 Health Survey. It's a standardized survey that evaluates eight health domains, including pain, physical function, mental health, and social functioning. It will be evaluated at the initial appointment and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups. \n\nResearchers will also use a measure to assess bladder mucosal healing, which is a potential benefit of the treatment. The measure involves inserting a catheter into the bladder and taking a biopsy. A pathologist will then evaluate the biopsy samples for signs of inflammation or ulceration, which may indicate that the treatment is leading to mucosal healing. \n\nFinally, researchers will evaluate the safety of the treatment by monitoring adverse events. As we mentioned before, nerve blocks are considered safe and effective, but there are potential risks associated with any medical procedure. Monitoring adverse events will help ensure that participants in the study are not experiencing any significant adverse effects from the treatment. \n\nOverall, by utilizing multiple outcome measures, researchers will be able to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of the pulsed radiofrequency ablation treatment for Bladder Pain Syndrome. \n\nWhat are the differences between pulsed radiofrequency ablation and traditional radiofrequency ablation?\n-----------------\nPulsed radiofrequency ablation is a newer treatment for chronic pain conditions and is being investigated as a potential alternative to traditional radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS). Traditional RFA delivers a high-frequency radio wave that produces an immediate injury to nerve tissue, resulting in pain relief in the area where the nerves are damaged. On the other hand, pulsed radiofrequency ablation utilizes a modulated, low-power radio wave that stimulates the nervous tissue rather than permanently damaging it. By stimulating nerve tissue",

This study aimed to explore the effectiveness and safety of combining the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab with the 5\u2010fluorouracil monophosphate prodrug liposomal 5'\u2010Deoxy\u20105'\u2010fluorocytidine (L\u2010DFC) and the pyrimidinesynthase inhibitor tirapazamine in the treatment of advanced CRC.METHODS: The 214 eligible patients in our open\u2010label study were randomly divided into two groups; one was treated with cetuximab combined with L\u2010DFC and the other received cetuximab alone. The patients' tumour lesions were observed for changes in size, and they were followed up. The study recorded the adverse reactions of the two groups and compared them.RESULTS: Overall response rates of 79.05% and 28.57% were recorded in the combined group (CG) and the cetuximab monotherapy group (MG), respectively. The tumour response rates were 81.53% and 56.55% in the CG and the MG, respectively. The duration of response in the combined group was significantly longer compared with that in the monotherapy group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), and the median response duration in the combined group was 7.34 months (95% CI, 5.31\u201013.88).

            "It's indeed a good idea to measure peripheral neuropathy symptoms more frequently throughout the treatment period. Measuring symptoms at each administration of chemotherapy drugs will provide a more detailed picture of the symptoms' progression. Additionally, measuring symptoms again within three months after chemotherapy completion will allow us to assess whether the symptoms' severity was affected by the intervention or persisted after treatment. Considering the treatment regimen, it's advisable to measure symptoms before the 6th and 12th administration of chemotherapy drugs, which coincide with mid-treatment (halfway) and end-treatment (at the end of the treatment course). It's worth noting that the time frame is based on the assumed study duration of six months, which can be adjusted as necessary.

The study will compare patients receiving Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with and without temperature packaging care. Patients with CIPN who are receiving Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to receive either heat compressing while receiving chemotherapy or not. The primary endpoint is the incidence rate of severe CIPN, while the secondary endpoints include assessments of quality of life, overall survival, treatment adherence, and cost-effectiveness. The study will adopt a randomization method to ensure that both groups are comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. The study team will be blinded to the treatment assignment to minimize bias. Statistical analysis will be performed to compare the effectiveness of temperature packaging care in reducing the incidence of severe CIPN and analyzing its impact on the quality of life of patients. The results of this study are expected to provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of temperature packaging care in reducing the incidence of CIPN in",

Before wrapping up, I'd like to make sure you're satisfied with the outcome measures we've selected for the study. Do you have any additional comments or questions? \nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPeripheral neuropathy (PN) is a common side effect of platinum-based chemotherapy such as Oxaliplatin, which is often used for colon, stomach, and lung cancers. Many patients experience pain and discomfort in their hands and/or feet. This pain can lead to difficulty in daily activities and reduce quality of life. It is crucial to maintain both motor nerve and sensory nerve functions of patients during a treatment course. Hot and cold pack applications may increase blood circulation and help to improve peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving Oxaliplatin. Moreover, the application of cold packs may prevent hypersensitivity or improve pain when administering platinum-based chemotherapy. This study aims to investigate the effect of hot and cold pack applications compared to standard care in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The study will monitor symptom intensity and severity, as well as evaluating quality of life. The investigators will also measure the ability to perform tasks and assess the motor and sensory functions of patients' hands and feet. The participants will be randomly assigned into an intervention group (hot and cold packs) or a control group (standard care). The study will measure the severity and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy every three months for a period of six months. The investigators expect that the application of hot and cold packs during the treatment period will help reduce pain and improve patients' quality of life and functional ability. The goal of this study is to support the use of hot and cold pack applications in clinical practice as part of holistic treatment protocols for CIPN.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Efficacy of Hot and Cold Packs in the Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nNeuropathic Pain Chronic\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Hot and",

However, the medication can cause dizziness as a side effect. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of calcium antagonist medication on dizziness, the most common side effect of nifedipine, using an audiology\u2010based screening method for hearing loss, a common cause of dizziness unrelated to medication.METHODS: Audiometry and clinical interview of patients were performed to obtain audiometry data and record the presence of hearing loss, vertigo, and the use of nifedipine and antihypertensive agents. A total of 200 patients were screened and divided into two groups: those taking nifedipine and the patients of the control group. The patients in both groups were randomly divided into three age ranges, with five patients in each group: Group 0 with a mean age of 32.2 years, group 1 with a mean age of 48.1 years, group 2 with a mean age of 64.1 years, and group 3 with a mean age of 90.1 years. The prevalence of hearing loss was analyzed statistically by age and gender and according to the use of nifedipine.RESULTS: The number of patients with mild, moderate, and severe hearing loss decreased with increasing age, with an increase in presbycusis. Hearing loss of the left ear was observed in three patients taking nifedipine, two (80%) of whom were in group 1 (mean age: 48.1 years). In addition, hearing loss of the right ear was observed in one case, which had decreased in the group taking nifedipine. This was observed in a 90\u2010year\u2010old patient (group 3, mean age: 90.1 years) who had no evidence of presbycusis or other hearing loss factors",

From December 2013 to June 2014, data from 53 patients who received oxaliplatin\u2010based regimes were recorded and analyzed. A total 41 patients with locally advanced gastric cancer and 12 patients with metastatic gastric cancer were included in the analysis. The baseline characteristics were consistent between the two groups. Cardiotoxicity was assessed in the patients receiving the oxaliplatin\u2010based regimen every 2 cycles. Clinical laboratory data, echocardiograms, and electrocardiograms (EKGs) were used to assess cardiotoxicity. One patient had a significant EKG conduction disturbance after the first cycle chemotherapy, without significant cardiac dysfunction identified by echocardiography and laboratory cardiac markers. Five patients presented with electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities such as PR prolongation or STsegment depression after oxaliplatin treatment, without any cardiac events. There were no significant laboratory abnormalities. One patient with advanced gastric cancer had significant left ventricular reduction and dysfunction after oxaliplatin\u2010based regimes. The patient was diagnosed with cardiotoxicity syndrome, and treatment with doxorubicin was discontinued. Another patient, with metastatic gastric cancer, had severe cardiac disease before chemotherapy. He received doxorubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine therapy. Severe cardiac disease, with atrial fibrillation and systolic ejection fraction (50%), was detected before treatment, and the patient completed a course of 6 cycles without significant cardiotoxicity. According to the data from this study, use of oxaliplatin in the patients with advanced gastric cancer with locally advanced disease did not induce a high incidence of cardioxaliplatin\u2010related cardiotoxicity. Patients with advanced gastric cancer at an earlier stage or with high\u2010risk factors may be more susceptible to the cardiotoxic effects of oxaliplatin."

The corneal sensitivity in each participant was measured with a Cochet\u2010Bonnet esthesiometer and the ocular surface health was evaluated by fluorescein staining, meibography, ocular surface disease index (OSDI), tear break\u2010up time (BUT), Schirmer test and infrared meibography (IRM) before, immediately after and 30 min following instillation of LV\u2010HS (236 mOsm/L). The primary endpoint was the change in corneal sensitivity. Sub\u2010group analyses were performed by age (\u2264 47, > 47 years).RESULTS Following application of LV\u2010HS, corneal sensitivity decreased significantly (p < 0.01); the mean reduction in corneal sensitivity was \u2212 0.44 \u00b1 1.76 logarithm of units (Log U). The mean pre\u2010treatment Log U values were 4.09 \u00b1 1.56 for CL wearers (n = 56) and 3.37 \u00b1 1.59 for non\u2010wearers (n = 31). There was no significant difference in the reduction of corneal sensitivity for CL wearers compared with non\u2010wearers. The corneal sensitivity also decreased in CL wearers aged > 47 years, but not in CL wearers aged \u2264 47 years.CONCLUSION Application of LV\u2010HS reduced corneal sensitivity, although the effect was not significantly different between CL wearers and non\u2010wearers. Irrespective of contact lens use and ageing, hypertonic saline should be used with care, especially in contact lens wearers who show poorer corneal sensitivity."

            "Are there any secondary outcome measures you want to include? \n\nAbstract:\nThis study aimed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the TAKE CARE procedure in a multimodal treatment for patients with rotator cuff problems. Of the total sample of 121 patients in this study, 22 patients were randomized to the TAKE CARE group and 27 patients with contraindications to the procedure were excluded. All patients were given painkillers, nonsteroidal antiinflam\u2010 matory drugs, and physical therapy. The outcomes of the pre\u2010 and postprocedure periods were compared among patients and in the TAKE CARE group using a Mann\u2010Whitney U test and chi\u2010squared test, respectively. The results of posthoc comparisons of outcomes before and after the surgery were also analyzed using a Mann\u2010Whitney U test. The results showed significant differences in the constant score (CS), simple shoulder tests (SST), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, and mean of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after the procedure (all p < 0.0001). The results showed no statistically significant differences in patient demographics. In the pre\u2010 and postprocedure periods, the TAKE CARE group showed significant improvements in the CS (p = 0.003), SST (p = 0.000), DASH (p = 0.001), and VAS for active arm motion (p = 0.006) compared with the contraindicated group. No adverse effects from the TAKE CARE procedure were observed, suggesting the safety of the procedure. Based on the favorable results of the study, the safety and efficacy of the TAKE CARE procedure were confirmed. Thus, it may be possible to use the procedure to assist with a multimodal treatment program.",

We can measure this outcome at the same time points as the other outcomes. Is that okay?",
            "Great! Let's move on to the next question. What is the duration of the intervention/treatment in the study? \n\nStudy design\n=================\nProspective, comparative, single-center, single-group (cohort) with longitudinal follow-up\n\nDescription\n=================\nFrozen shoulder syndrome (FSS) is a rotator cuff disease characterized by shoulder joint dysfunction and pain without any definite pathology. The pathophysiology is not well understood but is considered the result of capsular fibrosis. Although initially rare, FSS has become a common diagnosis in recent years, and this increasing incidence affects the quality of life of patients.  Currently, the treatment recommended in clinical practice is arthrolysis. Despite the excellent results obtained in the short term, arthrolysis of the shoulder joint capsule does not prevent the onset of adhesive capsulitis, with recurrence rates of 32-40% and complications occurring in 1-6% of people who undergo this procedure. In this way, the search for new treatment methods is imperative.  Exercises based on the principles of the Mulligan technique and joint mobilizations have been proposed as a possible alternative to surgery, resulting in promising results. The aim of this study is, first, to check whether manipulation of the shoulder joint capsule, along with the usual protocol of mobilizations and exercises, has short-term effects on FSS, and second, to compare this method with the classic protocol, analyzing the adhesions and levels of pain that occur weeks or months after the procedure and assess their long-term effectiveness.  Design: This is a prospective study (non-randomized), and a control group of patients will not be used.  Intervention: Both arms of the population will undergo conservative management. Arm 1: This arm will perform a program of joint mobilization and stretching of the scapular and rotator muscles (standard care) and an infraspinatus adhesiolysis. This will be performed following the guidelines of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.  Arm 2: This consists of a program of manual mobilization, stretching of the shoulder joint and rotator muscles (standard care) combined with manipulation of the subacromial space. This will be performed following the guidelines of the American Society of An",

It ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). We can measure this outcome at the same time points as the primary outcome measures. \n\nAbstract:\nObjective: To evaluate the utility of self\u2010reporting pain and self\u2010management in patients with non\u2010specific chronic low back pain. Methods: The study was a 4\u2010week randomized control trial with three arms. Participants were recruited via a chiropractic practice. Patients were randomized to either a control group (who received standard of care), a group which received exercise, pain management and manual therapy, and a group who received both exercise and a CBT intervention. The 2 groups which received manual treatments were also exposed to additional CBT information in the form of a pamphlet. Measures utilized were the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Pain Disability Index (PDI), which were administered at 0, 4, 16 and 52 weeks post initial visit. Participants completed a health and function questionnaire (SF\u201036) at the beginning of the study and were assessed on the day of the 52 week follow\u2010up. Results: Three hundred one patients were invited to participate in the study. A total of 154 participants were randomized into one of the three treatment groups, however 59 were lost to follow\u2010up. No significant differences were found between the groups for ODI or PDI scores at 4, 16 or 52 weeks for initial or follow\u2010up visits. Group 2 (exercise combined with CBT) demonstrated the highest initial ODI score (28.9) and lowest follow\u2010up ODI score (23.5) while Group 3 (exercise plus manual therapy plus CBT) demonstrated the lowest initial and follow\u2010up PDI scores (21.9 and 13.1, respectively). Conclusions: Exercise, pain management and manual therapy improved self\u2010reporting of physical function. Further research on the effects of self\u2010reporting on pain and function are needed in order to confirm the findings of this study.",

The study sample consists of 110 out of hospital elderly participants, with the mean age being 76 years \u00b1 3.8, who are scheduled for elective foot surgery. Before surgery, patients receive conventional education about foot surgery. Patients in the intervention group receive in addition 3-dimensional, visualization-based training which takes place either in the home environment or hospital prior to the surgery, patients in the control group are given conventional (2-dimensional) education material about foot surgery that is taken from the internet. A telephone-call at 8h, day 4 and day 7 postoperative is done to control for medication use for pain management, and the degree of pain catastrophizing is measured by Pain Catastrophizing Scale-short form (PCS-SF) questionnaire 1 and 4 days postoperative.\n\nStudy design\n=================\nThe trial is a multicenter, single-blinded and randomized controlled study where each patient is assigned to 1 of the 2 study groups by sealed envelope procedure, respectively random number generator.

In both studies, 12 weeks (Week 0 to Week 12) of treatment was the same. During this period, an anti-anginal regimen consisting of three antianginal drug therapies (Candoxatril, carvedilol, and atenolol) was administered. In the Phase III study, the Candoxatril 15-mg and 30-mg doses were selected because both doses were found to be superior to placebo in the JTIN CIP 1 study, and no dose-dependent changes in treatment efficacy were noted. Candoxatril administration was continued in the JTIN CIP 2 study for 54 weeks (Week 12 to Week 66). 25 mg of candoxatril sodium (1 DAAOi/day) was administered orally during weeks 13 to 16, 37 to 40, and 60 to 63, and 20 mg orally twice daily was administered during weeks 17 to 40 and 41 to 65. Each treatment was continued until a patient with recurring angina pectoris and/or severe heart failure was discontinued from the protocol.

            "Of course! The BSI has been validated and translated into Dutch and consists of 26 questions. Patients are asked about the frequency of various psychological and physical symptoms. These questions are rated on scales from 0 (in no way at all) to 4 (extremely). The total score for each domain is calculated and provides an indication of the severity of the symptoms. The questionnaire will be administered at the same time points as the NPI-Q, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's symptoms throughout the study. \n\nBackground\nThe number of people experiencing serious mental disorders (SMI) worldwide is growing, and as a result, the number of people with these disorders in Dutch hospitals is also steadily increasing. Despite this increase, patients with SMI continue to face challenges when accessing hospital services and participating in treatment programmes. Finding a solution to integrate people with SMI into hospitals is essential for improving the quality of care and reducing stigmatization. The CoMBI-SMI programme is a Dutch intervention that aims to help people with SMI engage in social activities and participate in daily life. It consists of four modules that are delivered over a period of 16 weeks: Module 1 involves assessment of the patient's needs and setting goals; Module 2 involves teaching patients to participate in hospital activities; Module 3 involves reinforcing the implementation of strategies learned in Modules 1 and 2; and Module 4 involves final examinations and evaluations. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the CoMBI-SMI programme in improving the quality of care for patients with SMI in Dutch hospitals. To accomplish this, data from 405 patients will be collected prospectively and analysed using appropriate statistical methods. The study focuses on the impact of the programme on social engagement, hospitalization status, medication use, and physical health. The results of this study will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the CoMBI-SMI programme in improving the quality of care for patients with SMI in Dutch hospitals.\n1.1 Programme\nThe aim of the programme is to enhance the patient's integration into hospital daily life and activities to be more involved in activities in their environment and daily routines and to be socially valued.

The questionnaire will be provided to the patients of the intervention study after the first and last CoMBI-SMI training session, which will take place on day 2 and day 15, respectively. This allows for an assessment of the potential effects of the CoMBI-SMI training on the patients' quality of life. In addition, the MHQoL-7D score will be compared to other scores, such as the EuroQol 5 dimensions, the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Questionnaire.

These domains include delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, fear, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibited behavior, irritability/lability, aimless repetitive behavior, night restlessness/sleep disorder, and appetite/eating behavior change. The questionnaire assesses the presence and severity of each symptom, as well as the emotional burden on the caregiver. It will be assessed before the start of treatment as usual (TAU), before the CoMBI-SMI training, and after 4 weeks of CoMBI-SMI training. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of changes in symptoms over time.",
            "For the second outcome measure, I recommend considering the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). This comprehensive questionnaire assesses psychological and physical symptoms in patients. It covers various domains such as somatic complaints, cognitive problems, interpersonal sensitivity, and more. The BSI provides a detailed overview of the patient's symptoms and their severity. It is also sensitive to therapy influences, making it suitable for evaluating the impact of the CoMBI-SMI intervention. Does this measure align with your study objectives?",

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe rationale for this study is to address concerns regarding an increased risk of progression- or polyp-related complications in the colon of patients with rectal cancer who have undergone surgery. This study will investigate whether screening colonoscopy performed 1) at 2 years following surgery (rather than the usual 5 year interval) or 2) at 5 years together with high dose prophylaxis with aspirin 300 mg/day is effective, safe and cost-efficient.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe results of a recent Swedish randomized study indicate that 5-year mortality is lower in patients receiving an ileoretical anastomosis following surgery for rectal cancer, when compared to patients receiving a low anterior resection with colorectal anastomosis. However, patients undergoing ileoretical anastomosis have also been reported to have an increased risk for progression to and/or polyp-related complications in the colon as well as colorectal cancer. As such, colonoscopic surveillance is recommended in these patients. However, colonoscopies performed within the first 2 years after surgery have a lower detection rate compared with colonoscopies performed a few years later due to technical difficulties caused by altered bowel anatomy. This raises the question whether a colonoscopy scheduled 2-years after surgery might miss colonic polyps. In a Finnish study the incidence of advanced colorectal adenomas was three-fold in patients who had their surveillance colonoscopy 2 years after rectal cancer surgery compared with patients undergoing colonoscopy at 3 years. This is in line with a Danish study showing a reduced detection rate for polyps with 7-9mm in largest dimension when comparing a screening colonoscopy performed at two years after surgery to a screening colonoscopy performed after three years or more. Whether a colonoscopy performed at 2 years after surgery combined with a screening colonoscopy 2-3 years later would be superior to performing the screening colonoscopy after 3 years remains unknown. In addition, colon cancer following ileorectal anastomosis develops on areas of altered bowel anatomy (i.e. in the ileo-rectal region), which suggests that high dose pro",

Because ADHD frequently co\u2010occurs with a developmental language disorder, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is appropriate to examine the effect of therapy on core cognitive defi ts associated with both disorders. METHODS/DESIGN: In children and adolescents ages 5\u201017 who have a diagnosis of ADHD and co\u2010morbid ASD or language impairment, we propose a pilot randomized double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled crossover phase I trial to evaluate the preliminary effi cacy of doses of 50\u2010, 100\u2010, 50 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks followed by a 4\u2010week no\u2010drug washout phase using a randomized double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled design to evaluate the effi cacy the phenylalanine supplementation.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, comparative study of 180 eyes that underwent pars plana vitectomy (PPV) with lensectomy from March 2010 to February 2013. We divided the eyes into two groups according to the number of postoperative weeks after surgery: the prolonged lateral position group (LP\u2010group; n = 92) and the short\u2010term lateral position group (ST\u2010group; n = 88). An uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20 / 25 or better was defined as a favorable outcome. RESULTS: The mean age was 76.5+/\u20108.8 years in the LP\u2010group, and 74.9+/\u20108.6 years in the ST\u2010group. In the LP\u2010group, 12 eyes (13.0%) lost less than one line of Snellen equivalent, 12 eyes (13.0%) lost two lines of Snellen equivalent, and 68 eyes (74.1%) recovered three or more lines of Snellen equivalent. In the ST\u2010group, 10 eyes (11.3%) lost less than one line of Snellen equivalent, 13 eyes (14.8%) lost two lines of Snellen equivalent, and 65 eyes (73.9%) recovered three or more lines of Snellen equivalent. The visual outcomes were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The postoperative visual outcomes \u2265 8 weeks after vitrectomy were similar between the LP\u2010group and the ST\u2010group.

No therapy is currently available, and there is an unmet need due to the significant and detrimental impact STD has on patients\u2019 mobility and quality of life . CM leads to clinical symptoms in the upper extremities (UE) and lower extremities (LE) and is mainly caused by cervical spinal cord compression (CSC). We performed MRI scans of the head and cervical spine of achondroplastic patients and investigated potential correlations between the cervicothoracic angle (CTA), the cervical\u2010thoracic ratio (CTR), the presence of CSC, and CM. Methods: Prospective cohort study comprising 30 male and female individuals (3\u201069 years) with ACH. All included subjects underwent cranio\u2010cervical MRI of the head and cervical spine. CTA and CTR were measured and related to the presence of CSC or to symptoms of CM. Results: CCTA was 126\u00b0 and ranged from 120\u00b0 to 133\u00b0 in males and 128\u00b0 in females (p<0.001). There was a higher CCTA in the male group compared with females (p=0.004). The mean CCTA was 129\u00b0 in men with CSC and 120\u00b0 in men without CSC (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in CCTA between individuals with CM and those without CM. Furthermore, CTR in men with CSC was 46.7 vs 45.4 respectively.

The treatment options of women are limited to drug therapy and a dietary approach. However, antihypertensive therapy has been shown to have limited efficacy and is often complicated by the occurrence of maternal and fetal adverse effects. In addition, there is a tendency towards the development of hypertension following a normal pregnancy. A dietary approach is therefore interesting and is one of the main reasons for the interest shown in the role of low proteins and protein restriction in preventing the development of preeclampsia. However, no clear data are available on the long-term effects of dietary restriction on the general population. The primary aim of the REFRESH study (REstriction in protein at the Fetal stage and in women HEalth) is to examine the long-term consequences of early and transient protein restriction in women with preeclampsia and in the general population. Hypotheses : 1) Protein restriction in preeclamptic women is associated with an improvement of systolic blood pressure in the 5 years after childbirth. 2) Protein restriction in healthy pregnant women is associated with an improvement of gluco-lipid metabolism and renal function in the 5 years after delivery. 3) Protein restriction in healthy pregnant women is associated with an improvement of body composition and insulin sensitivity in the 5 years following childbirth. This study aims to evaluate the short and medium-term consequences of protein restriction during pregnancy. Women will be randomized at 20 weeks of gestation into two groups: group A will continue their antenatal protein intake according to standard recommendations (1.0 g/kg / d), and group B will follow a low-protein diet (0.8 g/kg / d), with the exception of a single case: women with preeclampsia who are asked to carry out",

Any other outcome measures you'd like to include in the study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis clinical trial is testing the relationship of phenylketonuria, or PKU diet adherence to cognition and attention in individuals with PKU. Cognitive impairment is a common outcome of poor PKU control in childhood and adulthood. Recent research has suggested that this impairment correlates with both suboptimal PKU control and elevated plasma phenylalanine concentration. This research proposes to use neuroimaging methods to assess the relationship between cognitive function, plasma phenylalanine, and PKU diet adherence in children with PKU and healthy children. In this study, 35 children with PKU and 35 healthy controls will participate in a single research testing day. The study will involve several tasks, including blood draw for plasma phenylalanine levels, brain scans like electroencephalogram (EEG) that record brain wave activity and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) that records the magnetic fields created by the normal functioning of the brain, and computerized tasks that will measure attention and response inhibition during 2 days of testing. Data collection is anticipated to take about 6-10 hours, and will occur at the University of Minnesota Medical School Clinics and Research Center.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nObjectives: To understand how plasma levels of phenylalanine and brain activity are related to behavioral, cognitive, and physiological measures, while exposed to the experimental effects of food. Methods: This study will be a cross-sectional, case-control study. The study population will consist of 102 individuals, 35 with PKU and 35 healthy controls (ages 8-17 years). The experimental protocol will consist of one research testing session.

            "Abstract:\nPURPOSE: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive loss of muscle tissue leading to muscle weakness and impairment of ambulation. Longer life expectancy and increasing evidence of cardiac involvement in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy underscore the urgent need for reliable clinical markers of cardiotoxicity for treatment development. We explored the value of N\u2010terminal pro\u2010brain natriuretic peptide (NT\u2010proBNP), a marker of cardiac stress and strain, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and correlated NT\u2010proBNP to measures of cardiac remodeling and cardiac function in an observational cross\u2010sectional study of 31 subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and 10 age\u2010 and sex\u2010matched controls.METHODOLOGY: NT -proBNP correlated with echocardiography measures of cardiac remodeling and systolic and diastolic function and with measures of quality of life and exercise capacity. Factors such as age, cardiac impairments and dystrophin genotype did not appear to impact NT\u2010proBNP levels significantly. Nonetheless, NT\u2010proBNP levels in Duchenne muscular dystrophy differed significantly from control subjects.CONCLUSION: N\u2010terminal pro\u2010brain natriuretic peptide might be useful as a marker of cardiac remodeling in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; it deserves further investigation as a potential biomarker."

Could you also tell me if you are looking for healthy volunteers/participants? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPatients with NICM and FMR are at risk for complications secondary to ventricular remodeling (cardiac dilation and hypertrophy) which results from progressive stretching of the myocardium. The mechanisms by which this stretching occurs are poorly understood, but it is known that the heart is a highly mechanosensitive organ that uses a variety of intercellular chemical mediators to communicate under different loading conditions. There are several factors that may lead to structural abnormalities in the heart. One factor, stretch or stretch-like stimulation (SLS), is a major cause of interstitial fibrosis as evidenced by the presence of collagen (connective tissue) that builds up in response to stretching. As collagen accumulates, the heart's ability to pump blood may become diminished. Additionally, accumulation of collagen and ventricular remodeling lead to heart failure and arrhythmia with an associated decrease in patients' quality of life. FMR is a heart valve disorder affecting the mitral valve. Unlike valvular heart disease (such as aortic and mitral valve stenosis and insufficiency) which can be managed with surgical intervention, management of FMR to date has been solely with medical management. It is well known that functional mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common type of MR that can arise in both early and late stages of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The underlying etiology of functional MR secondary to NICM still remains poorly understood. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if there are differences in ventricular myocardial mechanics and structure between normal patients and those with FMR secondary to NICM.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPatients with functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) associated with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) experience poor functional status due to advanced heart failure, arrhythmia, and/or impaired quality of life (QOL). In order to improve outcomes in patients with FMR, it is imperative that we fully understand the underlying mechanisms driving mechanical and morphologic (tissues and organs)",

Using behavioral and neurochemical techniques, we examined the effects of intravenous administration of CRF(1\u201041) (100 \u03bcg/kg/h) and a competitive \u03bc\u2010opioid antagonist (naloxone, 2 mg/kg/h) on the development and maintenance of peripheral and central hypersensitivity following acute nerve injury. In a crossover design following a 5\u2010day tetanization, the ability of CRF and naloxone to modulate the development of hypersensitivity in the injured and uninjured periphery as well as the hindpaw to the noxious stimulus (formalin writhing) was determined. In a second experiment, the interaction of CRF and naloxone on long\u2010term changes in evoked dopamine release from the rostral ventral medulla (RVMP) and behavioral responses to acute mechanical and thermal stimuli was assessed.

This intervention is an implementation of the AUDIT-C tool. We will use a standardized manual of instructions, which has previously demonstrated efficacy (Clay et al, 2021). Participants will receive a feedback-based intervention with a trained research assistant within 24 hours of their hospital admission. The intervention is an implementation of the AUDIT feedback counseling model. The AUDIT intervention will include motivational information regarding alcohol use, and a feedback form will be used to convey information regarding risk of developing cirrhosis. Participants will be given a feedback form regarding their level of risk and a comparison to other patients of their age. The feedback form will also recommend a specific number of standard drinks for an individual to have each night to remain at or below the risk of developing cirrhosis. The feedback form will also include information about the costs of drinking alcohol and the benefits of reducing or stopping alcohol use. Participants who have had an alcohol-related complication within the preceding year, such as cirrhosis or gastritis, will have a modified feedback form with specific information regarding alcohol use and its impact on their health. This study has also applied for Ethics exemption from the University of Calgary for this form of feedback. Counseling will be provided by a trained Research Assistant who will contact the participants the following day, within 24 hours of discharge. The counselor will ensure that the information provided is understood, will engage in brief motivational interviewing to promote a reduction in consumption, and will reinforce the importance of the feedback form. The intervention will then be provided again to provide a recap of the feedback form.\nNumber of Arms:: 2\nTarget Number of Participant:: 140\nArm Type:: Experimental\nArm Description:: Intervention is tailored alcohol screening and feedback based on their AUDIT-C score and based",

One of the possible approaches to reduce the psychological impact of hip and knee OA is the use of psychological interventions that increase patients' adaptive coping, ability to make an emotional adjustment to their condition and to perceive pain as a tolerable sensation. Furthermore, a previous study reported that coping with patients is beneficial to psychological well\u2010being. However, it is unclear whether psychological interventions have beneficial effects on reducing pain and disability in patients with knee OA. The aim of this study was to assess the benefits of a specific psychological intervention program for patients with knee OA. METHODS: The sample consisted of 62 consecutive outpatients of the Toho University Ohashi Medical Center who met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical criteria for OA and who underwent knee arthroscopic surgery. Patients were randomized into study (n = 32) or control groups (n = 30). Patients in the study group underwent four 1\u2010h counseling sessions while those in the control group received a simple information booklet. The interventions were performed by a trained social worker. Patients in both groups completed self\u2010report questionnaires before and after surgery, as well as 6 months after the initial assessment. Data were collected using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) and the Patient\u2010Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures. The primary outcome was the PROMIS Pain Interference score and the secondary outcomes were all 24 PROMIS domains. All outcomes were measured at 3 time points. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups in any outcome measure at baseline. At 6 months, the between\u2010group difference in the PROMIS Pain Interference score was non\u2010significant and there were no differences between groups in other PROMIS measures.

            "One option would be to study the relationship between virtual reality and physiological measures of anxiety. For example, you can analyze heart rate variability and blood pressure during the procedure. This can provide insights into the physiological mechanisms of anxiety reduction. Additionally, you can measure the perceived helpfulness of virtual reality by asking the patients directly after the procedure. This can provide qualitative data on how effective virtual reality is in managing anxiety. The time frame for this measure would be 10 minutes after the procedure, and the data can be analyzed using descriptive statistics. What do you think? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nBackground: Intraoperative agitation is a clinical condition that occurs during general anesthesia and can increase the risk of aspiration and cardiovascular complications. The incidence of intraoperative agitation ranges from 2.5% to 5%. Patients who require prolonged general anesthesia may be more prone to agitation, such as those undergoing extensive surgical procedures. The prevalence of intraoperative agitation can be up to 80% in patients who receive neuraxial anesthesia. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend preventive measures such as sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis to manage intraoperative agitation. However, these measures may have adverse effects, including respiratory depression. Research has suggested that intraoperative agitation may be associated with postoperative delirium. An important risk factor for delirium is anxiety during the perioperative period. Newly formulated non-invasive monitoring may help assess intraoperative patient anxiety quickly and accurately, such as the non-invasive electrocardiogram. In particular, increased heart rate and decrease in heart rate variability have been reported in patients with anxiety. Clinical observation results suggest that increased patient anxiety during surgery is not only not conducive to the patient's stress hormone level control, it may even lead to the exacerbation of anxiety, which is detrimental to clinical work. The occurrence of intraoperative agitation will also increase the incidence of postoperative delirium, reduce the self-rating anxiety scale score of general anesthesia for a large period of patients, and improve the quality of postoperative recovery of patients. Previous studies have shown that virtual",
            "Absolutely. Another option could be to measure the adherence to the virtual reality intervention. This can provide insights into the patient's acceptance and compliance with the intervention, which is crucial for its effectiveness. To measure adherence, you can ask patients to provide a rating of their enjoyment and satisfaction with the virtual reality intervention on a 5-point scale. The time frame for this measure would also be 1 day after the surgery.",
            "No problem! One more point I want to mention is the importance of ensuring participant comfort and engagement with the virtual reality headset. You can address this by considering the size, weight, and adjustability of the headset. You may want to allow participants to customize the headset to fit comfortably and securely, and provide instructions on how to use it correctly. This can enhance the patient's experience and prevent discomfort during the procedure. Is there anything else we should keep in mind in terms of feasibility and challenges?"

It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb) and is transmitted via respiratory droplets. The diagnosis of latent TB is based on the tuberculin skin test (TST) and serological tests. Both tests are non-specific and have been replaced by the interferon-\u03b3 release assay (IGRA). The most commonly used IGRA are the T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec Ltd) and the QuantiFERON\u00ae-test Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT, Cellestis Ltd), both of which measure the Mtb specific interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) produced by activated T-lymphocytes upon exposure to Mtb antigens. Recently, a new test called QuantiFERON\u00ae access has been developed, which is more user friendly, affordable, easily stored and shipped. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of the QFT Access in detection of active pulmonary tuberculosis (sputum cultures positive) compared to QFT Plus and sputum culture (gold-standard). The other aim of the study is to investigate the sensitivity of the QFT Access test with HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected individuals. This study is a single-center, observational study. The study will include 368 patients between 18 to 60 years of age with suspected TB.

Do you have any preferred cut-off values for these measures? \n\nArticle Type: Original Article\n\nBackground: With recent advances, the majority (about 70%) of patients with heart failure (HF) are now treated with implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-Ds). While the primary objective of CRT-D is to reduce symptoms of HF, its secondary effect is to improve life expectancy and quality of life. Many studies have shown that life expectancy is directly related to the use of ICDs/CRT-Ds, but few studies have investigated the impact of the use of ICDs/CRT-Ds on the quality of life of patients with HF. Quality of life (QoL) is an important prognostic factor in patients with HF, and as the number of patients with HF increases, it is important to determine the current status of patients\u2019 QoL to better determine the indications for CRT-D. Recently, the QoL of patients with HF has improved with the introduction of new medical devices and drugs, but due to various limitations such as social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased psychological burden of patients undergoing CRT-D implantation, the QoL of patients with HF is still lower than that of the general population. Therefore, it is essential to identify the current status of QoL in patients with HF and its relationship with the use of ICDs or CRT-Ds, and to identify factors that contribute to the improvement or deterioration of QoL. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the patient\u2019s QoL, measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ), before and after ICD/CRT-D implantation in a patient with HF. Methods: A total of 87 patients with HF who were treated with ICD or CRT-D at Kwangju Christian Hospital between 2020 and 2022 were enrolled in this study. The MLHFQ data were compared and analyzed before and after the first ICD/CRT-D implantation. In addition, the relationships between the data were investigated",

Now, let's move on to the sample size calculation. \n\nAbstract:\nAIMS: To investigate early rehabilitation of patients with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and its impact on neurological recovery and the length of hospital stay.METHODS: This was a double\u2010blind, single center, randomized controlled trial. In this study, we enrolled 40 patients with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 3\u20108, between 14 to 60 years of age, without other organ injuries, and were randomized into intervention and control groups. Both groups were given standard medical treatment, and the intervention group was given early rehabilitation treatment. The main outcomes were the recovery of neurological function and length of hospital stay.RESULTS: The intervention group had faster recovery and a shorter hospital stay than the control group (Z=\u20103.240, P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis showed moderate early rehabilitation treatment could improve functional recovery and reduce the length of stay (R2=0.300, P < 0.01). Patients with mild early rehabilitation treatment had the best neurological function in the 3\u2010month follow\u2010up.CONCLUSIONS: Early rehabilitation treatment has a critical effect on improving the neurologic outcome and shortening the length of stay of patients with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.",

The time frame for this measure should be from the date of surgery until the date of discharge, or up to a maximum of 21 days if the patient is discharged earlier. What do you think about this measure? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Routine perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) has been the standard of practice for surgical infections since the 1940s but its effectiveness continues to be questioned. Ampicillin has previouslybeen found to be the most widely used antibiotic in AMP. The use of Ampicillin in AMP can lead to antibiotic\u2010induced antibiotic resistance and has been linked with increased surgical site infection (SSI) rates. We propose that the use of a selective antibiotic in AMP would be safe and allow for future studies aimed at demonstrating greater efficacy with reduced risks of resistance. Methods: Prospective, randomized, double\u2010blinded, controlled trial in American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) class 1\u20103 adults undergoing elective orthopedic, vascular, or general surgery. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to either AMP with cephalexin (2 g) or AMP with ampicillin, 1 g every 8 hours (n=150 each). Adverse events, antibiotic resistance, length of hospital stay, and SSI rates will be assessed. Subanalysis of SSIs will be compared by site of infection and age. Adherence to AMP will be determined via pharmacy reports. Discussion: The study will test whether cephalexin\u2010based prophylaxis is non\u2010inferior to Ampicillin. If it is, this would allow for future randomized controlled trials to compare cephalexin to other prophylactic regimens.

However, there is a paucity of data for response outcomes and disease control rates (DCR) with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in the metastatic setting, especially following cisplatin\u2010refractory disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy for treatment\u2010refractory locally advanced and metastatic HNSCC. Eligible patients were included in a retrospective cohort study (clinicopathological data, response outcomes, and overall survival) or a real\u2010world prospective study (DCR). Efficacy outcomes were defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Response rates per RECIST (CR+PR+SD) for the retrospective cohort (n = 26) and the real\u2010world prospective study (n = 63) were 31% and 20%, respectively. The DCR (CR+PR+SD+stable disease [SD]\u2a7e 3 months) for the retrospective cohort (95% confidence interval, 14.4\u201059.3 months) were superior to that of the real\u2010world prospective study (81.0%).

Grade 3 and 4 adverse events in the prospective study included anemia (n = 1), lymphangitis (n = 1), and gamma\u2010glutamyl transpeptidase increased (n = 1). Nivolumab 1 mg/kg monotherapy showed a tolerable safety profile.

Measuring the total glycemic variability, calculated using the standard deviation of the mean daily glycaemia levels, could be a way to provide an overall assessment of glycemic fluctuations during the course of the trial. We could also measure the severity of daily and overall hypoglycemic episodes, defined as glycaemia levels below 4 mmol/L.

Does that align with your objectives? \n\nStudy type\n=================\nObservational, prospective\n\nIntervention\n=================\nDIAPI is a diabetes management algorithm for endoscopy procedures. Endoscopy nurses use a Diabetes Tool (D-Tool) created by DIAPI to perform diabetes management during the endoscopy procedure for people with diabetes. D-tool provides an orderly algorithm for diabetes management to prevent hypoglycemia and other glycemic complications during the procedure. The algorithm incorporates pre-procedure carbohydrate ingestion, intra-procedure insulin and glucose infusion, post-procedure glucose monitoring and management, and insulin administration at discharge. Nurses follow the algorithm and manage patients' diabetes accordingly.",

Endoscopy procedures can be particularly challenging for patients with diabetes due to the associated surgical stress and changes in insulin sensitivity. To address this challenge, the investigators have developed a decision support algorithm specifically designed for patients with diabetes undergoing endoscopy procedures. The algorithm, called DIAPI (Diabetes Algorithm for Peri-intervention glycemic management), guides healthcare workers in the management of glycaemic levels before, during, and after endoscopy procedures. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of DIAPI in improving the management of glycaemia levels during endoscopy procedures, and to identify the best way to integrate the algorithm into clinical practice. The study will include a clinical trial of 100 participants with type I or type II diabetes undergoing endoscopy procedures.",

This is especially relevant in patients scheduled for liver resections with risk factors, such as pre\u2010existing co\u2010morbidities like obesity and diabetes mellitus. In this retrospective study, we report on the immediate impact of pre\u2010operative FFC in patients without diabetes and patients with uncontrolled DM on PF variability in a cohort of cancer patients undergoing liver resection. Methods: Data of patients that underwent liver resection with a scheduled pre\u2010op FFC are reviewed. In the control group (C), PF variability was not reduced; in the intervention group (I), PF variability was reduced during the FFC by at least 25%. Peri\u2010operative glucose management and outcomes were compared between the groups to determine the impact of PF reduction on peri\u2010operative glycemic control and patient safety. Results: Among 338 patients scheduled for FFC, 165 (49%) were randomized into a C group and 173 (51%) into an I group. The two groups were comparable in regard to major peri\u2010operative outcomes. Glucose levels during the surgery were significantly lower in the I group without an increased rate of hypoglycemia compared to the C group. Conclusions: Peri\u2010operative pre\u2010habilitation with a pre\u2010operative FFC significantly improved peri\u2010operative glycemic control and immediate post\u2010resection PF variability in patients with or without pre\u2010"

Sixty patients were enrolled in a prospective, 3\u2010month double\u2010blind study. Forty patients received rHuEPO (4000 U/m(2) at weeks 0, 1 and 2 and 2600 U/m(2) from week 3 to week 23) and the remaining 20 patients were treated with saline. We found that rHuEPO treatment induced a significant increase in hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), reticulocytes (Ret), total iron\u2010binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TSAT), iron in transferrin (FIT), transferrin receptors (TR), and erythropoietin (EPO) concentration levels during the 3\u2010month study. The serum ferritin (SFP) concentration of patients in the rHuEPO group was also increased significantly to 521.3 +/\u2010 153.4 (mean +/\u2010 SD) ng/mL in comparison to a slight decrease of 586 +/\u2010 64.4 ng/mL in patients treated with saline. Treatment with rHuEPO restored iron to a normal level during the 3\u2010month study. The SFP concentration correlated significantly with the Ht (r = 0.765, p less than 0.01) and the Ret (r = 0.792, p less than 0.01).

Robotic assisted esophageal myotomy provides further advantages compared to laparoscopic technique.AIMS: This prospective randomized clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of robotic\u2010assisted esophageal myotomy (RAEM) versus laparoscopic esophageal myotomy (LEM).METHOD: Thirty patients were randomized into two groups. Patients allocated to the first group were treated with RAEM, which was performed using the da Vinci surgical robot system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). Patients allocated to the second group were treated with LEM. The treatment success was evaluated in both groups via a questionnaire, and the degree of dysphagia and satisfaction with the operation were recorded.RESULTS: Both RAEM and LEM can be performed successfully. There was no significant difference in baseline clinical characteristics of the patients in both groups. The operation performance duration was shorter in RAEM compared to LEM (93.87\u00b111.52 vs. 167.32\u00b116.11 minutes, respectively, p<0.001).

For PNE, a set of educational sessions were provided and included:\nPatient Education\n1. The pain mechanism: how to avoid causing harm to the body and to stop the pain.\n2. Pain is not a threat to health, and its presence does not indicate any harm or disease.\n3. Pain can be understood as a protective defense reaction that helps the body alert to a possible threat.\n4. The brain and nervous system are the main causes of pain, and nerves are not necessarily harmed.\n5. Pain is not a permanent condition, and most patients will overcome the pain through lifestyle changes and regular movement exercises.\nEducation: The first half of the training will introduce the basic principles of the pain mechanism for patients, and the second half will introduce self-care behavioral interventions through exercise and guidance. Behaviors to be promoted. \n1) Self-care behavior: 1) To increase physical activity to relieve pain.\n2) Behaviors related to sleep: 1) Pay attention to your sleep quality, improve your sleep quality, and ensure that you have at least eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.\n3) Adequate water intake: ensure that you drink enough water to prevent dehydration.

The patients in the pain neuroscience education group participated in the 2 \u202fh pain neuroscience education course on the day after operation and received pain management guidelines. The control group did not receive training. Both groups were asked to complete the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Functional scale immediately before operation and six\u2010month follow\u2010up.RESULTS: Patients in the pain neuroscience education group showed a significant improvement in the WOMAC and VAS scores compared to the control group, but there was no significant improvement in the Functional scale.CONCLUSION: Pain neuroscience education has a beneficial effect on the improvement of patient's pain and quality of life after the total knee arthroplasty surgery.",

Assessing the knee joint function rehabilitation 3 months after discharge will provide insights into the sustained impact of the intervention on functional outcomes. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of exercise and mind training on mental fatigue, cognitive function, and fatigue\u2010related sleep problems. Methods and Methods: A total of 30 subjects were randomly allocated into an exercise\u2010induced therapy group (exercise), a hypnotherapy group (hypnosis), an exercise and mind (exercise and mind) group, and a no\u2010therapy group. Subjects were tested with the questionnaires for mental fatigue (S\u2010MFI), cognitive functioning (Stroop test, cognitive function questionnaire, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and fatigue\u2010related sleep problems (Athens Insomnia Scale). Subjects in the exercise and mind group began the cognitive therapy while simultaneously practicing physical exercises and participating in educational meetings to learn how to use a relaxation technique. They also performed mind training exercises for 6 weeks, and subjects in the exercise group performed physical exercises only. Results: There was no significant difference in any of the variables after treatment between subjects in the hypnotherapy and exercise and mind groups. A significant decrease in the S\u2010MFI score was only observed in the exercise and mind group after a 6\u2010week treatment. Sleep efficiency, sleep latency, total time awake, total recording time, and fatigue\u2010related sleep problems were improved after treatment in the exercise and mind group (P\u2010value<0.05). After treatment, memory (r = 0.515, P\u2010value = 0.030) and visuospatial ability (r = 0.416, P\u2010value = 0.038) decreased significantly in the hypnotherapy group, while attention (r = 0.535, P\u2010value = 0.019) decreased only in the exercise and mind group. There was no significant difference in motor function after treatment between groups. Conclusion: Exercise and mind therapy, as well as hypnotherapy as standalone treatment, may be more effective in reducing mental fatigue and fatigue\u2010related sleep problems than hypnotic suggestion alone.",

The primary outcome was a change from baseline in score on the Clinical Dystonia Rating Score (CDRS) for both limbs at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months compared to BMT after cessation of medication. Secondary outcome measures included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III, Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI\u2010II), and 36\u2010Item Short Form Health Survey v2 (SF\u201036v2) scores.RESULTS:: There was no significant difference in the mean CDRS for arms A and B at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months during the withdrawal period. All patients who had surgery reported improved symptoms and an improvement in mood. However, patients in the STN\u2010DBS group experienced a number of per\u2010operative complications, including post\u2010operative hemorrhage, intracranial infection, and lead displacement. Mean time to return to previous activities was 5.9 months.CONCLUSION:: Despite some limitations, this study suggests that STN\u2010DBS improves symptoms of dystonia over time. Patients in the study experienced an improvement in mood and a reduction in quality of life scores following surgery. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov NCT00614024.",

Patients were randomly assigned to an early RRT group (RRT group, n = 55; patients underwent RRT <48\u00a0h after CPB) or a late RRT group (control group, n = 1,131). Variables predicting AKI (RIFLE criteria) were identified using Cox proportional hazard models.RESULTS: AKI occurred in 1,140 patients (96.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 94.6\u201097.1%), and 2.9% of patients (33/1,186) required RRT. Multivariate analysis of both groups revealed 2 independent risk factors for RRT: renal dysfunction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.383, 95% CI 1.080\u20101.785) and CPB time (HR 1.001, 95% CI 1.001\u20101.003). No independent risk factors for RRT were identified in the early RRT group. The late RRT group had significantly better outcomes (length of ICU/hospital stay, days of RRT, and mortality).CONCLUSION: Renal dysfunction and prolonged CPB duration are risk factors for AKI after cardiac surgery with CPB. The timing of RRT needs to be decided when analyzing the efficacy of RRT in patients with AKI.",

This analysis was performed to quantify physical activity levels in hospital and community\u2010based populations of advanced stage cancer patients.METHODS: Using 7\u2010day recalls, physical activity in patients with incurable advanced cancer enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials within the Aerobic\u20105 (N=2168) and Aerobic\u20103 (N=1703) trials was compared to physical activity in hospital and community\u2010based cancer populations reported in other studies utilizing the same exercise questionnaire. This analysis focused on walking, moderate, and vigorous physical activity. Differences in physical activity levels were calculated by sex and functional status.RESULTS: Both Aerobic\u20105 and Aerobic\u20103 trial participants were less physically active than community dwelling advanced cancer patients, hospitalized patients with advanced cancer, and hospitalized or community living heart failure patients. However, only patients who underwent surgery were less physically active compared to patients recruited from a hospital or heart failure population.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with advanced cancer participating in clinical trials are a particularly sedentary population who are less physically active than community dwelling populations with incurable advanced cancer, hospitalized patients with advanced cancer, and patients with co\u2010morbid heart failure. The clinical trial and hospital\u2010based populations were more similar in terms of physical activity than either with communitydwelling cancer or heart failure patients, possibly due to the surgery requirement in the community cancer population.",

The SUPPLEMENT study is a two\u2010arm, open\u2010labelled randomized controlled trial. Patients with oligo metastatic prostate cancer were randomized to either androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) only, or ADT plus the selective androgen receptor modulator EPI\u2010543. Patients were followed for safety and efficacy assessments including the serum prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA) level. The present analysis of the 4\u2010year outcomes of this study aims to determine the predictive biomarkers for treatment responses of ADT alone or in combination with EPI\u2010543. Results: One hundred and nineteen patients were randomized in the SUPPLEMENT study, receiving either ADT alone (n=58) or in combination with EPI\u2010543 (n=60) starting from 3.6 years (\u00b1 0.2 years).

Monitoring changes in PCEC scores will provide insights into the impact of the treatment on cognitive function. What do you think? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study will be conducted at the Clinical Neuroscience Center (Frenchay Hospital), and the BRI and LISA unit (Bristol Beacon Research Centre, RUH), as well as Southmead Hospital. The work will be done on the sites of the Brain Tumour Research Unit of Bristol University (Bristol University and Bristol National Health Service (NHS), UK). Subjects who are patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) in standard clinical practice and who have been informed of the study will be eligible to participate. The aim of the study is to use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to investigate how radiation affects the brain structure and function during and after radiotherapy. Each MRI will last one to one and a half hours (approximately), consisting of several short sequences lasting only a few minutes each. These sequences will provide information on different aspects of the structure and functions of the brain that may be affected by radiation. Subjects are also invited to participate in behavioural (pencil and paper) tests of cognitive and emotional functions before radiotherapy and then again six months after radiotherapy. These behavioural tests take approximately one hour. If the primary tumour is visible in the MRI scan, the study may include repeated MRI-guided biopsies of the tumour before and 6 months after RT. These are outpatient procedures lasting about 2 hours that involve a small anaesthetic and a short MRI scan before and after the procedure in the same session. At the beginning of the study, a medical history assessment will be made and the patient's eligibility for the study will be verified. Patients will normally receive two MRIs one at the start of RT and one after RT, and may also have a repeat MRI at a later date and will undergo any number of MR-guided biopsies and repeat behavioural testing after RT.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground Previous studies in animals (mice, rats) have provided strong evidence that radiotherapy significantly and negatively modifies the functioning of neur",

The trial is investigating the impact of proton GRID radiotherapy in treating unresectable solid tumors and metastatic cancer. Method: A structured, multi\u2010step process was used to identify and prioritize outcomes for outcome measures after identifying the research questions and hypotheses. A literature review and interviews with subject matter experts were conducted to gather initial feedback. The identified outcomes were then organized into outcome domains and evaluated through a panel of multidisciplinary experts using Delphi voting. Results: Twenty potential outcomes were initially identified. Seven of these outcomes were chosen as the final primary and secondary outcome measures for the trial. Five additional outcomes were included as exploratory outcomes to further enhance the study. Conclusion: A structured, Delphi\u2010based group consensus process was effective in identifying and prioritizing outcome measures for a trial assessing the efficacy of proton GRID radiotherapy."

Lifestyle therapy is one of the basic measures in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. The objective of this work was to determine the optimal combination of cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction in persons with cardiovascular risk factors. This work was a continuation of the work of F. M. Stern and I. I. Lazareva. Material and methods. A retrospective analysis was performed of medical records of 692 patients with cardiovascular risk factors with ischemic syndromes (myocardial infarction, angina pain). An integrated index of the frequency of cardiovascular risk factors was introduced in order to assess the risk of myocardial infarction of the entire patient group and compare the results obtained with those previously obtained. The index of frequency was proposed by A. E. Skorlupinskii: I = (P1P2... Pn) + (M1M2... Mn) + (X1X2... Xn), where P \u2013 the frequency of hypertonic factor, M \u2013 the frequency of hyperlipemic factor, X \u2013 other risk factors. As a result of modeling, it was found that for patients with cardiovascular risk factors, in order to assess the risk of myocardial infarction, a minimum number of 8 parameters should be known, for the reliability of prediction, the error should not exceed 0.2 to 0.3, which is a fairly large error. Results. Among the factors that make it possible to predict atherosclerosis, the following are the highest: systolic blood pressure and its dynamics in the early morning, the level of total and low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, the frequency of diastolic arterial hypertension attacks, the presence of glucose tolerance abnormal",

Patients were randomised to receive clopidogrel and no placebo or clopidogrel and placebo containing charcoal with bentonite. The primary endpoint was any ischaemic event, which included death, myocardial infarction and hospitalisation for unstable angina. Ischaemic events were reported in four of 87 (4.5%) patients in the Placebo group and in 10 of 87 (11.5%) patients in the non\u2010decontamination group; there was a statistically significant reduction in the odds of an event in the placebo group compared with the control group (Odds Ratio 0.28, CI 0.09 to 0.83, p = 0.021).

Twenty\u2010one patients with chronic bronchitis were treated with either 300 mg/day of NAC or a placebo (14 patients in each group). PFTs, including forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and MCC were determined prior to treatment and 5\u00a0days, 10\u00a0days, and 15\u00a0days following the administration of the study medication. Both FVC and FEV1 increased over the duration of the study in both treatment groups, but the magnitude of the changes was not significantly different between the placebo and NAC\u2010treated groups. MCC values increased in both groups, suggesting that patients with chronic bronchitis may be able to self\u2010regulate MCC in the absence of NAC treatment.

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial is planned, to assess the efficacy and safety of azithromycin for reducing pregnancy loss rates in a high risk population. Three hundred two thousand one hunded women with a history of pregnancy loss will be treated after positive pregnancy test. Study design: Three hundred twenty women will be treated with azithromycin and three hundred twenty women will be treated with placebo.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nTo investigate whether treatment of women at high risk for pregnancy loss with azithromycin, in addition to optimal care, as compared to optimal treatment alone improves the pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy outcome and pregnancy loss rate will be compared between the azithromycin and the placebo groups, in the subgroups predefined in the inclusion criteria, and the differences in pregnancy outcomes between the aforesaid groups of women will be assessed by means of a multivariate statistical model. After including the subjects in the trial, they will be randomly (50:50) allocated to azithromycin and placebo. The patients will be in the study until the start of labor or until delivery when no labor has occurred. If an early pregnancy loss (by transvaginal ultrasound) or if a miscarriage occurs later, the patients will be excluded from the trial. In case of pregnancy loss, the following must be determined: a) whether the pregnancy lasted more than nine weeks and, b) the cause of pregnancy loss. Women included into study group A will be followed up for seven consecutive pregnancies with a maximum duration of five years. It is estimated that the follow-up period of the study, including analysis of the results, will be completed during May 2013.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Double-blind, Randomized",

It is usually associated with significant morbidity and leads to an increase in healthcare resource utilisation (Burstein 1998), such as delayed discharge from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), prolonged hospital stay, and additional financial burden (Burstein 1998, Hale 2000, Schoene et al., 2004). Ultrashort-acting propofol and remifentanil anesthesia has been widely used for gynecological surgery due to rapid recovery of clear-mindedness and decreased postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, PONV is still common in patients receiving this anesthesia regimen. Several studies have evaluated different antiemetic strategies during anesthesia to reduce PONV (Lv et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 20",

While HSCT is an effective treatment, many patients continue to experience severe and treatment-related fatigue for months or years following transplantation. The prevalence of fatigue after HSCT ranges from 35% to 100%, and it has been associated with decreased quality of life (QOL), depression, anxiety, and impaired functional capacity. \nFatigue is characterized by extreme tiredness and a decrease in energy levels, resulting in physical, cognitive, and emotional exhaustion. Persistent fatigue is considered a complex and often debilitating symptom, which significantly impacts patients' ability to participate in daily activities, perform work or school tasks, and engage in social relationships. The psychological and emotional consequences of persistent fatigue can also lead to feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, and depression, which further interferes with patients' QOL. \nCurrently, there are no specific interventions available to treat post-HSCT fatigue, and the management of this symptom is mainly focused on symptom mitigation using behavioral strategies, such as pacing and exercise, and pharmacologic agents, such as modafinil or methylphenidate. While some studies have suggested that these interventions may have some benefit in managing post-HSCT fatigue, the evidence is limited, and the efficacy of these interventions has not been established. \nCognitive Behavioral Ther",

On the other hand, the patients' rehabilitation period after surgery for lung cancer is not enough, and most patients cannot get rehabilitation after surgery. We hypothesized that this program will help patients improve quality of life, physical function, and cancer-related symptoms in the early rehabilitation period after surgery. Therefore, the experimental group (rehabilitation group) will be patients who underwent rehabilitation programs recommended by the nursing home, and the control group (usual group) will be the usual medical treatment of lung cancer patients.\nNumber of Arms:: 2\nTarget Number of Participant:: 17\nArm Type:: No Intervention\nArm Description:: Patients who underwent resection of lung cancer and not participated in the rehabilitation program did not undergo interventional treatment\nArm Label:: Control Group\nArm Type:: Experimental\nArm Description:: Patients who underwent surgery for",
            "The Rate of Intervention Completion measures the effectiveness of the intervention by assessing how many participants complete all 4 sessions of the CBT for fatigue intervention. If 80% or more complete all sessions, this indicates that the intervention was administered as intended and had the desired impact on participants. If the completion rate is lower, it may indicate that the intervention needs to be modified or refined to enhance adherence and effectiveness. This measure provides valuable information for improving the delivery of the intervention and ensuring that it is appropriate for the target population. [END]",
            "Yes, we suggest focusing on the following secondary outcome measures: Fatigue Severity, Physical Activity Level, Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Biomarkers. These measures will help assess the effectiveness of the intervention on fatigue-related outcomes. \n\nFatigue Severity will be measured using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), which assesses fatigue severity across seven domains: general, physical, mental, reduced motivation, reduced activity, reduced achievement of goals and reduced well-being. The questionnaire ranges from 8 to 40, with higher scores representing higher fatigue severity. The time frame for this measure is the 5-month follow-up.\n\nPhysical Activity Level will be measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ), which measures the amount, frequency and intensity of physical activity in the last 7 days. There are three levels of physical activity: low, moderate and vigorous. The time frame for this measure is the 5-month follow-up.\n\nQuality of Life will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) questionnaire, which assesses the overall quality of life for individuals with cancer. The questionnaire ranges from 0 to 108, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The time frame for this measure is the 5-month follow-up. \n\nPsychological Distress will be measured using the Distress Thermometer. This measures the level of distress on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 indicates no distress and 10 indicates the worst distress imaginable. The time frame for this measure is the 5-month follow-up.\n\nBiomarkers will be measured using blood samples, which will be taken at baseline and the 5-month follow-up. The biomarkers to measure are cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory factors, which will be analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and other laboratory techniques. We expect to see a reduction in inflammatory markers in the intervention group compared to the control group. \n\nWe hope these suggestions for secondary outcome measures will help you assess the effectiveness of the intervention on fatigue-related outcomes in more detail.",
            "Of course! Let's start with the Improvement of Fatigue. We will evaluate this using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), a self-reported questionnaire. It assesses the overall severity of fatigue and its impact on daily functioning. The FSS score ranges from 9 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe fatigue. We will measure this outcome at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. \n\nSecondly, the Improvement of Quality of Life will be measured using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQoL-SF). It is a validated self-reported questionnaire that assesses the impact of kidney disease on various aspects of life, including physical and social well-being. It ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. This measure will be assessed at baseline and at the 3-month follow-up. \n\nLastly, the Improvement of Mood will be evaluated using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), a self-reported questionnaire that assesses the frequency and intensity of depressive, anxious, and stressful symptoms. It ranges from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater psychological distress. This measure will also be measured at both assessment points.",
            "Sure, the Improvement of Quality of Life measures the impact of the intervention on participants' overall quality of life. It will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale. The score range for FACIT-F is 0-52, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The time frame for this measure is from baseline (pre-randomization) up to the 3-month follow-up. \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of adding a new dose of rituximab (RTX) in patients with rituximab\u2010naive relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in the context of a real life routine clinical practice. METHODS: An open\u2010label real life study was designed in patients with RRMS treated with IFN\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2) for the last six months. Patients were followed up for five years (60 months. 504 patients received 3 doses of RTX. After an IFN\u03b2 wash out period (6 months), patient that relapse (\u22651 T2 lesions increase at any occasion), were reconsidered for the addition of a new dose RTX 1g. Safety and efficacy measurements were registered and compared against a control group composed of patients without clinical relapses but still in IFN beta treatment. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients (45,9%) suffered at least 1 clinical relapse. 66,6% of them received the new RTX dose. 33,1% of the patients who received RTX showed new/enlarged lesions after the new RTX administration, whereas in the control group the rate was 52,5% (OR = 2,3, p<0,001). The MRI showed that the annualized relapses rate was reduced from 0,70 to 0,45 in patients who received RTX (p=0,028). Patients who received RTX had a less risk to be diagnosed with secondary progression (SP) (13,4%vs. 18,4%; OR = 0,70; p=0,001), during the 5\u2010year follow up. During the",

Fatigue is one of the most common problems experienced by cancer patients. Fatigue is very debilitating, and often leads to a decline in the quality of life (QoL) among cancer survivors who experience fatigue. Therefore, the alleviation of fatigue needs to be addressed through an evidence-based and effective management approach. Exercise is often recommended for the management of cancer-related fatigue. However, most of the research on the effects of exercise on cancer-related fatigue is not conclusive due to the varied exercises evaluated and the paucity of studies with a control group. In addition, there is heterogeneity in the outcome measures used. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that a combination of resistance (strength) and endurance-based exercises may alleviate fatigue among cancer survivors and that a tailored lifestyle intervention programme based on behaviour change principles and personalized exercise prescription will address the heterogeneity of physical exercise and will be effective for the alleviation of cancer-related fatigue.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Tailored Lifestyle Intervention Programme Based in Secondary Care for the Prevention and Management of Cancer-related Fatigue in Patients With Cancer Undergoing Secondary Care\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCancer-related Fatigue, Fatigue\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Behavioral: Lifestyle Intervention\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: 18 years old or older Diagnosed with cancer for more than 3 months Recieved secondary care for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) Exclusion Criteria: Patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation therapy as part of the active cancer treatment Unable to read and understand the Malay language as assessed by a language test",

Secondary Objective: To compare the differences in the effects of upper extremity intensive rehabilitation vs. non-intensive rehabilitation.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nStroke is a serious health condition that leads to a range of disabilities, including weakness and mobility problems, which can significantly affect a person's ability to perform daily activities. It also affects the ability to communicate effectively and contributes to social isolation. Many stroke survivors experience muscle weakness in the upper and lower extremities, along with poor mobility, which can affect their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) such as dressing and bathing, and participate in social activities. Strength training and active range of motion (AROM) exercises can help improve muscle strength, muscle tone, and motor control. Rehabilitation interventions that incorporate these techniques can lead to significant improvements in recovery and functional ability. Intensive rehabilitation therapy for people with mild to moderate hemiparesis has recently gained popularity and involves daily therapy sessions with short breaks. Several studies have shown that intensive rehabilitation is effective, especially for motor function and mobility. However, there is limited research investigating the impact of intensive rehabilitation on upper extremity function, functional mobility, and social participation in people with post-stroke hemiparesis. To address these gaps, the investigators will compare the effects of three different rehabilitation protocols on upper body strength, mobility, and social participation in people with post-stroke hemiparesis. These three protocols include task-oriented therapy (TOT), intensive rehabilitation therapy (IRT), and conventional rehabilitation therapy (CRT).\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nImpact of Intensive Rehabilitation on Upper Body Strength, Functional Mobility, and Social Participation in People With Post-stroke Hemiparesis\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nPost-stroke Hemiparesis\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Task-oriented therapy\n* Other: Intensive rehabilitation therapy\n* Other: Con",

The aim of the study was to determine the role of SMS or phone calls in reducing non\u2010adherence. A randomized, prospective clinical study was carried out in 400 patients with uncontrolled hypertension (220 males and 180 females), aged 18\u201075 years, with a history of non\u2010adherence to treatment. The patients were divided into the following 4 groups: Control group, to which they were allocated a conventional follow\u2010up. SMS group, in which patients received, from admission and once a week, weekly messages to remind them to take the drug. \"Call Group 1\" received weekly fixed calls in which the patients were reminded to take the drug. \"Call Group 2\" included patients, in which the patients were reminded once to take the drug, depending on the moment of taking the medication, which was also discussed to optimize the time of ingestion. The primary outcome to assess the efficacy of SMS or calls was non\u2010compliance to treatment and blood pressure. There was an improvement in compliance to treatment in the \"Call Group \u2010 2\" (p < 0.001). However, it did not reach statistical significance in any other group, even though it showed similar trends. There was a significant reduction in mean systolic blood pressure in the intervention groups, compared to the Control Group (p < 0.05). It is concluded that phone calls reduced systolic blood pressure but there was no significant difference with SMS. Phone calls do not require a particular computer or software knowledge. Therefore, we recommend their use in the setting of routine follow\u2010up in general practice for treating hypertensive patients who have non\u2010adherence to treatment.\n\nIntroduction\nNon-adherence is defined as the act of not taking medication as prescribed, whether that involves skipping doses, not taking the medicine at all, or not taking it as prescribed (dose, frequency, time). It is the most important challenge in hypertensive management . A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies showed that up to 50% of patients do not adhere to treatment in the treatment period of 95%"

It is estimated to affect 40% of adults in Mexico. NAFLD includes a spectrum of benign liver diseases ranging from simple and noninvasive hepatic steatosis to severe and invasive cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is currently the most common cause of chronic liver disease and leads to greater health care expenses in the US. NAFLD has been linked to T2D, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome. These patients have been demonstrated to have increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, which is directly related to the grade of steatohepatitis and not to the presence of hepatic steatosis alone. NAFLD accounts for at least 20% of liver transplantations in the US. NAFLD has also been linked to an increased incidence of noninvasive hepatocellular carcinoma and it is estimated that 10% of NAFLD patients will develop hepatocellular carcinoma. It is therefore important to identify new therapeutic agents for NAFLD, who can improve liver\u2010related pathology, and ultimately reduce the mortality of patients who develop hepatic steatosis or cirrhosis.",

In this study, we explored the safety and efficiency of 0.2mmoL/kg gadobutrol (Gadovist\u00ae, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Germany) in diabetic patients undergoing CMR.METHODS: A prospective study was performed in 42 diabetic patients (39 with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 3 with type 1 diabetes mellitus). All patients received gadobutrol at a dose of 0.2mmoL/kg body weight. The primary study outcome was a comparison of CMR\u2010derived left ventricle (LV) volumes and function between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The 2015 diagnostic performance criteria for acute myocardial infarction were used as a benchmark.RESULTS: We found no difference in the CMR outcomes between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The sensitivity of LV volume quantification to detect reduced ejection fraction was 88.9% in diabetic patients. Limitations of 71.4% and 88.9% were found for the detection of LV hypokinesia and an area with a Gadolinium signal intensity ratio more than 2, respectively.

It has a complex pharmacokinetic profile, and changes in the absorption or metabolism of the drug can lead to changes in its effectiveness. Bioequivalence studies of Lamotrigine are crucial in ensuring that the drug is consistently effective across different formulations and manufacturers. In particular, the bioequivalence of Lamotrigine 100 mg tablets is of interest, as many patients with epilepsy take this dose. Adequate bioequivalence studies have been conducted for Lamotrigine 100 mg tablets under fasting conditions, but there is currently a lack of data on the bioequivalence of the drug under fed conditions. This bioequivalence study aims to evaluate the bioequivalence of Lamotrigine 100 mg tablets under fasting conditions. Methods: In this randomized, single-dose, two-way crossover, open-label, bioequivalence study, 24 healthy subjects aged 18-45 years will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single 100 mg dose of Lamotrigine in a fed (250 milliliters of water after a standard breakfast) or fasted state (250 milliliters of water after an overnight fast of at least eight hours). Blood samples will be collected at predefined time points for analysis of Lamotrigine concentration in plasma using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. The primary outcome measures will be the area under the curve (AUC) and the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of the drug. The bioequivalence of the two formulations will be determined by comparing thetest and reference geometric means and 90",
            "The duration of sample collection will depend on the pharmacokinetics profile of Lamotrigine.

            "Good, I shall do that. Moving on to the secondary outcome measures. The second measure I proposed is the change in attitudes towards HIV testing. How do you think we can measure this? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe primary objective of this study is to promote HIV testing among adults through partnership with Florida Department of Health (FDOH) and Community Health Workers (CHWs). All study interventions will be conducted in targeted communities that have high HIV prevalence. The investigators aim to increase HIV testing rates through the Five-Point Initiative (FPI) model which was developed in collaboration with community experts and FDOH leadership and consists of a series of interventions to increase HIV prevention services, including HIV testing.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe University of South Florida is partnering with Florida Department of Health and Black Pride events in Pinellas and Miami-Dade Counties, one of the largest African American Pride events nationwide. The University of South Florida will conduct a cluster randomized trail in which all of the participating Black Pride events will be randomly assigned to an intervention or usual care (UC) arm. A total of 20 events will be assessed; 10 in each county. Each event will be conducted over a three day period and attended by thousands of individuals. A CHW from the CHW agency will work with the event planner to facilitate HIV testing. CHWs are defined as frontline health workers who have at least a two-year college degree and are hired by a health department or community-based organization to serve as a link between individuals with HIV and health care resources. CHWs will be specially trained by the investigators and will work closely with community members and event organizers/planners to meet the objectives of this study. The role of CHWs will include event preparation, coordination of logistics, recruitment of participants at the events, and post-event debriefing. The HIV testing site will be open for up to 10 hours each day during the community event. In order to maximize efficiencies, the investigators will recruit participants who are willing to be tested in the morning, and provide the results to FDOH during the day so they could call individuals within 12-25 hours with results. The investigators expect that by the end of the intervention, all events in the intervention group will have increased",
            "Great. Now, let's discuss the sample size calculation. We want to ensure that the sample size is large enough to detect a significant difference in the outcome measures between the intervention and control groups. Based on the literature, we can assume an average baseline prevalence of HIV testing of approximately 35% in both groups. With a power of 0.80 and a significance level of 0.05, we will need to enroll 416 participants per group to detect a 10% absolute increase in the prevalence of HIV testing. To account for possible attrition, we can increase the sample size by 10%, bringing it to 458 participants per group. Is this sample size sufficient for our needs? \n\n\n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Purpose:: Prevention\nPhase:: Not applicable\nIntervention Model:: Parallel\nBlinding/Masking:: Open\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: Behavioral\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIntervention Description:: Five Point Initiative (FPI), a behavioral intervention designed to reduce HIV-related disparities in predominantly Black communities.

We aimed to compare the effects of epidural analgesia (EA), transversus abdominis plane block (TAP) combined with pectoral nerve block (PES), and combined epidural/TAP/ PES on pain management for patients undergoing LH operation. A total of 180 patients were enrolled in a randomized prospective study. During surgery, EA group took epidural analgesia, transversus abdominis plane group took bilateral TAP, pectoralis nerve group took bilateral PEES, and the combined group took epidural analgesia, TAP, and PEES sequentially. The visual analogue scale (VAS), analgesic doses (morphine), hemodynamic parameters at rest, during and after pneumoperitoneum, postoperative ileus, and complications were recorded. The results showed that the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative shivering, and coughing were significantly lower in the TAP group and PES. The combined group had the lowest incidence for coughing and shivering. The incidence of other complications were not significantly different among the 4 groups. There were no statistical differences in the VAS score and analgesic dosage among the four groups. The combined block did not reduce the incidence or duration of ileus compared with the epidural analgesia or TAP+PES group. The results demonstrated the combined block did not have a significantly lower incidence or duration of ileus than epidural analgesia or TAP+PES regimen. 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The BORG CR10 scale is designed to provide an objective measurement of perceived pain and intensity of pain. The modified BORG CR10 scale has several advantages compared to other scales, including its simplicity and ease of use. However, there is limited evidence supporting the reliability of the modified BORG CR10 scale in pain assessment in the general population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the modified BORG CR10 scale in pain assessment in the general population. In this study, we recruited a sample of 50 randomly selected adults from the general population and asked them to complete a questionnaire that included the modified BORG CR10 scale and several other pain assessment scales. The reliability of the modified BORG CR10 scale was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients, which showed good consistency among the participants. In the final analysis, a multivariate linear mixed effects regression model was used to evaluate the associations between the modified BORG CR10 scale and other pain assessment scales, and the results showed that the modified BORG CR10 scale was correlated with several other pain assessment scales. Furthermore, demographic characteristics such as age and gender were also found to be significantly associated with pain intensity as measured by the modified BORG CR10 scale. Our findings suggest that the modified BORG CR10 scale is a reliable tool for pain assessment in the general population. It is easy to use and can provide a simple and objective measurement of pain intensity. However, further research is needed to fully understand the utility of the modified BORG CR10 scale in pain assessment in different settings and with different populations.",

After conventional rigid bronchoscopy, cryobiopsy was performed using 3.8\u2010mm, or 4.6\u2010mm double\u2010shielded cryoprobes (Erbe or EndoCare) with nitrous oxide insufflation through a 2.7\u2010mm inner bronchoscope or through an overtube connected to a 5.5\u2010mm bronchoscope with the use of an interventional bronchoscopy guide wire. After the biopsy, a bronchial wall biopsy was performed according to the BAC classification criteria. The clinical data and pathological results were analysed.RESULTS: We performed a total 20 cryobiopsy procedures on 10 patients, with a mean age of 62 years (range, 44\u201082 years). Successful diagnosis was obtained from bronchial biopsies in all but one case (nine of 10). Biopsy was successful in all patients in whom VATS biopsy was initially performed. Two cases (20%) failed cryobiopsy because of excessive bleeding. A total of 72 cryobiopsy samples were taken in 10 cases. Three of 52 (5.8%) endobronchial cryobiopsy samples showed BAC (two well differentiated BACs [WD\u2010BACs] and one poorly differentiated BAC [PD\u2010BAC]).

The HRR was measured using the Karvonen formula: HRR = (Maximum HR - Resting HR)/2 + Resting HR. The maximum HR was calculated as (220-age). The resting HR was measured at the end of a one-minute rest, at the end of the warm up period, and after the excercise session. The intensity of each session will be determined by the subject's exertion levels reported on the Borg scale. The aerobic exercise training will be performed using treadmill or stationary bike. The subjects will be asked to rate their perceived effort on the Borg scale at the end of each excercise session.\n\nThe primary outcome will be the 3-mile walk time. The subjects will be asked to walk 3 miles as fast as they can, wearing a pedometer to calculate the final time. Secondary outcomes will include changes in physical function (i.e., muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and mobility), quality of life (i.e., physical function, emotional function, and general health), and body composition (i.e., body fat and lean body mass). The changes in these outcomes will be assessed using various assessment tools. \n\nWe plan to measure the 3-mile walk time using a portable device that measures distance and time of walking. Additionally, the subjects will be asked to rate their perceived exertion (i.e., using the Borg scale) at the end of each excercise session to ensure they are exercising at the appropriate intensity.\n\nWe hope to analyze the data using linear regression models to assess the relationship between the amount of exercise and the change in physical function, quality of life, and body composition.

Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (none of the time) to 3 (most of the time), and the final score is calculated as the sum of the scores for the 19 items. The score can range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality.

Method: Two hundred and twelve cystic fibrosis patients with pulmonary exacerbation were enrolled after written informed consent in the study. They were divided randomly into two equal groups: A group consisted of an experimental arm, where patients received nebulized hypertonic saline (3%); and the other group was a control group consisting of subjects, who received the standard solution (0.9% saline). A score of the intensity of the symptoms of the pulmonary exacerbation was the basis for assigning the subjects to each group. All patients received antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy and aerosolization of colistin and tobramycin in combination with pulmozyme or aerosolized hypertonic saline for 3 months after the initiation of a bronchoscopic procedure performed every three months. Results: The frequency of pulmonary exacerbation was found to be significantly lower for the experimental group (P<0,05), while there was no significant difference in the number of admissions to the hospital and the length of hospital stay for the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The effectiveness of bronchoscopy in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients with exacerbations may depend on the type of hypertonic solution used - with nebulization of hypertonic saline.",

The factors that predict response to ENB 25 mg twice weekly were identified through logistic regression analysis with week 16 response as the dependent variable. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the ability of the factors to predict the response at various points of time.RESULT(S): Predictive factors of response included gender, human leukocyte antigen\u2010DRB1 alleles, and 28\u2010joint Disease Activity Score. Gender predicted response and was also the strongest factor among the 25 mg twice weekly, 50 mg twice weekly, and placebo groups. Gender\u2010related drug response, and the effects of HLA\u2010DRB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms, were evaluated among the HLA\u2010DRB1 allele\u2010positive subgroup, which showed significant differences for response in women and men treated with 25 mg twice weekly.CONCLUSION(S): These findings highlight a gender\u2010related effect on drug response, a finding that has been overlooked in the development of biological therapies.

The research will also use this information to better understand the mechanism of this disease which will hopefully lead to improved approaches for diagnostic evaluation and ultimately identify therapeutic targets.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPatients who have undergone some kind of surgery or biopsy for a diffuse infiltrative glioma. Diffuse infiltrative gliomas include glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, gliosarcoma, and other gliomas. Most of these patients do not have enough tumor in their tissue samples to get the information needed from studying the tumor cells themselves. In the past, glioblastoma was generally considered to have few, if any, immune cells present. However, recent evidence suggests there are immune cells in these tumors. The immune cells infiltrate the brain and may even attack and kill the tumor cells. To learn about this, the patient's tumor tissue samples will be used to create a unique kind of model that will allow us to study all of the different kinds of cells in the brain. A variety of techniques will then be used to characterize the different parts of each tumor and to study the interaction of the different cells in the brain. These studies will also help learn if there are differences in the way the immune cells act in people with anaplastic tumors compared to those with glioblastoma. Ultimately, this research will identify the immune cells that might be useful for treatment.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nTranslational Studies of Human Glioma Tumor Microenvironment\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nGlioblastoma Multiforme, Astrocytoma, Anaplastic",

This study aimed to identify a combination of gene variants strongly associated with NAFLD to understand its pathophysiology. We included 707 patients from the general population\u2010based Shanghai cohort and 222 patients with NAFLD without cirrhosis. Ten pathway\u2010associated genes were selected, and a total of 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the targeted sequence. The optimal diagnostic model constructed by selecting these genes included seven SNPs: rs17454, rs17214866, rs10044, rs93884, rs1760724, rs4871344, and rs1426002. When using this model to predict NAFLD, the area under curve (AUC) was 0.820, sensitivity was 83.1%, specificity was 70.6%, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was 2.90, and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) was 0.177. In addition, the area under curve (AUC) in the subgroups of patients without hypertension or diabetes was greater, the sensitivity was greater, and the positive likelihood ratio was higher, indicating that the diagnostic model was more suitable for this subgroup. The SNP combination also showed significantly different genetic risk profiles for Asian patients with NAFLD. Therefore, this gene combination may serve as a novel diagnostic tool for non\u2010alcoholic fatty liver disease."

This scale assesses participants' perceived ability to complete cognitive tasks. We can measure this at the same time points as the other secondary outcome measures. What do you think about including self-efficacy for cognitive function as a secondary outcome measure? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study will explore the impact of an intervention to help increase physical activity on executive function, daily functioning and quality of life in patients with heart failure (HF). The aim of this study is to determine if improving physical activity in HF with an exercise intervention combined with remote monitoring (e-health), will influence executive function, daily functioning and quality of life. This will be accomplished by examining the impact of the intervention on cognitive function, health-related quality of life and daily functioning. If an intervention group demonstrates improvements in the primary and secondary outcomes compared to the control group, this would provide valuable information for developing future interventions aimed at improving cognitive function and daily functioning in patients with HF.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe incidence of heart failure (HF) is rising and estimated to affect 23 million adults worldwide. In addition to the physical manifestations of HF, cognitive impairment is now recognized as an important comorbidity present in approximately 30% of patients with HF. Current treatment for HF, such as exercise training, does not appear to result in improvements in cognitive function, which may be due to the complexity of the intervention and the fact that most patients remain inactive after completion of training. In this study, the investigators plan to test the feasibility and investigate the impact of increasing physical activity in patients with HF. The investigators will utilize wearable sensor devices to provide the patients with personal feedback on their daily physical activities, while allowing the investigators to objectively monitor changes in physical activity. The intervention group will receive a remote coaching module that encourages increased physical activity through personalized feedback, with the goal of identifying the best strategies for increasing physical activity in patients with HF.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nMobilizing patients with Heart Failure to engage in physical Activity to Improve Cognitive Function and Quality of Life (MOXIE - Heart)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHeart Failure\n\nIntervention / Treatment",

This will help us in identifying and addressing potential issues related to the study protocol. We can allocate 20 minutes for each in-person or telehealth visit, 10 minutes for a virtual call, and approximately 5 to 10 minutes for each data collection tool. Now, we just need to identify a primary outcome measure. How about the Change Assessment of Kinesiophobia for Heart Conditions? This measure assesses the severity of kinesiophobia in participants with heart conditions. We can measure this at baseline, after the 8-week program, and 3 months after program completion. What do you think about using this measure as a primary outcome measure? \nAbstract:\nBackground/Purpose: Physical activity has been shown to improve prognosis and quality of life in patients after a cardiac event. However, several factors may impede individuals from engaging in physical activity, including fear of movement in the setting of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aims to determine the role of digital patient education in reducing kinesiophobia after a cardiac event. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in patients diagnosed with myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation within the past 6 months. Participants will be randomly allocated to two groups: the intervention group will receive digital patient education and standard care, while the control group will only receive standard care. The primary outcome measure is the Change Assessment of Kinesiophobia for Heart Conditions. Secondary outcome measures include the ActiGraph to objectively assess physical activity, a single\u2010item five\u2010category scale for the Stages of Change model, general self\u2010efficacy, heart\u2010focused anxiety, self\u2010rated health, and patients' experiences. Results: The study aims to recruit 54 participants and expects to enroll participants by July 2023. Data analysis will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using IBM Statistics software to examine the impact of digital patient education on reducing kinesiophobia and other outcome measures. Limitations: One potential limitation is the reliance on self\u2010reported data for some outcome measures, such as physical activity and self\u2010reported health.

Design: Prospective randomised trial. Setting: A single unit general surgical department. Patients: 40 patients, diagnosed with cancer or diverticulosis, treated with laparoscopy or laparotomy. Interventions: Laparoscopy vs. laparotomy, with a new anastomotic technique using the 24 French (Fr.) urology transfixing sutures and EndoStitch\u2122. Main outcome measures: Length of surgery, postoperative stay in hospital, conversion to laparotomy, complication rate, and anastomotic leak. All these could affect outcome and quality of life. Results: The mean age (58 years) and weight (76 kg) did not differ between groups; however, mean BMI was significantly higher for both groups. Twenty of the patients had colorectal cancer, 10 had diverticular disease, and 10 underwent other reasons of resection. The mean open conversion rate of laparoscopy was 18%. In the laparoscopy subgroup, the mean time for the first assistant was 32.7\u2009\u00b1\u200916.4 minutes, compared to 15.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911 minutes in the laparotomy subgroup (P\u2009<\u2009.001).

To evaluate the efficacy of a medication, it important to determine the percentage of subjects experiencing a response to treatment (defined as at least 50% reduction in the frequency of seizures from baseline). To evaluate safety, it necessary to monitor adverse events (AEs) and other safety parameters. To evaluate durability, it necessary to monitor the duration of treatment and whether the patient is able to tolerate the medication for an extended period. This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and durability of XEN1101 in people with epilepsy.",

The review included 21 interventional studies retrieved from Medline, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases. There were 18 unique comparisons with 743 participants randomized to continuous and 423 to intermittent training. The continuous training groups included a mean of 10.6 sessions per week for a mean of 347.1 days. The intermittent training groups included a mean of 5.7 sessions per week for a mean of 175.2 days. The results of fixed and random effects model showed a small\u2010to\u2010moderate positive effect of continuous training (SMD = 0.19, CI = 0.06, 0.31; I2 = 50%; p = 0.005).

In addition, a dose\u2010response non\u2010linear regression (k = 4, p < 0.001) showed a greater positive effect of continuous training in sessions per week (p < 0.05).

            "That makes sense. And what about secondary outcome measures? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: A major factor in promoting patient engagement in treatment is a mutual understanding between the team and patient, which is defined by two concepts: therapeutic alliance and continuity of care. Previous studies on the relationship between these two concepts, in relation to health outcomes, have yielded conflicting results. This study assesses the impact of the therapeutic alliance on continuity of care and on the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing treatment with antidepressants in primary care.METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed on data taken from a randomized controlled trial (the CONNECT study), a multicenter experimental study of continuity of care and its influence on clinical outcomes in primary care. A total of 435 patients with a diagnosis of moderate to severe depression were included in the study and randomized to groups with continuity of care provided by the same primary care team and the same doctor (continuity group) or to groups with less continuity of care, but with greater therapeutic alliance with their respective primary care team (treatment\u2010as\u2010usual control group). All the patients received antidepressants. The main outcome variables were therapeutic alliance, continuity of care, and clinical outcome (measured by the Hamilton depression scale [HDRS] and the SF\u201012v2 health survey).RESULTS: Better therapeutic alliance was positively correlated with continuity of care and with better clinical outcomes, both measured through the HDRS and the SF\u201012v2. No relationship was found between continuity of care and clinical outcomes, except for the health dimension of the HDRS score.CONCLUSIONS: A high level of patient\u2010team interaction could be as important as continuity of care in the clinical improvement of depressed patients treated with antidepressants. This conclusion should be further tested as patients receive more complex and intensive treatment in depression care.\n\nIntroduction\nA major factor affecting patient engagement in treatment, as well as its effectiveness, is the relationship between the member of the health care team and the patient. This relationship is defined by the two concepts of therapeutic alliance and continuity of care. The therapeutic alliance refers to the mutual understanding and rapport between the patient and the therapist or another member of the health care team. There is extensive research on how the therapeutic alliance is a predictive",

            "Great. And can you provide the exact definition or criteria for stroke? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies have investigated the use of aspirin and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease and mortality. The evidence is limited to patients with high cardiovascular risk, and few data are available regarding PCSK9i use in the long term in patients with a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of this regimen in the long\u2010term prevention of cardiovascular events (especially stroke and cardiovascular death) in patients with a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. METHODS: The study is a prospective, matched and retrospective cohort study based on the data obtained by the National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm), which is carried out from April 1st, 2013 to December 31st, 2018 and will run until March 31st, 2019 (data collection) . Patients were included on the basis of the following inclusion criteria: patients with a recent ischemic stroke (less than 12 months) and treated with alirocumab. Patients were identified within the database of the National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm). The first stage consists of collecting the characteristics of the patient during his consultation at the hospitalization day and before the start of statin treatment. The data collected during this first stage will allow us to analyze the possible risk factors in the occurrence of cardiovascular events (especially stroke and cardiovascular death) and thus to assess the possible confounding factors. Patients who met all inclusion criteria were allocated to two matched treatment groups, one matched with primary prevention patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with aspirin and alirocumab and the other with secondary prevention patients undergoing alirocumab treatment. These matched treatment groups will undergo a 16week observational period (observation1), which will be completed by a non\u2010observational treatment phase (non\u2010observation1: 32 weeks). A second round of observations will then begin, using the same matched treatment groups that will undergo a 6",

We can define the secondary endpoint as \"Any fatal or non-fatal stroke beyond 1 year to 5 years, or ischemic stroke in the territory of both the left and right extracranial carotid arteries beyond 1 year to 5 years.\" This measure captures the long-term effectiveness of the interventions. To better understand the occurrence of strokes, we can also assess the composite of major vascular events, which may include coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and death of unknown cause. Additionally, we can assess the neurologic and functional outcome as long as the patient survives the procedure, which can include the Modified Rankin Scale and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores 3 months after the index event. Lastly, the rate of intervention success would also be a valuable secondary outcome measure.",
            "That's a great idea. This will allow us to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the interventions on stroke occurrence. We can also consider stroke-free survival at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years, capturing both stroke occurrence and stroke-free survival. \n\nAbstract:\nThe optimal therapeutic approach for extracranial vertebral artery stenosis (ESVA) with or without severe atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. This study compared the benefits of medical therapy versus drug\u2010eluting stenting (DES) with the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, and ticagrelor in patients with ESVA and left atrial diameter greater than or equal to 45 mm. Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed 2,228 consecutive patients who underwent transesophageal echocardiography and had an ESVA. A total of 336 patients were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and with ESVA on baseline echocardiography who had undergone angiography or DES. These patients were randomly assigned into two groups: medical therapy group (n=169) and stenting group (n=167). A follow\u2010up echocardiography was performed in all patients 1, 3, and 5 years after inclusion. The primary endpoint was a combination of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and all\u2010cause mortality. The secondary endpoints were stroke, transient ischemic attack, and death. Results: The primary endpoint (combined stroke, transient ischemic attack, and all\u2010cause mortality) and the secondary endpoint (stroke and mortality) were similar between the two groups. However, there were more cases of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and mortality in the medical therapy group (27 of 169 patients; 16%) compared with the stenting group (15 of 167 patients; 9%) during the 5\u2010year follow\u2010up period. In addition, the left atrial diameter and prevalence of AF were larger in the medical therapy group than in the stenting group (left atrial diameter: 48.63 mm versus 45.25 mm, p=0.030",

Methods: Seventy\u2010seven patients without preoperative TIA or stroke were randomized to receive aspirin 325 mg three times per day and clopidogrel 75 mg daily (group A) or no antiplatelet drugs (group B) for a period of 28 days after CEA surgery. An evaluation of the presence of cerebral embolism during CEA surgery was performed using HD\u2010TCD according to the modified Tromethamine test (MTT) of Jaini. Preoperative and postoperative TIA and strokes were evaluated. Results: The mean age of the patients was 77.9 +/\u2010 9.78 years. Forty\u2010three patients underwent left CEA (group A: 21; group B: 22). A total of 34 cerebrovascular events (36 TIAs and two strokes) was observed during a period of 28 days, and 22 of these were classified as intraoperative embolization (25 TIAs and three strokes). Seven patients were classified as intraoperative embolization type I, whereas 15 were classified as embolization type II. The prevalence of intraoperative embolization in the surgical and contralateral hemisphere was 66.9% in group A and 46.7% in group B. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of intraoperative embolization between the two groups (p = 0.004). The 28\u2010day incidence of TIA/stroke was 22.5 and 49.8% in groups A and B.

Mean follow\u2010up was 3.2 years (range, 0.5 to 6 years). No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in intraoperative complications, postoperative hypotony, or macular or optic disk edema. Overall, 44% of the buckling cases were reoperated during the follow\u2010up period, with a higher rate of reoperations in the \u00bd\u2010vitrectomy group (P < .05). Postoperative hypotony occurred in 3 patients, but all were resolved after 6 to 9 weeks following implantation of a glaucoma shunt. Visual acuity improved significantly from baseline in both groups, but the final logMAR values were not significantly different (P = .27).CONCLUSION: Small\u2010incision scleral buckling using \u00bd vitrectomy can give good anatomical and visual results equivalent to standard scleral buckling, but with significantly fewer perioperative and postoperative complications.",

The study was designed in collaboration with REEV Sense, and the objectives were to assess the accuracy of the device in detecting gait parameters in individuals using ankle braces and estimate the precision of the device in measuring walking cadence, gait speed, and knee flexion angle measurements.\nObjective :\nThe study was conducted to assess the measurement accuracy of the REEV Sense gait tracker in ankle brace users in detecting walking cadence, gait speed, and knee flexion angle measurements. Methods: The study was conducted as a pilot or feasibility study aiming to provide initial data on the accuracy and reliability of the device in individuals with limited mobility and using ankle braces. The study design was a within-subjects design, and the sample size was based on the available sample size in the literature.\nMethods :\nThe study included 10 participants with limited mobility and using ankle braces, with an equal distribution between men and women. A power analysis was conducted based on the mean and standard deviation of the gait parameters of interest (cadence, gait speed, knee flexion angle), which were reported to have a range of 95-100 steps/min, 0.8 -1.2 m/s, and 0- 15 degrees, respectively. A minimum sample size of 10 participants was determined to provide a precision of \u00b15% of the mean or higher.\nResults :\nThe results of this observational study demonstrated moderate to high correlations between the kinematic data obtained from the REEV Sense device and the reference method, indicating a good level of accuracy in measuring walking cadence, gait speed, and knee flexion angle measurements in ankle brace users.

The investigators evaluated 2 hours post\u2010meal blood glucose (BG), a continuous glucose monitor (CGMS)\u2010measured 24\u2010hour glucose profile, and a CGMS\u2010measured beta cell index, following a single oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). These measurements were obtained following a single dose of VX\u2010670 compared with placebo, given 8 and 22 hours before a 75\u2010gram, oral glucose challenge.RESULTS: The CGMS\u2010measured area under the curve of the 2\u2010hour BG curve and insulin/BG ratio was reduced by 45 and 57%, respectively, by VX\u2010670 (P=0.0003 and 0.0001, respectively). A significant change versus placebo was also observed in the 24\u2010hour continuous BG (P=0.0001), glucose excursions (P=0.01), and the fasting glucose (P=0.0001). The C\u2010peptide area was decreased by 41% by VX\u2010670 (P=0.03). These effects on most variables were statistically significant and were of substantial clinical importance.CONCLUSIONS: VX\u2010670 reduced glucose excursions, the 2\u2010hour BG curve, and plasma C\u2010peptide, suggesting a possible benefit for this CXCR2 antagonist in type 2 diabetes.",

The majority of the studies in the field of social influence conducted so far have focused mainly on physical activity and dietary behavior, with limited focus on smoking behavior. In real world settings, the effects of smoking in public places have often been overlooked, especially in low and middle income countries. Given the importance of researching social influences on smoking behavior, the present study aimed at exploring the role of social influences on smoking behavior in various social situations. The study involved a sample of 480 smokers, where they were divided into three groups \u2010 experimental group for peer smoking (ESPM), experimental group for media smoking (EGMS), and a control group (CG). The participants' smoking behavior was measured based on the questions about the situations when they smoked and reported the number of cigarettes smoked in a day, week, and month respectively. Findings of the study suggest that social influences can have an effect on smoking behavior in the form of facilitating smoking in a social situation. Cigarette smoking seems to be a social norm in the present society, which needs to be dealt with by implementing social and behavior change communication campaigns.",

Although there is a wide array of treatments available for pain, none of them are free of risk and side effects. This study seeks to compare the effectiveness of an oral ketamine drug and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for treatment of severe facial pain, such as trigeminal neuralgia and post-herpetic neuralgia.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nIntroduction The study aims to determine whether oral ketamine and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be an effective treatment when combined as a means of improving the quality of life (QoL) in patients with trigeminal neuralgia and post-herpetic neuralgia. Method Participants must be aged 18-65 years and have severe pain, as well as a diagnosis of either trigeminal neuralgia or post-herpetic neuralgia. Participants must be able to read and understand English and provide informed consent. Participants must be available for visits and procedures at the university-affiliated study location: Washington University Barnes-Jewish Campus, St. Louis, Missouri. The current research involves one clinical study protocol and encompasses a five-month research period. The study consists of five visits. During the screening/pre-treatment phase of the study, study participants will complete assessments to ensure that they are eligible for participating in the study as outlined in the eligibility criteria. Participants may also have a study research appointment that includes completing questionnaires and a non-invasive imaging test called diffusion tensor imaging to assess potential differences in the brain's connectivity between healthy participants and those with trigeminal neuralgia or post-herpetic neuralgia. Study participants will be asked to complete an electroencephalogram (EEG) during some study visits. During each of these visits, participants may also receive an oral dose of ketamine in order to determine how best to dose ketamine for study participants with severe facial pain to be enrolled later in the study.

METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, double\u2010blind, randomized, controlled trial, patients with a normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) who underwent primary TKA were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive the anticoagulants dabigatran or enoxaparin. Dabigatran and enoxaparin were administered at a daily dose of 150 mg and 40 mg, respectively, for 1 day after surgery and at lower doses from then until the second postoperative week. Clinical and laboratory assessments as well as the quality of life for patients were assessed at predetermined time intervals. The primary outcome was the incidence of venous thromboembolism. RESULTS: Between March 2010 and March 2012, 220 patients were randomly assigned to the dabigatran group and 221 to the standard\u2010care enoxaparin group. Venous thromboembolism was diagnosed in 2 patients in the dabigatran group and 1 patient in the enoxaparin group. In contrast, the rate of adverse events within 21 days after surgery was higher in the dabigatran group than in the enoxaparin group (p < 0.001), particularly that of bleeding (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although the current dosage regimen of dabigatran was unable to prevent venous thromboembolism after TKA, we can provide novel insights into the effectiveness and safety of other dosage regimens by extrapol",

            "Excellent! I'm grateful for your valuable input. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The treatment of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for middle\u2010low anal cancer patients carries a significant impact on post operative morbidity, especially regarding lower anal sphincter function preservation (LASP). Although this is an important oncological issue, there is no available scoring tool to predict the clinical outcome of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) with respect to LASP. Methods: We have previously proposed an 8\u2010item clinical classification system for patients with cT1N0 middle anal cancer treated with 2 cycles of preoperative cisplatin and 5FU CRT followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) with re\u2010evaluation of pathological stage. This study included 121 middle anal cancer patients with cT1N0 stage who had undergone transanal excision (TAE). Preoperative nCRT and TME have been applied with a standard protocol. We retrospectively analyzed the prognostic factors for LASP based on this scoring system from a single institutional series. We calculated the probability of having LASP by using different combinations of the 8\u2010component items with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and used a Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Preoperative nCRT and TME was a promising combination treatment for anal cancer. After preoperative nCRT and TME, 36/121 (29.8%) patients were upstaged and 22/36 (61.1%) patients with upstaging achieved R\u20100 resection. None of the patients with ypT3N0M0 had received total mesorectal excision (TME) alone. TME significantly increased a negative resection margin without increasing morbidity. A negative resection margin was the most powerful independent prognostic factor for LASP. We successfully developed an 8\u2010item scoring system and the nomogram was able to identify high\u2010risk patients for LASP who needed pelvic radiotherapy. Conclusions: We successfully developed a clinical prediction model for LASP after nCRT in anal carcinoma with middle\u2010low tumors. This scoring system can be used in clinical practice to determine the most suitable treatment"
