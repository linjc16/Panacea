            "Sure, it is essential to select sections/areas consisting of at least 70% cancer cells to collect tissue material for subsequent biomarker analysis. Several variables could have an impact on the results of the mutational and methylation analysis. Biomarker expression can differ in normal tissue, precancerous lesions, or cancer tissue, but can also differ depending on the tumor cell percentage in a sample as well as the type of tissue section used . Furthermore, to achieve clinical validation of biomarkers, it is essential to ensure a sufficient proportion of a cancer cell, which guarantees that the biomarker is present and is indeed a cancer-specific biomarker. Using a 70% threshold, we can mitigate these potential variables and increase the odds that the biomarker identified in our study is cancer-specific. In other studies, such tissue section selection criteria have been used to collect biomarker-containing tissue material.",
            "In this trial, we would be collecting tumor biopsies from the patients as archival tissues, and we will use blood samples in some of the patients. However, in this study, we cannot have these samples from pediatrics less than 18 years of age. Hence we are planning to enroll only male adults. Therefore, it would be more appropriate for this cohort of patients if the exclusion criteria were to state \"exclude male pediatric patients\" as opposed to stating the age restriction.",
            "Given that this is an observational study, it would be important to limit potential confounders as much as possible. These exclusion criteria help to ensure that the studied patients are more comparable to each other, thus creating a more reliable foundation for the analysis of data and inferences drawn from the study."

            "Absolutely! The requirement for neoplastic lesion containing \u2265 70% neoplastic cells ensures that the samples used for mutational and epigenetic analysis are of high quality and contain enough neoplastic cells for accurate assessment. This criterion helps to minimize potential errors or inaccuracies in the analysis, thus improving the reliability of the study results. Does that clarify the importance of this criterion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the information provided, here's what I suggest for the exclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis.\n2. Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these exclusion criteria?",
            "Excellent! So here's the complete set of criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage III-IVa OPSCC, according to AJCC 7th Edition.\n2. Managed with definitive treatment modality (either radical surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy \u00b1 chemotherapy or definitive chemo-radiotherapy).\n3. Minimum follow up of 2 years or who had disease recurrence within 2 years after the end of treatment.\n4. Neoplastic lesion contains \u2265 70% neoplastic cells.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis.\n2. Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible.\n\nPlease make sure to document these criteria accurately. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
