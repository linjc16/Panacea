The study involves undergoing ultrasound imaging of the abdomen after tube feeding is inserted to ensure it is in the proper location. Patients will be selected for the study if they are intubated and require tube feeding.

There are no extra risks or burden with this procedure.\nStudy Risk/Benefits: There are no known risks associated with this study, although the ultrasound may show things not related to the tube position, but that is not the purpose of the study. The hope is to determine if ultrasound can be used to help in tube positioning.\nPotential Study Delays and Missed Treatment: Participation in the study will not delay your usual care and will not prevent you from receiving the best care available. As noted above, ultrasound will be used to help in tube placement, but it is not the only way to do so. The usual care you would get will not change.\nStudy Compensation: There is no compensation for participants but the results of the study may help other patients in the future.\nPotential Discomfort: Ultrasound does not cause pain and is not uncomfortable.

So far, we have discussed inclusion and exclusion criteria for subject recruitment. Let's now turn our attention to the next section of the risk-of-bias triangle, selection bias. selection bias. The risk-of-bias triangle. The concept of selection bias is important in planning an RCT to ensure that the results are unbiased, and unfavorable treatment effects can be minimized. The selection bias describes the processes involved with recruiting participants, starting with the initial contact with individuals and ending with their enrollment in the trial. There are two forms of selection bias, selection at time zero and selection at follow-up. Selection at time zero refers to selection bias that occurs before allocation to the intervention or control group, or in other words, when recruiting participants. Selection at follow-up refers to selection bias that occurs after allocation and is related to dropouts, that is, patients who are not adherent to the intervention or follow-up protocol. Selection bias can occur from inadequate concealment of group allocation, leading to selection of participants to receive the intervention or control group based on prognostic factors or known outcome differences. It can also occur from differential enrollment of treatment-related outcomes due to selective dropout, in which dropouts are more likely to have favorable outcomes compared to those who complete the trial. Finally, selection bias can occur from confounding by indication, in which participants who self-select into the study because of their baseline characteristics. It is important to minimize selection bias by adequate randomization to ensure that participants are assigned to groups randomly rather than preferentially selecting higher-risk patients or those with a particular outcome. Let's discuss some strategies to minimize selection bias, beginning with adequate randomization. Adequate randomization. Randomization minimizes selection bias by ensuring that participants are assigned to groups randomly rather than preferentially selecting higher-risk patients or those with a particular outcome. Randomization should use a method that minimizes systematic bias, such as block randomization. Where possible, minimizing the likelihood of participant or investigator bias should be considered during randomization. Luck-of-the-draw should be",

The criteria mention the need for an age >18 years, as it's recommended that individuals be over 18 years old to participate in most clinical trials. The last exclusion criterion is contraindication to temporary interruption of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, except aspirin, which are drugs that thin the blood and therefore increase bleeding risk. Aspirin, however, has antiprotease effects and can be useful to treat underlying inflammation in sarcoidosis participants, so this exclusion criterion is reasonable.\nClinical trials must have inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure participant safety and validity of study results.

Participants with syndromic forms of hearing loss. \n2. Participants with any known congenital or acquired condition affecting hearing, including ototoxic exposure or drugs (e.g. aminoglycoside exposure) known to cause sensorineural hearing loss.\n3. Profound or residual speech or language delays.\n4. Evaluation of candidacy for cochlear implantation or auditory brain implantation, or currently using a cochlear implant or auditory brain implant.\n[Detailed information] - Participants with syndromic forms of hearing loss should be excluded as these genetic conditions are known to cause nonsyndromic hearing loss.  Cochlear or auditory brain implantation will be evaluated as it may interfere with the hearing outcome. Syndromes with variable expressivity make diagnosis complicated and might jeopardize genetic testing interpretations. Speech- language delays may complicate the genetic interpretation and confound the association of the genotype with the phenotype. Please note that this is a subset of the total cohort of affected individuals in which the clinical picture is more complex and would likely impact the generalizability of the results in the remaining participants.    The exclusion of syndromes, cochlear or auditory brain implants, and speech-language delays will reduce the variability in the phenotype and improve the study population for the specific genotypes and associated hearing loss phenotypes, allowing a greater degree of precision in the results and generalizability of the findings across a broader patient population.",

I think that's all the criteria we need to think about. Do you have any other considerations before I start developing the inclusion and exclusion criteria? \n\nLet's move on to the third step-developing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Now that we've discussed the general criteria, we need to make them specific.\nYou can think of inclusion and exclusion criteria as boxes that your participants must or must not fall into to be considered for your study. These criteria should be specific and measurable, so that it is clear who is invited and who isn't.\nRemember our example of the study on caregiver burden among patients with cancer. We decided the inclusion criteria would be:\n\n>18 years old\nCaregiving responsibilities for a relative with cancer\nCaregiver strain index (CSI) score of >= 36\nLive within 50 miles of study site\nThe exclusion criteria would be:\nCaregiver of a patient with another chronic illness\nParticipants with a mental impairment or incompetence\nParticipating in another intervention for caregiver burden\nRecently hospitalized for mental health issues\nAs you can see, we have specific criteria for eligibility and exclusion, with operational definitions for each, and we make sure to include all the relevant factors that we think will impact our study.\nNow you can start drafting this information into a data sheet or table. Start by listing the criteria and providing the operational definition for each.\nHere's a template you can use to help get started.\nOnce you've done that, take some time to review and perfect it. A good strategy is to get feedback from your mentor or someone else you trust, to make sure that your criteria are clear and won't screen out anyone who might participate.\nA good inclusivity-exclusivity balance is key. Don't set criteria so narrow that you exclude all the participants you want to study, but don't make them so wide that you are inundated with participants who don't truly meet your study's criteria. Remember, if you end up with too many participants, it could jeopardize your study! If you have trouble getting it right",

The inclusion criteria include age, Cantonese-speaking language capability, Cantonese-speaking caregiver, and a caregiver burden score of 7 or above on the Mini-Mental State Exam.

We can include them in a separate subgroup or cohort, as long as the majority of participants consent to providing the necessary samples. This approach will still allow us to gather valuable data while accommodating the preferences and limitations of individual patients. Does that address your concern?",
            "I'm glad you find it reasonable. Now, we have discussed all the key inclusion criteria. Shall we move on to the key exclusion criteria?",
            "Great. The first criterion is: \"Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\" This criterion is important to avoid potential interactions or confounding effects of prior treatments on the safety and efficacy evaluation of the investigational therapy. Do you have any suggestions or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "I agree. Excluding patients who have recently received other therapies helps in isolating the effects of the investigational treatment. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\" This criterion ensures that patients with unresolved toxicities from prior treatments are excluded from the trial to prevent exacerbation of side effects and ensure patient safety. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our primary concern. Now, the next criterion is: \"Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients who may be at higher risk of severe immune-related adverse events with the investigational therapy based on their prior treatment history. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Minimizing the risk of severe adverse events is of utmost importance. Let's move on to the next criterion: \"Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\" This criterion is important to exclude patients with active or recent history of other malignancies that may confound the assessment of the efficacy of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I agree. Maintaining the focus on the specific types of cancer under study is crucial for meaningful evaluation. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients with brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease, as these patients may require specific treatment approaches and have different prognosis compared to patients without central nervous system involvement. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Excluding patients with central nervous system involvement helps maintain the homogeneity of the patient population and facilitates accurate evaluation of the investigational therapy. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\" This criterion is important to ensure patient safety and avoid potential severe allergic reactions to the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our top priority. Now, we have reached the final criterion: \"Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\" This criterion is essential to protect the safety of pregnant women and unborn children, as well as to prevent potential exposure of infants to the investigational therapy through breastfeeding. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Protecting the safety of vulnerable populations is paramount. Based on our discussion, here are the full criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nKey Inclusion Criteria:\n- Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumor.\n- Having received and failed or was intolerant to standard of care for advanced disease or not eligible for standard of care therapy.\n- Measurable disease.\n- ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n- Adequate organ function.\n- Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n- Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\n- Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\n- Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\n- Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\n- Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\n- History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n- Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

Now, the inclusion and exclusion criteria have been established, which are common for all study subjects. The next step is to determine the criteria specific to each arm of the study. To review their eligibility for the study, we need to further classify each of the inclusion and exclusion criteria by arm. For the placebo group, we need to add the following to the above list: 1. Patients with other shoulder injuries that would require more than 3-week recovery before arthroscopic supraspinatus repair. 2. Patients with major medical contraindications to NSAIDs, such as gastric ulcers or renal insufficiency. For the NSAID group, we need to add the following to the above list: 1. Patients with contraindications to NSAIDs, as previously mentioned. 2. Patients who have had a history of allergy to salicylates. At this point, we have included criteria for the type of patients that will be included and excluded in the study drug arms. However, we need criteria for those who drop out of the study.

A clear understanding that there may be a period of wrist rest that may last for up to 2 weeks. 3. Certain follow-up visits, including physical exam and telephone calls within 1, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery. 4. Assessment of complications such as wrist pain, joint swelling, and wrist movement within 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after surgery.

Our exclusion criteria include individuals with ASA III or IV, pregnant individuals, individuals with a history of diaphragmatic paralysis, and individuals with adverse reactions to local anesthetics. I'm impressed; your thoughtful consideration of every aspect of the study has made our sample size calculations much easier. \nInterviewing Participants\nAfter deciding on the eligibility criteria, we need to decide on the best way to notify potential participants of the study and to gather consent. Consider the following questions: \n  * Should the interviewer make phone calls or visits to individuals' homes to find participants?\n  * Will participants be able to provide written consent, such as via fax or online form, or will we need to seek additional authorization from an institutional review board (IRB)?\nWe will call this technique active recruitment, as the interviewer will be actively reaching out to potential participants to relay information and obtain consent. On the other hand, passive recruitment involves waiting for potential participants to approach the researchers and volunteer their participation. We'll discuss this option further later.\nBoth forms of recruitment will have pros and cons; choose whichever process is most appropriate for your study and feasible under your research budget. If you anticipate difficulties attracting any particular group of people (e.g., minorities or individuals with disabilities), it may be important to also advertise in media that are likely to reach these populations. \nAfter deciding on a method of recruitment and obtaining IRB approval, you'll need to create a protocol for interviewing participants. Your protocol should include information about the study, such as the study title and purpose, number of visits, times and location of visits, number of total and follow-up visits, length of follow-up, risks and benefits, participants' rights, and how to contact the research team. \nFor studies with participants who are unable to come to the research site, you may want to include a description of the informed consent procedure. In some cases, an IRB-approved informed consent form that the participant can read and sign in the presence of a live interviewer is sufficient. In other cases, a self-administered form that the participant can complete and mail or",

The inclusion and exclusion criteria should be specific and relevant to the population being studied. Keep in mind which patients will benefit most from the intervention or who will provide the most meaningful data.\nList potential inclusion criteria. Aim for as few criteria as possible. Start with the most important or strictest criteria first.\nEliminate those who don't meet the criteria. Re-read the criteria until you get to the last patient that would be included. If that individual doesn't meet all the criteria, then it's time to stop.\nIt's important to write the criteria in a way that's clear to both researchers and patients. Explain each criterion with a brief statement to avoid confusion.\nReview with colleagues or a study committee to ensure that your criteria are feasible and appropriate.\nInclude a short description of the rationale for each criterion. Why is it there? What does it test?\nCheck the criteria against the study's aims to ensure that they're consistent.\nHow to Use Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nUsing inclusion and exclusion criteria is a crucial step in any clinical trial. They ensure that the study includes patients who are most likely to benefit from the intervention and exclude those who will most likely not benefit. The criteria also minimize the risk of missing important baseline characteristics that could affect study outcomes.",

Patients who started androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) more than 26 weeks prior to enrollment will also be excluded. Any questions about these exclusions?",
            "Exactly! We also have additional exclusion criteria. Patients who started intensification of therapy beyond ADT (e.g., AR pathway inhibitor, cytotoxic therapy) more than 26 weeks prior to registration will be excluded. Subjects with a known allergy to contrast material and/or contraindication to FDG-PET will also be excluded. Furthermore, patients enrolled in another therapeutic clinical trial that would preclude them from participating in this trial will be excluded.

Someone with a severe head injury may not be able to tolerate the procedure or the side effects of the drug. Additionally, we should also exclude participants with hypoxia, such as participants with carbon monoxide poisoning, seizures, or neurological conditions such as brain tumors, hydrocephalus, or encephalitis. These conditions can also alter the results and create unnecessary risks for the participants.

Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria for the cancer arm participants. The first criterion is the exclusion of pregnancy or lactating women. Can you think of a reason why this is important?",
            "Well said! Excluding pregnant or lactating women helps ensure that the levels of biomarkers are not influenced by hormonal changes during pregnancy or lactation. The next criterion is the exclusion of recipients of organ transplants or prior non-autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplants. Can you think of a reason for this exclusion?",
            "Perfect! You've understood it perfectly. The next criterion is the exclusion of recipients of blood transfusion within 7 days prior to the study blood draw. Any ideas why this criterion is important?",
            "Exactly! Blood transfusions can introduce external biomarkers or alter the levels of existing biomarkers, which could impact the study results. The final criterion we'll discuss for the cancer arm participants is the exclusion of recipients of any anti-cancer therapy within 30 days prior to the study blood draw, due to diseases other than cancers. What do you think about this criterion?",

The last three criteria were agreed upon with some reservation/amendments: the eighth criterion, excluding individuals with a history of GVHD, required clarification: is GVHD in remission, active, or unspecified? The ninth criterion required some further explanation: individuals with pre-existing neurological disorders should be considered on a case-by-case basis, i.e., whether the disorder is likely to affect immune function? And the tenth criterion, individuals with a history of anaphylaxis, required amendment to exclude participants with a history of reaction to a previous vaccination (not administration) and agree to readminister a vaccination after an appropriate time period.\nWith the addition of these two statements, we have our final set of inclusion/exclusion criteria and can move on to writing the exclusion/inclusion criteria section of our protocol:\nSTDs: ___/__: (include pregnancy, history of anaphylaxis to a previous vaccine, current GVHD with active symptoms, neurological disorders with functional impairment, current nephrotic syndrome, and participants receiving nephrotoxic medications) 1.

So, the criteria are comprehensive, and they ensure that only healthy participants without any medical conditions that may be affected by the medication are enrolled in the study. Good luck with the rest of the design.",

Now, let's proceed to the next criterion. How should we categorize participants based on their renal function?",
            "That's a good approach. To categorize participants, we can use the pre-defined eGFR values based on the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. According to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) standards, what should be the range of eGFR values for each renal function group?",

And the last criterion is patients who are able and willing to adhere to the study visit schedule, including 3 scheduled visits at 3-month intervals, and the willingness to follow-up for survival for at least 5 years after treatment. Is there anything else you would like to include or exclude for the inclusion criteria?",
            "That makes sense. The next exclusion criterion is patients who develop untreated, symptomatic liver metastases at baseline or those with CNS metastases.  Do you have any comments on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Exactly! By identifying patients with longer treatment durations, we can better understand the long-term responses to regorafenib. Therefore, these criteria have been set for inclusion and exclusion for the study's participants."

            "Exactly! Timeframe is crucial for the accuracy of the study. Now let's move on to the second criterion. Adult patients, 18 years or older, at the date of their first regorafenib treatment should be included. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! We need to understand how effective the treatment is specifically in adults. Now, for the third criterion, we need to consider patients who have at least one recorded visit, laboratory test, or other recorded electronic medical record entry in the Flatiron network at least 3 months before the date of their first regorafenib treatment. However, if the patient was diagnosed with mCRC within the last 3 months, this requirement does not apply. What are your thoughts?",
            "Exactly! Having a baseline helps us assess the impact of the treatment accurately. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is patients who had a diagnosis or recorded history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), or other primary cancers (except non-melanoma skin cancers) during the 6-month period on or prior to the date of their first regorafenib treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! We want to ensure that the data collected is specific to metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with regorafenib. Now, for the final exclusion criterion, patients will be excluded if their treatment duration is less than 5 months for treatment completers or less than 4 months at their last visit date for non-completers. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Including patients with shorter treatment durations may not provide enough data to evaluate the effectiveness of regorafenib over the long term. Now, let me summarize the full criteria we have designed:\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with a diagnosis of mCRC between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2022, who initiated regorafenib monotherapy up to 14 days prior or after their mCRC diagnosis and during the patient selection period (July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022).\n2. Adult patients (\u226518 years old) at the date of their first regorafenib treatment.\n3. Patients with at least one recorded visit, laboratory test, or other recorded electronic medical record entry in the Flatiron network at least 3 months before the date of their first regorafenib treatment, unless diagnosed with mCRC within the last 3 months.\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with a diagnosis or recorded history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), or other primary cancers (except non-melanoma skin cancers) during the 6-month period on or prior to the date of their first regorafenib treatment.\n2.

One of the exclusion criteria is participants with a history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder. This is to exclude participants who may have previously had a mental health disorder that may affect their ability to adhere to the trial procedures. What do you think?",
            "Perfect. Another inclusion criteria could be presence of a vein larger than 10 mm in diameter in the antecubital fossa of the preferred arm. This will ensure that participants have the proper vein size for blood sampling during the study procedures. Are you OK with this one?",
            "Excellent. With all of these criteria satisfied, we have a solid basis for our inclusion/exclusion criteria. So let's summarize our thoughts in a bullets list: Healthy female or male volunteers aged 18 or above (exclusion age > 65) 2 Stable weight of the participant with Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 Physically able to permit a short period of injection in the upper arm. Voluntary and competent to provide informed consent. This would be a great inclusion/exclusion criteria list to approach the IRB with for approval.",

            "With all these exclusion criteria, we've ensured our study participants are healthy, free of relevant medications or conditions that might impact the performance of the on-body injector, and unlikely to have histories of skin sensitivities or allergies. This greatly reduces the risk of adverse events and ensures the data collected are as reliable and accurate as possible.\nRecruitment and retention are crucial in ensuring the success of any clinical trial. Participants are the central focus of any study, and a high rate of dropouts can undermine the credibility of the study's findings. The inclusion and exclusion criteria we've discussed help to reduce the likelihood of dropouts by filtering out individuals who may have underlying conditions, lifestyle factors, or other concerns that could affect the study's outcomes.",

Firstly, \"Patient must have given their free and informed consent or included by emergency procedure.\" Informed consent is essential to ensure that patients understand the study procedures and potential risks. In emergency situations where the patient is unable to provide consent, an emergency procedure may be necessary to include them in the study. Secondly, \"Patient signed the consent form or included by emergency procedure.\" This criterion ensures that patients are aware of their participation in the study and have the opportunity to withdraw if they choose. What do you think?",

These laboratory findings are characteristic of Type 2 inflammation, which is commonly associated with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. This ensures that the study population is homogenous. Any questions?",

Are there any potential alternative explanations for your outcomes? How will you interpret the results? Hypothesis and/or research question If you are studying cause and effect, is the proposed protocol a necessary and appropriate approach to answer the question?\nAre the risks to participants minimized?\nWhat type of IRB/IAC review is required (full board, expedited, etc.)? Are you using drugs or devices where you need to provide FDA information?\nWhat happens if an emergency situation arises that requires immediate IRB/IAC review? Is the research expected to be completed in a year or less?\nIs there any reason why a consent form can't be used (e.g., impossible or impractical)? Exactly what form or form template will be used (e.g., name of institution's template)? What are the elements that must be included in the consent form (e.g., explanation of study, explanation of alternatives, details of procedures, risks and benefits, information about compensation)? Is there anything you need to specially protect the privacy or welfare of participants (e.g., age, disability, economically/educationally disadvantaged, vulnerable and exploited populations)?

This is a common criterion in clinical studies to ensure the subjects have reached sufficient cognitive and psychological maturity to provide informed consent and understand the risks and benefits of the study. Any age below 18 is excluded because of the impaired cognitive and psychological abilities at these ages. Our secondary inclusion criteria are typical for endoscopic studies-male sex, without a history of any major surgical procedures in the last 6 weeks, and signed informed consent. The informed consent helps us ensure that each participant is aware of the potential risks, benefits, and implications of the study and provides voluntary, informed consent. The male sex requirement is typical in urological studies as males have a higher prevalence of the disease under investigation. The last criterion ensures that the subject has not had any major surgical procedures within the last 6 weeks. This helps avoid iatrogenic or medical complications due to the surgery or anesthesia.

I've drawn up two options for the treatments that we can offer our participants. Please take a moment to review each one and let me know if you see anything that needs changing.\nTreatment A:\n- Artificial tears with or without NAC 0.04%\n- Artificial tears without NAC 0.04%\nNow, treatment B:\nWe're ready to move forward with the treatment phase of the study now. Which treatment do you think would be best to use?\nIn treatment A, we've included artificial tears with or without NAC 0.04%. The inclusion of NAC is based on the hypothesis that it will improve participants' symptoms and signs of dry eye. Treatment A appears to be a stronger artificial tear formula than the control treatment, which doesn't contain NAC, therefore the artificial tear without NAC would be an appropriate control. What do you think?\nThe only other difference between the treatments is the addition of 0.04% NAC in the active treatment. 0.04% NAC has been shown in recent studies to improve symptoms and signs of dry eye significantly more than placebo, and it has a much better reported tolerability profile than more concentrated treatments. 0.04% NAC is the lowest concentration of NAC allowed by our IRB, but based on the literature, it's the optimal concentration to use because it has the best efficacy and good patient acceptance. Therefore, as the intervention is so similar for both groups and the control is the more dilute artificial tear in a container that looks and feels the same, I suggest we do not randomize. I would like to keep participants blinded to their treatment; therefore, we would be doing a crossover design, where treatment A would serve as the control and treatment B would be the intervention. Participants would use the active treatment for one month followed by the placebo for another month to equalize the amount of treatment they receive. In this crossover design, participants would be able to use the highest concentration of artificial tears they like and receive the treatment they will continue with after the study. Do"

            "Wonderful. The final exclusion criterion is that participants should not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Excluding pregnant or breastfeeding individuals helps ensure the safety and well-being of both the mother and developing fetus/infant. Is there anything else you would like to add?",
            "Excellent. And the last exclusion criterion is that participants should not be taking medication known to affect physiological thermoregulation. Excluding individuals on medication that affects thermoregulation helps ensure comparable physiological responses. Do you have concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "The seventh and final exclusion criterion is that participants should not be participating in any other investigational therapy or intervention. Participants enrolled in other investigational therapies or interventions may be at increased risk for adverse effects or confounded by the passive heat intervention. Excluding individuals participating in other investigational therapies helps ensure the safety and accuracy of study outcomes. Would you like to add anything else?",
            "Wonderful. The eighth exclusion criterion is that participants should have no active skin rashes or dermatological conditions that may impact heating blanket use. Participants with unresolved skin rashes or dermatological conditions may be uncomfortable during heating blanket exposure. Excluding individuals with these conditions helps avoid discomfort for participants. Is there anything you would like to say about this criterion?",
            "Excellent, let's continue with the remaining exclusion criteria. The ninth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have chronic conditions that would interfere with cardiovascular or orthopedic assessments. Individuals with certain chronic conditions may have limitations that could compromise their ability to complete cardiovascular and orthopedic assessments as required by the study protocol. Do you have any questions or concerns about this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. The last exclusion criterion is that participants should not have a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg or thigh, that can break off and travel to the lungs, which can be life-threatening. Individuals with a history of DVT may be at increased risk for DVT during the passive heat therapy session, which could be harmful. Are you concerned about this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Well, those are the 10 exclusion criteria for this study. Do you have any other questions or comments?",

            "Perfect. The second criterion is that participants should be at least 2 years post-injury. This is to ensure that participants have had sufficient time to stabilize and adapt to their injuries. It helps control for potential confounding variables related to the acute phase of injury. Any questions so far?",
            "Great. The third criterion is that participants should be able to do a level transfer with minimal assistance. This ensures that participants have a certain level of physical ability to safely participate in the study and undergo the passive heat therapy intervention. Is there anything you'd like to add or ask about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on, the fourth criterion is that participants should be engaged in a regular and consistent bowel/bladder management program. This is important for the safety and well-being of participants during the study. Individuals with spinal cord injuries often have specific bowel and bladder management needs that need to be addressed to prevent complications. Any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The fifth criterion is that participants should be 19 years of age or older. This ensures that participants are adults who can provide informed consent and are likely to have a better understanding of the study requirements. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Good. The sixth criterion is that participants should be able to communicate effectively in English. Effective communication is crucial for the study procedures and data collection. Ensuring that participants can communicate in English helps maintain clear and accurate communication throughout the study. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Great. The seventh criterion is that participants should have self-reported well controlled/predictable orthostatic hypertension and/or autonomic dysreflexia, if present. This is necessary to ensure the safety of participants with specific cardiovascular conditions that may be affected by the passive heat therapy intervention. Any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The eighth criterion is that participants should be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, including the initial 2 doses and 1 booster. This criterion is important for the safety of participants and researchers, especially considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination helps reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. We'll follow a similar process to design each criterion step by step. Are you ready to continue?",
            "Great. The first exclusion criterion is that participants should not smoke or use tobacco products. Smoking and tobacco use can have negative effects on cardiovascular health, which may confound the results of the study. Excluding smokers helps control for this potential confounding factor. Any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. The second exclusion criterion is that participants should not have any cardiac/respiratory illness or diabetes mellitus. Participants with pre-existing cardiac, respiratory, or metabolic conditions may have underlying health issues that could impact the study outcomes. Excluding individuals with these conditions helps ensure the safety and integrity of the study. Do you have any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The third exclusion criterion is that participants should not have known diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a condition that may be exacerbated by heat therapy or other study procedures. Excluding individuals with known diverticulitis helps prevent potential complications. Any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Well said. The fourth exclusion criterion is that participants should not be hypertensive, with systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 190 mmHg. Individuals with uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk of adverse events during the passive heat therapy intervention. Excluding hypertensive individuals helps ensure participant safety. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The fifth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have a scheduled MRI investigation in the 7 days following the data collection session. MRI investigations may interfere with the study procedures or outcomes. Excluding individuals with scheduled MRI investigations helps avoid potential confounding factors. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The sixth exclusion criterion is that participants should not take prescription medications that affect blood vessels, other than contraceptives. Medications that affect blood vessels may interact with the passive heat therapy intervention or other study procedures. Excluding individuals taking these medications helps control for potential confounding variables. Any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Great. The seventh exclusion criterion is that participants should not have used an erectile dysfunction related medication in the past 48 hours. Erectile dysfunction medications may have cardiovascular effects that could impact the study outcomes. Excluding individuals who have used these medications helps control for potential confounding factors. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The eighth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have an unhealed fracture or contracture that would interfere with a simple chair to tub transfer and/or donning/doffing clothing. Individuals with unhealed fractures or contractures may have physical limitations that could affect their ability to participate safely in the study procedures. Any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Well said. The ninth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have an unhealed pressure sore of any grade and/or open skin areas. Open wounds or pressure sores may increase the risk of infection or complications during the study procedures. Excluding individuals with unhealed pressure sores helps ensure participant safety. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. The tenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have an unstable medical/psychiatric condition or substance abuse disorder.

Excluding these individuals helps ensure participant safety and data integrity. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The eleventh exclusion criterion is that participants should not have underlying health conditions or injuries that would impact their ability to tolerate a mild exercise response or hot water immersion. Individuals with underlying health conditions that may be exacerbated by mild exercise or heat therapy may not be suitable for the study. Excluding these individuals helps ensure participant safety. Any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Well said. The twelfth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have uncontrolled orthostatic hypotension, where blood pressure does not return to normal within 2-3 minutes after standing or transferring. Individuals with uncontrolled orthostatic hypotension may be at increased risk of adverse events during the study procedures. Excluding these individuals helps ensure participant safety. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The thirteenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk for COVID-19, such as respiratory illness, compromised immunity, or chronic health conditions. Individuals with these underlying health conditions may be at increased risk during the study. Excluding these individuals helps ensure participant safety.

            "Well said. The fourteenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have any COVID-19 related symptoms, such as a new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, or other symptoms. Individuals with COVID-19 symptoms may be at risk of transmitting the virus to other participants or researchers. Excluding individuals with COVID-19 symptoms helps prevent the spread of the virus during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The fifteenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have traveled outside Canada or had close contact with anyone who has traveled outside Canada in the past 14 days. Travel increases the risk of COVID-19 exposure and transmission. Excluding individuals who have traveled outside Canada helps reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the study. Any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Well said. The sixteenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have close contact with anyone with respiratory illness or a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19. Close contact with individuals who may have COVID-19 increases the risk of transmission. Excluding individuals with close contact with respiratory illness or COVID-19 cases helps prevent the spread of the virus during the study. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The seventeenth and final exclusion criterion is that participants should not be currently self-isolating.

Is there anything else that we need to discuss before I close the questionnaire? [PATIENT:] I'd like one more question. What are the potential side effects of the treatment?  [PONYTAKER:] Of course! The potential side effects include all of the typical side effects of pancreatic cancer treatment. We may also observe nausea, vomiting, dehydration, elevation in body temperature, and hematologic and hepatic toxicities. However, these side effects may be minimized with proper hydration, dietary accommodations, and close monitoring. [PATIENT:] What is the most common side effect of the treatment?  [PONYTAKER:] The most common side effect of the treatment is likely to be mild to moderate gastrointestinal distress.  [PATIENT:] Can this treatment cure my pancreatic cancer? [PONYTAKER:] I am sorry, we cannot guarantee a treatment that will cure your pancreatic cancer at this time but we will do everything in our power to help you achieve the best possible outcome.",

Here's the first one: \"Female or male aged 18 years and over.\" This criterion ensures that the participants are adults who can provide informed consent and are likely to tolerate the treatment. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. \"Pathologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma, also known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\" This criterion ensures that the participants have a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, which is necessary for the study's focus on pancreatic cancer patients. Any thoughts?",
            "Exactly. Now, for the third criterion: \"Patient is deemed ineligible for surgical resection of the pancreatic cancer.\" This criterion targets patients who are not suitable candidates for surgery, which is important as the study aims to assess an alternative treatment option for patients who cannot undergo surgery. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Precisely. Moving on, the fourth criterion is: \"Life expectancy of 16 weeks or longer.\" This criterion ensures that participants have a sufficient life expectancy to potentially benefit from the treatment and complete the study. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's discuss the fifth criterion: \"World Health Organisation (WHO) Performance status 0-1.\" This criterion ensures that participants have a good performance status, indicating that they are in relatively good health and able to tolerate the treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Now, for the sixth criterion: \"One or more measurable pancreatic tumours of at least 20 mm in the longest diameter.\" This criterion ensures that participants have measurable tumors that can be monitored for response to treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's move on to the seventh criterion: \"Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.\" This criterion is important to ensure the safety of female participants who could potentially become pregnant during the study. What do you think?",
            "I completely agree. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first one is: \"Radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks before the start of study therapy.\" This criterion is important to avoid potential interactions or confounding effects of recent radiation therapy on the study treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, for the second criterion: \"Chemotherapy within the last 2 weeks before the start of study therapy.\" This criterion is important to avoid potential interactions or confounding effects of recent chemotherapy on the study treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",

Informed consent is a critical component of clinical research, and including patients who are unable to provide consent due to cognitive impairment would violate ethical guidelines. Excluding these patients helps protect their rights and ensures that only individuals who can fully understand the risks and benefits of participating in the study are included. Additionally, we should exclude patients with known but untreated heart disease, such as persistent foramen ovale (PFO) or recent congestive heart failure, as it could complicate comparability within the groups. Patients with untreated heart disease may have underlying conditions that could impact their oxygenation and airway management, potentially confounding the results of the study.

You may also want to pilot your informed consent form by randomly stopping participants and asking them to review the form, as they will provide valuable feedback regarding any confusing or troublesome phrases or sections of the informed consent form. To pilot test the informed consent form, you can ask friends, colleagues, or even research administrators who are not otherwise affiliated with your study to review and provide feedback. It's also a good idea to have the informed consent form reviewed for clarity and comprehension by an attorney as well. 7.3.9 Inserting the Informed Consent Form into the Protocol Procedures Chapter 7 discusses how to prepare your informed consent form. Here, we'll add it to the protocol. Simply insert a section entitled \"Informed Consent\" and within that section, list the informed consent form as an exhibit. Below is an example: Consent Form (see attached) Inserting the Consent form Exhibit 17.4 Informed Consent Informed consent will be obtained by the researcher prior to participation according to the following consent form, described in the attached consent form. 17.5 Study Participant Confidentiality Questions While the importance of maintaining subject confidentiality is emphasized throughout the protocol, including in recruitment and enrollment methods and data collection procedures, there may be questions or concerns from participants about how their personal identifiers (e.g., name, contact information, responses to survey questions) will be managed and kept confidential. Participants should be assured that all data and records that would make it possible to identify them will be stored separately from their demographic data and clinical information. All data should be coded and kept in locked files and electronic databases so that no one person can identify participant responses. It's good practice to inform all data clerks and computer technicians who may have access to participant data that disclosing any identifying information is a serious breach of confidentiality. It is also valuable to provide contact information"

            "Great. The next exclusion criterion is: \"Assumption of antibiotics during the last 6 months.\" This criterion helps to eliminate potential confounding factors that could impact the results of the study, as antibiotics can influence periodontal health.

[*] \u200b\nThe Nursing Process in Crohn's disease nursing care\nCrohn's disease is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease that can cause bowel inflammation in any part of the digestive tract. Nursing care for a person with Crohn's disease requires a thorough understanding of the disease, its symptoms, and individualized nursing interventions. Crohn's disease affects a person's physical and psychosocial health, so nurses need to address both. The nursing process helps nurses develop individualized nursing care plans for people with Crohn's disease. After diagnosing and educating the patient, nurses assess the patient's symptoms and set goals for the care plan, such as treating fistulas or controlling diarrhea. Nurses develop a plan of action and evaluate the effectiveness of the plan as they care for the patient with Crohn's disease. The main goal in nursing for Crohn's disease is to prevent complications and improve the patient's quality of life.\nCrohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The disease causes inflammation in the digestive wall, which can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. The nursing process helps nurses understand what the patient is experiencing and design a care plan tailored to meet the patient's unique needs. The first step in the nursing process is diagnosis and educating the patient about the disease. Nurses should inform the patient about the symptoms of Crohn's disease and the risks of complications. After diagnosing and educating the patient, nurses assess the patient's symptoms and set goals for the care plan. For example, a common goal in the care plan for Crohn's disease may be treating a perianal fistula, a small hole in the intestine that can lead"

            "Absolutely! Moving on to the next criterion, it states that participants with any clinically significant cardiac abnormalities should be excluded. This is to minimize the risk of cardiovascular complications during treatment. What do you think?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion. It specifies that participants with previous treatment with tepotinib or other MET inhibitors should be excluded. This ensures that participants have not been previously exposed to the study drugs. What are your thoughts?",

The second-to-last exclusion criterion states that participants with any other condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, would not make them a good candidate for the clinical trial should be excluded. This allows the investigator to consider additional factors that could impact a participant's suitability for the study. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely! Now, the final exclusion criterion is that participants should not have symptoms of active COVID-19 or documented active COVID-19 infection at the time of screening. This is to ensure the safety of the participants and minimize the risk of potential complications. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Patients with these conditions may have different underlying causes of bladder pain syndrome that could affect the study results. It is important to focus on a specific population to ensure the validity of the study results. What do you think?",
            "Precisely. Another exclusion criterion should be current pregnancy. This is essential to protect the health of the fetus and ensure the safety of the pregnant participant. Pregnancy can also affect pain perception and response to treatment, so it is important to exclude pregnant individuals from the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Excellent. I'll add that criterion too. Now, for the last inclusion criterion, informed consent is essential. It's crucial that patients voluntarily participate in the trial and sign the informed consent form. This ensures their understanding of the risks and benefits involved. What are your thoughts on including this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Inclusion criteria are now complete. Let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the study goals, I have a few suggestions. Firstly, we should exclude patients with cardiac function grade 3 or above. This is to ensure the safety of participants, as those with severe cardiac dysfunction may be at higher risk during anesthesia. What do you think?",
            "I'm glad you agree. I'll add that to the exclusion criteria. Another suggestion is to exclude patients for whom observing pupil size is difficult, especially for head or neck surgery patients. Monitoring pupil size is important as it can indicate neurological status and may be affected by the drugs being studied. What's your opinion on this?",
            "I'm glad you understand the rationale. I'll add that criterion as well. Next, I propose excluding patients who are receiving other forms of anesthesia, such as nerve block or spinal anesthesia. This will help isolate the effects of remimazolam besylate and propofol on hemodynamics. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Great. I'll include that criterion too. Moving on, it's important to exclude patients known to be allergic to remimazolam besylate or benzodiazepines. This is necessary to prevent allergic reactions and ensure the safety of the participants. What do you think?",
            "Perfect. I'll add that criterion as well. Now, let's discuss excluding patients undergoing major vascular surgery or surgeries that directly affect hemodynamics. By excluding these cases, we can control for confounding variables and ensure that the study results are not influenced by other factors. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "I'm glad you agree. I'll include that criterion too. Additionally, excluding patients with coagulation dysfunction, endocrine diseases, or other hemodynamic conditions is important to ensure their safety during anesthesia. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. I'll add that as well. Next, excluding patients undergoing minor surgery (operation duration <1 hour) will help us focus on procedures that require longer anesthesia durations and have a greater impact on hemodynamics. What's your opinion on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. I'll include that criterion too. Lastly, excluding patients with a history of drug or alcohol dependence is important to ensure their safety during the trial and prevent potential interactions with the study drugs. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. I'll add that criterion as well. Finally, we have a catch-all criterion, where subjects deemed unsuitable for the study by the investigator can be excluded. This allows the investigator to use their clinical judgment and exclude patients who may not be suitable for various reasons. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Now that we have discussed all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, let me summarize them for you:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n- Age above 45 years old\n- American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I-II\n- Patients undergoing tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway surgery under general anesthesia\n- Informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n- Patients with cardiac function grade 3 or above\n- Difficult to observe the pupil size of head or neck surgery patients\n- Patients with multimodal anesthesia such as nerve block or spinal anesthesia compounded\n- Patients known to be allergic to remimazolam besylate or benzodiazepines\n- Major vascular surgery and the type of surgery that directly affects hemodynamics\n- Patients with coagulation dysfunction, endocrine diseases, or other hemodynamic conditions\n- Minor surgery (operation duration <1 hour)\n- Surgery lasting more than 4 hours\n- Emergency surgery\n- Patients with a history of drug or alcohol dependence\n- Subjects deemed unsuitable for the study by the investigator",

The first exclusion criterion is the presence of lesions that cannot be imaged well due to the motion during acquisition or presence of metallic stents or hardware. This criterion is necessary as the test being studied is based on imaging, and it may not be possible to assess the lesions properly if they cannot be imaged well. What else can you suggest?",
            "Let's continue with the criteria. The fourth criterion is that patients with a history of autoantibodies to Gallium, idiopathic thyroid adenomas, and cancer are excluded. This is because these patients are likely to have baseline positive FAP levels, and their 68 Gallium -Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography results may be skewed due to their underlying condition. Do you agree with this criterion? \u200b",

The last inclusion criterion is that patients who are expected to require radiotherapy with known contraindications to 18-F 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake should be excluded. This is because the diagnostic test may affect the efficacy of local radiation therapy. What do you think of this criterion? \u200b",

This is because these conditions may affect the results of the diagnostic test, and patients with these histories may have an elevated risk of false positives or false negatives that could skew the study results. Do you agree with this exclusion criterion?",

The first exclusion criterion is that all patients with a history of allergic reactions to 68Ga-DOTATATE, 68Ga, 1111In, or 18F tracers or their reagents should be excluded from the study. This is because a history of an allergic reaction may result in a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction if the patient received the diagnostic tracer during the study period. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent. The second exclusion criterion is that women of childbearing potential should not receive progestational therapy during the study period. This is to avoid potential risks to the fetus if pregnancy occurs during the study. What do you think?",

The first criterion is that patients must have histologically or cytologically solid tumors at any stage. This is important to ensure that the study population consists of patients with solid tumors, as the trial aims to evaluate Fibroblast Activating Protein (FAP) positivity in patients with solid tumors. What do you think?",
            "I'm glad you agree. The second criterion is that patients who have undergone a 18-Fluorine-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose Positron emission tomography / Computerized tomography scan with dubious or inconclusive results should be included. This is because patients with inconclusive imaging results may benefit from further molecular assessment using the diagnostic test being studied in this trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on to the next criterion, we have age eligibility. Both male and female patients aged 18 years or older can participate. This ensures that the study includes adult patients who are eligible to participate in clinical trials. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The next criterion is the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Patients with an ECOG performance status of less than 2 should be included.

            "I'm glad you agree. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Female patients of childbearing potential should use highly effective birth control methods. This is necessary to prevent potential risks to the fetus and ensure safety during the study period. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The last criterion for inclusion is that participants must be willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study. Informed consent is a fundamental ethical requirement in clinical research to ensure that participants are fully aware of the study procedures, risks, and benefits.

            "Wonderful! We have successfully designed the inclusion criteria. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Are you ready to proceed?",
            "Great. The first exclusion criterion is that patients who have participated in another clinical trial with any investigational agents within 30 days prior to study entry or 5 half lives of the study drug should be excluded. This is to prevent potential confounding effects of previous investigational treatments on the study outcomes. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The next criterion is the presence of medical or psychological conditions that would prevent the participant from understanding or signing the informed consent. We need to exclude patients who may not be able to fully comprehend the study procedures or provide informed consent. What do you think about this criterion?",

The next exclusion criterion is a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Fibroblast Activating Protein Inhibitor or other agents used in the study. This is to prevent potential allergic reactions or adverse events in patients with known sensitivities. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The next criterion is the inability to remain still for the entire duration of the exam. Patient cooperation and the ability to remain still are essential for the success of imaging procedures. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. The next criterion is life expectancy. Patients with a life expectancy of less than 6 months should be excluded. This is because patients with a short life expectancy may not benefit significantly from the diagnostic test, and their inclusion may introduce bias in the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The next exclusion criterion is the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Patients with an ECOG performance status greater than 2 should be excluded. Patients with poor performance status may not tolerate the diagnostic test well and may provide unreliable results. What do you think about this criterion?",

First, we should state the research question, which can be developed using PICO format as follows: 1. Patients with serious and persistent mental illness 2. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention 3. Study site: inpatient hospital or residential SMI treatment facilities.\nThe next step is to develop a study timeline detailing the study duration, which may look similar to this: 10 weeks inpatient treatment followed by 12 weeks outpatient track for 4 groups\nThe treatment phase will include a pretest/baseline assessment to establish a control data set, and a post-intervention assessment to measure the impact of the CoMBI-SMI intervention.\nWe will also include a follow-up assessment one and three months following treatment termination to measure the maintenance of any treatment gains.\nThe control data set is critical to ensure the reliability of the results. One control group is an active control condition - TAU, which will receive standard care, and one is a standard CBT control group, as this is the most common control condition used in similar types of studies.\nThe outcomes of interest are psychiatric symptoms as measured by the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and the Global Severity Index (GSI), as well as psychosocial functioning as measured by the Functioning Assessment Short Test for Adults (FAST) and the quality of life as measured by the World Health Organization Quality of Life - brief version (WHOQOL-BREF). Additionally, we will assess use of complementary and alternative medicines as indicated by the CAM Index.\nAnalysis will involve both within-subject and between-subject statistics to determine the effect of the intervention on the study outcomes. Descriptive statistics will be first reported and then we will use mixed model ANOVA to assess treatment group differences. We will likely need to adjust for the randomization sequence, since the groups will be cross-over, and for missing data.\nWe will likely use intention-to-treat analysis, since the groups will be fully randomly assigned and treated",

            "Great. One final criterion for inclusion in the study is that the patient must have a stable fracture with minimal displacement. This aims to ensure that the fracture is in a condition that's amenable to orthopedic intervention and 3D printing. Interested in hearing your thoughts on this.",
            "Great. So, these are the inclusion criteria for the study. Let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is a history of any contra-indications to surgery. This excludes patients who are not suitable for surgery due to conditions such as uncontrolled heart disease or heavy smokers, for example. Do you have any comments on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent, we can proceed. The exclusion criteria for this study include non-distal radius fractures, intra-articular fractures with external comminution, and fractures with mal-union or non-union. These criteria help to exclude participants who do not meet the specific criteria for the intended treatment group, ensuring that the results are as applicable to the population of interest as possible. Any thoughts on these exclusion criteria?",
            "Excellent. The next exclusion criterion is the presence of major concomitant injuries besides the radius fracture. This is to ensure that the effects of 3D printing are studied in isolation and the true effect of the intervention can be assessed. How about this criterion?",
            "The last exclusion criterion is that the patient has a history of systemic diseases that can alter wrist movements. This helps to avoid including patients with conditions that may affect the analysis of the effects of the intervention. Do you have any thoughts on this?",
            "Brilliant. The last exclusion criterion is the presence of concomitant ligament or tendon injuries. This excludes patients who may have other injuries that may confound the data on the effects of 3D printing on the distal radius fracture. Do you agree?",
            "The last exclusion criterion is the presence of open fractures with bone loss, shortening or deformities, or intra-articular injuries. These types of injuries can make the healing process more difficult and limit the effectiveness of the 3D printing intervention. Can you suggest any changes to this list of exclusion criteria? \u260e What do you think about the exclusion criteria, \ufb02ogDENz? \u260e 11.8.2 Eligibility Criteria and Inclusion Criteria for Phase II of the InvestiGene Study The inclusion and exclusion criteria in Phase II may be similar to those in Phase I, but may also include age, weight, and bone length. These criteria are listed below. Please correct or add to this list in the blanks provided. Please explain the rationale for these inclusion and exclusion criteria. Please discuss any alternative inclusions and exclusions that you would suggest. Please click on the circles next to the criteria in the list to fill in the blanks. - Adult - Age between 18 to 65 years old - BMI between 18 - 30 - No history of 3D printing technology experience - No previous surgical treatment of the wrist - Minimum bone length of the radius 40-50 mm (as measured by X-ray) \u00f7 \u00f7 The inclusion and exclusion criteria are very important because they determine who will or will not be allowed to participate in the study. These criteria ensure that the data collected will be as homogeneous and comparable as possible, and that the results are not biased by factors such as age, weight, or previous experience with 3D printing. The criteria were developed with the input of experts in the \ufb01eld and are based on previous research studies. Remember that as the project develops, the criteria may need to be revised or amended based on new information and feedback.",
            "And lastly, we have the exclusion criterion of no surgery on the wrist in the past 12 weeks. This ensures that the trialists are comparing like with like and that there are no confounding variables from past surgical interventions on the wrist. Does anything jump out at you that you would change or add? \u200b\nRemember, the goal of the exclusion and inclusion criteria is to ensure that the participants in the study are as similar as possible, and that the treatment or intervention being studied is working as expected on this group only. Any questions or feedback?",
            "Excellent. And the last exclusion criterion is age greater than 75 years due to increased risk of frailty and comorbidities, which can complicate the surgical procedure and post-operative healing. What do you think?",

Obtaining informed consent is essential in any clinical trial to ensure that participants understand the risks and benefits of the study and are willing to participate voluntarily. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Precisely. Moving on, we have the exclusion criterion of additional injuries to the hand and forearm, except for distal ulna fractures meeting specific criteria. This ensures that the study population is homogenous and that the effects of 3D printing on the distal radius fracture can be accurately assessed without interference from other injuries. What do you think?",

Excluding patients with these injuries helps ensure that the study results are not influenced by external factors that could affect the outcomes of the intervention. What are your thoughts on these criteria?",

Could you please briefly summarize the key points we've discussed so far? \u2726 The inclusion/exclusion criteria will include age, gender, genetic mutations, disease severity, medical history, and laboratory test results. \u2726 The inclusion criteria primarily focus on criteria related to disease severity and medical history, while the exclusion criteria focus on excluding participants with contraindications to the intervention. \u2726 A key criterion is the requirement for stable disease to ensure participant safety and to minimize the risk of adverse effects. Based on our discussion, the final inclusion/exclusion criteria have a total of 11 criteria. Would you like to review the final criteria before finalizing them? \u2726 \u2726 \u2726 \u2726 \u2726 Males or females aged 6-75 years with a confirmed genetic mutation targetable by the drug being studied. Have a body mass index between 18 and 29 with a body weight of >50 kg to 270 kg. Have an LVEF of >40 %. Are able to provide written informed consent. Have any significant medical conditions, including heart or lung disease, that may prelicate participation, as well as a medical history of allergies or contraindications to the specific treatment. Current pregnancy or breastfeeding status. Have any contraindications to blood sampling for genetic testing, such as those with abnormal clotting characteristics or autoimmune diseases. Have a history of organ transplantation or have received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant within the past 3 years.

Including caregivers may enhance the generalizability of the findings and provide important information about the potential impact of the intervention on caregivers' lives as well as participants'. Now that we've established the inclusion/exclusion criteria, we need to define the target population. Criteria for the target population are typically related to the characteristics of the study participants, and they are used to ensure that participants have sufficient uniformity on the variables of interest and to guide recruitment efforts. Let's return to the hypothetical example trial. The target of the intervention in this case is older adults with breast cancer who have completed chemotherapy within the preceding 8 weeks. The inclusion/exclusion criteria for the target population would include criteria related to the diagnosis of breast cancer and completed chemotherapy within the preceding 8 weeks. For example, the inclusion criterion could be breast cancer diagnosis, and the exclusion criterion could be breast cancer recurrence or metastasis. Let's discuss the other types of criteria that may be included in the protocol. The second type of criterion is called \"special selection.\" Special selection criteria refer to factors that may limit eligibility of a specific participant but are beyond the investigator's capability to change. They are also known as \"locked\" criteria. In contrast, \"open\" selection criteria, which may admit participants with these factors, are within the discretion of the investigator. For example, in the hypothetical trial, the special selection criterion might be the use of hormonal therapy for breast cancer. This criterion would exclude participants who are on hormonal therapy. The third type of criteria is \"open\" selection/exclusion criteria. \"Open\" criteria are those that the participant or caregiver can choose during the screening/recruitment process. For example, in the hypothetical trial, the open criterion might be the participant's preference for group therapy versus individual therapy. By specifying these criteria in the protocol, the investigator ensures that participants are not excluded from the study unfairly and that they are adequately screened for study eligibility. In summary, the inclusion/exclusion criteria are an important part of a clinical protocol.

So, let's move on to the next section - Study Design and Procedure. Please expound on the study design and procedure.\nThe study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that will randomize participants into two groups: one group will receive the intervention and the other will receive a placebo. The intervention or treatment group will apply the test serum to their affected scalps twice a day for 12 weeks, while the other group will receive a placebo only twice a day for 12 weeks. Assessments will be made by use of serial digital photographs and subjective assessments and adverse events. The primary endpoint will be the change in the severity of alopeciae from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints will include examination of hair follicles from a biopsy at baseline and at week 12 and examination of changes in adverse events. Sample size of 80 participants per group will be sufficient to detect a 1-standard-departure, within-group difference in the change from baseline to 12 weeks.

            "That's an important criterion, as patients who have a very low body weight may not be able to tolerate the interventions. Also, since a hysterectomy involves a surgical procedure, we should exclude individuals who have any contraindications to surgery.

Other than that, any other factor that may interfere with the conduct of the trial or the interpretation of the results should also be included in the exclusion criteria. \nI think that establishing clear inclusion and exclusion criteria is an important step in the planning of a clinical trial. It helps ensure that the trial is conducted in a well-defined population that is relevant to the research question, and reduces the likelihood of false negative or false positive results due to incorrect patient selection. In addition, it helps limit the number of participants who are screened and potentially subjected to risks or burdens associated with the trial, which can beresource- and time-consuming.

Here, you can see how the inclusion and exclusion criteria fit into the overall CONSORT diagram for the trial. Let's move on to the sample size calculation for this clinical trial. Based on previous studies, we know that there is a 20% chance that the true effect of PEMFS treatment is small, so we use a conservative approach and take into account a 10% chance that the trial will be stopped early due to futility. To detect a treatment effect of 20% in the per-protocol analyses (efficacy), we will need to enroll 820 patients. 20% chance of being wrong: 0.20 \u00d7 820 = 164 patients To detect a treatment effect of 20% in the intention-to-treat analyses (efficacy), we will need to enroll 540 patients 20% chance of being wrong: 0.20 \u00d7 540 = 107 patients For a 50% difference in the between-group number of participants in the safety group who drop out, we want the within-group dropout rate to be no greater than 0.25, so for the intention-to-treat analyses we need a minimum n of 540 / 0.75 = 744 20% chance of being wrong: 0.20 \u00d7 744 = 147 To sum up, we need 820 patients in the per-protocol analyses, for a 20% probability of the trial being stopped early due to futility, and 540 patients in the intention-to-treat analyses, for a 20% probability of the trial being stopped early for futility. To detect a treatment difference of 20% in the per-protocol analyses , including a 10% chance the study will be stopped early due to futility, we would need 820 patients 20% chance of being wrong: 0.20 \u00d7 820 = 164 For a treatment difference of 20% in the intention-to-treat analyses , including",

What should we include in the inclusion criteria to select the ideal participants for the study? \nHere are some typical inclusion criteria for a magnesium sulfate administration study:\nPatients undergoing an induced or elective cesarean delivery with a history of prior cesarean delivery and anticipated need for general anesthesia\nPatients undergoing an elective breast biopsy under local anesthesia\nPregnant women requiring induction of labour at 37 weeks of gestation\nPatients with less than 6 cm cervical dilation\nPatients with fetal malposition (occiput posterior, face/forehead presentation, breech presentation)\nPatients at low risk of pre-eclampsia, such as those without preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, placenta abruption, prolonged rupture of membrane, 1 prior cesarean delivery, previous classical or transverse scar, prior preterm birth, multi-gravidity, placenta previa on prior delivery, and history of fetal growth restriction\nPatients without contraindications to general anesthesia (e.g., prior head and neck surgery, prior GA, previous unconsciousness due to GA, untreated hypothyroidism, untreated Wolffe-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), morbid obesity)\nNow that we have established our inclusion and exclusion criteria, let's move on to the next step: deciding how many participants to include in the study. \nHow many participants should we enroll? Sample size analysis helps us determine this. In studies of surgical interventions, the sample size is typically based on the risk of mortality or the risk of an endpoint associated with the procedure. In this case, we are not planning to harm the patients, so we can set the risk at a lower level of",
            "That's a good idea. By excluding patients with liver failure, we can reduce the risk of adverse effects related to impaired liver function. Do you have anymore suggestions for exclusion criteria?",
            "That's an excellent suggestion. Excluding patients with glaucoma will help prevent potential eye complications and ensure the safety of participants. At this point, we've covered all the exclusion criteria and have a list of patients who should not be considered for the study. Now it's time to move on to the inclusion criteria. \nInclusion and exclusion criteria should be specific, measurable, and uniformly enforced so that eligible participants are readily identifiable. To proceed, what criteria should we include? \nThere should be at least 20 patients between 18 and 85 years of age who meet all the exclusion criteria. \nWe don't want to exclude any subgroups of patients; therefore, every population should be represented in the study. Ages 18 to 85 are inclusive of most populations, so we will stick to this range. We want to test the drug in a variety of patients, so we'll set the sample size to include both male and female participants. \nNo history of liver or kidney failure or glaucoma. All participants must be healthy enough to undergo the procedure and the procedures associated with the drug being studied. \nNo history of aneurysms or dissecting atherosclerotic aortic plaque. This will help ensure participants are safe to begin the study and continue as per study protocol\nOnce the exclusion criteria have been defined and agreed to by all, the inclusion criteria can be defined. \nInclusion criteria are statements that describe the patients that should be considered for the study.\nIn our example, the inclusion criteria would be 18-85 yo, both male and female, exclude liver and kidney failure, exclude patients with aneurysms and dissecting atherosclerotic aortic plaques.",

To increase the rate of participant enrollment, consider the following strategies. \u200d Ask your own network. Start by asking family, friends, and colleagues if they know anyone who may be interested in participating. You can also post on social media, your website, and in newsletters. \u200d Use incentives. Monetary incentives work well. You may be able to recruit more participants if you offer some sort of gift or free service. However, don't offer such enticements at a level that will bias your results. \u200d Advertise in the community. Place ads in newspapers, online, and on social media. Be clear that the study is research and explain why it's important. Don't use language that suggests the intervention will fix your problems. \u200d Recruit a diverse sample. Make sure that your sample represents the diversity of the population from which you will extrapolate your results. However, this can be difficult to accomplish if you don't have extensive community connections. \u200d Tailor the message to the audience. Use the audience's language and tailor the message to them.

            "That's a great point. Including other malignant diseases can provide valuable insights into the efficacy of the treatment beyond FL-HCC. Now, let's move on to the third criterion. It requires the presence of DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript, assessed by RNA-based next-generation sequencing or realtime-polymerase chain reaction amplification. This criterion ensures that the treatment is directed at the appropriate molecular target. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! It's crucial to target the specific molecular drivers of the disease to maximize the effectiveness of the treatment. Now, let's move on to the fourth criterion. It states that participants must be at least 18 years old. This is a standard criterion for adult clinical trials to ensure that participants are legally able to provide informed consent and understand the implications of the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Legal requirements and the ability to understand the implications of the trial are crucial factors to consider. Now, let's move on to the fifth criterion. It states that participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. This ensures that participants are well enough to undergo treatment and participate in the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! A good performance status is essential to ensure that participants can undergo the treatment without compromising their overall well-being. Now, let's move on to the sixth criterion. It requires participants to have measurable disease per iRECIST. This is necessary to assess the efficacy of the treatment and monitor the response to therapy. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Measurable disease allows for accurate assessment of treatment response and helps determine the clinical benefit of the intervention. Now, let's move on to the seventh criterion. It states that participants must have adequate organ function laboratory values. This criterion ensures that participants have sufficient organ function to tolerate the treatment and reduces the risk of adverse events. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Participant safety is of utmost importance in clinical trials, and adequate organ function is a key factor to consider. Now, let's move on to the eighth criterion. It requires a negative SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test. This criterion is necessary to protect participants from potential exposure to COVID-19, especially considering the immunosuppressive nature of the treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Participant safety should always be a top priority, and taking precautions against COVID-19 is crucial in the current environment. Now, let's move on to the ninth criterion. It states that female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of childbearing potential must agree to the use of contraception. This is important to prevent potential harm to a fetus during treatment with investigational drugs. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Protecting potential pregnancies is crucial, and appropriate contraception measures are necessary to minimize any risks. Now, let's move on to the tenth criterion. It states that participants should either be postmenopausal or provide evidence of non-childbearing status. This further ensures the safety of potential pregnancy during the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Ensuring the safety of potential pregnancies is crucial, and this criterion provides an extra layer of protection. Now that we've discussed all the inclusion criteria, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Are you ready to proceed?",
            "Great! Let's start with the first exclusion criterion. It states that pregnant or breastfeeding individuals cannot participate in the trial. This criterion is essential to protect the health of the fetus or newborn from potential harm due to the investigational treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Protecting the health of both the participant and the fetus or newborn is of utmost importance. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. It states that participants should be willing and able to follow the study schedule. This criterion ensures that participants can adhere to the protocol requirements and complete the trial as intended. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Participant compliance with the study schedule is essential for obtaining valid results and maintaining the overall success of the trial. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have received chemotherapy, systemic therapy, or radiotherapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of the study drug. This criterion reduces the risk of drug interactions and ensures that participants are not receiving other treatments that may confound the results of the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Minimizing potential confounding factors is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable trial results. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have received any immunotherapy agents within 28 days prior to the dosing of the study drug. This criterion is important to avoid interference with the study treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Avoiding any potential interference with the study treatment is crucial for obtaining reliable results. Now, let's move on to the fifth exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have a known sensitivity or history of allergic reactions to the investigational drugs. This criterion protects participants from potential harm due to known allergies or sensitivities to the study drugs. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Participant safety should always be a top priority, and excluding individuals with known allergies or sensitivities is a necessary precaution. Now, let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have a history of autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency. These criteria are important to exclude individuals who may have conditions that could be exacerbated by the immunotherapy treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Excluding individuals with autoimmune diseases or immunodeficiencies is necessary to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and ensure participant safety. Now, let's move on to the seventh exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have symptomatic interstitial lung disease or brain metastases. These criteria exclude participants with conditions that may complicate or worsen during the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Excluding participants with symptomatic interstitial lung disease or brain metastases is crucial to minimize potential complications and maintain the integrity of the trial results. Now, let's move on to the eighth exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, and other conditions that may interfere with the trial. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Participant safety should always be a top priority, and excluding individuals with uncontrolled intercurrent illness is crucial to minimize potential complications. Now, we have discussed all the criteria for both inclusion and exclusion. Shall I provide you with the full criteria we have designed?",
            "Here are the full criteria we have designed for the clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n2. Histologically confirmed FL-HCC or other malignant disease that is locally advanced or metastatic.\n3.

            "Great. How about the second exclusion criterion: rebleeding during surgery. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The third exclusion criterion is failed surgery. Patients who experience a failed surgery are excluded because the suture material may have contributed to the failure. Including these participants could introduce bias. What are your thoughts on that criterion?",

This will help to reduce any confusion or delay in the enrollment process. Great point! Now let's talk about the exclusion criteria.",
            "Including caregivers who report primary responsibility for child feeding outside of childcare is certainly a relevant criterion. This criterion will allow us to examine the ways in which parents/caregivers influence their child's eating habits when they are not in a childcare setting. It will be helpful to understand how we can support parents/caregivers to continue this influence outside of the childcare setting. Excellent addition!",

We will include this criterion in the final version of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.",
            "Excluding participants who are under the age of 18 is important to ensure that they have the capacity to provide informed consent.  This criterion will eliminate individuals who are minors or young adults, who may not be legally able to provide consent for themselves. It also ensuns they are old enough to understand the study procedures and be able to participate in the study. Excellent choice!",

            "Excellent. Let's continue with the remaining inclusion criteria:\n\n3. Patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission: This criterion ensures that patients who require ICU care are included in the study, as fluid resuscitation may play a crucial role in their stabilization and outcomes. Patients who don't require ICU admission may not be at a level of care where fluid resuscitation would affect their outcomes significantly. \n4. Patient age between 12-18 years old: This criterion excludes patients under 12 years old as their bodies and metabolism differ from adults, which may alter the effects of fluid resuscitation. Patients above 18 years old are considered to have fully developed bodies and are more representative of the general population, so including them is important for generalizability of the study's results. Do you have any other thoughts about the inclusion criteria?",
            "Excellent. And lastly,\n\n4. Age < 18 or > 75: Excluding patients under 18 or over 75 years of age ensures that we have a more homogeneous patient population. Older patients may have pre-existing medical conditions that can influence outcomes, while younger patients may have a better ability to tolerate fluid resuscitation. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I fully agree. So, these are the inclusion criteria, now let's discuss the exclusion criteria:\n\n1. Less than 2% total body surface area (TBSA) involvement: Excluding patients with less than 2% TBSA involvement helps prevent including patients with minor burns or superficial injuries that may not benefit from fluid resuscitation. \n2. Patients with fluid replacement and burn size less than 600 ml: These criteria help ensure that the patients are nearing the maximum fluid capacity and require additional fluid rather than fluid replacement. \n3. Patients less than 16 years old: The age restriction helps ensure that children, who often have a higher volume of extracellular fluid relative to their body weight and a less efficient capillary filtration coefficient, do not participate in the trial. \n4. Preexisting co-morbidities: Excluding patients with preexisting co-morbidities helps avoid enrolling patients with other significant medical conditions that may confound the trial results. \n5. Women within 6 weeks of potential pregnancy and men within 6 months of potential pregnancy: Excluding patients who may be pregnant helps avoid confounding trial results by excluding potential gender or hormonal differences that may be influenced by pregnancy. \nSo, that concludes our discussion on inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria helped us eliminate patients that may be either too healthy or too sick, too young or too old, with too little or too much fluidloss, with preexisting diseases or conditions that may influence the results or who may conceive during the study period.",
            "Excellent! Let's continue with the remaining exclusion criteria:\n2. History of fluid administration within the first 12 hours of admission: Fluid given within the first 12 hours of admission may affect the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels, complicating the assessment of the impact of fluid resuscitation. Excluding patients who received fluid within the first 12 hours of admission helps ensure a cleaner baseline for analysis. How do you feel about this criterion?",

Now, let's add these criteria to our inclusion and exclusion criteria grid using the following template:\nInclude (check)\nExclude (X)\nCriterion #1:\nBurns < 24 hours old\nAll other patients\nCriterion #2:\nPatients who are hypersensitive to Albumin\nIn sum, we included patients who have burns less than 24 hours old and excluded patients who are hypersensitive to Albumin. By doing so, we can obtain a study population that's more homogeneous and better suited to test the effects of fluid resuscitation on a specific population. In essence, the inclusion and exclusion criteria help us select the most appropriate patients for the study and minimize the impact of potential confounding factors.",

Albumin is a safe and well-tolorated treatment, but patients with certain medical conditions may be at risk for complications or contraindications to treatment. Excluding these patients helps protect them from potential risks while still allowing the study to focus on the intervention of interest. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "You're right. Let's move on to the next criterion:\n5. Pregnant patients: Pregnant patients may have a different fluid responsiveness and fluid balance than non-pregnant patients. Excluding them helps focus on the effectiveness of the intervention in patients who are more similar to those who would typically receive the intervention in practice. What do you think about this criterion?",

Patients with known Co-morbidities: Patients with co-morbidities may affect fluid requirements and responses to fluid resuscitation. Excluding these patients helps ensure a more homogeneous study population. What do you think about this criterion?",

With all of the exclusion criteria discussed, let's move on to the inclusion criteria for the study.\nInclusion Criteria\nNow that we've discussed the exclusion criteria, let's discuss the inclusion criteria for the study. The inclusion criteria should include:\n1. Adult patients over 18 years old with a body surface area greater than 10% total burned area. Examples of burn area calculation methods include the Logan (% total body surface area = [body surface in cm2] x 8.365), the Cumberland (% total body surface area = [body surface in cm2] x 6), or the Calculator (Clinical TBSA Estimation Calculator) online tool.\n2. Burns received within the last 7 days.\n3. No previous episode of cardiac arrest.\n4. Consent ability and ability to understand instructions.\n5. No previous fluid resuscitation within the last 24 hours.\n6. No allergies to Albumin or any of its components.\n7. Body temperature between 38\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F and 104\u00b0F).\nIn cases where there is uncertainty about the inclusion criteria, a case conference should be held to determine whether the patient is eligible for the study or not.\nDuring the case conference, the potential inclusion criteria must outweigh the potential exclusion criteria. For instance, if a patient has a history of asthma and is taking a medication that may affect hemodynamics, they may still be included in the study if the potential benefit of fluid resuscitation outweighs the potential risk of the medication interaction.\nLet's consider two examples to further understand the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nSample Exclusion Criteria:\n1. No recent surgery within the last 7 days (excluding routine dental surgery)\n2. Not bed-rest\n3. No history of renal or liver disease\n4. No history of metabolic diseases such as diabetes or electrolyte disorders\n5. No history of psychiatric disease\nSample Inclusion Criteria:\n1. Burns received within the last 7 days\n2.

This may be included to ensure that participants have access to healthcare services and can continue to receive necessary care throughout the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is that participants should be able to keep a lying position during the entire procedure. This is necessary as the procedure involves lying still for an extended period of time, and movement could affect the accuracy of the treatment delivery. What do you think?",
            "Great. The second criterion is that participants should not be under any law restrictions. This is to ensure that participants are able to provide informed consent and comply with the requirements of the study. Shall we include this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The last criterion for exclusion is that pregnant women or breastfeeding individuals should not participate. This is important to protect the health of the fetus or infant, as radiation therapy can be harmful during pregnancy or breastfeeding. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Based on our conversation, here are the complete inclusion and exclusion criteria for your trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria: \n1. 18 years old or older\n2. Diagnosed with prostate, kidney, cervix, head and neck cancer, or glioblastoma\n3. Indication of external radiotherapy\n4. Treated with the Linac UNITY MRI guided radiotherapy at the centre hospitalier Lyon Sud des Hospices Civils de Lyon\n5. Agreement of the patient to participate\n6. Affiliated to a social security system\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Patient unable to keep a lying position during all the procedure\n2. Patient under law restriction\n3.

            "That's right. And for the third criterion, we require that participants have a confirmed diagnosis of mCRPC. Do you have any ideas about what this should entail?",
            "That's right. Excellent. Another criterion is that all participants should have an Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Can you share your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Yes, it's crucial to obtain pre-screening imaging to confirm the presence of metastases at the time of enrollment.  The next criterion is that patients should have life-limiting, rapidly progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer. Can you share your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Good point. The next exclusion criterion is that patients currently treated with investigational medicinal products. What are your thoughts on this criterion ?",
            "That makes sense. So the investigator should ensure that the study population is as homogeneous as possible to assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug. The next exclusion criterion states that patients should not have received steroids within 14 days of study enrollment. Can you explain this requirement?",
            "That makes sense. Let's move on to the last criterion, which is that of no current treatment-associated toxicities except for non-significant adverse events at a grade 1 or 2. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Correct. The surgical procedure must be well recovered from before starting the study medication to avoid any potential risks. Now, let's discuss the last criterion, which is men who are not willing to use condoms during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

DOES THE IDEA SOUND FAMILIAR? SO, LET'S CONTUE. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are simply the criteria used to determine who can and cannot participate in a clinical research study. Your inclusion and exclusion criteria should be clear, specific, and transparent. Your protocol should list both\u2014-what characteristics do you want to include and what characteristics do you want to exclude? For each inclusion criterion, you should justify your choice clearly and transparently. For example, if you want to include patients age 25 to 50 years old, you should explain why this range is important. You should also discuss why you will not include individuals with certain exclusion criteria such as orthodontic or endodontic treatment, tooth replacement, or other. The inclusion-exclusion criteria are an important part of the scientific rigor of your study. SOME OF YOU MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THE INCLUSION-EXCLUSION CRITERIA YOU CHOOOSE WILL MEAN YOU MISS OUT ON RECRUITING ENOUGH PARTICIPANTS. I GENERALLY TELL MY STUDENTS THAT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A RELIABLE, THOROUGHLY VETTED SAMPLE THAN TO HAVE TOO MANY PARTICIPANTS. THE RESEARCH PI IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTIMATING THE REQUISITE PARTICIPANT NUMBERS FOR THEIR STUDY UPFRONT. The inclusion-exclusion criteria are an important part of ensuring the soundness of your study. Remember: the goal is to recruit a reliable, thorough sample, not the largest sample possible. WHAT IF YOU DON'T KNO",
            "That's certainly a valid criterion! Excluding individuals with advanced substance loss or deep margins will help ensure that the study results are not skewed by these conditions. Do you have any final suggestions for inclusion/exclusion criteria? \nAlthough a large range of inclusion/exclusion criteria may be developed, a well-formulated maximum of 10-15 criteria is reasonable. A longer list of criteria will compromise the external validity of the study, as only highly motivated individuals will be available for study. Conversely, an overly short list of criteria will result in an arbitrary decision as to the \"extent\" of inclusion or exclusion.\nIt is also important to identify what treatment(s) will or will not be provided during the study. There can be a fine line between selecting a healthy population and performing an inappropriate procedure (e.g., unnecessary extensive restorations in a fixed partial denture) or performing a treatment that cannot be justified (e.g., unnecessary surgical extractions of healthy permanent teeth in a healthy individual requiring a tooth-replacement prosthesis).\nThe inclusion/exclusion criteria do not need to be all-inclusive. Rather, the goal is simply to guide the subject recruitment process by identifying the \"typical\" patient who can benefit from the treatment being investigated.\nLastly, inclusion and exclusion criteria are not static but rather dynamic during the course of a treatment protocol. As the need for or anticipated benefits of a treatment change over time, the inclusion and exclusion criteria may need to be re-evaluated.",

Lastly, we have the fourth criterion: \"Psychological factors that would preclude comprehension of material or full participation in the study as determined by the investigators\". This criterion aims to ensure that participants are able to fully engage with the intervention and provide accurate data. Participants with psychological factors that may affect their comprehension or participation may not benefit from the intervention or may skew the results of the study. What do you think about this criterion?",

            "Excellent! Let's continue with the criteria. How about including patients with a low-to-intermediate pre-test probability of disease? This will ensure that we only enroll participants with coronary artery disease, minimizing inclusion of healthy volunteers. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! The criteria are now finalized. You've done a great job! Now we can use them to develop a list of inclusion and exclusion criteria that will help us identify the eligible participants for our study.",

            "Great, let's continue. The next criterion could be including only those participants with confirmed or suspected coronary artery disease, based on medical history, clinical presentation, or electrocardiogram findings, or abnormal cardiac stress test results (e.g., angina or myocardial ischemia). This will ensure a study population with a high likelihood of having coronary artery disease, which is essential to the study's objective. Do you agree?",
            "So far, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are sound. Let's continue. We can also consider excluding patients who are on anti-platelet or anticoagulation therapy before study enrollment, as these factors can affect the results of diagnostic tests. Do you agree?",
            "That makes sense. Our final exclusion criterion is patients with no legally accepted indication for coronary angiography, such as asymptomatic patients. This exclusion criterion makes sure that the study population only includes patients with clear indications for undergoing angiography. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Great. Let's continue with the last criteria. Patients with acute pulmonary embolism or severe aortic regurgitation should also be excluded. Acute pulmonary embolism can influence the accuracy of diagnostic tests and severe aortic regurgitation can affect cardiac output and blood flow, so both are important to exclude. Your thoughts on these last two criterion?",
            "I agree. Lastly, patients with pre-excitation syndrome should also be excluded. This is because these syndromes can interfere with the evaluation of coronary artery disease using standard angiographic techniques, so these patients should be excluded. What do you think?",
            "I agree. Finally, we should also exclude patients with a known history of allergy or hypersensitivity to clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a medication commonly used to prevent blood clots, but allergic reactions to it can be serious and even life-threatening. Excluding such patients will help ensure the safety of all study participants. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent! With one more criterion left, I think we've covered all the important factors to consider. The last criterion we should consider is the number of patients expected to enroll. Based on the study timeline and number of patients needed per arm, how many patients are expected to enroll?",
            "I agree that incomplete IVUS coverage can compromise the quality of the data, so excluding patients with these findings is a wise choice. These are all of the exclusion criteria I am considering for our study. Do you have any final thoughts or modifications you would like to make to our list?"

This is essential to ensure that they fully understand the study procedures, risks, and benefits, and voluntarily agree to participate. What are your thoughts on including this criterion?",
            "I fully agree with you. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Considering the study's focus on assessing coronary artery lesions, it would be appropriate to include patients with intermediate coronary lesions, specifically those with diameter stenosis between 30% and 80% as visually estimated from coronary angiography. This will allow for a diverse and clinically relevant study population. What do you think?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion we can consider is excluding patients who are ineligible for diagnostic intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or fractional flow reserve (FFR) examination. These diagnostic tests are essential for the study, so we need to ensure that participants can undergo them. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. Patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting of the interrogated vessels should be excluded. Previous bypass surgery could affect the accuracy of the diagnostic tests being evaluated in the study, so excluding these patients helps ensure the reliability of the results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I completely agree with you. Moving on to the next criterion, we should exclude patients who have had a myocardial infarction within 72 hours of coronary angiography. Recent myocardial infarction could confound the results of the diagnostic tests, so excluding these patients helps minimize potential bias. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Well said. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. Patients with severe heart failure should be excluded. Severe heart failure can cause hemodynamic instability, which could affect the accuracy of the diagnostic tests. Excluding these patients will help ensure the safety and validity of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree with you. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion. Patients with serum creatinine levels greater than 150 umol/L or glomerular filtration rates less than 45 ml/kg/1.73 m2 should be excluded. Impaired renal function could impact the use of contrast agents and adenosine during the diagnostic tests, so excluding patients with renal dysfunction helps minimize potential risks. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. Patients with known allergies to the contrast agent or adenosine should be excluded. Allergic reactions to these agents could pose a safety risk during the diagnostic tests, so it's best to prevent such adverse events by excluding patients with known allergies. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I fully agree with you. We're almost done with the criteria design. The next criterion we should consider is excluding patients with a life expectancy of less than 2 years. Patients with limited life expectancy may not benefit from the study procedures, so it's best to focus our resources on participants who are more likely to benefit. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Lastly, let's discuss the final exclusion criteria. Patients with an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) pullback that does not cover the entire lesion should be excluded. Complete imaging of the target lesion is necessary for accurate assessment, so excluding patients with incomplete IVUS coverage helps ensure the quality of the data. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree with you. We have now completed the design of all the criteria for your clinical trial. Here is a summary of the full criteria:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, or after the acute phase of myocardial infarction\n2. Age \u226518 years\n3. Written informed consent\n4.

            "Alright. And finally, for the last exclusion criterion, we may want to exclude obese patients due to space limitations in the breathing circuit. Large patients may have trouble fitting into the equipment we will be using, so excluding them ensures our safety and prevents any discomfort or harm to the patients. Can we include \"patient who is obese\" as the eighth exclusion criterion?",

            "Alright. Could you also tell me the study type and phase of the trial?",
            "Thank you for providing that information. Now, let's start with the inclusion criteria. Based on the details you've given me, here's what I suggest for the inclusion criteria: Firstly, the participants should be male or female who are 18 years old or above at the time of inclusion. This is to ensure that they are legally able to provide informed consent. What do you think?",
            "Great! Now, moving on to the second inclusion criterion. Since the trial is focused on pulmonary health parameters and cardiac output monitoring, it would be appropriate to include patients currently admitted in the ICU who are indicated for cardiac output monitoring using a pulmonary artery catheter. Additionally, they should require pressure or volume controlled mechanical ventilation using an ETT. This will ensure that the participants have the specific medical conditions and treatment requirements necessary for the study. What do you think?",
            "Perfect. Now, for the third inclusion criterion, it's important to obtain signed and dated informed consent from the participants. This ensures that they fully understand the study procedures, risks, and benefits before agreeing to participate. Can we include \"provision of signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) by the patient or a trusted person\" as the third inclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the information provided, we can establish the first exclusion criterion as \"male or female under the age of 18 years old at the time of screening.\" This is to protect minors who may not fully understand the risks and benefits of participating in the study. What are your thoughts?",
            "Alright. For the second exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients who are under guardianship. Since patients under guardianship may not be able to provide informed consent for themselves, it's important to ensure that all participants are able to make their own decisions about participation. Can we include \"patient under guardianship\" as the second exclusion criterion?",
            "Good. Now, for the third exclusion criterion, it is suggested to exclude patients who require tidal volumes of less than 250cc. This is to ensure that the participants have similar baseline characteristics and are receiving standard mechanical ventilation settings. Patients requiring very low tidal volumes may have different physiological responses that could confound the study results. Shall we include \"patient who requires tidal volumes of less than 250cc\" as the third exclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on, for the fourth exclusion criterion, it would be appropriate to exclude pregnant patients. Pregnancy can affect pulmonary health parameters and introduce confounding variables, so excluding pregnant patients helps to ensure that the study results are not influenced by this factor. Can we include \"pregnancy\" as the fourth exclusion criterion?",
            "Very well. Now, for the fifth exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients whose care requires the use of an anesthetic conserving device. The use of such devices may impact pulmonary health parameters and could interfere with the study results. Shall we include \"patient whose care requires the use of an anesthetic conserving device\" as the fifth exclusion criterion?",
            "Perfect. Let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion. It is suggested to exclude patients whose care requires a closed-loop ventilator. Closed-loop ventilators may have different settings and mechanisms compared to standard mechanical ventilation, potentially affecting the study outcomes. Shall we include \"patient whose care requires a closed-loop ventilator\" as the sixth exclusion criterion?",
            "Great. Now, for the seventh exclusion criterion, it is important to exclude patients who are unable to tolerate a transient increase in inhaled CO2. Some patients may have underlying conditions that make them more sensitive to changes in CO2 levels, so excluding them ensures their safety. Can we include \"patient who is unable to tolerate a transient increase in inhaled CO2\" as the seventh exclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent. Finally, for the eighth exclusion criterion, it is advisable to exclude patients who are unable to tolerate a transient inhalation of N2O or are contraindicated to N2O use. This exclusion helps to ensure the safety of participants by excluding those who may have adverse reactions to N2O. Can we include \"patient who is unable to tolerate a transient inhalation of N2O or is contraindicated to N2O use\" as the eighth exclusion criterion?",

            "Excellent! The last inclusion criterion I'd suggest is to include patients who are expected to undergo a general anesthetic for their surgery. This is because dexmedetomidine and esketamine may interact with general anesthetics, so it's important to exclude patients who will not receive a general anesthetic. What do you think?",
            "Perfect, those are the inclusion criteria. It seems like we've covered all the important points. Are there any other criteria you think should be included?",
            "Perfect. I would also suggest excluding patients with severe sleep disorders. Severe sleep disorders can affect drug response and general well-being, which may influence the treatment outcome. Should we include this as an exclusion criterion?",
            "Brilliant! And lastly, we should exclude patients with a history of drug abuse or dependent or with psychiatric disorders that may cause sedation. This ensures compliant and safe study conduct. Do you agree?",
            "Excellent! You've got it! The last criterion I suggest is to exclude patients who are allergic to dexmedetomidine, which is one of the study drugs, as allergic reactions can be severe. Is that a good criterion to include?",
            "Excellent! And lastly, should patients with a recent history of opioid or benzodiazepine use be excluded? These substances can alter sleep quality and affect the results of the study. 3DChatDoctor, what do you think? 3DChatDoctor 3DDoctor: I agree with all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria you have mentioned so far. As a rule of thumb, I would always include any medical condition that may influence the results of the study such as illnesses that can alter sleep quality and drugs that may alter the efficacy of the intervention. Do you have any more criteria to add? 3DDoctor 3DDoctor: No, I believe we have included all the essential criteria. 3DDoctor 3DDoctor: Great! Now it's time to specify the number of patients required in each group. How many patients should we include in each group? 3DDoctor: The number of patients depends on the effect size you are trying to detect, the statistical power of your study, and other factors such as dropout rate, potential side effects, and ethical constraints. We could discuss these in more detail during the informed consent process. But as a starting point, you should aim to recruit at least 20 patients per group to detect a difference of 4-5 points in the endpoint of interest with a power of 80% and a 10% dropout rate. 3DDoctor 3DDoctor: That seems reasonable to me. How about inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study site? What criteria do you think should be included? 3DDoctor 3DDoctor: Generally, the study should be carried out in an accredited site that has the appropriate equipment and trained staff and investigators to perform the study procedures. You should also include a list of exclusions such as sites that have poor accessibility, unstable patient populations, or weak leadership that might compromise the quality of the study. 3DDoctor 3DDoctor: So for example, a site with weak leadership or poor accessibility would be excluded, while an accredited site with appropriate equipment and trained staff would be a possible study site. Any other criteria we should consider? 3DLayperson 3DDoctor: It's always a good idea to include a list of exclusion",

Firstly, we should exclude patients who are not suitable for nasal administration due to nasal cavity diseases such as rhinitis or nasal polyps. Nasal cavity diseases can affect drug absorption and distribution, which could potentially confound the results. What do you think?",

I suggest excluding patients with preoperative LVEF less than 30%, sick sinus syndrome, severe sinus bradycardia, or atrioventricular block of degree II or higher without a pacemaker. These conditions may increase the risk of cardiovascular events with the study drugs. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! The next criterion is excluding patients with severe liver dysfunction, severe renal dysfunction, or an American Society of Anesthesiologists classification of IV or higher. These patients may have altered drug metabolism or be at increased risk of adverse events. Should we exclude them?",
            "Great! We're almost there. I suggest excluding patients who are allergic to dexmedetomidine and/or esketamine, or those who have other conditions that are considered unsuitable for study participation. Allergic reactions can be severe and life-threatening, so it's reasonable to exclude patients with known allergies. What do you think?",

            "Outstanding. And there you have it, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for your clinical trial. Did you follow along so far? This process can seem daunting at first, but with practice and a structured approach, it becomes second nature. Now that you have your inclusion and exclusion criteria, we can move on to the next step: the objective of the clinical trial. The objective of a clinical trial is to address one or more specific questions about the safety and efficacy of a treatment intervention by comparing it to a standard of care or placebo. It should be measurable, meaning it can be quantified and directly observed over the course of the trial. An example of an objective may be to evaluate the rate of bone regeneration in patients who receive a certain bone graft vs. those who do not. In this case, we can measure bone regeneration by taking serial X-rays over the course of the trial. The objective should always be clearly stated, specific, measurable, and outcomes should be pre-specified and feasible. Once your objective has been established and your inclusion and exclusion criteria are ready, the last important part of defining your protocol is to decide how many participants you hope to enroll in your clinical trial. Setting a target enrollment number can help ensure the study is completed within a reasonable timeframe and on budget. Keep in mind that under-enrolling is preferable to over-enrolling, as doing so may lead to negative consequences such as delayed publication of data or lost study subjects who may not receive the treatment being studied. A rough rule of thumb is to plan to have between 20%-30% overlap between your estimated enrollment and actual enrollment for any given point in the study. As the study progresses and you learn more, you might revise your enrollment targets accordingly. So, how many participants do you think you will need to enroll in your clinical trial? Remember to consider the characteristics of your target patient population in your calculation. For example, if your patient population has a 20% annual loss to follow-up rate, you should plan to enroll 80% of your target enrollment number just to compensate for those who don't complete the study. This may seem wasteful, but it ensures your study is successful. Don't forget to allow some slack time into your target enrollment schedule"

Myofascial Pain Syndrome (MPS) is an umbrella term used to describe a spectrum of pain conditions that are characterized by localized muscle pain and tenderness in one area of the body. These pain conditions can be caused by a trigger point or \u2018\u2019knot' in the muscle, which is a restricted area within a fibrous band of muscle that can be felt as a tough, rope-like band under the skin in tension. Can you please confirm that this is the correct criterion?",

What do you think about excluding family members who already participate in a structured caregiving program?",
            "Good idea. Based on the information provided, it appears that the inclusion criteria are ready to be finalized. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria.

Can you walk me through the questionnaire items for each of these measures? \ud83d\udc4d [Clarification: I will walk through the items for the first outcome measure, caregiver burden, which will be administered before the intervention. For the second outcome measure, the questionnaire items will be similar but slightly different depending on the stage of the disease you are evaluating. I'll provide the items for the second outcome measure after we have established the items for the first measure.] First, I will ask caregivers to assess their level of burden in the form of a multi-item scale. Caregivers will respond to questions such as \"How much do you agree with the following statements? During the past month, caregiving for your family member or friend has been a burden to you.\" The questions will measure the caregiver's feelings of burden and sacrifice and stress levels. To what extent did providing care interfere with your own personal \u230atask/obligations/leisure activities? To what extent has caregiving for your \u230afamily member or friend\u230b affected your work or school responsibilities? To what extent has caring for your family member or friend put a strain on your marriage or other relationships? Then they will provide a numerical rating for each statement, as well as an overall score to measure their burden. \ud83d\udc4d Sounds like a sensitive and relevant measure. Now, let's proceed to the items for the second measure, the care recipient's quality of life. The care recipient will be asked to assess their quality of life using a questionnaire that includes questions such as \"How much would you agree with the following statements? Your role as the care recipient has caused you much stress or anxiety.\" The questions will assess the recipient's feelings of disability, self worth, dignity, and physical pain. In addition, the survey will measure the care recipient's perception of the burden on the family caregivers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the family member or friend helping you is a great hard",

Patients with any of the following cardiac comorbidities: uncontrolled hypertension, acute or chronic ischemic heart disease, acute or chronic pulmonary disease, or valvular pathologies: This criterion is important to exclude the impact of traditional cardiac risk factors and comorbidities that might confound the results of the study. We want to focus on the impact of AVF on the heart in patients with ESRD.\n2. Pregnant or breastfeeding women: Considering the use of AVF in dialysis patients, excluding women in the fertile age (15-45 years old) might reduce the number of participants and compromise the generalizability of the results. However, including this criterion would pose additional logistical and ethical challenges, such as contraception in women of childbearing age.\n3. Current alcohol or drug abuse: This criterion is important to ensure a safe research environment and to avoid possible confounding factors that might interfere with the results of the study. However, considering that abstinence is a criterion for kidney transplantation, excluding patients with a history of substance abuse might further limit the study population, especially in areas with a high prevalence of kidney disease.\n4. Patients with a known malignant neoplastic disease: As this study aims to investigate the impact of AVF on cardiac structure and function, excluding patients with a history of malignant neoplasm might pose additional safety concerns and might also limit the generalizability of the results.\n5.

High output states such as hyperthyroidism: Excluding patients with high output states such as hyperthyroidism is necessary as these conditions can impact cardiac structure and function independent of AVF. By excluding such patients, the study can more accurately assess the specific impact of AVF on the heart.\n\n3. Basic heart diseases (cardiomyopathy, severe valvular disease, intracardiac shunting, constrictive pericarditis, post heart transplant, etc.): Excluding patients with basic heart diseases is important to ensure that the study focuses specifically on the impact of AVF on the heart in patients with ESRD.

Because the average time from diagnosis to surgery in glioblastoma is relatively short, we can consider using a time cut-off to ensure that patients are available for the study. Therefore, I recommend including only patients with no more than 3-month time since diagnosis. 3 months seems like a reasonable cut-off, as it would ensure patients have enough time to get used to brain MRIs and have had enough time to undergo the MVP test.

            "That sounds reasonable. Including only adult patients will help us focus on the metabolic MR-PET and tissue measures of glycolysis in brain tumors, which may not be applicable to pediatric patients. Now, let's move on to the next inclusion criterion. Should we include only patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma?",
            "That makes sense. By including these patients, we can correlate the imaging measurements with tissue measures in tumor areas selected for bulk resection surgery. Now, let's discuss the exclusion criteria. Should we exclude patients who cannot obtain an MRI or FDG PET scan with contrast?",
            "Exactly. These imaging techniques are crucial for measuring glycolysis in brain tumors, and excluding patients who cannot undergo these scans will ensure that we gather the necessary data for the study. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion. Should we exclude patients with ferromagnetic implanted devices that might produce a safety hazard?",
            "Absolutely. MRI scans can pose risks to individuals with certain implanted devices, and excluding such patients will minimize potential safety hazards. Now, for the final exclusion criterion, should we exclude subjects with severe claustrophobia or severely compromised renal function?",
            "I completely agree. Severe claustrophobia can impact the quality of MRI scans, which are essential for our study. Additionally, compromised renal function can affect the administration of contrast agents used in imaging techniques. By excluding these patients, we ensure the accuracy and safety of the study results."

This exclusion criterion ensures that the effects of pain management interventions do not influence the study results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Recurrent strokes can complicate the interpretation of experimental findings, so excluding participants with second or subsequent strokes helps to simplify the analysis. The next criterion is spasticity of the lower limbs. Excluding spastic participants helps to control for any potential confounding factors that may arise from muscle contractions. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Good thinking! By excluding participants with strokes in the brainstem and cerebellum, we can isolate the effects of proprioception deficits on gait and balance in other regions of the brain. Finally, let's discuss the last exclusion criterion: neurodegenerative diseases. What do you think about excluding participants with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis?",
            "Great idea! Excluding participants with epilepsy helps to minimize the impact of potential confounds related to this condition. Our sixth and final exclusion criterion is participants with neurodegenerative disorders. Excluding participants with neurodegenerative disorders helps to minimize confounds related to these conditions and focus on the effects of proprioception on gait and balance in acute stroke patients. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Finally, what about the last exclusion criterion: visual or audiovisual impairment? Excluding participants with visual or audiovisual impairments helps to exclude any confounds related to vision and hearing when assessing proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Excluding participants with other neurological, rheumatological, or orthopedic diseases will allow us to isolate the effects of stroke and proprioception deficits on gait and balance without the confounding effects of other conditions. Lastly, let's discuss the seventh exclusion criterion: pregnancy. Excluding participants who are pregnant helps to avoid alterations in gait and balance associated with pregnancy.

What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Perfect! I'll include hemiparesis as the third criterion. Now, let's discuss the fourth criterion: time from stroke to 3 months. Limiting the time frame to 3 months helps to capture the acute phase of stroke recovery when proprioception deficits may have a significant impact on gait and balance. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Exactly! Including the time frame of 3 months will provide us with valuable insights into the immediate effects of proprioception deficits. Now, let's move on to the fifth criterion: age 30-75. Restricting the age range helps to control for age-related factors that may influence proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance parameters. What do you think about this age range?",
            "Perfect! We're making great progress. Now, let's discuss the sixth criterion: grade 3-5 in the Functional Ambulation Category.

Excluding participants who do not provide informed consent maintains ethical standards and ensures that all participants are fully aware of the study and its implications. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Prioritizing informed consent is crucial for maintaining ethical standards. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion: second or subsequent stroke. Excluding participants with multiple strokes helps to control for potential confounding variables that may arise from recurrent strokes. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! By excluding participants with multiple strokes, we can focus on the effects of proprioception deficits in individuals experiencing their first stroke. Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion: stroke of the brainstem and cerebellum. Excluding participants with strokes in specific brain regions helps to focus on the impact of proprioception deficits on gait and balance parameters in stroke patients. What is your opinion on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. By excluding participants with strokes in the brainstem and cerebellum, we can isolate the effects of proprioception deficits on gait and balance in other brain regions. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion: epilepsy. Excluding participants with epilepsy helps to control for potential confounding factors that may affect proprioception, reaction time, and gait and balance parameters. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Excluding participants with epilepsy will help us control for potential confounding factors and isolate the effects of proprioception on gait and balance. Now, let's discuss the fifth exclusion criterion: disorders of higher mental functions. Excluding participants with cognitive impairments helps to ensure that participants can accurately complete assessments related to proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Precisely! By excluding participants with cognitive impairments, we can ensure that the study's assessments related to proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance are completed accurately. Now, let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion: coexisting neurological, rheumatological, orthopedic diseases. Excluding participants with other conditions helps to isolate the effects of stroke and proprioception deficits on gait and balance. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! By excluding participants with other conditions, we can isolate the effects of stroke and proprioception deficits on gait and balance more accurately. Finally, let's discuss the seventh and final exclusion criterion: use of orthopedic supplies during locomotion. Excluding participants who use orthopedic supplies during walking helps to ensure that the study focuses on the impact of proprioception on gait and balance without the confounding effects of external support devices. What do you think about this criterion?",

            "That's all the criteria I have. Do you know if there are any others?",
            "Great! The fourth criterion is that participants should have impaired liver function, as defined by alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or bilirubin levels within 1 to 2 times the upper limit of the normal range. This is to ensure that participants have mild to moderate liver impairment, which is expected with this treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Super! With these inclusion and exclusion criteria finalized, we are ready to move forward with preparing the written criteria statement for submission to the IRB/IEC for approval. I will draft the criteria and send it to you for review. Is there anything else that needs to be added or revised before proceeding? \nAnother important aspect of developing criteria is identifying the population(s) to which the criteria apply. While this step is usually more clear-cut than the previous step of developing inclusion and exclusion criteria, it is still worth thoroughly discussing with your team. It's important to clearly understand which populations the criteria will be applied to before moving forward with the rest of the protocol. Otherwise, researchers risk collecting data that is not applicable to the target population or making operational decisions that are not informed by relevant research findings, which could lead to ineffective or inefficient study implementation. In the case of the pirate costume study, for example, perhaps the inclusion and exclusion criteria would need to be revised if the study were aimed at preschool-age children or participants who were allergic to seafood.\nFor help with writing inclusion and exclusion criteria, click here.\nOperationalizing the Criteria\nAfter criteria are finalized, it is important to operationalize them, which means clarifying how they will be applied in practice. For example, if the criteria state that participants should be between 18-65 years old, how will researchers ensure participants understand their age and provide accurate information? One strategy is to have them read their date of birth aloud and provide some form of photo ID to confirm their identity. To ensure participants are able to comply with all study procedures, the operationalization document may include instructions on what to do if a participant does not fit the inclusion or exclusion criteria. For example, if the criteria state that participants should have normal blood pressure, what should the procedure be if a participant has high blood pressure upon arrival? Is that a reason to exclude them, or can they give their medication and recheck their blood pressure at a later time? It may also be useful to include a list of other conditions that are not specifically included or excluded by the criteria but may affect implementation, like pregnancy or a history of participation in another study at the clinic. When operationalizing criteria, be sure to discuss how changes in the protocol might affect study",
            "Terrific. The second criterion is that participants should not use any medications within 14 days before or during the study. This is necessary to ensure that any potential drug interactions are minimized. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The third exclusion criterion is that participants should have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 to 30. This is important to ensure that participants are within the normal weight range and are not underweight or overweight. Do you think this is necessary?",

            "Fabulous idea! The last criterion is that participants should have a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 18 and less than 40. This BMI range ensures that the drug will be effective in individuals of a range of weights. What's your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent decision! The last criterion is that participants should have written informed consent within the past 12 months. This is required by the Institutional Review Board. Do you have any remarks or thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The last criterion is that participants should not have any condition that requires treatment with investigational products within 30 days before or 500 km from the trial center. This is necessary to avoid potential interactions or complications from overlapping drugs or treatments. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Awesome! We've now finalized our list of exclusion criteria, and we're ready to move on to the inclusion criteria.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria are critical in clinical trials and other research studies because they help ensure that the sample size is representative of the target population, the results are reliable and valid, and the participants are safe and protected from potential harm. By identifying and eliminating participants who fall outside of the defined criteria, we can improve the quality of the data and the overall study process.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria were developed using the Likert scale. While any criteria can be used, the Likert scale is one of the most commonly used approaches because it's simple to apply, easy to understand, and allows for clear and consistent communication among study team members. The scale can range from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating that the criterion is not met and 4 indicating that the criterion is met.\nEach criterion is assigned a numerical value based on its severity or importance. For example, a criterion for body mass index (BMI) might be assigned a value of 1 for over 40, a value of 2 for 30-40, a value of 3 for 20-30, and a value of 4 for less than 20 (normal range). In the final analysis, all participants who meet or exceed all criteria are included in the study, while those who do not meet the criteria are excluded.\nThe criteria are typically divided into four categories: demographic/psychosocial, medical/laboratory, device, and surgical. For example, inclusion and exclusion criteria for a heart disease study might include the following:\nInclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria\nAged 18-75 years old Aged younger than 18 or older than 75 years old\nLess than high school education or GED equivalency No history of secondary education or higher\nCurrent smoker No history of smoking or abstinence for a minimum of 6 months prior to screening No history of smoking or abstinence for a minimum of 2 years prior to screening\nNo history of cardiovascular disease or abnormal stress tests No history of a qualifying cardiac event, such as heart attack, angina, coronary artery disease, or stroke\nNormal fast"

Exclusion criteria are patients aged >80 years not able to understand and sign an informed consent or with contraindication for the study or with an aneurysm other disease type. \nThe trial is not a randomized controlled trial. It does not involve pharmacological treatment; therefore, no safety or efficacy could be observed in the course of the trial. Given this fact, the primary objective is neither to test a hypothesis nor demonstrate the efficacy of a pharmacological treatment that might prove of future use in the real, but only to examine the evolution of a specific disease. Therefore, the only data of interest in the study are descriptive in nature. The results are of an exploratory nature, and a level I evidence may be obtained, if any.\nOnce all exclusion criteria are satisfied, the information about the patients will be recorded and signed by the patient or his family (see Figure 1). This document should contain the data necessary to make the diagnosis. The information is double-entered, to ensure data accuracy. Patients with no changes of data and the supervisor review the final data and sign it on the last data grid.\nOnce all CT-Scan patients who comply to the inclusion criteria identified, these are randomized and labeled. Patients will be allocated to either treatment (study group) or to control group (control group). The flow chart of the patient's management is depicted in Figure 8.\nThe treatment group will be treated by monthly CT-Scan and the control group with the usual practice: yearly. The same persons will be responsible for the follow-up assessment at each visit. To reduce intraobserver and interobserver variability, every 6 months, a CT-Scan will be done by another operator (not the operator of record). As no treatment is used, the assessment of the images is only by the two primary investigators. For reasons of blinding, the operator who will carry out the last evaluation is not informed of the group assignation and blinding is also kept by masking the original CT-Scan reports and the case file of the patients by a third person not involved in the study. This third person is kept by the statistician in a place unknown to the rest of the research",

Participants with a body temperature of 37.3\u00b0C or more prior to vaccination would be excluded. This ensures that individuals with acute illnesses are not included. Another criterion is allergic history, where individuals with allergies to any component of the investigational vaccine or a history of severe adverse reactions to vaccines are excluded. Vaccine history is also considered, and participants who received certain types of vaccines within specific timeframes prior to the investigational vaccine are excluded. There are also exclusions based on health conditions, immune-related diseases, gastrointestinal conditions, neurological and mental health, acute illness, immune therapy, coagulation abnormalities, organ removal history, participation in other clinical studies, and special conditions for children aged 24 months and below. Finally, the investigator has the discretion to exclude participants based on individual suitability for the study.",

            "Excellent. The first criteria is: 1: Patients with ACLF. 1.1 Inclusion: - Patients with ACLF defined by MELD, CLIFT or CTP score greater than 19.",
            "Excellent. The second inclusion criterion is patients with acute liver failure of more than 72 hours with a MELD score > 16 points or acute-on-chronic liver failure with MELD score between 12-16 points and evidence of coagulopathy that has progressed beyond the use of prophylactic or corrective anticoagulation [Adapted from the study protocol, Modified from Bellomo et al16]. This criterion ensures that the patients are at a critical stage where the infusion of CytoSorb would make clinically significant improvement. Does this criterion make sense and is it phrased in a clear and concise manner?",
            "It's good to hear. In the next criterion, the investigator is asked to exclude pregnant or breast-feeding women, patients with malignancies, and patients with active or uncontrolled infections. The goal of excluding these populations is to minimize the risk of adverse effects or confounding factors from these various conditions. Are you comfortable with this criterion?",
            "Fantastic. The next criterion requires that the participants have contraindications for anticoagulation for more than 24 hours. This ensures that they are at high risk for complications due to bleeding. Is this criterion okay for the inclusion? \u00a9 2017 questionStudyGuide. All rights reserved.",
            "Great. How about the last criterion, that participants must have an ejection fraction (EF) \u2265 25% or a contraindication against abdominal CT. This ensures that the participants have a relatively healthy liver to help further our understanding of the device's effect on healthy liver tissue. Do you have any comments on this criterion?",
            "That's great news. The last criterion in the list states that participants should not have malignant tumors. The exclusion of participants with malignant tumors ensures that the study focuses on patients at risk of liver failure due to non-cancerous conditions. Do you have any comments on this criterion? \u260e \u260e \u260e \u260e [INSDTN] Please talk to me. [END] *Note: The question prompts were added by the moderation system in the course of the conversation.\n2.3.3 - Devising exclusion/inclusion criteria (continued)\nThe information in this section should deal with the exclusion/inclusion criteria that will be used in the study protocol. The content here should deal with any criteria that were not yet mentioned in the previous section on inclusion/exclusion criteria.\nPlease add the text below to the end of the section on inclusion/exclusion criteria in the protocol template:",
            "Wonderful. The last criterion specifies that participants must have no signs of systemic infection, defined by C reactive protein \u2265 100 pg/mL, white blood cell count (WBC) \u2265 12,000 cm3, or positive blood cultures. This helps to ensure that participants do not have a active systemic infection, which can interfere with study results. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The eighth criterion specifies that participants must have an INR \u22651.5 at the start of the study. The INR measures the clotting time of prothrombin time, and an INR \u2265 1.5 indicates liver dysfunction that may warrant treatment with citrate. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The exclusion criteria for this study are pretty straightforward. Are there any disagreements on any of these?",
            "The first exclusion criterion specifies that participants must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Since the study involves invasive procedures, it is important to exclude pregnant women to minimize risk to the fetus. Breastfeeding is excluded to avoid introducing the drug into the mother's milk and harming the neonate. What do you think about these exclusion criteria?",
            "Excellent. The second exclusion criterion specifies the age below or above 18 years old. This criterion ensures that participants are old enough to consent to participate and able to understand the risks and benefits of the study. Do you see any issues with this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. The third exclusion criterion is participants with an acute renal failure. Continuing treatment for renal failure can be harmful for participants, so they are not suitable for inclusion. Do you agree?",
            "Fantastic. The last exclusion criterion is for pregnancy. Because of the risk of teratogenic effects of the study intervention, participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be excluded. Do you think this is a valid criterion?",
            "Great, we have reached the end of the list of exclusion criteria. It seems we have a well-set up list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Let's move on to the interventions section. The first intervention is the use of acetylcysteine to treat acute liver failure. Acetylcysteine is a medicine used for liver support and detoxification. The second intervention is the use of sepsis. Sepsis is a serious infection in the bloodstream that can cause organ failure and death. The third intervention is the use of U.D. care. U.D. care stands for unfractionated or unproven dialysis, which is a type of renal replacement therapy. The fourth intervention is the use of normal saline. Normal saline is a type of sterile water used as a fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy. The last intervention is the use of placebo. The use of placebo is a matching dummy treatment given to some of the participants to evaluate the effects of the other treatments. Do you have any questions regarding the interventions?",

            "Alright. The first inclusion criterion is adult patients (\u2265 18 years) admitted to the University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA), Belgium. This criterion ensures that the study population consists of adults who are receiving care at a specific hospital, allowing for standardized treatment and monitoring. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. Moving on to the second criterion. It states that written informed consent must be obtained from the patient or their legal representative if the patient is unable to provide consent due to encephalopathy (> grade 2). Obtaining informed consent is crucial to ensure that participants understand the study procedures and risks involved. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Let's proceed to the third criterion. It specifies that participants must have acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) grade \u2265 2. This ensures that the study focuses on patients with significant liver dysfunction. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect. We're making progress. The fourth criterion states that participants must have experienced an acute decompensation event with an identifiable trigger. This helps to ensure that participants have a clear cause for their liver failure, allowing for more targeted treatment and analysis. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on to the fifth criterion. It states that participants must have hepatic encephalopathy grade \u2265 2. The presence of hepatic encephalopathy at a certain severity level ensures that participants have significant neurological symptoms related to their liver failure, which may impact treatment outcomes. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great. Let's move on to the sixth criterion. It specifies that participants must have acute kidney injury (AKI) according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria stage 3. AKI is a common complication of ACLF, and using standardized criteria helps to ensure consistency in diagnosing and monitoring kidney function in participants. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Now, let's discuss the seventh criterion. It states that participants must have a serum bilirubin level \u2265 10 mg/dl. Elevated bilirubin levels are a marker of liver dysfunction, and this criterion ensures that participants have significant liver impairment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. We're almost done with the inclusion criteria. The last criterion is that participants must have hemodynamic instability with vasopressor support. This means that participants requiring vasopressor support for hemodynamic instability have severe circulatory issues that may impact treatment response, making them appropriate for the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. We have successfully designed all the inclusion criteria for your clinical trial. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Shall we continue?",
            "Fantastic. The first exclusion criterion is known patient will against participation in the study or against the measures applied in the study. This criterion respects the autonomy of participants who do not wish to be involved in the study or receive specific interventions. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Moving on to the second exclusion criterion. It states that a decision made prior to inclusion to stop further treatment of the patient within the next 24 hours excludes them from the study. Participants who are not expected to continue treatment for at least 24 hours may not benefit from the study intervention, making them unsuitable for inclusion. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. Let's proceed to the third criterion. It states that participants with no complete remission of malignancy, including hepatocellular carcinoma, within the past 12 months, should be excluded. This criterion ensures that participants with active malignancies that may confound the study results or impact their overall prognosis are excluded. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. We're almost there. The last exclusion criterion is that participants receiving ongoing intermittent or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before study inclusion should be excluded. Participants receiving renal replacement therapy may have different treatment needs and outcomes, potentially affecting the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

This criterion is necessary as individuals with extensive backgrounds in art history may have a bias towards a particular intervention group and may not be able to accurately evaluate the effects of the museum intervention. Excluding individuals with recent art history experience helps ensure that the study's results are not influenced by prior knowledge. Do you have any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. The last exclusion criterion is age < 65. This criterion is reasonable as the museum intervention may not be as impactful for individuals under the age of 65.

The inclusion criteria are as follows: age > 55 years old with at least 5 years since diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ability to read and speak English, and ability to attend the museum on the day and at the time of the session. This criteria is reasonable for several reasons. First, individuals who are 55 years and older with a history of atrial fibrillation for at least 5 years are likely to benefit the most from the museum intervention. Second, requiring participants to be able to read and speak English ensures they have the cognitive ability to understand the museum intervention and are able to provide accurate feedback on their experiences. Finally, requiring them to be able to attend the museum on the day and at the time of the session ensures they have the physical ability to engage in the intervention and experience it in its entirety.

This is to ensure that the participants are adults with fully developed skeletal structures, which may impact the effectiveness and safety of the implant. Do you have any questions or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "Great. Moving on to the next inclusion criterion, the patient must have a lumbar disc herniation with compressive radiculopathy requiring partial discectomy. This criterion specifies the target population with a specific condition that requires surgical intervention, allowing for a focused study on the efficacy of the PerQdisc device in this patient population. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The next criterion states that the overall disc herniation should affect half or less of the width of the dorsal annulus of the spinal canal. This limitation ensures that patients with a specific type of herniation, suitable for the intervention, are included in the study. Any feedback on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Moving on, the next criterion is that the patient must have a minimum of 6 mm of disc height. This ensures that the patients have a minimum disc height, which may impact the feasibility and safety of the implantation procedure. Any concerns or suggestions regarding this criterion?",

Based on our conversation, here are the full criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n- Patient is skeletally mature and at least 21 years of age.\n- Patient has a lumbar disc herniation, between L1-S1, with compressive radiculopathy of the traversing nerve root requiring partial discectomy or sequestrectomy. Only one lumbar disc may be treated with the PerQdisc device.\n- Patient must have an overall disc herniation (extrusion or protrusion) such that half or less of the width of the dorsal annulus of the spinal canal, is affected by the herniation. The width of the canal is defined by the lateral recesses and the central canal (i.e. pedicle to pedicle).\n- Patient must have a minimum of 6 mm of disc height as measured in the center of the affected disc.\n- Patient is willing and able to give informed consent.\n- All surgeries must be approved by at least 2 members of the Medical Advisory Board (MAB) - potential anatomical limitations of safely accessing Kambin's, extent of annular disruption, as well as overall patient criteria will be evaluated\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n- Patient has had prior lumbar spine surgery at the index level (nucleoplasy is acceptable).\n- Patient has had spinal fusion in the lumbar spine. Cervical or thoracic fusion is allowed as long as there are no neurologic deficits in the lower extremities.\n- Patient has spondyloarthropathy or other spondylolisthesis greater than 4 mm or spondylolysis at the index level (on standing X-ray).\n- Patient has underlying moderate or severe spinal stenosis (congenital, degenerative, or due to epidural lipomatosis) at any level. If the index level shows stenosis due to the disc herniation, it is acceptable if the index level is going to be treated concurrently with the PerQdsic procedure.\n- Patient has compressive radiculopathy of the exiting nerve root at the index level.\n- Patient has significant facet disease. Significant is defined as clinically confirmed by diagnostic block or radiologically grade 2 or higher (mild joint narrowing and irregularity are acceptable, but not sclerosis or osteophyte formation).\n- Patient has any known active malignancy.\n- Patient has previously undergone or currently on immunosuppressive therapy. Steroids used to treat inflammation are allowed.\n- Patient has active local or systemic infection.\n- Patient has been diagnosed with hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, or other autoimmune disease including AIDS, AIDS related complex (ARC) and HIV.\n- Patient has diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2) requiring daily insulin management.\n- Patient has osteopenia of the spine (T-score of -1.0 or lower). All patients 50 years of age or older, and any postmenopausal women with a history of fractures should have a dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to confirm exclusion.\n- Patient has morbid obesity defined as a body mass index (BMI) more than 35 (>35).\n- Patient has a known allergy to silicone or barium sulfate.\n- Patient has a broad disc herniation that is wider than half of the dorsal annulus forming the wall of the spinal canal.\n- Patient requires decompression involving disruption of the midline bony-ligamentous elements (i.e. laminectomy).\n- Patient has a significant Schmorl's node at the level to be treated, or any Schmorl's nodes affecting 3 or more lumbar levels. Significant is defined as a large, rectangular or irregular-shaped node that has an associated active inflammatory process (Modic I changes).\n- Patient has more than 20 degrees of mobility on flexion/extension radiographs at the index level.\n- Patient has more than 10 degrees of lumbar scoliosis.\n- Patient belongs to a vulnerable population or has a condition such that his/her ability to provide informed consent, comply with follow-up requirements, or provide self-assessments is compromised (e.g. developmentally disabled, prisoner, chronic alcohol/substance abuser).\n- Patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study. Pregnancy ruled out by serum HCG. If the patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study and wishes to continue study participation, a new Pregnancy Informed Consent must be completed.\n- Intraoperative Exclusion: Poor radiological visualization of Kambin's triangle, annular defect following surgical treatment of the disc herniation/protrusion that is greater than 6 mm, sustained irritation of the exiting nerve root during any aspect of the annular dilation technique (leg movement or if performing with electrical monitoring) in spite of repositioning instruments, protrusion of the 50A Imaging Balloon up to or beyond the outer margin of the vertebra during the imaging steps, and a violated endplate as determined by imaging balloons during fluoroscopy.",

            "Any other criteria?",
            "Great idea. The last exclusion criterion is related to the use of any other investigational products or participation in other clinical trials. Participants who are already enrolled in other clinical trials may not be able to adhere to the study protocol, which could lead to skewed results. How does that criterion sound to you?",
            "Perfect. The last exclusion criterion asks participants to be at least 12 years post-menopausal or surgically sterile, due to the effects the investigational drug may have on the endometrium. Explain what such an exclusion criterion means and why it was included in the protocol.",

            "Absolutely. Moving on to the next criterion, we need to address a specific subset of participants for combination therapy expansion. How about specifying \"Serine/threonine kinase 11/ liver kinase B1 (STK11/LKB1) mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as assessed by historical (local) test\"? This allows us to evaluate the investigational drug in this particular patient population.",

How about including \"Must be refractory to or have progressed on or after a platinum-based doublet regimen and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)\"? This criterion identifies participants who are suitable candidates for a novel therapy like the investigational drug.",

I usually provide a google document for review. Some things to consider while preparing the criteria include:\n1. Use I, not necessarily she or her since you want to avoid unconscious bias.\n2. Keep it simple and focused. A single sentence per criterion - it's easy for a busy IRB member to miss something if you have more.\n3. Inclusion and Exclusion criteria are not the same. Inclusion are people who satisfy the criteria, and Exclusion are people who DON'T. So, word it that way: \"Must have\", \"should have\", or \"may have\" are better than \"must not\".\n4. Avoid absolute language. \"Never\" or \"never before\" are absolute. Instead say \"within X weeks\" or \"ever\". Always requires a good justification.\n5. Eliminate double negatives. Instead of \"not have a history of....\" say \"a history of...\" because anything with a history is included.\n6. Be specific. \"History of ovarian cancer\" is better than \"a history of cancer\" since you want to include all types of cancer if they are listed.\n7. Avoid negatives and positives - say what you want to let in as a question instead of what you want to exclude. It's easier to get an IRB to understand and give you what you want.\n8. Check other similar studies in your field and follow similar criteria if possible.\nIf something is unclear or confusing, call your IRB. I found a typo or missing word is very common for us.\nI hope that helps and feel free to ask more questions if needed. Good luck!"

[/FONT][FONT=Calibri]\nStudy of an Investigational Drug for Smoldering Multiple Myeloma with a Novel Approach to Drug Development\nParticipants with smoldering multiple myeloma [SBMM] have intermediate-risk of advancing to active multiple myeloma [AA MM] and limited therapeutic options [1,2]. Although bortezomib is highly effective against AA MM [3-6], it has not been formally tested in SBMM [7]. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that causes degradation of the tumor suppressor IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKA), which then activates the transcription factor NFkB, induces apoptysis, and inhibits cell proliferation [8]. IKKA inhibition also prevents translocation of the transcription factor NFkB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [8], where it can regulate the expression of multiple genes involved in inflammation and cell proliferation [9]. Bortezomib is also a strong inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [10], which plays a critical role in protein synthesis and cell growth. In addition, bortezomib and dexamethasone have been shown to induce regression of multiple myeloma bone disease in NALL 1 transgenic mice [11]. However, bortezomib at the dose of 1.3 mg/m^2 weekly is well-tolerated with only mild to moderate side effects in patients with multiple myeloma [12]. Bortezomib has not been tested at a lower dose in patients with SBMM. Therefore, an adaptive randomized open-label dose escalation study of bortezomib for SBMM [13]"

Examples include a solitary brain metastasis (met), contralateral lung nodule, or an adrenal metastatic site.\n- A patient may also be enrolled on a treatment trial and participate in this study, if all other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.\n- Able to provide informed consent, or if the oncology physician determines the patient to not have decision-making capacity, a patient-designated health care proxy (or authorized representative per institutional policies) must sign consent by the baseline visit.\n- Participant or healthcare proxy has adequate understanding of the English language (preferred) because not all GA measures have been validated in other languages. Study team should be contacted for any participants with other preferred languages including Spanish and Mandarin. Inclusion of these participants will depend upon the availability of the translators and their ability to accurately translate the measures as approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n- Have surgery planned within 3 months of approach date. Patients who have previously received surgery are eligible.\n- Presence of symptomatic brain metastases (if more than one) at the time of study consent process.

            "Exactly! Excluding patients with contaminated wounds will help us focus on a specific population and eliminate potential confounding factors. Finally, the last exclusion criterion is cirrhosis. Should we exclude patients with cirrhosis?",
            "Perfect! Excluding patients with cirrhosis will help ensure that our results are not influenced by liver-related complications.",
            "That's correct! You have successfully designed the criteria for the clinical trial. Well done! If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask."

            "That's a great suggestion. We shouldn't forget about medications that may impact glucose tolerance. Now that we have the inclusion and exclusion criteria, what next?",

            "Perfect, let's finalize the criteria. These are the exclusion criteria: >1 major medical history or medication that affects glucose regulation, digestion or body fat distribution. Now that we have our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we can create a protocol that outlines the details for participant recruitment and data collection."

            "Excellent suggestions! Excluding individuals under 18 ensures that participants are capable of providing informed consent, while excluding those with food allergies or intolerances protects their safety during the trial. Now, let's discuss other exclusion criteria. Any ideas on this?",
            "That's a valid point. Excluding participants on medications that affect glucose tolerance will indeed help control for confounding factors. What about other exclusion criteria? Can you think of any?",
            "Absolutely, excluding participants with diabetes or those using anti-hyperglycemic drugs or insulin will help us isolate the impact of starch processing on blood glucose levels. Are there any other exclusion criteria that come to mind?",

            "Good point! Excluding individuals with conditions or medications that affect digestion and absorption will help us maintain consistency and control for potential variables. Is there anything else you would like to add?",
            "Excellent suggestion! Excluding participants on these medications will indeed help control for their effects on glucose metabolism and body fat distribution. Is there anything else we need to consider for the exclusion criteria?",
            "That's a valid point. Excluding participants with other medications or conditions that could impact the study results will help maintain the internal validity of the trial. Now, let me summarize the full criteria we have discussed:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Adult males or non-pregnant females\n2. Eligible to receive income in Canada\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Age less than 18 years\n2. Any known food allergies or intolerances to the investigational product\n3. Medications known to affect glucose tolerance\n4. Known history of diabetes mellitus or the use of anti-hyperglycemic drugs or insulin\n5. Major medical or surgical events requiring hospitalization within the preceding 3 months\n6. Presence of disease or drugs which influence digestion and absorption of nutrients\n7. Short-term use of systemic steroids or atypical antipsychotics\n8. Other medications or conditions which might affect the results\n9. Inability or unwillingness to comply with experimental procedures or safety guidelines"
