The study involves undergoing ultrasound imaging of the abdomen after tube feeding is inserted to ensure it is in the proper location. Patients will be selected for the study if they are intubated and require tube feeding.

There are no extra risks or burden with this procedure.\nStudy Risk/Benefits: There are no known risks associated with this study, although the ultrasound may show things not related to the tube position, but that is not the purpose of the study. The hope is to determine if ultrasound can be used to help in tube positioning.\nPotential Study Delays and Missed Treatment: Participation in the study will not delay your usual care and will not prevent you from receiving the best care available. As noted above, ultrasound will be used to help in tube placement, but it is not the only way to do so. The usual care you would get will not change.\nStudy Compensation: There is no compensation for participants but the results of the study may help other patients in the future.\nPotential Discomfort: Ultrasound does not cause pain and is not uncomfortable.

So far, we have discussed inclusion and exclusion criteria for subject recruitment. Let's now turn our attention to the next section of the risk-of-bias triangle, selection bias. selection bias. The risk-of-bias triangle. The concept of selection bias is important in planning an RCT to ensure that the results are unbiased, and unfavorable treatment effects can be minimized. The selection bias describes the processes involved with recruiting participants, starting with the initial contact with individuals and ending with their enrollment in the trial. There are two forms of selection bias, selection at time zero and selection at follow-up. Selection at time zero refers to selection bias that occurs before allocation to the intervention or control group, or in other words, when recruiting participants. Selection at follow-up refers to selection bias that occurs after allocation and is related to dropouts, that is, patients who are not adherent to the intervention or follow-up protocol. Selection bias can occur from inadequate concealment of group allocation, leading to selection of participants to receive the intervention or control group based on prognostic factors or known outcome differences. It can also occur from differential enrollment of treatment-related outcomes due to selective dropout, in which dropouts are more likely to have favorable outcomes compared to those who complete the trial. Finally, selection bias can occur from confounding by indication, in which participants who self-select into the study because of their baseline characteristics. It is important to minimize selection bias by adequate randomization to ensure that participants are assigned to groups randomly rather than preferentially selecting higher-risk patients or those with a particular outcome. Let's discuss some strategies to minimize selection bias, beginning with adequate randomization. Adequate randomization. Randomization minimizes selection bias by ensuring that participants are assigned to groups randomly rather than preferentially selecting higher-risk patients or those with a particular outcome. Randomization should use a method that minimizes systematic bias, such as block randomization. Where possible, minimizing the likelihood of participant or investigator bias should be considered during randomization. Luck-of-the-draw should be",

The criteria mention the need for an age >18 years, as it's recommended that individuals be over 18 years old to participate in most clinical trials. The last exclusion criterion is contraindication to temporary interruption of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, except aspirin, which are drugs that thin the blood and therefore increase bleeding risk. Aspirin, however, has antiprotease effects and can be useful to treat underlying inflammation in sarcoidosis participants, so this exclusion criterion is reasonable.\nClinical trials must have inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure participant safety and validity of study results.

Participants with syndromic forms of hearing loss. \n2. Participants with any known congenital or acquired condition affecting hearing, including ototoxic exposure or drugs (e.g. aminoglycoside exposure) known to cause sensorineural hearing loss.\n3. Profound or residual speech or language delays.\n4. Evaluation of candidacy for cochlear implantation or auditory brain implantation, or currently using a cochlear implant or auditory brain implant.\n[Detailed information] - Participants with syndromic forms of hearing loss should be excluded as these genetic conditions are known to cause nonsyndromic hearing loss.  Cochlear or auditory brain implantation will be evaluated as it may interfere with the hearing outcome. Syndromes with variable expressivity make diagnosis complicated and might jeopardize genetic testing interpretations. Speech- language delays may complicate the genetic interpretation and confound the association of the genotype with the phenotype. Please note that this is a subset of the total cohort of affected individuals in which the clinical picture is more complex and would likely impact the generalizability of the results in the remaining participants.    The exclusion of syndromes, cochlear or auditory brain implants, and speech-language delays will reduce the variability in the phenotype and improve the study population for the specific genotypes and associated hearing loss phenotypes, allowing a greater degree of precision in the results and generalizability of the findings across a broader patient population.",

I think that's all the criteria we need to think about. Do you have any other considerations before I start developing the inclusion and exclusion criteria? \n\nLet's move on to the third step-developing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Now that we've discussed the general criteria, we need to make them specific.\nYou can think of inclusion and exclusion criteria as boxes that your participants must or must not fall into to be considered for your study. These criteria should be specific and measurable, so that it is clear who is invited and who isn't.\nRemember our example of the study on caregiver burden among patients with cancer. We decided the inclusion criteria would be:\n\n>18 years old\nCaregiving responsibilities for a relative with cancer\nCaregiver strain index (CSI) score of >= 36\nLive within 50 miles of study site\nThe exclusion criteria would be:\nCaregiver of a patient with another chronic illness\nParticipants with a mental impairment or incompetence\nParticipating in another intervention for caregiver burden\nRecently hospitalized for mental health issues\nAs you can see, we have specific criteria for eligibility and exclusion, with operational definitions for each, and we make sure to include all the relevant factors that we think will impact our study.\nNow you can start drafting this information into a data sheet or table. Start by listing the criteria and providing the operational definition for each.\nHere's a template you can use to help get started.\nOnce you've done that, take some time to review and perfect it. A good strategy is to get feedback from your mentor or someone else you trust, to make sure that your criteria are clear and won't screen out anyone who might participate.\nA good inclusivity-exclusivity balance is key. Don't set criteria so narrow that you exclude all the participants you want to study, but don't make them so wide that you are inundated with participants who don't truly meet your study's criteria. Remember, if you end up with too many participants, it could jeopardize your study! If you have trouble getting it right",

The inclusion criteria include age, Cantonese-speaking language capability, Cantonese-speaking caregiver, and a caregiver burden score of 7 or above on the Mini-Mental State Exam.

We can include them in a separate subgroup or cohort, as long as the majority of participants consent to providing the necessary samples. This approach will still allow us to gather valuable data while accommodating the preferences and limitations of individual patients. Does that address your concern?",
            "I'm glad you find it reasonable. Now, we have discussed all the key inclusion criteria. Shall we move on to the key exclusion criteria?",
            "Great. The first criterion is: \"Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\" This criterion is important to avoid potential interactions or confounding effects of prior treatments on the safety and efficacy evaluation of the investigational therapy. Do you have any suggestions or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "I agree. Excluding patients who have recently received other therapies helps in isolating the effects of the investigational treatment. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\" This criterion ensures that patients with unresolved toxicities from prior treatments are excluded from the trial to prevent exacerbation of side effects and ensure patient safety. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our primary concern. Now, the next criterion is: \"Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients who may be at higher risk of severe immune-related adverse events with the investigational therapy based on their prior treatment history. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Minimizing the risk of severe adverse events is of utmost importance. Let's move on to the next criterion: \"Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\" This criterion is important to exclude patients with active or recent history of other malignancies that may confound the assessment of the efficacy of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I agree. Maintaining the focus on the specific types of cancer under study is crucial for meaningful evaluation. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients with brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease, as these patients may require specific treatment approaches and have different prognosis compared to patients without central nervous system involvement. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Excluding patients with central nervous system involvement helps maintain the homogeneity of the patient population and facilitates accurate evaluation of the investigational therapy. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\" This criterion is important to ensure patient safety and avoid potential severe allergic reactions to the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our top priority. Now, we have reached the final criterion: \"Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\" This criterion is essential to protect the safety of pregnant women and unborn children, as well as to prevent potential exposure of infants to the investigational therapy through breastfeeding. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Protecting the safety of vulnerable populations is paramount. Based on our discussion, here are the full criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nKey Inclusion Criteria:\n- Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumor.\n- Having received and failed or was intolerant to standard of care for advanced disease or not eligible for standard of care therapy.\n- Measurable disease.\n- ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n- Adequate organ function.\n- Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n- Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\n- Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\n- Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\n- Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\n- Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\n- History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n- Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

Now, the inclusion and exclusion criteria have been established, which are common for all study subjects. The next step is to determine the criteria specific to each arm of the study. To review their eligibility for the study, we need to further classify each of the inclusion and exclusion criteria by arm. For the placebo group, we need to add the following to the above list: 1. Patients with other shoulder injuries that would require more than 3-week recovery before arthroscopic supraspinatus repair. 2. Patients with major medical contraindications to NSAIDs, such as gastric ulcers or renal insufficiency. For the NSAID group, we need to add the following to the above list: 1. Patients with contraindications to NSAIDs, as previously mentioned. 2. Patients who have had a history of allergy to salicylates. At this point, we have included criteria for the type of patients that will be included and excluded in the study drug arms. However, we need criteria for those who drop out of the study.

A clear understanding that there may be a period of wrist rest that may last for up to 2 weeks. 3. Certain follow-up visits, including physical exam and telephone calls within 1, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery. 4. Assessment of complications such as wrist pain, joint swelling, and wrist movement within 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after surgery.

Our exclusion criteria include individuals with ASA III or IV, pregnant individuals, individuals with a history of diaphragmatic paralysis, and individuals with adverse reactions to local anesthetics. I'm impressed; your thoughtful consideration of every aspect of the study has made our sample size calculations much easier. \nInterviewing Participants\nAfter deciding on the eligibility criteria, we need to decide on the best way to notify potential participants of the study and to gather consent. Consider the following questions: \n  * Should the interviewer make phone calls or visits to individuals' homes to find participants?\n  * Will participants be able to provide written consent, such as via fax or online form, or will we need to seek additional authorization from an institutional review board (IRB)?\nWe will call this technique active recruitment, as the interviewer will be actively reaching out to potential participants to relay information and obtain consent. On the other hand, passive recruitment involves waiting for potential participants to approach the researchers and volunteer their participation. We'll discuss this option further later.\nBoth forms of recruitment will have pros and cons; choose whichever process is most appropriate for your study and feasible under your research budget. If you anticipate difficulties attracting any particular group of people (e.g., minorities or individuals with disabilities), it may be important to also advertise in media that are likely to reach these populations. \nAfter deciding on a method of recruitment and obtaining IRB approval, you'll need to create a protocol for interviewing participants. Your protocol should include information about the study, such as the study title and purpose, number of visits, times and location of visits, number of total and follow-up visits, length of follow-up, risks and benefits, participants' rights, and how to contact the research team. \nFor studies with participants who are unable to come to the research site, you may want to include a description of the informed consent procedure. In some cases, an IRB-approved informed consent form that the participant can read and sign in the presence of a live interviewer is sufficient. In other cases, a self-administered form that the participant can complete and mail or",

The inclusion and exclusion criteria should be specific and relevant to the population being studied. Keep in mind which patients will benefit most from the intervention or who will provide the most meaningful data.\nList potential inclusion criteria. Aim for as few criteria as possible. Start with the most important or strictest criteria first.\nEliminate those who don't meet the criteria. Re-read the criteria until you get to the last patient that would be included. If that individual doesn't meet all the criteria, then it's time to stop.\nIt's important to write the criteria in a way that's clear to both researchers and patients. Explain each criterion with a brief statement to avoid confusion.\nReview with colleagues or a study committee to ensure that your criteria are feasible and appropriate.\nInclude a short description of the rationale for each criterion. Why is it there? What does it test?\nCheck the criteria against the study's aims to ensure that they're consistent.\nHow to Use Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nUsing inclusion and exclusion criteria is a crucial step in any clinical trial. They ensure that the study includes patients who are most likely to benefit from the intervention and exclude those who will most likely not benefit. The criteria also minimize the risk of missing important baseline characteristics that could affect study outcomes.",

Patients who started androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) more than 26 weeks prior to enrollment will also be excluded. Any questions about these exclusions?",
            "Exactly! We also have additional exclusion criteria. Patients who started intensification of therapy beyond ADT (e.g., AR pathway inhibitor, cytotoxic therapy) more than 26 weeks prior to registration will be excluded. Subjects with a known allergy to contrast material and/or contraindication to FDG-PET will also be excluded. Furthermore, patients enrolled in another therapeutic clinical trial that would preclude them from participating in this trial will be excluded.

Someone with a severe head injury may not be able to tolerate the procedure or the side effects of the drug. Additionally, we should also exclude participants with hypoxia, such as participants with carbon monoxide poisoning, seizures, or neurological conditions such as brain tumors, hydrocephalus, or encephalitis. These conditions can also alter the results and create unnecessary risks for the participants.

Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria for the cancer arm participants. The first criterion is the exclusion of pregnancy or lactating women. Can you think of a reason why this is important?",
            "Well said! Excluding pregnant or lactating women helps ensure that the levels of biomarkers are not influenced by hormonal changes during pregnancy or lactation. The next criterion is the exclusion of recipients of organ transplants or prior non-autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplants. Can you think of a reason for this exclusion?",
            "Perfect! You've understood it perfectly. The next criterion is the exclusion of recipients of blood transfusion within 7 days prior to the study blood draw. Any ideas why this criterion is important?",
            "Exactly! Blood transfusions can introduce external biomarkers or alter the levels of existing biomarkers, which could impact the study results. The final criterion we'll discuss for the cancer arm participants is the exclusion of recipients of any anti-cancer therapy within 30 days prior to the study blood draw, due to diseases other than cancers. What do you think about this criterion?",

The last three criteria were agreed upon with some reservation/amendments: the eighth criterion, excluding individuals with a history of GVHD, required clarification: is GVHD in remission, active, or unspecified? The ninth criterion required some further explanation: individuals with pre-existing neurological disorders should be considered on a case-by-case basis, i.e., whether the disorder is likely to affect immune function? And the tenth criterion, individuals with a history of anaphylaxis, required amendment to exclude participants with a history of reaction to a previous vaccination (not administration) and agree to readminister a vaccination after an appropriate time period.\nWith the addition of these two statements, we have our final set of inclusion/exclusion criteria and can move on to writing the exclusion/inclusion criteria section of our protocol:\nSTDs: ___/__: (include pregnancy, history of anaphylaxis to a previous vaccine, current GVHD with active symptoms, neurological disorders with functional impairment, current nephrotic syndrome, and participants receiving nephrotoxic medications) 1.

So, the criteria are comprehensive, and they ensure that only healthy participants without any medical conditions that may be affected by the medication are enrolled in the study. Good luck with the rest of the design.",

Now, let's proceed to the next criterion. How should we categorize participants based on their renal function?",
            "That's a good approach. To categorize participants, we can use the pre-defined eGFR values based on the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. According to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) standards, what should be the range of eGFR values for each renal function group?",

And the last criterion is patients who are able and willing to adhere to the study visit schedule, including 3 scheduled visits at 3-month intervals, and the willingness to follow-up for survival for at least 5 years after treatment. Is there anything else you would like to include or exclude for the inclusion criteria?",
            "That makes sense. The next exclusion criterion is patients who develop untreated, symptomatic liver metastases at baseline or those with CNS metastases.  Do you have any comments on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Exactly! By identifying patients with longer treatment durations, we can better understand the long-term responses to regorafenib. Therefore, these criteria have been set for inclusion and exclusion for the study's participants."

            "Exactly! Timeframe is crucial for the accuracy of the study. Now let's move on to the second criterion. Adult patients, 18 years or older, at the date of their first regorafenib treatment should be included. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! We need to understand how effective the treatment is specifically in adults. Now, for the third criterion, we need to consider patients who have at least one recorded visit, laboratory test, or other recorded electronic medical record entry in the Flatiron network at least 3 months before the date of their first regorafenib treatment. However, if the patient was diagnosed with mCRC within the last 3 months, this requirement does not apply. What are your thoughts?",
            "Exactly! Having a baseline helps us assess the impact of the treatment accurately. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is patients who had a diagnosis or recorded history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), or other primary cancers (except non-melanoma skin cancers) during the 6-month period on or prior to the date of their first regorafenib treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! We want to ensure that the data collected is specific to metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with regorafenib. Now, for the final exclusion criterion, patients will be excluded if their treatment duration is less than 5 months for treatment completers or less than 4 months at their last visit date for non-completers. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Including patients with shorter treatment durations may not provide enough data to evaluate the effectiveness of regorafenib over the long term. Now, let me summarize the full criteria we have designed:\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with a diagnosis of mCRC between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2022, who initiated regorafenib monotherapy up to 14 days prior or after their mCRC diagnosis and during the patient selection period (July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022).\n2. Adult patients (\u226518 years old) at the date of their first regorafenib treatment.\n3. Patients with at least one recorded visit, laboratory test, or other recorded electronic medical record entry in the Flatiron network at least 3 months before the date of their first regorafenib treatment, unless diagnosed with mCRC within the last 3 months.\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with a diagnosis or recorded history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), or other primary cancers (except non-melanoma skin cancers) during the 6-month period on or prior to the date of their first regorafenib treatment.\n2.

One of the exclusion criteria is participants with a history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder. This is to exclude participants who may have previously had a mental health disorder that may affect their ability to adhere to the trial procedures. What do you think?",
            "Perfect. Another inclusion criteria could be presence of a vein larger than 10 mm in diameter in the antecubital fossa of the preferred arm. This will ensure that participants have the proper vein size for blood sampling during the study procedures. Are you OK with this one?",
            "Excellent. With all of these criteria satisfied, we have a solid basis for our inclusion/exclusion criteria. So let's summarize our thoughts in a bullets list: Healthy female or male volunteers aged 18 or above (exclusion age > 65) 2 Stable weight of the participant with Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 Physically able to permit a short period of injection in the upper arm. Voluntary and competent to provide informed consent. This would be a great inclusion/exclusion criteria list to approach the IRB with for approval.",

            "With all these exclusion criteria, we've ensured our study participants are healthy, free of relevant medications or conditions that might impact the performance of the on-body injector, and unlikely to have histories of skin sensitivities or allergies. This greatly reduces the risk of adverse events and ensures the data collected are as reliable and accurate as possible.\nRecruitment and retention are crucial in ensuring the success of any clinical trial. Participants are the central focus of any study, and a high rate of dropouts can undermine the credibility of the study's findings. The inclusion and exclusion criteria we've discussed help to reduce the likelihood of dropouts by filtering out individuals who may have underlying conditions, lifestyle factors, or other concerns that could affect the study's outcomes.",

Firstly, \"Patient must have given their free and informed consent or included by emergency procedure.\" Informed consent is essential to ensure that patients understand the study procedures and potential risks. In emergency situations where the patient is unable to provide consent, an emergency procedure may be necessary to include them in the study. Secondly, \"Patient signed the consent form or included by emergency procedure.\" This criterion ensures that patients are aware of their participation in the study and have the opportunity to withdraw if they choose. What do you think?",

Based on the title and conditions, one important criterion would be patients who are diagnosed with BTC (including IHCC, EHCC, GBC) by histology or cytology. This is necessary to accurately assess the feasibility of using bile cfDNA for these types of carcinomas. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely! Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Informed consent is a fundamental ethical requirement in clinical research. It ensures that participants are fully aware of the study's purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits before agreeing to participate. Therefore, another criterion should be patients who have signed an informed consent form. What are your thoughts on this?",

We should include patients who agree and have the ability to follow the planned research visits, provide surgical tissue, blood, and bile samples, provide clinical information, and cooperate with other research steps. This will ensure that participants are willing and able to comply with the study protocol. What do you think?",
            "Great! We've successfully designed the inclusion criteria. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. One important criterion should be patients who are deemed unsuitable for enrollment by the researchers. This allows the researchers to exclude patients who may not be suitable for the study due to various reasons such as medical conditions that could interfere with the study outcomes or inability to comply with the study requirements. What are your thoughts on this?",

            "Great idea! Patients with ARDS often require invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory support. Including only patients on mechanical ventilation ensures that the study population is similar in terms of disease severity and treatment. Now, for the fourth inclusion criterion, any suggestions?",
            "That's a comprehensive criterion. It's essential for the study to investigate the impact of depth of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in ARDS patients. Including patients who require deep sedation or neuromuscular blockade ensures that the study can assess this relationship effectively. Now, onto the last inclusion criterion. What do you propose?",
            "Good thinking! Since the study involves the use of monitoring devices such as Masimo O3 NIRS cerebral oximetry and SedLine processed EEG, ensuring that the application of these devices is feasible in all included patients is crucial for the successful implementation of the study. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. What ideas do you have for the first exclusion criterion?",

Excluding these patients helps maintain the homogeneity of the study population. Now, let's discuss the second exclusion criterion. Any thoughts?",
            "That's an important consideration. Including patients who are expected to die within the next 24 hours would not be appropriate for a research study. It's crucial to ensure patient safety and ethical considerations. Let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. What do you think it should be?",
