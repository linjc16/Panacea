The study involves undergoing ultrasound imaging of the abdomen after tube feeding is inserted to ensure it is in the proper location. Patients will be selected for the study if they are intubated and require tube feeding.

There are no extra risks or burden with this procedure.\nStudy Risk/Benefits: There are no known risks associated with this study, although the ultrasound may show things not related to the tube position, but that is not the purpose of the study. The hope is to determine if ultrasound can be used to help in tube positioning.\nPotential Study Delays and Missed Treatment: Participation in the study will not delay your usual care and will not prevent you from receiving the best care available. As noted above, ultrasound will be used to help in tube placement, but it is not the only way to do so. The usual care you would get will not change.\nStudy Compensation: There is no compensation for participants but the results of the study may help other patients in the future.\nPotential Discomfort: Ultrasound does not cause pain and is not uncomfortable.

So far, we have discussed inclusion and exclusion criteria for subject recruitment. Let's now turn our attention to the next section of the risk-of-bias triangle, selection bias. selection bias. The risk-of-bias triangle. The concept of selection bias is important in planning an RCT to ensure that the results are unbiased, and unfavorable treatment effects can be minimized. The selection bias describes the processes involved with recruiting participants, starting with the initial contact with individuals and ending with their enrollment in the trial. There are two forms of selection bias, selection at time zero and selection at follow-up. Selection at time zero refers to selection bias that occurs before allocation to the intervention or control group, or in other words, when recruiting participants. Selection at follow-up refers to selection bias that occurs after allocation and is related to dropouts, that is, patients who are not adherent to the intervention or follow-up protocol. Selection bias can occur from inadequate concealment of group allocation, leading to selection of participants to receive the intervention or control group based on prognostic factors or known outcome differences. It can also occur from differential enrollment of treatment-related outcomes due to selective dropout, in which dropouts are more likely to have favorable outcomes compared to those who complete the trial. Finally, selection bias can occur from confounding by indication, in which participants who self-select into the study because of their baseline characteristics. It is important to minimize selection bias by adequate randomization to ensure that participants are assigned to groups randomly rather than preferentially selecting higher-risk patients or those with a particular outcome. Let's discuss some strategies to minimize selection bias, beginning with adequate randomization. Adequate randomization. Randomization minimizes selection bias by ensuring that participants are assigned to groups randomly rather than preferentially selecting higher-risk patients or those with a particular outcome. Randomization should use a method that minimizes systematic bias, such as block randomization. Where possible, minimizing the likelihood of participant or investigator bias should be considered during randomization. Luck-of-the-draw should be",

The criteria mention the need for an age >18 years, as it's recommended that individuals be over 18 years old to participate in most clinical trials. The last exclusion criterion is contraindication to temporary interruption of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, except aspirin, which are drugs that thin the blood and therefore increase bleeding risk. Aspirin, however, has antiprotease effects and can be useful to treat underlying inflammation in sarcoidosis participants, so this exclusion criterion is reasonable.\nClinical trials must have inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure participant safety and validity of study results.

Participants with syndromic forms of hearing loss. \n2. Participants with any known congenital or acquired condition affecting hearing, including ototoxic exposure or drugs (e.g. aminoglycoside exposure) known to cause sensorineural hearing loss.\n3. Profound or residual speech or language delays.\n4. Evaluation of candidacy for cochlear implantation or auditory brain implantation, or currently using a cochlear implant or auditory brain implant.\n[Detailed information] - Participants with syndromic forms of hearing loss should be excluded as these genetic conditions are known to cause nonsyndromic hearing loss.  Cochlear or auditory brain implantation will be evaluated as it may interfere with the hearing outcome. Syndromes with variable expressivity make diagnosis complicated and might jeopardize genetic testing interpretations. Speech- language delays may complicate the genetic interpretation and confound the association of the genotype with the phenotype. Please note that this is a subset of the total cohort of affected individuals in which the clinical picture is more complex and would likely impact the generalizability of the results in the remaining participants.    The exclusion of syndromes, cochlear or auditory brain implants, and speech-language delays will reduce the variability in the phenotype and improve the study population for the specific genotypes and associated hearing loss phenotypes, allowing a greater degree of precision in the results and generalizability of the findings across a broader patient population.",
