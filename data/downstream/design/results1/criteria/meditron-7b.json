A case of hepatic encephalopathy in a patient with concomitant hepatopulmonary syndrome and bronchopleural fistula\n\nA B S T R A C THepatic encephalopathy is a complication of cirrhosis due to overstimulation of the central nervous system caused by the blood-brain barrier dysfunction, mainly due to ammonia. In this report, we describe the case of a 56-year-old man who was referred to our service to diagnose hepatic encephalopathy, as he presented a hepatic cyst in the liver and was already on follow-up for hepatopulmonary syndrome, a severe complication of cirrhotic liver. In the context of acute renal failure refractory to conventional treatments and with the suspicion of overstimulation of the central nervous system, neurologists recommended an extensive investigation of the encephalopathic syndromes of our patient. At this point, he began to show signs of bronchial obstruction, such as cough and dyspnea, with subsequent diagnosis of bronchopleural fistula by thoracic tomography. This case highlights the importance of the clinical examination of cirrhotic patients, which can reveal other conditions that can coexist in these patients through their symptoms.\n\n# Introduction\nHepatic encephalopathy results from liver insufficiency and/or portal hypertension due to dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier. The pathophysiology involves ammonia excretion and protein catabolism and the inflammatory response   Neuroimaging in hepatic encephalopathy, Riggio  .\nThe syndrome is classified according to its severity and course into: minimal hepatic en",
            "HPV vaccination.\n\n Women are disproportionately affected by HPV types 16 and 18, which cause more than 60% of cervical cancers. Vaccination against HPV infections may lessen the incidence and severity of neoplasia. The HPV vaccine is undergoing clinical trials, and the first clinical trial with a prophylactic HPV vaccine in women is currently under way in Italy. The efficacy and impact of this vaccine on cervical cancer rates is still undetermined. The vaccine being tested has no effect on current HPV infections but may prevent future infections. A review of the current science of HPV prophylaxis is presented in this article.\n Effects of Eicosapentaenoic Acid on Graft Survival and Metabolism Assessed by 1H-NMR Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry in a New Rat Kidney Graft Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Model\n\nCitation: Schepers, A.; van Vliet, E.; De Groot, N.-M.; Smits, D.; Kranenburg, O.V.A.; van der Heide, J.A.; Leferink, H.L.; Nauta, J.; Van der Laan, L.J.W.; Bouwstra, J.A.; et al. Effects of Eicosapentaenoic Acid on Graft Survival and Metabolism Assessed by 1 H-NMR Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry in a New Rat Kidney Graft Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Model. Nutrients 2023, 15, 504.Abstract: Delayed graft function (DGF) and post-transplant acute kidney injury (ATI-AKI) are common complications after deceased donor kidney transplantation. Both DGF and ATI-AKI correlate with decreased graft survival and may be associated with an inflammatory response. In this study, we used a new rat kidney warm perfusion and reperfusion model combined with in-life 1 H-NMR spect"

            "Absolutely! The requirement for neoplastic lesion containing \u2265 70% neoplastic cells ensures that the samples used for mutational and epigenetic analysis are of high quality and contain enough neoplastic cells for accurate assessment. This criterion helps to minimize potential errors or inaccuracies in the analysis, thus improving the reliability of the study results. Does that clarify the importance of this criterion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the information provided, here's what I suggest for the exclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis.\n2. Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these exclusion criteria?",
            "Excellent! So here's the complete set of criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage III-IVa OPSCC, according to AJCC 7th Edition.\n2. Managed with definitive treatment modality (either radical surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy \u00b1 chemotherapy or definitive chemo-radiotherapy).\n3. Minimum follow up of 2 years or who had disease recurrence within 2 years after the end of treatment.\n4. Neoplastic lesion contains \u2265 70% neoplastic cells.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis.\n2. Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible.\n\nPlease make sure to document these criteria accurately. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
