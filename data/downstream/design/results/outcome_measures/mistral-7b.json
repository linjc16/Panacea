            "Great! The secondary outcome measures we have selected are:\n\n1. Progression-free Survival (PFS): This measure will help us determine the time it takes for the tumor to progress or worsen in participants who did not achieve an objective response.\n2. Overall Survival (OS): This measure will help us determine the time it takes for participants to die from any cause.\n3. Quality of Life (QoL): This measure will help us assess the impact of the treatment on participants' quality of life.\n4. Pharmacokinetics: This measure will help us assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the drugs in the body.\n5. Pharmacodynamics: This measure will help us assess the biological effects of the drugs on the body.\n\nThese secondary outcome measures will complement the primary outcome measure by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the treatment on participants. They will help us evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment, as well as its long-term efficacy.",
            "Another secondary outcome measure is the Pharmacokinetic Profile of Voyager V1 and Cemiplimab. This measure will help us understand how the combination treatment affects the pharmacokinetics of both drugs. It's important for optimizing the dosing regimen and ensuring that the drugs are being absorbed and metabolized as expected. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "Yes, it's important to understand the pharmacokinetics of the treatments to optimize the dosing regimen and ensure the efficacy of the treatment. Additionally, we have also included the Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis, which involves assessing the biological activity of the treatment using various biomarkers such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1. This measure will help us understand the pharmacodynamics of the treatment and its impact on the immune system. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "I'm glad you agree! These secondary outcome measures will complement the primary outcome measure by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment's efficacy and safety. By evaluating these measures, we can gain valuable insights into the treatment's mechanism of action and potential long-term effects."

            "One of the secondary outcome measures is the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0. This measure focuses on monitoring the safety and tolerability of the treatment by evaluating any adverse events that may occur during the study. It's essential for ensuring patient safety throughout the trial. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "Absolutely! Another secondary outcome measure is the Serum concentration time, which involves assessing the serum concentration data using RT-PCR for VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels. This measure will help us understand the pharmacokinetics of the treatments and their distribution in the body. What do you think about this measure?",
            "Lastly, we have the measure to investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression. This measure aims to understand the biological effects of VV1 on the immune system and its potential mechanism of action. It will provide insights into how the treatment interacts with the immune response. How do you feel about this measure?",
            "Great! We have now discussed the primary and secondary outcome measures for the Phase 2 Trial of Voyager V1 in Combination With Cemiplimab in Cancer Patients. Here are the full outcome measures:\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Objective response rate (ORR) per imaging assessment: Percentage of participants with objective response assessed every six weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 through disease progression, within 24 months.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0: Safety and tolerability within 24 months.\n- Serum concentration time: Serum concentration data using RT-PCR of VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels within 24 months.\n- To investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2: To investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression within 24 months."
