The primary outcome measures include evaluating the feasibility and safety of the study procedures, the recruitment rate, the ability to randomize patients, and the data collection of various surgical parameters. The secondary outcome measures cover a wide range of clinical outcomes, quality of life assessments, and safety evaluations.\n\nSince the model output does not mention any of the specific outcome measures listed in the groundtruth table, I cannot conclude that the outcome measures from the model's output are fully included in the groundtruth outcome measures. Therefore, the match prediction is 0, indicating that the outcome measures mentioned in the model's output are not present in the full table of groundtruth outcome measures."
