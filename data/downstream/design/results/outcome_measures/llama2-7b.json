            "Great! The secondary outcome measures we have selected are:\n\n1. Progression-Free Survival (PFS): This measure will assess the length of time during which the tumor does not grow or progress after treatment.\n2. Time to Response (TTR): This measure will evaluate the time it takes for the tumor to respond to treatment.\n3. Duration of Response (DOR): This measure will assess the length of time during which the tumor remains in remission after the initial response to treatment.\n4. Overall Survival (OS): This measure will evaluate the length of time from the start of treatment until death from any cause.\n5. Adverse Event Profile: This measure will assess the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with the treatments.\n6. Quality of Life (QoL): This measure will evaluate the impact of the treatments on the participant's quality of life, including physical, emotional, and social well-being.\n7. Biomarker Analysis: This measure will assess the levels of specific biomarkers in the blood or tissue before and after treatment, to help understand the mechanism of action of the treatments.\n\nThese secondary outcome measures will provide additional information on the safety and efficacy of the combination treatment, and will help us to better understand how it works, and how it can be optimized.\n\nDo you have any questions about these measures?",
            "Absolutely! Another secondary outcome measure we have selected is the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Voyager V1 in combination with cemiplimab. This measure will help us determine the highest dose of Voyager V1 that can be safely administered in combination with cemiplimab without causing unacceptable toxicity. This information will be valuable in designing future clinical trials and optimizing the treatment regimen. What do you think about this measure?",
            "Exactly! By analyzing the serum concentration data, we can gain insights into how the treatments are distributed and cleared from the body, which can help us optimize the dosing and administration regimens. Additionally, this measure can help us identify potential drug interactions or toxicities that may arise from the combination of VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and cemiplimab.\n\nNow, let's move on to the next secondary outcome measure. We have selected the Progression-Free Survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST 1.1. This measure will help us evaluate the efficacy of the treatment in terms of tumor shrinkage or stability over time. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "I completely agree! By assessing the pharmacodynamics of VV1, we can gain a deeper understanding of how it works at the molecular level and how it can be optimized for maximum efficacy. This information can also help us identify potential biomarkers for treatment response, which can be used to improve patient selection and monitoring.\n\nIn addition to these measures, we will also be conducting a range of exploratory analyses to identify potential biomarkers for treatment response and to better understand the safety profile of VV1. These analyses will include immune-related biomarkers, such as changes in immune cell populations and cytokine levels, as well as clinical and laboratory measures of treatment response.\n\nOverall, I believe that this comprehensive approach to evaluating VV1 will provide valuable insights into its mechanism of action and its potential as a treatment for cancer. By combining these measures with clinical data, we can gain a more complete understanding of VV1's efficacy and safety profile, and ultimately improve patient outcomes."

            "One of the secondary outcome measures is the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0. This measure focuses on monitoring the safety and tolerability of the treatment by evaluating any adverse events that may occur during the study. It's essential for ensuring patient safety throughout the trial. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "Absolutely! Another secondary outcome measure is the Serum concentration time, which involves assessing the serum concentration data using RT-PCR for VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels. This measure will help us understand the pharmacokinetics of the treatments and their distribution in the body. What do you think about this measure?",
            "Lastly, we have the measure to investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression. This measure aims to understand the biological effects of VV1 on the immune system and its potential mechanism of action. It will provide insights into how the treatment interacts with the immune response. How do you feel about this measure?",
            "Great! We have now discussed the primary and secondary outcome measures for the Phase 2 Trial of Voyager V1 in Combination With Cemiplimab in Cancer Patients. Here are the full outcome measures:\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Objective response rate (ORR) per imaging assessment: Percentage of participants with objective response assessed every six weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 through disease progression, within 24 months.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0: Safety and tolerability within 24 months.\n- Serum concentration time: Serum concentration data using RT-PCR of VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels within 24 months.\n- To investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2: To investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression within 24 months."
