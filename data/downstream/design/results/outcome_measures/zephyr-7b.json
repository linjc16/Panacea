            "Excellent choices! By incorporating these secondary outcome measures, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the study population and identify potential predictors of adverse outcomes. Monitoring these parameters over time will provide valuable longitudinal data to track disease progression, response to treatment, and overall prognosis in HFpEF patients. This information will be crucial for risk stratification and tailored management strategies. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the outcome measures?",
