            "One of the secondary outcome measures is the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0. This measure focuses on monitoring the safety and tolerability of the treatment by evaluating any adverse events that may occur during the study. It's essential for ensuring patient safety throughout the trial. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "Absolutely! Another secondary outcome measure is the Serum concentration time, which involves assessing the serum concentration data using RT-PCR for VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels. This measure will help us understand the pharmacokinetics of the treatments and their distribution in the body. What do you think about this measure?",
            "Lastly, we have the measure to investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression. This measure aims to understand the biological effects of VV1 on the immune system and its potential mechanism of action. It will provide insights into how the treatment interacts with the immune response. How do you feel about this measure?",
            "Great! We have now discussed the primary and secondary outcome measures for the Phase 2 Trial of Voyager V1 in Combination With Cemiplimab in Cancer Patients. Here are the full outcome measures:\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Objective response rate (ORR) per imaging assessment: Percentage of participants with objective response assessed every six weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 through disease progression, within 24 months.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0: Safety and tolerability within 24 months.\n- Serum concentration time: Serum concentration data using RT-PCR of VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels within 24 months.\n- To investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2: To investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression within 24 months."
