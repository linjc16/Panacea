            "That's a great plan for the secondary outcome measures. By collecting this data at baseline and during follow-up visits, you'll be able to identify any changes or trends over time, which could provide valuable insights into the progression of HFpEF and the effectiveness of your intervention. Additionally, you may want to consider collecting data on patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and symptom burden, as these measures can also be important in understanding the impact of HFpEF on patients' daily lives. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!",

            "Excellent choices! By incorporating these secondary outcome measures, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the study population and identify potential predictors of adverse outcomes. Monitoring these parameters over time will provide valuable longitudinal data to track disease progression, response to treatment, and overall prognosis in HFpEF patients. This information will be crucial for risk stratification and tailored management strategies. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the outcome measures?",
