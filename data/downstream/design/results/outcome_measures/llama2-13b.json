            "Great! The secondary outcome measures we have selected include:\n\n1. Duration of Response (DoR): This measure will assess the length of time during which the tumor remains in remission after achieving a response.\n2. Disease Control Rate (DCR): This measure will evaluate the percentage of participants who experience a complete response, partial response, or stable disease for at least 6 months.\n3. Progression-Free Survival (PFS): This measure will assess the length of time during which the disease does not progress after treatment.\n4. Overall Survival (OS): This measure will evaluate the length of time from the start of treatment until death from any cause.\n5. Adverse Event Profile: This measure will assess the safety of the combination treatment by evaluating the incidence and severity of adverse events.\n6. Pharmacokinetics: This measure will evaluate the concentration of the drugs in the blood over time and how they are metabolized by the body.\n7. Pharmacodynamics: This measure will assess the effects of the drugs on specific biomarkers and molecular targets.\n\nThese secondary outcome measures will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment's efficacy and safety profile, and will help us to better understand the effects of the combination treatment on the tumor and the body as a whole.\n\nWhat do you think about these secondary outcome measures? Do you have any suggestions or questions?",
            "Absolutely! Another secondary outcome measure we have selected is the Change from Baseline in PD-L1 Expression on Tumor Cells at Week 12. This measure will help us evaluate the effect of the combination treatment on the expression of the PD-L1 protein on tumor cells. This is an important biomarker for immunotherapy, and assessing its change over time can provide valuable insights into the treatment's mechanism of action. Your thoughts?",
            "Exactly! Additionally, we have also included the Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) assessment as a secondary outcome measure. This will help us monitor for any potential immune-related side effects of the treatments, such as inflammation or damage to organs.\n\nAnother important secondary outcome measure is the Quality of Life (QoL) assessment using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. This will help us evaluate the impact of the treatments on the patients' overall quality of life, including their physical, emotional, and social well-being.\n\nFinally, we will also assess the Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaires. These questionnaires will provide valuable insights into the patients' subjective experiences and symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.\n\nOverall, these secondary outcome measures will provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of the treatments on the patients' cancer, quality of life, and overall well-being.",
            "Great! All of these secondary outcome measures will provide valuable insights into the safety and efficacy of the combination treatment, and help us better understand the mechanisms of action of VV1 and cemiplimab. By evaluating these measures, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment's potential benefits and risks, and make informed decisions about its future development.\n\nNow, let's discuss the sample size calculation for the study. Based on the primary and secondary outcome measures, what do you think would be an appropriate sample size for the study?"

            "One of the secondary outcome measures is the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0. This measure focuses on monitoring the safety and tolerability of the treatment by evaluating any adverse events that may occur during the study. It's essential for ensuring patient safety throughout the trial. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "Absolutely! Another secondary outcome measure is the Serum concentration time, which involves assessing the serum concentration data using RT-PCR for VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels. This measure will help us understand the pharmacokinetics of the treatments and their distribution in the body. What do you think about this measure?",
            "Lastly, we have the measure to investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression. This measure aims to understand the biological effects of VV1 on the immune system and its potential mechanism of action. It will provide insights into how the treatment interacts with the immune response. How do you feel about this measure?",
            "Great! We have now discussed the primary and secondary outcome measures for the Phase 2 Trial of Voyager V1 in Combination With Cemiplimab in Cancer Patients. Here are the full outcome measures:\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Objective response rate (ORR) per imaging assessment: Percentage of participants with objective response assessed every six weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 through disease progression, within 24 months.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0: Safety and tolerability within 24 months.\n- Serum concentration time: Serum concentration data using RT-PCR of VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels within 24 months.\n- To investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2: To investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression within 24 months."
