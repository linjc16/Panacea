            "Great! The secondary outcome measures for the Phase 2 Trial of Voyager V1 in combination with cemiplimab in cancer patients are:\n\n1. Duration of Response: This measure will help us understand how long the treatment effect lasts in responding patients.\n\n2. Progression-Free Survival (PFS): This measure will provide information on how long the treatment delays or prevents the disease from getting worse.\n\n3. Overall Survival (OS): This measure will help us understand how long the patients live after starting the treatment.\n\n4. Safety: We will closely monitor and assess the adverse events and serious adverse events related to the treatment. This will help us understand the safety profile of the combination treatment.\n\n5. Pharmacokinetics: This measure will help us understand how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and eliminates the treatments.\n\n6. Pharmacodynamics: This measure will help us understand the effect of the treatments on the body's physiological processes.\n\nThese secondary outcome measures complement the primary outcome measure by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the treatment's efficacy and safety.",
            "Great! Another secondary outcome measure is the Duration of Response, which will be assessed from the first date of response until the date of the first occurrence of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. This measure will help us understand how long the treatment effect lasts in responding patients.\n\nWe will also assess the Progression-Free Survival (PFS), which is the time from the start of treatment until the first occurrence of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. This measure will provide information on how well the treatment can delay or prevent the progression of cancer.\n\nLastly, we will evaluate the Overall Survival (OS), which is the time from the start of treatment until death due to any cause. This measure will give us an understanding of the impact of the treatment on patient survival.\n\nThese secondary outcome measures will provide a more comprehensive view of the treatment's efficacy and safety. Do you have any questions or concerns about these measures?",
            "Great! Another secondary outcome measure is the Pharmacodynamic biomarkers, which involve assessing the biomarkers related to the immune response and tumor response. This measure will help us understand the mechanism of action of the combination treatment and its impact on the immune system. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "I'm glad you agree! In summary, the outcome measure design for the Phase 2 Trial of Voyager V1 in combination with cemiplimab includes the primary outcome measure of Objective Response Rate (ORR) per imaging assessment and secondary outcome measures of Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Serum concentration time, and Pharmacodynamics of VV1. This comprehensive design will provide valuable insights into the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action of the combination treatment, ultimately helping to inform future clinical trials and potential therapeutic options for cancer patients."

            "One of the secondary outcome measures is the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0. This measure focuses on monitoring the safety and tolerability of the treatment by evaluating any adverse events that may occur during the study. It's essential for ensuring patient safety throughout the trial. What are your thoughts on this measure?",
            "Absolutely! Another secondary outcome measure is the Serum concentration time, which involves assessing the serum concentration data using RT-PCR for VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels. This measure will help us understand the pharmacokinetics of the treatments and their distribution in the body. What do you think about this measure?",
            "Lastly, we have the measure to investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression. This measure aims to understand the biological effects of VV1 on the immune system and its potential mechanism of action. It will provide insights into how the treatment interacts with the immune response. How do you feel about this measure?",
            "Great! We have now discussed the primary and secondary outcome measures for the Phase 2 Trial of Voyager V1 in Combination With Cemiplimab in Cancer Patients. Here are the full outcome measures:\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Objective response rate (ORR) per imaging assessment: Percentage of participants with objective response assessed every six weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 through disease progression, within 24 months.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events assessed by CTCAE v5.0: Safety and tolerability within 24 months.\n- Serum concentration time: Serum concentration data using RT-PCR of VSV-IFN\u03b2-NIS and systemic cemiplimab levels within 24 months.\n- To investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2: To investigate the pharmacodynamics of VV1 by measuring serum IFN\u03b2 expression within 24 months."
