            "The combination of IT VV1 and IV cemiplimab in the melanoma arm was chosen because IT VV1 has shown promising results in previous clinical trials for melanoma, and cemiplimab is a PD-1 inhibitor that has also shown efficacy in treating melanoma. The combination of these two therapies is intended to enhance the anti-tumor response and improve patient outcomes.\n\nIT VV1 is a personalized neoantigen-based therapy that is designed to stimulate an immune response against the patient's own cancer cells. By using a personalized approach, IT VV1 can target specific mutations in the patient's tumor that are most likely to be recognized by the immune system.\n\nCemiplimab, on the other hand, is a PD-1 inhibitor that works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which is expressed on the surface of T cells. By blocking PD-1, cemiplimab can help to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells.\n\nBy combining these two therapies, the researchers hope to create a synergistic effect that will enhance the anti-tumor response and improve patient outcomes. The combination of IT VV1 and cemiplimab has the potential to provide a more effective and targeted approach to treating melanoma, and may help to overcome some of the limitations of current treatments.",
            "The head and neck SCC arm is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VV1 in combination with cemiplimab in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who have progressed following previous treatment. This arm is focused on patients who have limited treatment options and are in need of new and innovative therapies.",
            "The colorectal carcinoma arm is designed for patients who have progressed after previous treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The combination of VV1 and cemiplimab aims to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety in this patient population.",
            "Certainly! Here are the full details of the study arms for the Phase 2 trial of VV1 in combination with cemiplimab:\n\n**Melanoma Arm**\n\n* Patients must have stage III or IV melanoma that has progressed after prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy\n* Treatment: VV1 (intra-tumoral) and cemiplimab (intravenous)\n* Dose escalation: VV1: 1-3 x 10^8 CFU/mL; cemiplimab: 350 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks\n* Primary endpoint: Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1\n* Secondary endpoints: Duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, and pharmacokinetics\n\n**Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) Arm**\n\n* Patients must have stage III or IV HNSCC that has not received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy\n* Treatment: VV1 (intra-tumoral) and cemiplimab (intravenous)\n* Dose escalation: VV1: 1-3 x 10^8 CFU/mL; cemiplimab: 350 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks\n* Primary endpoint: ORR according to RECIST v1.1\n* Secondary endpoints: DoR, PFS, OS, safety, and pharmacokinetics\n\n**Colorectal Carcinoma Arm**\n\n* Patients must have metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed after prior standard therapies\n* Treatment: VV1 (intra-tumoral) and cemiplimab (intravenous)\n* Dose escalation: VV1: 1-3 x 10^8 CFU/mL; cemiplimab: 350 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks\n* Primary endpoint: ORR according to RECIST v1.1\n* Second",
