            "The combination of intratumoral (IT) VV1 and intravenous (IV) cemiplimab was chosen for the melanoma arm because of the potential synergistic effects of these treatments. VV1 is a cancer-targeting platform technology that delivers a payload of cytokine genes directly into the tumor, while cemiplimab is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody that helps the immune system attack cancer cells. By combining these treatments, the study aims to enhance the immune response against the tumor and potentially improve treatment outcomes for patients with melanoma.",
            "The head and neck SCC arm is also focused on patients who have previously received anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and shown progression. The combination of VV1 and cemiplimab is used in this arm to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety in this specific patient population.",
            "The colorectal carcinoma arm is designed for patients who have previously received anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and shown progression. The combination of VV1 and cemiplimab is used to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety in this patient population.",
            "Sure, here are the full details of the study arms:\n\n1. Melanoma Arm:\n- Patients: Those with melanoma who have progressed on anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.\n- Intervention: Intratumoral (IT) VV1 and intravenous (IV) cemiplimab.\n- Objective: To evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of the combination in this patient population.\n\n1. Head and Neck SCC Arm:\n- Patients: Those with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have not received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.\n- Intervention: Intratumoral (IT) VV1 and intravenous (IV) cemiplimab.\n- Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of the combination in this specific cohort.\n\n1. Colorectal Carcinoma Arm:\n- Patients: Those with colorectal carcinoma who have progressed on standard therapies.\n- Intervention: Intratumoral (IT) VV1 and intravenous (IV) cemiplimab.\n- Objective: To evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of the combination in this patient population.\n\nPlease note that these details are based on the information provided and may not be the complete or final study design. It's always recommended to refer to the original study protocol for the most accurate and up-to-date information.",
