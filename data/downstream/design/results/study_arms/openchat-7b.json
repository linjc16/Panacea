Treatment Arm: Participants in this group will receive the subconjunctival aflibercept injection as the primary intervention. This group will be further divided into subgroups based on the dosage or frequency of the injections. For example:\n* Aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks\n* Aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks\n* Aflibercept 2 mg every 12 weeks\n1. Control Arm: Participants in this group will receive an alternative treatment or a placebo. This could be another medication, a different dosage of aflibercept, or a sham injection. The control group will help you compare the effectiveness of the aflibercept injection to other treatments.\n\nYou may also consider adding additional arms to the study, such as:\n\n1. Combination Arm: Participants in this group will receive the aflibercept injection in combination with another treatment (e.g., anti-VEGF therapy). This arm will help you determine if the combination of treatments is more effective than the aflibercept injection alone.\n2. Observational Arm: Participants in this group will not receive any treatment but will be monitored to observe the natural progression of the disease. This arm can provide valuable information on the disease's progression without intervention.\n\nPlease note that the design of your study arms will depend on the specific objectives of your clinical trial, the available treatments, and the ethical considerations.

Pozelimab Q4W + Cemdisiran: This arm combines Pozelimab, an anti-CD59 monoclonal antibody, administered every four weeks (Q4W) with Cemdisiran, an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic targeting complement factor D (CFD). The rationale behind this combination is that Pozelimab inhibits the protective function of CD59 on the surface of red blood cells, making them more susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. Cemdisiran, on the other hand, targets CFD, a key enzyme in the alternative pathway of the complement cascade.

This arm allows the investigators to explore the potential benefits of a more frequent dosing regimen of Pozelimab in combination with Cemdisiran.\n\nThe parallel assignment in the intervention model means that participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two study arms, ensuring that the effects of the combination treatment can be compared between the two groups.
