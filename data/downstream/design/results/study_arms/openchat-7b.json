Treatment Arm: Participants in this group will receive the subconjunctival aflibercept injection as the primary intervention. This group will be further divided into subgroups based on the dosage or frequency of the injections. For example:\n* Aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks\n* Aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks\n* Aflibercept 2 mg every 12 weeks\n1. Control Arm: Participants in this group will receive an alternative treatment or a placebo. This could be another medication, a different dosage of aflibercept, or a sham injection. The control group will help you compare the effectiveness of the aflibercept injection to other treatments.\n\nYou may also consider adding additional arms to the study, such as:\n\n1. Combination Arm: Participants in this group will receive the aflibercept injection in combination with another treatment (e.g., anti-VEGF therapy). This arm will help you determine if the combination of treatments is more effective than the aflibercept injection alone.\n2. Observational Arm: Participants in this group will not receive any treatment but will be monitored to observe the natural progression of the disease. This arm can provide valuable information on the disease's progression without intervention.\n\nPlease note that the design of your study arms will depend on the specific objectives of your clinical trial, the available treatments, and the ethical considerations.

Pozelimab Q4W + Cemdisiran: This arm combines Pozelimab, an anti-CD59 monoclonal antibody, administered every four weeks (Q4W) with Cemdisiran, an RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic targeting complement factor D (CFD). The rationale behind this combination is that Pozelimab inhibits the protective function of CD59 on the surface of red blood cells, making them more susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. Cemdisiran, on the other hand, targets CFD, a key enzyme in the alternative pathway of the complement cascade.

This arm allows the investigators to explore the potential benefits of a more frequent dosing regimen of Pozelimab in combination with Cemdisiran.\n\nThe parallel assignment in the intervention model means that participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two study arms, ensuring that the effects of the combination treatment can be compared between the two groups.

            "Certainly. The design of the experimental study arm involving Alirocumab and Cemiplimab is based on the rationale that combining these two therapies may provide a more effective treatment for patients with metastatic, refractory non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed on prior PD-1 directed therapy.\n\nAlirocumab is an anti-PCSK9 antibody that reduces the production of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme PCSK9. This can lead to increased levels of LDL receptors on the surface of liver cells, which in turn increases the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the blood. High levels of LDL cholesterol have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a common comorbidity in patients with cancer.\n\nCemiplimab is an anti-PD-1 antibody that blocks the interaction between the PD-1 receptor on T cells and the PD-L1 ligand on tumor cells. This interaction is a key mechanism of immune checkpoint inhibition, which can lead to the activation and proliferation of T cells that recognize and attack cancer cells.\n\nThe combination of Alirocumab and Cemiplimab is based on the hypothesis that the reduction of LDL cholesterol by Alirocumab may enhance the anti-tumor activity of Cemiplimab. This is because high levels of LDL cholesterol have been shown to be associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, characterized by the presence of regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. By reducing LDL cholesterol, Alirocumab may potentially modulate the tumor microenvironment to make it more conducive to the anti-tumor activity of Cemiplimab.\n\nIn addition, preclinical studies have suggested that the combination of PCSK9 inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade may have synergistic effects on tumor growth inhibition and survival. This has led to the design of this experimental study arm to test the efficacy and safety of this combination in patients with metastatic, refractory non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed on prior PD-1 directed therapy.",
            "The dosing schedules for Alirocumab and Cemiplimab in this study arm are determined based on the established safety and efficacy profiles of these drugs in their respective indications.\n\nAlirocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor, is typically administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 mg every two weeks. This dosing schedule is based on clinical trials that have demonstrated its efficacy in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.\n\nCemiplimab, a PD-1 inhibitor, is typically administered intravenously at a dose of 350 mg every three weeks. This dosing schedule is based on clinical trials that have demonstrated its efficacy in treating various types of cancer, including metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nIn the experimental study arm, the combination of Alirocumab and Cemiplimab is administered according to these established dosing schedules. The rationale behind this approach is to leverage the known safety and efficacy profiles of these drugs while exploring their potential synergistic effects in overcoming immune checkpoint blockade resistance in patients with metastatic, refractory non-small cell lung cancer.",

Placebo Comparator: Placebo\n- Participant Group/Arm: Participants who received placebo matched to dupilumab.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Participants received placebo injections subcutaneously on Day 1 followed by placebo injections once every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, in addition to background therapy of topical corticosteroids/topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCS/TCI) at a stable dose.\nReasoning: The inclusion of a placebo arm is essential to assess the true efficacy of the investigational drug, dupilumab, in comparison to no treatment. By including a placebo arm, researchers can control for the placebo effect and ensure that any observed effects are due to the active drug rather than other factors.\n\n2. Experimental: Dupilumab 300 mg Q2W\n- Participant Group/Arm: Participants who received dupilumab treatment.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Participants received dupilumab injections at a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1 followed by dupilumab injections of 300 mg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, along with background therapy of TCS/TCI at a stable dose.\nReasoning: This arm is the experimental group where the investigational drug, dupilumab, is administered to evaluate its efficacy and safety in treating prurigo nodularis. By comparing the outcomes in this arm to the placebo arm, researchers can determine the effectiveness of dupilumab in improving itch response, skin lesions, and quality of life in patients with inadequately controlled PN. Additionally, the inclusion of background therapy ensures that the effects of dupilumab can be evaluated in combination with standard treatments for PN.",

Unmet need: There is a significant unmet need for effective treatments for patients with recurrent symptomatic malignant ascites, as current options have limitations in terms of efficacy and duration of response.\n2. Targeting the VEGF pathway: Aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) trap that inhibits the VEGF pathway, which is involved in the development of malignant ascites. By targeting this pathway, the study aims to reduce the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity and improve patient symptoms.\n3. Previous positive results: Aflibercept has shown promising results in other cancer indications, such as metastatic colorectal cancer, where it has been shown to improve progression-free survival and overall survival. This provides a rationale for evaluating its potential in ovarian cancer patients with malignant ascites.\n4. Addressing a significant clinical problem: Malignant ascites is a debilitating condition that can lead to reduced quality of life and increased healthcare utilization.

Patients are randomly assigned to one of two groups: the treatment group or the control group. Both groups receive the same number of treatments, but the treatment group receives the investigational drug (SAR153191), while the control group receives a placebo.
