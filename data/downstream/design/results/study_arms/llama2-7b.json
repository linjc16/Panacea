            "The melanoma arm of the study was designed to include IT VV1 and IV cemiplimab because these treatments have shown promise in preclinical studies as a potential combination therapy for melanoma.\n\nIT VV1 is a type of immunotherapy that works by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells. It has been shown to be effective in treating melanoma in early-stage clinical trials.\n\nIV cemiplimab is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by blocking a protein called PD-1 on immune cells, which can help to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells. It has also shown promise in early-stage clinical trials for the treatment of melanoma.\n\nBy combining IT VV1 and IV cemiplimab, the study aims to enhance the immune response against melanoma and improve treatment outcomes. The combination of these two therapies may also help to overcome any resistance to treatment that may develop over time.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific combination of treatments in the melanoma arm of the study is based on the results of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials, and the investigators are evaluating its safety and efficacy in this larger, phase 2 trial.",
            "The head and neck SCC arm is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VV1 and cemiplimab in patients with advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who have progressed after prior therapy. This arm is similar to the melanoma arm in terms of the combination of treatments, with the addition of VV1 being administered intratumorally (IT) in addition to the intravenous (IV) administration of cemiplimab. The IT administration of VV1 is intended to enhance the delivery of the drug directly to the tumor site, potentially increasing its anti-tumor activity.",
            "The colorectal carcinoma arm is designed for patients who have not received prior anti-PD-(L)1 treatment. The combination of VV1 and cemiplimab is being evaluated in this arm to assess its efficacy and safety in this patient population.",
            "Of course! Here are the full details of the three study arms for the Phase 2 clinical trial of VV1 in combination with cemiplimab in patients with advanced cancer:\n\n**Melanoma Arm**\n\n* Study design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled\n* Inclusion criteria:\n\t+ Histologically confirmed melanoma that has progressed after prior anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy\n\t+ Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1\n\t+ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1\n\t+ Adequate organ function\n* Exclusion criteria:\n\t+ Prior therapy with VV1 or cemiplimab\n\t+ Active autoimmune disease or a history of autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past 2 years\n\t+ Prior therapy with immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., corticosteroids) within 2 weeks of study drug administration\n\t+ Pregnant or breastfeeding women\n* Study drug: VV1 (100 \u03bcg/mL) + cemiplimab (3 mg/kg) or placebo + cemiplimab (3 mg/kg)\n* Dose and schedule: VV1 and cemiplimab will be administered on days 1 and 22 of a 28-day cycle, or placebo will be administered on days 1 and 22 of a 28-day cycle.\n* Primary endpoint: Objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1\n* Secondary endpoints:\n\t+ Duration of response (DoR)\n\t+ Progression-free survival (PFS)\n\t+ Overall survival (OS)\n\t+ Safety and tolerability\n\t+ Immune-related adverse events (irAEs)\n\t+ Biomarker analysis (e.g., PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden)\n\n**Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) Arm**\n\n* Study design: Randomized",
