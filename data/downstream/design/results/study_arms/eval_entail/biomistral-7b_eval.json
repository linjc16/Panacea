First, primiparous women are more likely to experience perineal trauma during childbirth due to the lack of elasticity in their pelvic floor muscles and connective tissues.

Second, primiparous women are more likely to experience perineal pain during childbirth due to the lack of experience with childbirth.

Third, primiparous women are more likely to experience perineal trauma during childbirth due to the lack of experience with childbirth.

This arm also helps to establish the dose-response relationship and inform future treatment strategies. What are your thoughts?",
