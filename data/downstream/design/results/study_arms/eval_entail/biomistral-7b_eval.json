First, primiparous women are more likely to experience perineal trauma during childbirth due to the lack of elasticity in their pelvic floor muscles and connective tissues.

Second, primiparous women are more likely to experience perineal pain during childbirth due to the lack of experience with childbirth.

Third, primiparous women are more likely to experience perineal trauma during childbirth due to the lack of experience with childbirth.

This arm also helps to establish the dose-response relationship and inform future treatment strategies. What are your thoughts?",

In general, MDRT would be performed after the completion of SOC cytotoxic chemotherapy. This is because the goal of SOC cytotoxic chemotherapy is to reduce the overall tumor burden, while the goal of MDRT is to target specific areas of disease that are PET-avid. By performing MDRT after SOC cytotoxic chemotherapy, it is hoped that the overall tumor burden will be reduced, making it easier to target the remaining disease with MDRT.

It is a behavioral intervention that aims to reduce cough frequency and severity by changing the behavior of the participant. The intervention is delivered online through a website and consists of educational and training videos, as well as training exercises. The videos and exercises are designed to teach participants how to suppress their cough using behavioral techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing, cough re-education, and cough hygiene. Participants are also encouraged to keep a cough journal to track their cough frequency and severity. The intervention is designed to be self-administered, but participants will have access to a study therapist through email and phone to ask questions and receive support. The intervention will last for 12 weeks, and participants will be asked to log into the website and watch the videos and perform the exercises as recommended.",

The energy required to successfully cardiovert the patient will be recorded. The PVI will be performed using a 3D electroanatomical mapping system and a contact force-sensing catheter.

This will help to determine the placebo effect and ensure that any improvements observed in the intervention groups are due to the active treatment and not the placebo effect.
