The training will be conducted three times a week for 6 weeks, with each session lasting 30 minutes.\n\n2. Active Comparator: Standard training\n- Participant Group/Arm: This arm will consist of participants who will undergo standard training.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Participants in this arm will receive training using the standard training protocol, which includes conventional physiotherapy.

The goal is to gradually reduce body weight unloading as participants progress through the intervention period.\n\n2.

This arm allows us to assess the impact of fumigation on bacterial reduction in a real-world dental office setting.",

By comparing the outcomes of this arm with the other study arms, we can determine the efficacy and safety of this specific product.\n\nThe second arm, Experimental: Ampli-01, 6 mg nicotine pouch, is important to evaluate the effects of a higher nicotine concentration (6 mg) in the Ampli-01 product. This arm allows us to compare the outcomes of the 6 mg pouch with the 3 mg pouch and the active comparator, providing valuable information on the dose-response relationship and potential differences in efficacy and safety.\n\nThe third arm, Active Comparator: ZYN Cool Mint Mini Dry, 6 mg nicotine/pouch, serves as a reference point for comparison with the experimental products.

By administering dupilumab to participants with chronic idiopathic DHR, the researchers can evaluate the impact of the drug on the immune response and skin symptoms associated with the condition. This arm is essential for determining the potential benefits of dupilumab in managing DHR and understanding its immunologic effects.",

This study arm design will allow you to evaluate the effects of dupilumab on the immune system and skin biopsies in patients with dermal hypersensitivity reaction. It will provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of the drug in treating this condition. Is there anything else you would like to discuss or any other study arms you would like to design?"

By starting with a lower dose, researchers can evaluate any potential adverse effects or tolerability issues before moving on to higher doses. This arm allows for a gradual escalation of the intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of the participants.\n\n2.

This will allow us to compare the safety and efficacy of the two fasting policies. What do you think?",

The reasoning behind this arm is to test the hypothesis that a shorter fasting time may be safe and effective in children with pediatric ALL. By allowing oral hydration, we can assess the impact of this policy on patient comfort and safety. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
