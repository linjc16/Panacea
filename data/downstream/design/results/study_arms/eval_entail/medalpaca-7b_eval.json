            "The McMurray Enhanced Airway (MEA) is a novel device that is designed to improve oxygenation in patients undergoing procedures where there is a risk of airway obstruction. It is a soft, flexible, and transparent tube that is placed in the mouth and advanced into the pharynx. It has a unique design that allows for a continuous flow of air to the lungs while minimizing the risk of airway obstruction. The nasal cannula is a common device used to deliver oxygen to patients who are at risk of airway obstruction. It is a flexible tube that is placed in the nostril and delivers oxygen to the lungs. The primary endpoint of the study is the oxygen saturation of arterial blood. Secondary endpoints include the time to desaturation, the duration of the procedure, and the incidence of adverse events. The study will be conducted at a single center and will enroll 20 patients. The study duration is 12 months. Would you like to make any changes to the study design?",
