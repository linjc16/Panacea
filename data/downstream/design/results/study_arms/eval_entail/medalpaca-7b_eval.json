            "The McMurray Enhanced Airway (MEA) is a novel device that is designed to improve oxygenation in patients undergoing procedures where there is a risk of airway obstruction. It is a soft, flexible, and transparent tube that is placed in the mouth and advanced into the pharynx. It has a unique design that allows for a continuous flow of air to the lungs while minimizing the risk of airway obstruction. The nasal cannula is a common device used to deliver oxygen to patients who are at risk of airway obstruction. It is a flexible tube that is placed in the nostril and delivers oxygen to the lungs. The primary endpoint of the study is the oxygen saturation of arterial blood. Secondary endpoints include the time to desaturation, the duration of the procedure, and the incidence of adverse events. The study will be conducted at a single center and will enroll 20 patients. The study duration is 12 months. Would you like to make any changes to the study design?",

The model's output describes two study arms:\n\n1. Ondansetron every 3 weeks in combination with aprepitant and dexamethasone\n2. Ondansetron weekly in combination with aprepitant and dexamethasone\n\nThese two study arms are present in the groundtruth study arm table, with the same interventions and treatments described in the model's output.\n\nThe groundtruth study arm table includes the following two study arms:\n\n1. Experimental: Ondansetron every 3 weeks combined with aprepitant and dexamethasone\n2. Experimental: Ondansetron weekly combined with aprepitant and dexamethasone\n\nThe interventions and treatments for these two study arms match the ones described in the model's output, including the use of ondansetron, aprepitant, and dexamethasone.\n\nTherefore, the study arms mentioned in the model's output are fully included in the groundtruth study arm table, and the match prediction is '1'."
