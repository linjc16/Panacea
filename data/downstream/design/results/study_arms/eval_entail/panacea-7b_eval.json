            "Thank you for providing that information. Now, let's move on to designing the study arms. Based on the information you've given me, I suggest the following study arms:\n\n1. Experimental: 3D printed model group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients in this group will receive a preoperative 3D printed model of their distal intra-articular radius fracture.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention in this group is the use of a preoperative 3D printed model of the distal intra-articular radius fracture.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is necessary to evaluate the impact of using a 3D printed model on the quality of fracture reduction. By comparing the outcomes of patients who receive a 3D printed model with those who do not, the researchers can determine if the use of a 3D printed model leads to better fracture reduction.\n\n2. Active Comparator: Conventional group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients in this group will not receive a preoperative 3D printed model of their distal intra-articular radius fracture.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention in this group is the standard surgical procedure without the use of a 3D printed model.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as the control group to compare the outcomes of patients who receive a 3D printed model with those who do not. By including a group that does not receive a 3D printed model, the researchers can assess the effectiveness of using a 3D printed model in improving the quality of fracture reduction.",

            "Absolutely! The experimental group will provide valuable insights into the impact of 3D printing on fracture reduction. By comparing the outcomes between the control group and the experimental group, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the 3D model."
