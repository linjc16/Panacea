Could you explain why it's necessary to have neoplastic lesion containing \u2265 70% neoplastic cells?\n\n### Answer\n\nThe fourth criterion is to ensure that the tissue sample is representative of the tumor.

            "# Introduction\nMusculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) are a group of disorders that affect the muscles, bones, and joints. They are among the most common health conditions worldwide, with an estimated global prevalence of 1.71 billion people. MSDs can cause pain, stiffness, and limited mobility, which can significantly impact a person's quality of life. MSDs can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, age, lifestyle, and environmental factors.\n\n# Background\nMSDs are a significant public health concern, with an estimated global economic burden of $1.7 trillion in 2010. The economic burden of MSDs is expected to increase in the coming years, as the global population ages and the prevalence of MSDs continues to rise. MSDs can have a significant impact on a person's ability to work and participate in daily activities, which can lead to lost productivity and increased healthcare costs.\n\n# Methods\nThis study aims to investigate the prevalence of MSDs in the general population and to identify the factors that contribute to their development. The study will use a cross-sectional design and will be conducted in a large, representative sample of the general population. Participants will be recruited through a variety of methods, including online surveys, community outreach, and healthcare facilities. The study will collect data on a range of factors, including demographics, lifestyle factors, and medical history. The data will be analyzed using statistical methods to identify patterns and associations between the various factors and the prevalence of MSDs.\n\n# Results\nThe results of this study will provide valuable insights into the prevalence of MSDs in the general population and the factors that contribute to their development. The findings will help to inform the development of prevention and management strategies for MSDs, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of individuals and society as a whole.\n\n# Conclusions\nThis study will provide valuable insights into the prevalence of MSDs in the general population and the factors that contribute to their development. The findings will help to inform the development of prevention and management strategies for MSDs, which could have a significant impact",

This list should include all of the criteria that you have identified as being important for the study.\nOnce you have created the list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, you will need to decide how to apply them to potential participants. This can be done in a variety of ways, depending on the study design and the specific criteria that you are using.\nFor example, if you are using a randomized controlled trial design, you may want to apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria to potential participants before they are randomized into the study. This will help to ensure that the study population is representative of the target population and that the results of the study are generalizable to the broader population.\nOn the other hand, if you are using a cross-sectional study design, you may want to apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria to potential participants after they have been enrolled in the study. This will help to ensure that the study population is representative of the target population and that the results of the study are generalizable to the broader population.\nNo matter how you decide to apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria, it is important to be consistent and transparent about how you are doing so. This will help to ensure that the study results are reliable and that the study population is representative of the target population.\nIn conclusion, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are an important part of any study design.
