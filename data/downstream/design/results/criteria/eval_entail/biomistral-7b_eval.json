In this study, we will be collecting tumor tissue samples from the patients and performing whole-exome sequencing and methylation analysis on these samples. To ensure that we are analyzing the tumor cells and not normal cells, we need to have a certain percentage of neoplastic cells in the sample. If the sample contains less than 70% neoplastic cells, it will make it difficult to interpret the results, as we may be analyzing both tumor and normal cells.

Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible.\n\nThese exclusion criteria are directly relevant to the study and help ensure the reliability and accuracy of the research by excluding participants who do not meet the necessary requirements.

            "The first exclusion criterion is that participants who are currently using other cellulite treatments, such as topical creams or laser therapy, should not be included in the trial. This is to avoid any potential confounding effects from other treatments. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",

            "Absolutely. By excluding participants with unusual or abnormal leg swelling, we can minimize potential confounding factors and focus on evaluating the intervention's impact on cellulite. Now, let's move on to the seventh exclusion criterion. Participants with any condition that may affect their ability to comply with the study protocol should be excluded. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. By excluding participants who have had abdominal or leg operations within 1 year, we can minimize the potential confounding effects of recent surgeries on the trial results. Now, let's move on to the eighth and final exclusion criterion. Participants with any other condition that could affect the lymphatic system or skin integrity should be excluded. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

By excluding pregnant participants, we can minimize potential confounding factors and ensure that the trial results are accurately reflecting the effects of the intervention on cellulite. Now, we have discussed all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Do you have any other suggestions or questions before we move on to the outcome measures?",
            "Great! Now that we have finalized the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we can move on to the outcome measures. The primary outcome measure for this trial will be the Cellulase\u00ae Clinical Grading System (CCGS). The CCGS is a validated, objective, and reliable tool for assessing the severity of cellulite. It is based on the grading of five signs of cellulite: reticular pattern, nodules, depressions, edema, and hyperpigmentation. Each sign is graded on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no visible signs and 3 indicating severe signs. The total score ranges from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating more severe cellulite. What are your thoughts on using the CCGS as the primary outcome measure?"
