            "Great. The second exclusion criterion is \"history of significant upper airway disease.\" What do you think about this criterion?",
            "That makes sense. The last exclusion criterion is \"pregnancy.\" What do you think about this criterion?",
            "That's right. Pregnancy can be a risk factor for the procedure, so it's best to exclude participants who are pregnant. Lastly, we have \"allergy to local anesthetics.\" What do you think about this criterion?",
            "That's a good point. Coagulopathy can be dangerous, especially during a bronchoscopy. The last exclusion criterion is \"active infection.\" What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Yes, safety should always be our top priority. So, based on our discussion, we should keep all the exclusion criteria except for \"contraindication to the temporary interruption of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, except aspirin.\" I agree with that.",
            "These criteria were finalized after discussion and agreed upon by all authors.\nThe sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome measure, which was the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis after bronchoscopy. The sample size was calculated using the following formula: n = (Z2 * p*q) / 2, where n is the sample size, Z is the confidence level (95%), p is the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis in the control group (0.1), and q is the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis in the intervention group (0.2). The calculated sample size was 30.\nThe data were analyzed using SPSS version 220.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables, and the Student t-test was used to compare continuous variables. The level of significance was set at 0.05.\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board of the hospital.\nA total of 100 patients were screened for eligibility, and 98 were excluded due to inability or unwillingness to consent, pregnancy, steroid therapy in the previous 2 months, contraindication to temporary interruption of anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, or age >80 years. A total of 20 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the study population was 51.5 \u00b1 12.2 years, and 14 (70%) were female. The mean duration of symptoms was 1.8 \u00b1 1.2 years. The mean FEV1 was 89.2% \u00b1 18.2% of predicted. The mean ATS score was 1.2 \u00b1 0.6. The mean BMI was 24.2 \u00b1 3.2. The mean ATS score was 1.2 \u00b1 0.6. The mean FEV1 was 89.2% \u00b1 18.2% of predicted. The mean BMI was 24.2 \u00b1 3.2. The mean ATS score was 1.2 \u00b1 0.6. The mean FEV1 was"
