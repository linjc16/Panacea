            "Certainly! The fourth criterion is necessary to ensure that the mutational and epigenetic signature is derived from the primary tumor and not from other sources such as metastatic lesions or normal tissue. The percentage of neoplastic cells in the lesion is a measure of the purity of the sample, and a minimum of 70% neoplastic cells is considered sufficient to ensure that the signature is derived from the primary tumor.\n\nHaving a high percentage of neoplastic cells in the sample also increases the accuracy of the mutational and epigenetic analysis, as it reduces the likelihood of contamination from other sources. This is important because the signature is used to predict the risk of relapse, and any contamination could affect the accuracy of the prediction.\n\nIn summary, the fourth criterion is necessary to ensure that the mutational and epigenetic signature is derived from the primary tumor and to increase the accuracy of the analysis.",

This criterion is important as it ensures that participants are in good overall health and are likely to tolerate the intervention. ASA Physical Status I and II are the lowest two levels of the ASA Physical Status Classification System, which is used to assess the risk of anesthesia and surgery. Including only patients with ASA Physical Status I or II reduces the risk of adverse events and ensures that the results of the trial are applicable to the target population. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad to hear that. The fourth inclusion criterion is \"Patients with no prior history of chronic pain or chronic pain medication use\". This criterion is important as it helps in ensuring that the intervention is being tested on patients with a similar baseline pain status. Patients with a history of chronic pain or chronic pain medication use may have different pain responses to the intervention, and including them in the study population could lead to confounding results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is \"Patients with a history of bleeding disorders or taking anticoagulant therapy\". This criterion is important as it helps in reducing the risk of bleeding complications during the intervention. Patients with a history of bleeding disorders or taking anticoagulant therapy may have an increased risk of bleeding, and including them in the study population could compromise the safety of the study. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent. The second exclusion criterion is \"Coagulopathy\". Coagulopathy refers to a condition in which the blood clots abnormally, and can increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Excluding patients with coagulopathy is important to ensure their safety during the intervention. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The third exclusion criterion is \"Coagulopathy\". Coagulopathy is a condition that affects blood clotting and can increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Excluding patients with coagulopathy is important to prevent complications and ensure patient safety during the intervention. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The last exclusion criterion is \"Other surgical procedures\". Excluding patients who are undergoing other surgical procedures is important to ensure that the intervention is focused on the specific condition being studied. Including patients undergoing other procedures could confound the results and affect the outcomes of the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The last exclusion criterion is \"Cardiac surgery under emergency conditions\". Excluding patients undergoing emergency surgery is important as the study is focused on elective cardiac surgery under median sternotomy. Emergency surgeries can introduce confounding variables related to the urgency of the surgery and the patient's overall health status. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Finally, the last exclusion criterion is \"Other surgical procedures\". Excluding patients undergoing other surgical procedures is important to ensure that the study is focused specifically on cardiac surgery under sternotomy. Including patients undergoing other surgeries could introduce confounding variables related to the type and duration of surgery. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The last exclusion criterion is \"Other surgical procedures\". Excluding patients undergoing other surgical procedures is important as the study is focused specifically on cardiac surgery under sternotomy. Including patients undergoing other surgeries could introduce confounding variables and affect the outcomes of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. In summary, the inclusion criteria for this trial include patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery under median sternotomy, age greater than or equal to 18 years, ASA Status I-IV, and approval and sign of informed consent. The exclusion criteria include allergy to local anesthetics, puncture site infection, lack of informed consent, age less than 18 years, emergency surgery, ASA greater than IV, and preoperative acute respiratory failure. These criteria help to ensure the safety and validity of the study by selecting a suitable and homogeneous study population."
