Patients with a history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy for OPSCC.\n4. Patients with a history of immunotherapy for OPSCC.\n5. Patients with a history of other immunotherapy for any other malignancies.\n6. Patients with a history of autoimmune diseases.\n7. Patients with a history of organ transplantation.\n8.

            "Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Now, let's move on to the study design. Based on the information provided, here's what I suggest for the study design:\n\n1. Prospective, observational study.\n2. The study will be conducted at a single institution.\n3. The study will include a total of 100 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage III-IVa OPSCC.\n4. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the participating institution.\n5. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants.\n\nWhat do you think about these study design elements?"

            "Absolutely! The requirement for neoplastic lesion containing \u2265 70% neoplastic cells ensures that the samples used for mutational and epigenetic analysis are of high quality and contain enough neoplastic cells for accurate assessment. This criterion helps to minimize potential errors or inaccuracies in the analysis, thus improving the reliability of the study results. Does that clarify the importance of this criterion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the information provided, here's what I suggest for the exclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis.\n2. Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these exclusion criteria?",
            "Excellent! So here's the complete set of criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage III-IVa OPSCC, according to AJCC 7th Edition.\n2. Managed with definitive treatment modality (either radical surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy \u00b1 chemotherapy or definitive chemo-radiotherapy).\n3. Minimum follow up of 2 years or who had disease recurrence within 2 years after the end of treatment.\n4. Neoplastic lesion contains \u2265 70% neoplastic cells.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis.\n2. Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible.\n\nPlease make sure to document these criteria accurately. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
