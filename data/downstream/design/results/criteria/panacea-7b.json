This is necessary to accurately assess the mutational and epigenetic signature of the tumor. By including only samples with a high percentage of neoplastic cells, we can ensure the reliability and validity of the results.",

            "I'm glad you agree with the exclusion criteria. Now, let's summarize the full criteria for the trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage III-IVa OPSCC, according to AJCC 7th Edition.\n2. Managed with definitive treatment modality (either radical surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy \u00b1 chemotherapy or definitive chemo-radiotherapy).\n3. Minimum follow up of 2 years or who had disease recurrence within 2 years after the end of treatment.\n4. Neoplastic lesion contains \u2265 70% neoplastic cells.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis.\n2. Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible."

            "Absolutely! The requirement for neoplastic lesion containing \u2265 70% neoplastic cells ensures that the samples used for mutational and epigenetic analysis are of high quality and contain enough neoplastic cells for accurate assessment. This criterion helps to minimize potential errors or inaccuracies in the analysis, thus improving the reliability of the study results. Does that clarify the importance of this criterion?",
