Moving on, the next criterion is: \"Adequate organ function.\" This criterion is necessary to ensure that the patients included in the trial have adequate organ function to tolerate the investigational treatment and undergo the necessary assessments required during the study. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Adequate organ function is essential for patient safety and reliable evaluation of treatment outcomes. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\" This criterion is important as it allows for the collection of tumor samples for biomarker analysis and assessment of treatment response. It helps in understanding the mechanism of action of the investigational therapy and identifying potential predictive biomarkers. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "That's a valid concern. While it's ideal to have tumor samples from all participants, we can provide an option for patients who are unable or unwilling to provide pre-treatment or on-treatment tumor biopsy samples. We can include them in a separate subgroup or cohort, as long as the majority of participants consent to providing the necessary samples. This approach will still allow us to gather valuable data while accommodating the preferences and limitations of individual patients. Does that address your concern?",
            "I'm glad you find it reasonable. Now, we have discussed all the key inclusion criteria. Shall we move on to the key exclusion criteria?",
            "Great. The first criterion is: \"Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\" This criterion is important to avoid potential interactions or confounding effects of prior treatments on the safety and efficacy evaluation of the investigational therapy. Do you have any suggestions or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "I agree. Excluding patients who have recently received other therapies helps in isolating the effects of the investigational treatment. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\" This criterion ensures that patients with unresolved toxicities from prior treatments are excluded from the trial to prevent exacerbation of side effects and ensure patient safety. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our primary concern. Now, the next criterion is: \"Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients who may be at higher risk of severe immune-related adverse events with the investigational therapy based on their prior treatment history. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Minimizing the risk of severe adverse events is of utmost importance. Let's move on to the next criterion: \"Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\" This criterion is important to exclude patients with active or recent history of other malignancies that may confound the assessment of the efficacy of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I agree. Maintaining the focus on the specific types of cancer under study is crucial for meaningful evaluation. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients with brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease, as these patients may require specific treatment approaches and have different prognosis compared to patients without central nervous system involvement. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Excluding patients with central nervous system involvement helps maintain the homogeneity of the patient population and facilitates accurate evaluation of the investigational therapy. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\" This criterion is important to ensure patient safety and avoid potential severe allergic reactions to the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our top priority. Now, we have reached the final criterion: \"Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\" This criterion is essential to protect the safety of pregnant women and unborn children, as well as to prevent potential exposure of infants to the investigational therapy through breastfeeding. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Protecting the safety of vulnerable populations is paramount. Based on our discussion, here are the full criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nKey Inclusion Criteria:\n- Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumor.\n- Having received and failed or was intolerant to standard of care for advanced disease or not eligible for standard of care therapy.\n- Measurable disease.\n- ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n- Adequate organ function.\n- Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n- Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\n- Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\n- Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\n- Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\n- Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\n- History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n- Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

This is to ensure that the study results are not influenced by other interventions or treatments. Can we include \"currently participating in another clinical trial\" as the fifth exclusion criterion?",
            "Alright. Moving on, for the sixth exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients who are receiving non-invasive ventilation. Since the study is focused on patients receiving mechanical ventilation via an ETT, it's important to ensure that all participants are receiving the same type of ventilation. Can we include \"patient receiving non-invasive ventilation\" as the sixth exclusion criterion?",

Since patients under guardianship may not be able to provide informed consent for themselves, it's important to ensure that all participants are able to make their own decisions about participation. Can we include \"patient under guardianship\" as the second exclusion criterion?",
            "Good. Now, for the third exclusion criterion, it is suggested to exclude patients who require tidal volumes of less than 250cc. This is to ensure that the participants have similar baseline characteristics and are receiving standard mechanical ventilation settings. Patients requiring very low tidal volumes may have different physiological responses that could confound the study results.

Pregnancy can affect pulmonary health parameters and introduce confounding variables, so excluding pregnant patients helps to ensure that the study results are not influenced by this factor. Can we include \"pregnancy\" as the fourth exclusion criterion?",
            "Very well. Now, for the fifth exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients whose care requires the use of an anesthetic conserving device. The use of such devices may impact pulmonary health parameters and could interfere with the study results. Shall we include \"patient whose care requires the use of an anesthetic conserving device\" as the fifth exclusion criterion?",

This ensures that the study participants are at a stage where they are likely to benefit from either cardioversion or ablation, which are the interventions being studied. What do you think?",
            "Wonderful. Now, let's move on to designing the exclusion criteria. Based on the information provided, I have a few suggestions. The first criterion should be \"Creatinine clearance (eGFR) < 30mls/min.\" This is necessary to exclude individuals with severe kidney impairment, as they may be at increased risk of complications from the interventions being studied. Would you like to include this criterion?",
            "Great choice. The second exclusion criterion I suggest is \"Contraindication or unable to take anticoagulation.\" Anticoagulation therapy is often necessary for patients with AF to prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of stroke. Excluding individuals who are unable to take anticoagulants ensures the safety of the participants. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Excellent. The third exclusion criterion should be \"Uncontrolled hypertension.\" Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of complications during the interventions being studied. Managing hypertension is crucial for the safety of the participants. Would you like to include this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The fourth exclusion criterion I suggest is \"Contraindication for catheter ablation.\" This criterion is necessary to ensure that participants are suitable candidates for the ablation procedure, as contraindications may increase the risk of complications. What do you think?",
            "Great choice. The fifth exclusion criterion I propose is \"BMI > 40.\" This criterion is likely included to exclude individuals who are severely obese, as they may be at increased risk of complications during the interventions being studied. Would you like to include this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. The sixth exclusion criterion should be \"Patients in Persistent AF who have had more than one previous cardioversion.\" Excluding patients who have had multiple previous cardioversions helps to ensure that the study participants have not already been exposed to this intervention multiple times, which could impact the results of the study. What are your thoughts?",
            "Excellent choice. Lastly, the seventh exclusion criterion should be \"Established diagnosis of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\" Individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may have unique considerations and risks related to AF treatment, which could impact the outcomes of the study. Excluding these individuals helps to ensure the safety and validity of the study results. What do you think?",

            "Precisely. This specificity will help us evaluate the intervention's impact on the targeted area. Now, for the third criterion, we should consider the onset of CRPS type I. The maximum duration after the symptomatic event should be limited to three years. What do you think about this time frame?",
            "Excellent point. Limiting the time frame to three years will indeed allow us to focus on the early stages and minimize potential confounding variables. Moving on to the fourth criterion, we should consider pain severity. It's recommended to include participants with a pain intensity of at least 5 on the visual analog scale (VAS) at recruitment. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Exactly. This criterion will ensure that we have participants with a certain level of pain severity, which is crucial for assessing the impact of the treatment. Now, for the final criterion, it is suggested that all participants should have undergone the first infusion cycle of neridronate. What do you think about this requirement?",

            "Alright. The first exclusion criterion is the presence of any neurological pathologies such as stroke, degenerative, or traumatic pathologies. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Exactly. By excluding those with pre-existing neurological pathologies, we can ensure a more accurate assessment of the intervention's effects on CRPS-I. Moving on to the second exclusion criterion, participants with confirmed local neurological impairment (type II CRPS) should be excluded. What do you think about this?",
            "Precisely. By focusing solely on type I CRPS, we can avoid any potential confounding factors related to type II CRPS. Lastly, the third exclusion criterion is having a cardiac pacemaker or treatment site malignancy. This is primarily for the safety of the participants during the trial. What are your thoughts?",

This criterion helps to ensure that the participants have a specific trigger point in a specific muscle, which is characteristic of MPS and is necessary for the targeted treatments being studied. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great. The last inclusion criterion is not receiving any treatment for MPS in the last 1 month. This criterion helps to ensure that the participants have not received any other treatments that could potentially affect the outcomes of the study, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the effects of the interventions being studied. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is serious cervical disc disorders. This criterion is important as individuals with serious cervical disc disorders may have different underlying pathologies that could confound the results of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The second exclusion criterion is the presence of a tumor. Individuals with tumors may have different treatment needs and may experience pain due to the tumor rather than MPS, which could impact the outcomes of the study. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. The third exclusion criterion is the presence of fibromyalgia. Since fibromyalgia is a separate condition from MPS, including individuals with fibromyalgia could introduce confounding variables that may affect the results of the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The next exclusion criterion is the presence of mental or psychotic disorders. Individuals with these conditions may have altered pain perception and treatment responses, which could impact the outcomes of the study. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The fifth exclusion criterion is venous insufficiency. Venous insufficiency could affect the circulation and blood flow in the affected area, potentially influencing the response to the treatments being studied. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. The sixth exclusion criterion is active infection. Active infection could impact the overall health and well-being of the participants, potentially affecting their ability to participate in the study and respond to the treatments. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on, the seventh exclusion criterion is pregnancy. Pregnancy is a unique physiological state that may impact the response to treatments and could introduce additional safety concerns for the participants. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The eighth exclusion criterion is allergic skin diseases. Individuals with allergic skin diseases may have adverse reactions to the treatments being studied, which could impact the outcomes of the study. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. Lastly, the ninth exclusion criterion is acute rheumatic diseases. Acute rheumatic diseases may have symptoms that overlap with MPS, potentially confounding the results of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Great! The fifth criterion is \"No distant metastasis.\" This criterion ensures that patients without distant metastases are included in the trial. This helps ensure that the surgical procedures being compared are appropriate for the stage of cancer being studied. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the sixth criterion: \"No other malignant tumors.\" This criterion ensures that patients with no other malignant tumors are included in the trial. Having other malignant tumors may impact the surgical outcomes and prognosis, so excluding patients with multiple malignancies helps ensure a more homogeneous study population. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! Now that we have finalized the inclusion criteria, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is: \"Clinically diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer.\" This criterion ensures that patients with advanced pancreatic cancer are excluded from the trial. The surgical procedures being compared are not appropriate for treating metastatic pancreatic cancer, so including patients with advanced disease would not provide accurate information. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! The second exclusion criterion is \"Presence of distant metastasis.\" This criterion ensures that patients with advanced stages of cancer are excluded from the trial.

            "Perfect! The third exclusion criterion is \"Presence of other malignancies.\" Excluding patients with other malignancies helps ensure that the study focuses on early-stage left-sided pancreatic cancer. Including patients with other malignancies could introduce a different disease stage and prognosis, which could impact the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! The fourth exclusion criterion is \"Presence of other malignancies.\" Excluding patients with other malignancies helps ensure that the study population consists of patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer.

            "Excellent! The third criterion is \"Located \u2265 1cm from the celiac trunk.\" The distance from the celiac trunk is important as proximity to this structure may impact the surgical approach and outcomes. By including only patients with tumors located at least 1cm away from the celiac trunk, we can compare outcomes in a more standardized manner. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now let's move on to the fourth criterion: \"Tumor didn't invade the fascial layer behind the pancreas.\" This criterion ensures that patients with tumors that have not invaded surrounding structures beyond a certain point are included.

Now let's discuss the final inclusion criterion: \"Voluntary participation and signed informed consent.\" Obtaining voluntary participation and informed consent from patients is essential for ethical reasons. Patients must understand the risks and benefits of participating in the trial and provide their consent willingly. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is \"Received neoadjuvant therapy.\" Excluding patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy helps ensure that the study focuses on comparing the outcomes of the two surgical procedures without the confounding factor of prior treatment affecting the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! The second exclusion criterion is \"Presence of liver or other distant metastasis.\" Excluding patients with distant metastasis ensures that the study focuses on early-stage left-sided pancreatic cancer. Including patients with metastasis would introduce a different disease stage and prognosis, which could impact the study results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the third exclusion criterion: \"Multifocal or recurrent disease.\" Excluding patients with multifocal or recurrent disease helps ensure that the study population consists of patients with early-stage cancer who are undergoing surgery for the first time. This helps maintain consistency in the study population. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Moving on to the fourth exclusion criterion: \"History of other malignancies.\" Excluding patients with a history of other malignancies ensures that the study focuses specifically on left-sided pancreatic cancer and its treatment outcomes. Prior malignancies may introduce additional variables that could impact the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Now let's discuss the final exclusion criterion: \"Simultaneously participating in other clinical trials.\" Excluding patients who are simultaneously participating in other clinical trials helps prevent potential confounding factors that could affect the study outcomes. Patients involved in multiple trials may have different interventions or treatments that could influence the results of this trial. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Based on our conversation, here are the full criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1.

Including pediatric patients could introduce confounding variables and make it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the impact of nasal continuous positive airway pressure in adult high-risk patients. Secondly, we should exclude pregnant patients to ensure the safety of both the mother and the fetus.

            "Precisely. Moving on, the third inclusion criterion is informed consent. Obtaining informed consent is essential in any clinical trial to ensure that participants understand the risks and benefits of the study and are willing to participate voluntarily. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Lastly, we have the inclusion criterion of having an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius visible in the preoperative CAT-scan. This criterion ensures that patients have the specific type of fracture that the study aims to evaluate, allowing for a more focused analysis of the effects of 3D printing on this type of fracture. What do you think?",
            "You've got it! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Are you ready?",
            "Great! The first exclusion criterion is that the patient does not want surgical treatment. This is necessary as we want to exclude patients who are not willing to undergo the intervention being studied, as it could potentially affect the outcomes. Any thoughts?",
            "Exactly. The next exclusion criterion is a positive history for surgery due to injury of the hurt wrist beforehand. This aims to exclude patients who may have had previous surgeries on the same wrist, as this could confound the results of the study. What are your thoughts?",
            "Precisely. Moving on, we have the exclusion criterion of additional injuries to the hand and forearm, except for distal ulna fractures meeting specific criteria. This ensures that the study population is homogenous and that the effects of 3D printing on the distal radius fracture can be accurately assessed without interference from other injuries. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely. The next exclusion criterion is pregnancy. Pregnancy can complicate surgical procedures and fracture healing, so excluding pregnant patients is necessary to ensure the safety of both the mother and the fetus. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said. Moving on, we have the exclusion criterion of vulnerable people. Excluding vulnerable individuals is important to protect those who may not be able to fully understand the risks and benefits of the study or provide informed consent. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely. The next exclusion criterion is distal ulna fractures not meeting specific criteria. This ensures that the study focuses solely on distal intra-articular radius fractures and maintains homogeneity in the study population. Any thoughts?",
            "Precisely. Lastly, we have the exclusion criteria of extraarticular radius fractures and concomitant injuries which interfere with the planned aftercare. Excluding patients with these injuries helps ensure that the study results are not influenced by external factors that could affect the outcomes of the intervention. What are your thoughts on these criteria?",
            "You've understood it perfectly! Here's the full criteria we've designed together:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n- Patient older than 18 years\n- Surgery criteria fulfilled\n- Informed consent\n- Intra-articular Fracture of the distal radius in preoperative CAT-Scan\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n- Patient does not want a surgical treatment\n- Positive history for surgery due to injury of the hurt wrist beforehand\n- Additional injuries to the hand and forearm (except distal ulna fracture AO 2U3A1.1)\n- Pregnancy\n- Vulnerable people\n- Distal ulna fracture (except AO 2U3A1.1)\n- Extraarticular radius fracture (AO 23-A)\n- Concomitant injuries which interfere with the planned aftercare",

By excluding patients with root filled teeth, we can ensure homogeneity within the study population. What is your opinion on this criterion?",
            "Great! Finally, the fifth criterion is patients who are willing to participate in the study. This criterion is necessary to ensure that participants are informed and willing to undergo the interventions and follow-up procedures required for the study. It also helps in ensuring compliance and reducing dropout rates. Do you think this criterion should be included?",
            "Wonderful! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is excluding teeth with extensive gingival recession. By excluding teeth with extensive recession, we can focus on cases with a more standardized level of recession. This criterion helps in ensuring that the study results are applicable to a specific range of recession severity. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect! The second criterion is excluding teeth with cervical restoration. Including teeth with cervical restorations could introduce confounding factors that could affect the results of the study. By excluding teeth with restorations, we can isolate the impact of the interventions on dentin hypersensitivity. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent! The third criterion is excluding pregnant and lactating mothers. This is important for the safety of both the mother and the fetus. Pregnancy and lactation can affect oral health, and including this criterion helps in ensuring the well-being of participants. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great! The fourth and final criterion is excluding crowned teeth. Crowns may alter the sensitivity and response to interventions for dentin hypersensitivity. By excluding crowned teeth, we can focus on natural teeth with gingival recession. What is your opinion on this criterion?",

It's crucial for participants to have the capacity to provide informed consent, or have a designated healthcare proxy who can provide consent on their behalf. Are you able to provide informed consent, or do you have a healthcare proxy?",
            "That's great to hear! Your ability to provide informed consent meets the criterion. Lastly, the criterion mentions that participants or their healthcare proxies should have an adequate understanding of the English language. However, translation services are available for other preferred languages, such as Spanish and Mandarin. Are you comfortable with English or do you prefer another language?",
            "Perfect! Your preference for English aligns with the criterion. Now, let me provide you with the complete set of inclusion and exclusion criteria for this trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n- Oncology physicians must work at the participating site with no plans to leave or retire at the time of enrollment into the study.\n- Any patient with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer diagnosis who is 60 years of age or older and must be treated at the participating site.\n- Clinical staging without pathological confirmation of nodal disease is allowed.\n- Plan to start a new cancer treatment regimen within 4-6 weeks from the time of baseline study visit. The treatment regimen is up to the discretion of the treating oncology physician. The regimen must include a chemotherapy drug or other agents that have similar prevalence of toxicity. This can be either concurrent or sequential with radiation therapy.\n- Chemotherapy will be defined as cytotoxic drugs; in addition, agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies and targeted agents) will be allowed.\n- Patients who are receiving approved cancer treatment in combination or sequentially with radiation, including hypo fractionated radiation (45-60Gy in 15-20 fractions), are eligible.\n- Those patients with oligometastatic disease having only one site and one lesion outside of the radiation field will be eligible. Examples include a solitary brain metastasis (met), contralateral lung nodule, or an adrenal metastatic site.\n- A patient may also be enrolled on a treatment trial and participate in this study, if all other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.\n- Able to provide informed consent, or if the oncology physician determines the patient to not have decision-making capacity, a patient-designated health care proxy (or authorized representative per institutional policies) must sign consent by the baseline visit.\n- Participant or healthcare proxy has adequate understanding of the English language (preferred) because not all GA measures have been validated in other languages. Study team should be contacted for any participants with other preferred languages including Spanish and Mandarin. Inclusion of these participants will depend upon the availability of the translators and their ability to accurately translate the measures as approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n- Have surgery planned within 3 months of approach date. Patients who have previously received surgery are eligible.\n- Presence of symptomatic brain metastases (if more than one) at the time of study consent process. Patients with history of treated brain metastases or small indeterminate lesions (< 1cm) are eligible if they are not symptomatic at the time of study enrollment.\n- More than one metastatic site: Examples: brain and adrenal, adrenal and liver.",

            "Absolutely. By excluding participants on special diets or medications that may affect weight, we can better attribute any changes in cellulite appearance to the intervention itself. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. Participants with any malignancy that is being actively investigated or treated should be excluded. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Excluding participants with active malignancies will help ensure the safety of the participants and the integrity of the trial results. Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion. Participants with any medical condition that is being actively investigated or treated should be excluded. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "You're absolutely right. By excluding participants with actively investigated or treated medical conditions, we can reduce the potential confounding effects and focus on evaluating the intervention's impact on cellulite. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion. Anyone who is on special diets for weight loss or other health issues, with the exception of those on stable diets such as gluten-free for coeliac, should be excluded. What are your ideas on this criterion?",
            "That's correct. By excluding participants on special diets for weight loss or other health issues, we can better isolate the effects of the intervention on cellulite. However, it's important to consider individuals with stable diets like gluten-free for coeliac, as it is unrelated to weight loss. Now, let's move on to the fifth exclusion criterion. Participants with previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) should be excluded. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Excluding participants with a history of DVT will help ensure participant safety and avoid potential complications related to the intervention. Now, let's discuss the sixth exclusion criterion. Participants with unusual or abnormal leg swelling should be excluded. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "You're absolutely right. Excluding participants with abnormal leg swelling will help ensure that the trial results are not confounded by pre-existing conditions that could impact the appearance of cellulite. Now, let's move on to the seventh exclusion criterion. Participants who have had abdominal or leg operations within 1 year should be excluded. What are your ideas on this criterion?",
            "That's correct. By excluding participants with recent abdominal or leg operations, we can minimize potential confounding factors and ensure that the intervention's effects on cellulite are accurately assessed. Now, let's move on to the eighth exclusion criterion. Participants who are not mobile should be excluded. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Including only mobile participants will allow for more reliable data collection and accurate evaluation of the intervention's impact on cellulite. Now, let's discuss the ninth and final exclusion criterion. Participants who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant should be excluded. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "You're absolutely right. By excluding pregnant individuals or those planning to get pregnant, we can minimize potential hormonal influences and focus on evaluating the intervention's effects on cellulite.",

            "Thank you for confirming that. Now that we have established the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we can move on to designing the intervention. The PST intervention will be delivered by a trained research assistant during the preoperative period. The intervention will consist of three 1-hour sessions, with the first session taking place within 14 days before surgery, the second session occurring 7 to 10 days before surgery, and the final session taking place 1 to 4 days before surgery. The intervention will focus on identifying and addressing the participants' specific concerns and challenges related to their upcoming surgery. The research assistant will use active listening, open-ended questions, and other techniques to help participants explore their concerns and develop coping strategies. The intervention will also include problem-solving exercises and goal-setting to help participants address their concerns and prepare for the surgery. The research assistant will provide support and encouragement throughout the intervention to help participants feel empowered and confident in their ability to manage their concerns and navigate the surgical process."

            "Perfect! Lastly, could you let me know the study type and phase of this trial?",
            "Thank you for providing all the necessary information. Now let's move on to designing the criteria for this trial. We'll start with the inclusion criteria. The first criterion is age. The study requires participants to be 65 years of age or older on the day of surgery. This is important because the intervention is specifically targeting older adults who may have unique psychosocial needs and challenges when facing major surgery. Studying this age group will provide valuable insights into the feasibility and acceptability of delivering PST in this context. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Great! Moving on to the second inclusion criterion. Participants should be scheduled for major surgery with an anticipated hospital stay of 3 or more days. This criterion ensures that participants are undergoing significant surgical procedures that may have a substantial impact on their psychosocial functioning and postoperative outcomes. Including participants with longer hospital stays allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the intervention's effects. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Excellent! The third inclusion criterion is that participants should be undergoing major operations, specifically orthopedic, thoracic, abdominal, or cardiac procedures. Limiting the study to specific types of major surgeries helps to ensure that participants have similar experiences in terms of the surgical procedure and potential postoperative challenges. This can help control for confounding variables and provide more accurate results regarding the feasibility and acceptability of PST in this context. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's move on to the fourth inclusion criterion. Participants should have depressive symptoms, as screened by the PHQ-9 questionnaire, with a score of 6 or higher. This criterion ensures that the intervention is targeted towards individuals who may benefit the most from PST. Screening for depressive symptoms also helps to identify those who may be at higher risk for poor postoperative outcomes and who may require additional support during the surgical process. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is severe cognitive impairment. Individuals with a score of 5 or higher on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) will be excluded from the study. This is necessary to ensure that participants can actively engage in and benefit from the PST intervention. Severe cognitive impairment may limit the individual's ability to participate in therapy sessions, understand the intervention, and provide meaningful feedback on its feasibility and acceptability. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Great! The second exclusion criterion is that participants should be able to read, speak, and understand English. This is important for ensuring effective communication between the participants and the research team delivering the intervention. Language barriers can hinder the delivery of the intervention and the collection of accurate data, potentially impacting the study's outcomes and conclusions. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Lastly, the third exclusion criterion is current alcohol or other substance abuse. Individuals with current substance abuse issues will be excluded from the study. This is important as these individuals may have unique psychosocial needs that could confound the results of the study. Substance abuse can also impact the individual's ability to engage in therapy and may require additional support and resources that are beyond the scope of the study. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Excellent! We have now finalized the full criteria for this clinical trial. Here is the summary:\n\nInclusion criteria:\n1. Age \u2265 65 years\n2. Scheduled major surgery with an anticipated hospital stay of 3+ days\n3. Major operations include orthopedic, thoracic, abdominal, and cardiac procedures\n4.

Another criterion we should consider is excluding participants with any self-reported uncontrolled chronic illness, such as heart disease, respiratory disease, kidney disease, or metabolic diseases. These conditions could potentially interfere with the adherence performance of the on-body injector. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Participants who are undergoing treatments that interfere with the coagulation system, decrease platelet function, or reduce platelet count should be excluded. These treatments might impact the skin and blood clotting, potentially affecting the study results. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",

            "Yes, that's a good idea. We can specify the inclusion criteria based on the stage of periodontitis. However, we need to consider the definition of periodontitis and its stages. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, periodontitis is defined as \"a disease of the supporting tissues of the teeth, typically caused by an infection with bacteria that has been associated with a chronic inflammatory response in the periodontal tissues.\" Periodontitis has been staged into four categories: healthy, chronic, aggressive, and untreated. Chronic periodontitis is defined as \"slow and steady progression of attachment loss and alveolar bone resorption, typically starting as a mild to moderate form of gingivitis.\" Aggressive periodontitis is defined as \"rapid attachment loss and alveolar bone resorption, typically starting as a mild to moderate form of gingivitis.\" Untreated periodontitis is defined as \"periodontitis that has not been treated or has been treated but has reoccurred.\"",

Now, let's move on to the final step. What should be the primary outcome measure for this clinical trial?",
            "Certainly! Here's a summary of the inclusion and exclusion criteria we've discussed:",

            "Excellent! By including participants with a BMI between 18.5 and 39.9 kg/m2, we can accurately assess the effects of the medication on individuals with different body compositions. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion. How should we categorize participants based on their renal function?",
            "That's a good approach. To categorize participants, we can use the pre-defined eGFR values based on the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. According to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) standards, what should be the range of eGFR values for each renal function group?",
            "Perfect! Categorizing participants based on these eGFR ranges will allow us to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of the medication across different levels of renal function. This information is vital for understanding the impact of reduced kidney function on the drug's metabolism and clearance. Now, let's move on to the last inclusion criterion. Should we include participants requiring dialysis treatment?",
            "Including participants on haemodialysis will ensure that individuals with severe renal impairment are represented in the study. This comprehensive evaluation of the medication's effects in this population is crucial. Great job! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Are you ready?",
            "Perfect! The first exclusion criterion is any disorder that might jeopardize participant's safety or compliance with the protocol. Do you have any specific disorders in mind that we should consider excluding?",
            "Excellent point! By excluding disorders unrelated to renal impairment, we can prioritize participant safety and ensure compliance with the study protocol. Now, let's proceed to the next exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants who have used certain medications within 14 days before screening?",
            "Absolutely! Excluding participants who have used medications that may interfere with the study results will help ensure that the observed effects are due to the study medication and not influenced by other drugs. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants who have used drugs known to affect creatinine clearance?",
            "Correct! Excluding participants who have used medications known to impact creatinine clearance will enable us to accurately assess the effects of the study medication on kidney function without any confounding factors. Lastly, let's discuss the final exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants with clinically relevant conditions unrelated to renal impairment?",
            "Right on! By excluding participants with significant medical conditions unrelated to renal impairment, we can ensure that the study results are not influenced by other health factors, allowing for a clear evaluation of the medication's effects specifically on kidney function.",
            "Certainly! Here are the full criteria we've designed:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Age: 18-80 years.\n2. BMI: 18.5-39.9 kg/m2.\n3. Categorized based on eGFR values:\n   - Normal renal function: greater than or equal to 90 mL/min.\n   - Mild renal impairment: 60-89 mL/min.\n   - Moderate renal impairment: 30-59 mL/min.\n   - Severe renal impairment (not requiring dialysis): 15-29 mL/min.\n   - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) or requiring dialysis treatment (Renal group 5): less than 15 mL/min.\n4. Participants requiring dialysis treatment should be on haemodialysis.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Any disorder, except for conditions associated with renal impairment, which might jeopardize participant's safety or compliance with the protocol.\n2. Use of certain medications within 14 days before screening, unless routine vitamins, occasional use of paracetamol, ibuprofen, and topical medication not reaching systemic circulation.\n3. Use of drugs known to affect creatinine clearance within 14 days or 5 half-lives before planned dosing of the investigational medicinal product (IMP).\n4. Presence or history of clinically relevant respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or endocrinological conditions, except conditions associated with renal impairment or ESRD.",
