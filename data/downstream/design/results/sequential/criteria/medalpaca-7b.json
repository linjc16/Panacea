Now, let's move on to the sample size calculation. The sample size calculation is an important step in ensuring the study is well-powered to detect a meaningful difference between the intervention and control groups. For this study, we need to determine how many participants we need to recruit to have a 90% power to detect a difference of 0.5% in HbA1c between the intervention and control groups. To do this, we can use a formula that takes into account the effect size, the standard deviation of the outcome variable, and the sample size. In this case, the effect size is 0.5%, which is a small effect size. The standard deviation of HbA1c is 1.5%, and we want 90% power.

            "That's a valid point. Including patients with early-stage solid tumors could expand the patient population and potentially provide valuable insights. However, for this particular trial, the focus is on advanced solid tumors to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SNS-101 in patients who have exhausted standard treatment options. Including early-stage tumors might dilute the outcomes and make it challenging to assess the specific benefits of the investigational therapy. Does that clarify the rationale behind this criterion?",
            "Great. The next criterion is: \"Having received and failed or was intolerant to standard of care for advanced disease or not eligible for standard of care therapy.\" This criterion ensures that the patients included in the trial have exhausted all standard treatment options available to them. This helps in evaluating the potential benefit of the investigational treatment in patients who have limited or no other treatment options. Any thoughts or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "That's a valid consideration. Including patients who are not eligible for standard care therapy could provide valuable insights into the potential benefit of the investigational treatment in a broader patient population. We can certainly include them as a separate subgroup or cohort in the trial, to further explore the efficacy of SNS-101 in patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria for standard care. Does that sound reasonable to you?",
            "The next criterion is: \"Measurable disease.\" This criterion is essential as it allows for accurate assessment of the response to treatment by providing measurable endpoints for evaluating the efficacy of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I agree. Measurable disease is crucial for evaluating treatment response objectively. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\" This criterion ensures that the patients included in the trial have good performance status, indicating that they are able to carry out daily activities without any significant limitations. This helps in ensuring that the patients are fit enough to participate in the trial and potentially benefit from the treatment. Do you have any suggestions or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "Understood. Moving on, the next criterion is: \"Adequate organ function.\" This criterion is necessary to ensure that the patients included in the trial have adequate organ function to tolerate the investigational treatment and undergo the necessary assessments required during the study. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Adequate organ function is essential for patient safety and reliable evaluation of treatment outcomes. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\" This criterion is important as it allows for the collection of tumor samples for biomarker analysis and assessment of treatment response. It helps in understanding the mechanism of action of the investigational therapy and identifying potential predictive biomarkers. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "That's a valid concern. While it's ideal to have tumor samples from all participants, we can provide an option for patients who are unable or unwilling to provide pre-treatment or on-treatment tumor biopsy samples. We can include them in a separate subgroup or cohort, as long as the majority of participants consent to providing the necessary samples. This approach will still allow us to gather valuable data while accommodating the preferences and limitations of individual patients. Does that address your concern?",
            "I'm glad you find it reasonable. Now, we have discussed all the key inclusion criteria. Shall we move on to the key exclusion criteria?",
            "Great. The first criterion is: \"Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\" This criterion is important to avoid potential interactions or confounding effects of prior treatments on the safety and efficacy evaluation of the investigational therapy. Do you have any suggestions or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "I agree. Excluding patients who have recently received other therapies helps in isolating the effects of the investigational treatment. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\" This criterion ensures that patients with unresolved toxicities from prior treatments are excluded from the trial to prevent exacerbation of side effects and ensure patient safety. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our primary concern. Now, the next criterion is: \"Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients who may be at higher risk of severe immune-related adverse events with the investigational therapy based on their prior treatment history. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Minimizing the risk of severe adverse events is of utmost importance. Let's move on to the next criterion: \"Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\" This criterion is important to exclude patients with active or recent history of other malignancies that may confound the assessment of the efficacy of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I agree. Maintaining the focus on the specific types of cancer under study is crucial for meaningful evaluation. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients with brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease, as these patients may require specific treatment approaches and have different prognosis compared to patients without central nervous system involvement. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Excluding patients with central nervous system involvement helps maintain the homogeneity of the patient population and facilitates accurate evaluation of the investigational therapy. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\" This criterion is important to ensure patient safety and avoid potential severe allergic reactions to the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our top priority. Now, we have reached the final criterion: \"Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\" This criterion is essential to protect the safety of pregnant women and unborn children, as well as to prevent potential exposure of infants to the investigational therapy through breastfeeding. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Protecting the safety of vulnerable populations is paramount. Based on our discussion, here are the full criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nKey Inclusion Criteria:\n- Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumor.\n- Having received and failed or was intolerant to standard of care for advanced disease or not eligible for standard of care therapy.\n- Measurable disease.\n- ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n- Adequate organ function.\n- Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n- Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\n- Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\n- Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\n- Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\n- Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\n- History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n- Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

The intervention for the study will be a peer education program aimed at improving self-care and quality of life for burn patients. The intervention will consist of a series of group sessions led by trained peer educators who have had similar experiences with burn injuries. The peer educators will provide support, guidance, and education on topics such as wound care, pain management, and emotional well-being. The sessions will be interactive and include discussions, role-playing, and other activities to help patients develop coping strategies and build a support network. The peer educators will also provide follow-up support and monitoring to ensure that patients are adhering to the recommended self-care practices. The control group will receive standard care, which may include some support and education, but no formal peer education intervention. The study will be a randomized controlled trial, with the intervention group receiving the peer education intervention and the control group receiving standard care. The study will be double-blinded to ensure that the peer educators and patients are not aware of group assignment, which will help to minimize bias and ensure objective measurement of outcomes. The primary outcome measure will be self-reported quality of life, as measured by the Short Form-12 Health Survey. Secondary outcomes will include measures of pain, depression, anxiety, and other health-related outcomes. The study will be conducted at a burn center and will include a large sample of patients with burn injuries of varying severity. The study is expected to have a high level of external validity, as the peer education intervention has been shown to be effective in previous studies and is a promising approach for improving outcomes for burn patients.

            "This criterion is necessary as the procedure for zygomaticomaxillary fracture repair typically requires the patient to be under general anesthesia. Patients who are not fit for general anesthesia may not be suitable candidates for the procedure. Including this criterion ensures the safety and suitability of the participants. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. Moving on to the second inclusion criterion. It is \"Isolated minimally displaced zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fracture\". This criterion ensures that the study focuses on a specific type of fracture, which allows for more consistent and accurate results in evaluating the effectiveness of finite element analysis for selecting single point fixation. Excluding complex or severely displaced fractures helps us assess the impact of the intervention on a specific type of fracture. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is \"Absence of other facial trauma\". Excluding patients with other facial trauma ensures that we specifically evaluate the impact of finite element analysis for zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures without confounding factors from additional injuries. This criterion helps us isolate the effects of the intervention on the specific condition being studied. Do you have any objections or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "Great. Lastly, we have the criterion \"Mandibular condylar fracture\". Excluding patients with mandibular condylar fractures is important as these fractures involve a different anatomical region and may require different treatment approaches. By focusing on isolated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures, the study can provide more targeted and relevant results for the specific condition under investigation. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! Here's the full criteria we have designed for the clinical trial:\nInclusion Criteria: \n1. Fit to general anesthesia (GA)\n2. Isolated minimally displaced zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fracture\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Absence of other facial trauma\n2. Mandibular condylar fracture",

            "Absolutely! Respecting patients' autonomy is crucial. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. It states that patients who have difficulty understanding and expressing themselves in French are excluded. This is important as the study is likely conducted in French, and effective communication is necessary. What are your thoughts?",
            "Precisely! Effective communication is key for successful participation. Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion. Patients under guardianship or curatorship are excluded. This ensures that patients have the capacity to provide informed consent for participation in the study. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely! Protecting patients' rights and ensuring their ability to provide informed consent is crucial. Lastly, the fourth exclusion criterion is no preoperative CT scan available for 3D modeling. This criterion is important as the intervention involves using a three-dimensional model of the patient's kidney, which requires preoperative CT scan data. Patients without this data would not be able to benefit from the intervention and may not be suitable for the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Now that we have discussed all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, let me summarize them for you:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Adult patients (\u2265 18 years of age).\n2. Scheduled surgical management by laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with robotic assistance for kidney tumor.\n3. Unilateral kidney tumor or 1st surgery for bilateral involvement.\n4.

This criterion ensures that the study focuses on the impact of preoperative immunonutrition specifically on patients undergoing a cystectomy. Do you have any questions or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "Alright. The next inclusion criterion is \"Age \u226518 years\". This criterion is reasonable as individuals under the age of 18 may have different physiological responses to immunonutrition compared to adults. Additionally, including only adults ensures that participants can provide informed consent. Do you have any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! Now, we'll move on to the third inclusion criterion. It is \"Ability and willingness to provide informed consent documented by signature\". Obtaining informed consent is essential in research involving human subjects to ensure that participants understand the study's purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits. This criterion protects the rights and autonomy of participants. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is \"Contraindications to IN, e.g. known hypersensitivity or allergy to lactose, fish oil, or soy lecithin\". Excluding individuals with known allergies or hypersensitivities to components of immunonutrition is important to prevent adverse reactions and ensure participant safety. Any questions or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. It is \"Severe diarrhea requiring medical attention\". Severe diarrhea can impact the absorption and efficacy of immunonutrition, so excluding individuals with this condition helps maintain the integrity of the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, we'll move on to the third exclusion criterion. It is \"Current treatment with any immunosuppressive drug\". Including individuals on immunosuppressive drugs could confound the results of the study by affecting immune response outcomes. Excluding them ensures that the study can accurately assess the impact of immunonutrition. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.",
            "Great to hear that. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion. It is \"Other clinically significant concomitant disease affecting immunity, such as severe renal failure, HIV, SLE, or being a transplant recipient\". These conditions can influence immune response and complicate the interpretation of study results. Excluding individuals with these conditions helps ensure the study's focus remains on the impact of immunonutrition on immune response after cystectomy. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad we're on the same page. Now, let's discuss the fifth exclusion criterion. It is \"Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to psychological disorders, dementia, etc.\". Individuals with psychological disorders, dementia, or other conditions that may impair their ability to follow study procedures may not be able to adhere to the intervention or data collection requirements. Excluding them helps maintain the study's internal validity. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion. It is \"Participation in another study with an investigational drug within the 30 days preceding and during the present study\". Including individuals who are concurrently participating in another study with an investigational drug could introduce confounding variables that may impact the study outcomes. Excluding them helps minimize potential biases. Any questions or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, let's discuss the seventh exclusion criterion. It is \"Previous enrollment into the current study\". Excluding individuals who have previously participated in the study helps prevent duplicate data collection and ensures that the study results are based on unique participants. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, we'll move on to the eighth exclusion criterion. It is \"Use of IN independently of the study\". Individuals who are already using immunonutrition outside of the study may not be representative of the study population or may have different responses to the intervention. Excluding them helps control for this potential confounding factor. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.",
            "I'm glad you understand. Now, let's discuss the ninth exclusion criterion. It is \"Enrollment of the investigator, his/her family members, employees, and other dependent persons\". Including individuals with close personal or professional relationships to the investigator could introduce bias or conflicts of interest. Excluding them helps maintain the study's objectivity and integrity. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm happy to hear that. Lastly, we'll discuss the tenth exclusion criterion. It is \"Emergency procedure (less than 7 days between screening and surgery)\". Emergency procedures may involve different preoperative and postoperative care protocols that could impact the study outcomes. Excluding individuals who undergo emergency procedures helps ensure that the study results are based on planned surgeries with consistent protocols. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you understand the rationale behind this criterion. Now that we have discussed all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, let me provide you with the full criteria for your clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n- Patient undergoing open cystectomy (for all reasons)\n- Age \u226518 years\n- Ability and willingness to provide informed consent documented by signature\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n- Contraindications to IN, e.g. known hypersensitivity or allergy to lactose, fish oil or soy lecithin\n- Severe diarrhea requiring medical attention\n- Current treatment with any immunosuppressive drug\n- Other clinically significant concomitant disease affecting immunity (e.g., severe renal failure, HIV, SLE, transplant recipient, ...)\n- Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due psychological disorders, dementia, etc.\n- Participation in another study with investigational drug within the 30 days preceding and during the present study\n- Previous enrollment into the current study\n- Use of IN independently of the study\n- Enrolment of the investigator, his/her family members, employees, and other dependent persons\n- Emergency procedure (less than 7 days between screening and surgery)\n\nPlease make sure to include these criteria in your clinical trial design.

Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is the presence of autoimmune disease or a history of autoimmune disease. This exclusion criterion ensures that the treatment is not given to patients with conditions that may be exacerbated by immune stimulation. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "That's right. It's important to protect the rights and welfare of the participants. Now, let's move on to the fifth criterion. It requires participants to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. This criterion ensures that participants are able to tolerate the rigors of the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "That's right! A good performance status is essential for the safe and effective administration of the treatment. Now, let's move on to the sixth criterion. It states that participants must have measurable disease, as defined by RECIST 1.1. This ensures that the treatment is effective in participants with measurable disease. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Measurable disease is essential for monitoring the treatment response and ensuring the safety of the participants. Now, let's move on to the last criterion. It requires participants to have received no more than 2 prior systemic therapies for advanced or metastatic disease. This criterion ensures that the treatment is given to participants who have not received extensive prior treatment and are likely to benefit from the trial treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Adequate organ function is essential for the safe and effective administration of the treatment. Now, let's move on to the last criterion. It requires participants to have a life expectancy of greater than 3 months. This criterion ensures that the trial is not enrolling participants who are near the end of their life and reduces the risk of enrolling participants who are not likely to benefit from the treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent! The last criterion is a negative pregnancy test within the last 30 days. This criterion ensures that participants are not pregnant, which can be a contraindication to the treatment being tested. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Preventing pregnancy is essential to protect the health of both the mother and the developing fetus. Now, let's move on to the tenth and final criterion. It requires that participants be willing and able to comply with the protocol and follow-up visits. This ensures that participants adhere to the study procedures and attend all scheduled appointments, which is crucial for the collection of reliable data. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent! These criteria help ensure the safety and well-being of participants while also maintaining the integrity of the trial results.",

            "That's a great point. Including other malignant diseases can provide valuable insights into the efficacy of the treatment beyond FL-HCC. Now, let's move on to the third criterion. It requires the presence of DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript, assessed by RNA-based next-generation sequencing or realtime-polymerase chain reaction amplification. This criterion ensures that the treatment is directed at the appropriate molecular target. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! It's crucial to target the specific molecular drivers of the disease to maximize the effectiveness of the treatment. Now, let's move on to the fourth criterion. It states that participants must be at least 18 years old. This is a standard criterion for adult clinical trials to ensure that participants are legally able to provide informed consent and understand the implications of the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Legal requirements and the ability to understand the implications of the trial are crucial factors to consider. Now, let's move on to the fifth criterion. It states that participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. This ensures that participants are well enough to undergo treatment and participate in the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! A good performance status is essential to ensure that participants can undergo the treatment without compromising their overall well-being. Now, let's move on to the sixth criterion. It requires participants to have measurable disease per iRECIST. This is necessary to assess the efficacy of the treatment and monitor the response to therapy. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Measurable disease allows for accurate assessment of treatment response and helps determine the clinical benefit of the intervention. Now, let's move on to the seventh criterion. It states that participants must have adequate organ function laboratory values. This criterion ensures that participants have sufficient organ function to tolerate the treatment and reduces the risk of adverse events. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Participant safety is of utmost importance in clinical trials, and adequate organ function is a key factor to consider. Now, let's move on to the eighth criterion. It requires a negative SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test.

This is important to prevent potential harm to a fetus during treatment with investigational drugs. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Protecting potential pregnancies is crucial, and appropriate contraception measures are necessary to minimize any risks. Now, let's move on to the tenth criterion. It states that participants should either be postmenopausal or provide evidence of non-childbearing status. This further ensures the safety of potential pregnancy during the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Ensuring the safety of potential pregnancies is crucial, and this criterion provides an extra layer of protection. Now that we've discussed all the inclusion criteria, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Are you ready to proceed?",
            "Great! Let's start with the first exclusion criterion. It states that pregnant or breastfeeding individuals cannot participate in the trial. This criterion is essential to protect the health of the fetus or newborn from potential harm due to the investigational treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Protecting the health of both the participant and the fetus or newborn is of utmost importance. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. It states that participants should be willing and able to follow the study schedule. This criterion ensures that participants can adhere to the protocol requirements and complete the trial as intended. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Participant compliance with the study schedule is essential for obtaining valid results and maintaining the overall success of the trial. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have received chemotherapy, systemic therapy, or radiotherapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of the study drug. This criterion reduces the risk of drug interactions and ensures that participants are not receiving other treatments that may confound the results of the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Minimizing potential confounding factors is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable trial results. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have received any immunotherapy agents within 28 days prior to the dosing of the study drug. This criterion is important to avoid interference with the study treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Avoiding any potential interference with the study treatment is crucial for obtaining reliable results. Now, let's move on to the fifth exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have a known sensitivity or history of allergic reactions to the investigational drugs. This criterion protects participants from potential harm due to known allergies or sensitivities to the study drugs. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Participant safety should always be a top priority, and excluding individuals with known allergies or sensitivities is a necessary precaution. Now, let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have a history of autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency. These criteria are important to exclude individuals who may have conditions that could be exacerbated by the immunotherapy treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Excluding individuals with autoimmune diseases or immunodeficiencies is necessary to reduce the risk of adverse reactions and ensure participant safety. Now, let's move on to the seventh exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have symptomatic interstitial lung disease or brain metastases. These criteria exclude participants with conditions that may complicate or worsen during the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Excluding participants with symptomatic interstitial lung disease or brain metastases is crucial to minimize potential complications and maintain the integrity of the trial results. Now, let's move on to the eighth exclusion criterion. It states that participants should not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, and other conditions that may interfere with the trial. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Participant safety should always be a top priority, and excluding individuals with uncontrolled intercurrent illness is crucial to minimize potential complications. Now, we have discussed all the criteria for both inclusion and exclusion. Shall I provide you with the full criteria we have designed?",

            "Excellent! The third criterion is \"Located \u2265 1cm from the celiac trunk.\" The distance from the celiac trunk is important as proximity to this structure may impact the surgical approach and outcomes. By including only patients with tumors located at least 1cm away from the celiac trunk, we can compare outcomes in a more standardized manner. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now let's move on to the fourth criterion: \"Tumor didn't invade the fascial layer behind the pancreas.\" This criterion ensures that patients with tumors that have not invaded surrounding structures beyond a certain point are included.

What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! The second exclusion criterion is \"Presence of liver or other distant metastasis.\" Excluding patients with distant metastasis ensures that the study focuses on early-stage left-sided pancreatic cancer. Including patients with metastasis would introduce a different disease stage and prognosis, which could impact the study results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the third exclusion criterion: \"Multifocal or recurrent disease.\" Excluding patients with multifocal or recurrent disease helps ensure that the study population consists of patients with early-stage cancer who are undergoing surgery for the first time. This helps maintain consistency in the study population. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Moving on to the fourth exclusion criterion: \"History of other malignancies.\" Excluding patients with a history of other malignancies ensures that the study focuses specifically on left-sided pancreatic cancer and its treatment outcomes.

            "Excellent. We're in agreement. With our inclusion and exclusion criteria finalized, we can move on to the next step of the PICO framework. The PICO framework is a tool used to guide the development of clinical questions and the search for evidence. It consists of 4 components: Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome. In our example, the PICO framework is as follows: P- colorectal cancer patients undergoing transanal specimen extraction surgery; I- transanal specimen extraction surgery; C- survival; O- mortality. This PICO framework will help us identify the relevant studies and evidence on the outcomes of transanal specimen extraction surgery in colorectal cancer patients. The next step in the PICO framework is to develop a search strategy. A search strategy is a plan for finding relevant studies. It includes the databases, search terms, and other details for finding the evidence. In our example, we will be searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Our search terms will include colorectal cancer, transanal specimen extraction, and survival or mortality. The search strategy is an important step in ensuring that we find the most relevant studies and minimize the risk of bias. The last step in the PICO framework is to critically appraise the evidence. Critical appraisal is the process of evaluating the quality of the studies found using the evidence. In our example, we will be using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in observational studies. This tool helps us evaluate the risk of bias in studies that compare the outcomes of interest between groups. After critically appraising the evidence, we can then synthesize the findings and draw conclusions. In our example, we may find that transanal specimen extraction surgery is associated with improved survival compared to other surgical options in colorectal cancer patients. This information can then be used to inform clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. The PICO framework is a useful tool for systematically identifying, appraising, and synthesizing the evidence on a clinical question. It helps us ensure that we find the most relevant studies and minimize the risk of bias.",

Now, let me provide you with the complete set of inclusion and exclusion criteria for this trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n- Oncology physicians must work at the participating site with no plans to leave or retire at the time of enrollment into the study.\n- Any patient with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer diagnosis who is 60 years of age or older and must be treated at the participating site.\n- Clinical staging without pathological confirmation of nodal disease is allowed.\n- Plan to start a new cancer treatment regimen within 4-6 weeks from the time of baseline study visit. The treatment regimen is up to the discretion of the treating oncology physician. The regimen must include a chemotherapy drug or other agents that have similar prevalence of toxicity. This can be either concurrent or sequential with radiation therapy.\n- Chemotherapy will be defined as cytotoxic drugs; in addition, agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies and targeted agents) will be allowed.\n- Patients who are receiving approved cancer treatment in combination or sequentially with radiation, including hypo fractionated radiation (45-60Gy in 15-20 fractions), are eligible.\n- Those patients with oligometastatic disease having only one site and one lesion outside of the radiation field will be eligible. Examples include a solitary brain metastasis (met), contralateral lung nodule, or an adrenal metastatic site.\n- A patient may also be enrolled on a treatment trial and participate in this study, if all other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.\n- Able to provide informed consent, or if the oncology physician determines the patient to not have decision-making capacity, a patient-designated health care proxy (or authorized representative per institutional policies) must sign consent by the baseline visit.\n- Participant or healthcare proxy has adequate understanding of the English language (preferred) because not all GA measures have been validated in other languages. Study team should be contacted for any participants with other preferred languages including Spanish and Mandarin. Inclusion of these participants will depend upon the availability of the translators and their ability to accurately translate the measures as approved by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n- Have surgery planned within 3 months of approach date. Patients who have previously received surgery are eligible.\n- Presence of symptomatic brain metastases (if more than one) at the time of study consent process. Patients with history of treated brain metastases or small indeterminate lesions (< 1cm) are eligible if they are not symptomatic at the time of study enrollment.\n- More than one metastatic site: Examples: brain and adrenal, adrenal and liver.",

Only one lumbar disc may be treated with the PerQdisc device.\n- Patient must have an overall disc herniation (extrusion or protrusion) such that half or less of the width of the dorsal annulus of the spinal canal, is affected by the herniation. The width of the canal is defined by the lateral recesses and the central canal (i.e. pedicle to pedicle).\n- Patient must have a minimum of 6 mm of disc height as measured in the center of the affected disc.\n- Patient is willing and able to give informed consent.\n- All surgeries must be approved by at least 2 members of the Medical Advisory Board (MAB) - potential anatomical limitations of safely accessing Kambin's, extent of annular disruption, as well as overall patient criteria will be evaluated\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n- Patient has had prior lumbar spine surgery at the index level (nucleoplasy is acceptable).\n- Patient has had spinal fusion in the lumbar spine. Cervical or thoracic fusion is allowed as long as there are no neurologic deficits in the lower extremities.\n- Patient has spondyloarthropathy or other spondylolisthesis greater than 4 mm or spondylolysis at the index level (on standing X-ray).\n- Patient has underlying moderate or severe spinal stenosis (congenital, degenerative, or due to epidural lipomatosis) at any level. If the index level shows stenosis due to the disc herniation, it is acceptable if the index level is going to be treated concurrently with the PerQdsic procedure.\n- Patient has compressive radiculopathy of the exiting nerve root at the index level.\n- Patient has significant facet disease. Significant is defined as clinically confirmed by diagnostic block or radiologically grade 2 or higher (mild joint narrowing and irregularity are acceptable, but not sclerosis or osteophyte formation).\n- Patient has any known active malignancy.\n- Patient has previously undergone or currently on immunosuppressive therapy. Steroids used to treat inflammation are allowed.\n- Patient has active local or systemic infection.\n- Patient has been diagnosed with hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, or other autoimmune disease including AIDS, AIDS related complex (ARC) and HIV.\n- Patient has diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2) requiring daily insulin management.\n- Patient has osteopenia of the spine (T-score of -1.0 or lower). All patients 50 years of age or older, and any postmenopausal women with a history of fractures should have a dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to confirm exclusion.\n- Patient has morbid obesity defined as a body mass index (BMI) more than 35 (>35).\n- Patient has a known allergy to silicone or barium sulfate.\n- Patient has a broad disc herniation that is wider than half of the dorsal annulus forming the wall of the spinal canal.\n- Patient requires decompression involving disruption of the midline bony-ligamentous elements (i.e. laminectomy).\n- Patient has a significant Schmorl's node at the level to be treated, or any Schmorl's nodes affecting 3 or more lumbar levels. Significant is defined as a large, rectangular or irregular-shaped node that has an associated active inflammatory process (Modic I changes).\n- Patient has more than 20 degrees of mobility on flexion/extension radiographs at the index level.\n- Patient has more than 10 degrees of lumbar scoliosis.\n- Patient belongs to a vulnerable population or has a condition such that his/her ability to provide informed consent, comply with follow-up requirements, or provide self-assessments is compromised (e.g. developmentally disabled, prisoner, chronic alcohol/substance abuser).\n- Patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study. Pregnancy ruled out by serum HCG. If the patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study and wishes to continue study participation, a new Pregnancy Informed Consent must be completed.\n- Intraoperative Exclusion: Poor radiological visualization of Kambin's triangle, annular defect following surgical treatment of the disc herniation/protrusion that is greater than 6 mm, sustained irritation of the exiting nerve root during any aspect of the annular dilation technique (leg movement or if performing with electrical monitoring) in spite of repositioning instruments, protrusion of the 50A Imaging Balloon up to or beyond the outer margin of the vertebra during the imaging steps, and a violated endplate as determined by imaging balloons during fluoroscopy.",

Based on the information provided, it would be reasonable to exclude individuals who have had a regular dental visit within the last 12 months. This criterion is important to exclude individuals who are already receiving regular dental care and likely have access to preventive oral cancer screenings. By excluding these individuals, the study can focus on those who may have limited access to dental care and are at higher risk for late diagnosis of oral cancer. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

The first criterion is for psychogeriatric inpatients aged 18 and above. This ensures that we include participants within a specific age range who are receiving care in a psychiatric setting. What do you think?",
            "Exactly! Including this criterion will help us assess the effectiveness of the intervention in the target population. Now, let's move on to the second inclusion criterion. We need to include participants who have a presence of SMI and behavioral problems. This will allow us to specifically address the challenges faced by individuals with serious mental illness and behavioral issues. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now, onto the third inclusion criterion. We should include participants who have the willingness and ability to participate in this study. It's important to have participants who actively engage in the study procedures for reliable data collection and to ensure they can benefit from the intervention. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Including this criterion will ensure that the participants can fully engage in the study and benefit from the intervention. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is to exclude participants with behavioral problems caused by delirium. This is necessary to focus on individuals with SMI-related behavioral issues. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said! This criterion will help ensure that the study accurately assesses the impact of the CoMBI-SMI intervention on SMI-related behavioral problems. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion. We need to exclude participants with current substance-related disorders. This is important as substance-related disorders can significantly impact behavior and may require different treatment strategies. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "You're absolutely right! By excluding participants with substance-related disorders, we can ensure that the study results are more accurate and applicable to the target population. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. Participants who are currently receiving treatment in forensic psychiatry should be excluded. This ensures that our study population is more homogeneous and that the results are applicable to the intended population. What do you think?",
            "Well said! Excluding participants in forensic psychiatry allows us to focus on individuals in general psychiatric care, providing more applicable results. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion. Participants in a manic phase should be excluded. This is because individuals in a manic phase may have heightened agitation, impulsivity, and altered judgment, which could impact their ability to participate and adhere to the intervention protocol. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Excluding participants in a manic phase will help us maintain the study's internal validity and ensure that the collected data accurately reflects the intervention's impact on SMI-related behavioral problems. Now, let's discuss the final exclusion criterion. We should exclude individuals with florid psychosis. This will allow us to focus on participants with stable mental health conditions and accurately assess the intervention's impact on behavioral problems and psychiatric complaints. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! This criterion will help us maintain a clear focus on the target population and provide more accurate insights into the intervention's impact.

Patients in both cohorts may also enroll if they meet certain timeframes related to starting therapy. Any questions so far?",
            "Exactly! Now, it's important that patients have adequate blood counts. Specifically, leukocytes (WBC) should be \u2265 2,500/mcL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be \u2265 1,500/mcL, and platelets (PLT) should be \u2265 80,000/mcL. Patients must also be able to lie flat and still for approximately 15-20 minutes and tolerate FDG-PET/CT radiographical imaging and radiation treatment planning and delivery. These are necessary for the procedures involved in the trial. Are you following along?",
            "Excellent! Moving forward, patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy are eligible as long as it doesn't interfere with the trial endpoints. However, patients will be ineligible if another known malignancy makes it difficult to interpret if FDG-avid lesions represent prostate cancer or if it's expected to interfere with standard therapy for prostate cancer for 2 years from study enrollment. Additionally, patients must have a life expectancy of at least 6 months and the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent document. Any questions about these criteria?",
            "You've got it! Lastly, let's discuss the exclusion criteria. Patients with prostate cancer that is castration resistant, defined as two consecutive rising PSA values despite testosterone level < 50 ng/dL, will be excluded. Patients who started androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) more than 26 weeks prior to enrollment will also be excluded. Any questions about these exclusions?",
            "Exactly! We also have additional exclusion criteria. Patients who started intensification of therapy beyond ADT (e.g., AR pathway inhibitor, cytotoxic therapy) more than 26 weeks prior to registration will be excluded. Subjects with a known allergy to contrast material and/or contraindication to FDG-PET will also be excluded. Furthermore, patients enrolled in another therapeutic clinical trial that would preclude them from participating in this trial will be excluded.

This exclusion criterion is necessary to avoid potential harm to the fetus or infant. The second exclusion criterion is that participants must not have a history of psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder. This exclusion criterion is necessary to avoid including participants with pre-existing mental health conditions that may confound the study's aims. The third exclusion criterion is that participants must not be currently using benzodiazepines or opioids.

The screening phase will involve a brief telephone interview to determine eligibility and assess suicidal ideation. If participants are found to be eligible, they will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group. The treatment phase will involve either brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). The CBT will consist of 6 sessions over 8 weeks, while TAU will consist of usual care provided by mental health providers at the participant's military installation. The study will last for 8 weeks, with follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measure will be suicidal ideation, assessed by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SRS). Secondary outcomes will include depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. The study will be conducted at several military installations across the United States. The study is funded by the Department of Defense and is expected to enroll 300 participants. The study is currently recruiting participants and is expected to be completed in 2021."

It also ensures that participants have access to mental health services during the study period. Any questions about this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. The fourth inclusion criterion is that participants must score greater than zero on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) Screener-Recent, indicating suicidal ideation within the last month.

Moving on to the fourth inclusion criterion, which is \"English speaking.\" This criterion ensures that participants can understand the study materials and communicate effectively with the researchers. It helps ensure that there are no language barriers that could impact the study outcomes. Should we include this criterion?",

Finally, let's discuss the fifth inclusion criterion, which is \"Working cell-phone with camera.\" This criterion may be necessary for participants to document their self-removal attempts, which could be used for monitoring and evaluation purposes. It may also be used for communication with the researchers during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! Now that we have covered all the inclusion criteria, let's move on to the exclusion criterion. The exclusion criterion is quite straightforward and states, \"Not meeting the above inclusion criteria, no other specific exclusion criteria.\" This ensures that participants who do not meet the inclusion criteria are not included in the study. It helps maintain the integrity of the study design and ensures that the results are valid and applicable to the intended population. Shall we include this criterion?",

            "Excellent. The third criterion is that patients must have best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in both eyes. This ensures that the patients have sufficient vision in both eyes to undergo the mini-monovision approach.",
            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is patients with pre-existing ocular disease or ocular surgery that may affect the visual outcome. This exclusion criterion ensures that we evaluate the mini-monovision approach in healthy eyes only. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! The second exclusion criterion is a history of ocular or systemic disease that may impact the outcomes of the mini-monovision approach with the Clareon Vivity and Clareon Vivity Toric IOLs. By excluding patients with pre-existing conditions, we can ensure that the outcomes are specific to the mini-monovision approach and the intraocular lenses being evaluated. What do you think?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. We need to exclude patients with a history of ocular or systemic medications that may affect visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, binocularity, or reading performance. Examples of medications that may impact visual outcomes include but are not limited to: - Anti-cholinergics - Anti-histamines - Anti-depressants - Anti-epileptics - Anti-psychotics - Anti-hypertensives - Anti-inflammatories - Anti-coagulants - Anti-platelet agents - Steroids - Androgens - Estrogens - Oral contraceptives - Androgenic anabolic steroids - Other medications that may affect visual outcomes. By excluding patients with these medications, we can isolate the impact of the mini-monovision approach and the specified intraocular lenses on visual outcomes. What do you think?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's discuss the fifth exclusion criterion. We need to exclude patients with a history of ocular surgery other than cataract surgery. This exclusion criterion ensures that the outcomes of the mini-monovision approach are not influenced by previous ocular surgeries that may have altered the anatomy of the eye. What do you think about this criterion?",

            "Let's begin with the inclusion criteria. The first criterion is adult patients with bilateral age-related visually significant cataracts in otherwise healthy eyes, undergoing bilateral sequential implantation within 21 days using Clareon Vivity and Clareon Vivity Torics. This criterion ensures that we focus on patients who require cataract surgery in both eyes and are suitable for the mini-monovision approach with the specified intraocular lenses. What do you think?",
            "Exactly! Now, let's move on to the second inclusion criterion. We need patients with IOL powers between +10D to +30.0D, T3-T6. This will ensure consistency in the type of lenses implanted. By limiting the range of powers, we can evaluate the outcomes of the Clareon Vivity and Clareon Vivity Toric IOLs within a specific range that is relevant to the mini-monovision approach. What are your thoughts?",
            "That's spot on! Now, let's move on to the third inclusion criterion. We require potential acuity measured post-operatively to be 20/25 or better in both eyes. This ensures that patients included in the study achieve a certain level of visual acuity outcomes. By setting a specific threshold, we can assess the effectiveness of the mini-monovision approach using the Clareon Vivity and Clareon Vivity Toric IOLs. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is a history of ocular or refractive surgery. This excludes patients with prior surgical interventions that may impact the outcomes of the mini-monovision approach with the Clareon Vivity and Clareon Vivity Toric IOLs. By excluding these patients, we can focus on evaluating the outcomes in a population without confounding factors. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Excellent! Now, let's discuss the second exclusion criterion. We need to exclude patients with ocular or systemic comorbidities that may alter or reduce visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, binocularity, or impair reading performance. Conditions such as severe dry eye/ocular surface disease, glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinopathy, neuro-ophthalmic diseases, and strabismus/amblyopia are examples. By excluding patients with these comorbidities, we can isolate the impact of the mini-monovision approach and the specified intraocular lenses on visual outcomes. What do you think?",
            "Exactly! Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. We need to exclude patients with irregular astigmatism, corneal dystrophies, pupil abnormalities, and zonular laxity. These conditions may affect the outcomes of the mini-monovision approach with the specified intraocular lenses. By excluding patients with these abnormalities, we can focus on evaluating the outcomes in a population without anatomical factors that could impact the results. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Absolutely! Lastly, we have the fourth exclusion criterion. We need to exclude patients who experience intraoperative or postoperative complications. These complications could confound the results of the study. By excluding patients with complications, we can evaluate the outcomes of the mini-monovision approach with the Clareon Vivity and Clareon Vivity Toric IOLs in a population without additional confounding factors.

Bilateral tooth loss with a sufficient amount of bone volume: This criterion ensures that the participants have a similar dental condition, which allows for a more accurate comparison between the two sides of the mouth receiving the intervention.\n2. No general problems: Participants without general health issues are more likely to have a successful outcome from the intervention, as they are less likely to experience complications that could affect the results.\n3. Good oral health: Good oral health is necessary to ensure the success of the dental implant procedure and to minimize the risk of infection or other complications that could confound the results.\n4.

The existence of serious systemic disorders: Serious systemic disorders may impact the participant's ability to heal properly or may increase the risk of complications, making it necessary to exclude these individuals from the study.\n3. Contraindications for local anesthesia or oral surgery: Participants with contraindications for anesthesia or surgery may not be able to safely undergo the intervention, making it necessary to exclude them from the study.\n4. Pregnant women and nursing mothers: Pregnancy and breastfeeding can affect the body's response to interventions and medications, potentially impacting the results of the study and posing risks to the mother and baby.\n5. Patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation: These treatments can affect healing and immune function, potentially interfering with the outcomes of the study.\n6.

            "Thank you for providing all the necessary information. Now let's move on to designing the criteria for this trial. We'll start with the inclusion criteria. The first criterion is age. The study requires participants to be 65 years of age or older on the day of surgery. This is important because the intervention is specifically targeting older adults who may have unique psychosocial needs and challenges when facing major surgery. Studying this age group will provide valuable insights into the feasibility and acceptability of delivering PST in this context. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Great! Moving on to the second inclusion criterion. Participants should be scheduled for major surgery with an anticipated hospital stay of 3 or more days.

Including participants with longer hospital stays allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the intervention's effects. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Excellent! The third inclusion criterion is that participants should be undergoing major operations, specifically orthopedic, thoracic, abdominal, or cardiac procedures. Limiting the study to specific types of major surgeries helps to ensure that participants have similar experiences in terms of the surgical procedure and potential postoperative challenges. This can help control for confounding variables and provide more accurate results regarding the feasibility and acceptability of PST in this context. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's move on to the fourth inclusion criterion. Participants should have depressive symptoms, as screened by the PHQ-9 questionnaire, with a score of 6 or higher. This criterion ensures that the intervention is targeted towards individuals who may benefit the most from PST. Screening for depressive symptoms also helps to identify those who may be at higher risk for poor postoperative outcomes and who may require additional support during the surgical process. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is severe cognitive impairment. Individuals with a score of 5 or higher on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) will be excluded from the study. This is necessary to ensure that participants can actively engage in and benefit from the PST intervention. Severe cognitive impairment may limit the individual's ability to participate in therapy sessions, understand the intervention, and provide meaningful feedback on its feasibility and acceptability. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Great! The second exclusion criterion is that participants should be able to read, speak, and understand English. This is important for ensuring effective communication between the participants and the research team delivering the intervention. Language barriers can hinder the delivery of the intervention and the collection of accurate data, potentially impacting the study's outcomes and conclusions. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Lastly, the third exclusion criterion is current alcohol or other substance abuse. Individuals with current substance abuse issues will be excluded from the study. This is important as these individuals may have unique psychosocial needs that could confound the results of the study. Substance abuse can also impact the individual's ability to engage in therapy and may require additional support and resources that are beyond the scope of the study. Can you please confirm this criterion?",

They help to ensure that only eligible participants are enrolled in the trial and that the results are as representative of the target population as possible. The first exclusion criterion is age. The trial is only open to participants between the ages of 18 and 75. This is because older and younger participants may have different responses to the treatment being studied, which could affect the results. Any thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",

Now, let's move on to the fourth criterion, which is VEN-AZA refractory defined as no response after two cycles of VEN-AZA whatever the dose and the treatment duration. This criterion ensures that the participants have truly failed to respond to the VENETOCLAX-AZACITIDINE therapy, which is essential for evaluating the efficacy of DASATINIB monotherapy in this specific patient population. Any ideas for this criterion?",

            "That's a crucial consideration. Excluding participants with preferred languages other than English or Spanish will indeed ensure effective communication and prevent language barriers from hindering the study results. It's essential to maintain consistency and accuracy throughout the study. Based on our discussion so far, here are the full criteria we have designed:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Parental or guardian self-identified as Black, African American, African, Latino, Hispanic, or Chicano.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Parent or guardian age less than 18 years old.\n2. Preferred language other than English or Spanish (including if preferred communication is sign language).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further ideas or if there's anything else I can assist you with!"

            "Perfect. The second criterion is that participants should be at least 2 years post-injury. This is to ensure that participants have had sufficient time to stabilize and adapt to their injuries. It helps control for potential confounding variables related to the acute phase of injury. Any questions so far?",
            "Great. The third criterion is that participants should be able to do a level transfer with minimal assistance. This ensures that participants have a certain level of physical ability to safely participate in the study and undergo the passive heat therapy intervention. Is there anything you'd like to add or ask about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on, the fourth criterion is that participants should be engaged in a regular and consistent bowel/bladder management program. This is important for the safety and well-being of participants during the study. Individuals with spinal cord injuries often have specific bowel and bladder management needs that need to be addressed to prevent complications. Any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The fifth criterion is that participants should be 19 years of age or older. This ensures that participants are adults who can provide informed consent and are likely to have a better understanding of the study requirements. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Good. The sixth criterion is that participants should be able to communicate effectively in English. Effective communication is crucial for the study procedures and data collection. Ensuring that participants can communicate in English helps maintain clear and accurate communication throughout the study. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Great. The seventh criterion is that participants should have self-reported well controlled/predictable orthostatic hypertension and/or autonomic dysreflexia, if present. This is necessary to ensure the safety of participants with specific cardiovascular conditions that may be affected by the passive heat therapy intervention. Any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The eighth criterion is that participants should be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, including the initial 2 doses and 1 booster. This criterion is important for the safety of participants and researchers, especially considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination helps reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. We'll follow a similar process to design each criterion step by step. Are you ready to continue?",
            "Great. The first exclusion criterion is that participants should not smoke or use tobacco products. Smoking and tobacco use can have negative effects on cardiovascular health, which may confound the results of the study. Excluding smokers helps control for this potential confounding factor. Any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. The second exclusion criterion is that participants should not have any cardiac/respiratory illness or diabetes mellitus. Participants with pre-existing cardiac, respiratory, or metabolic conditions may have underlying health issues that could impact the study outcomes. Excluding individuals with these conditions helps ensure the safety and integrity of the study. Do you have any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The third exclusion criterion is that participants should not have known diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a condition that may be exacerbated by heat therapy or other study procedures. Excluding individuals with known diverticulitis helps prevent potential complications. Any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Well said. The fourth exclusion criterion is that participants should not be hypertensive, with systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 190 mmHg. Individuals with uncontrolled hypertension may be at increased risk of adverse events during the passive heat therapy intervention. Excluding hypertensive individuals helps ensure participant safety. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The fifth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have a scheduled MRI investigation in the 7 days following the data collection session. MRI investigations may interfere with the study procedures or outcomes. Excluding individuals with scheduled MRI investigations helps avoid potential confounding factors. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The sixth exclusion criterion is that participants should not take prescription medications that affect blood vessels, other than contraceptives. Medications that affect blood vessels may interact with the passive heat therapy intervention or other study procedures. Excluding individuals taking these medications helps control for potential confounding variables. Any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Great. The seventh exclusion criterion is that participants should not have used an erectile dysfunction related medication in the past 48 hours. Erectile dysfunction medications may have cardiovascular effects that could impact the study outcomes. Excluding individuals who have used these medications helps control for potential confounding factors. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The eighth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have an unhealed fracture or contracture that would interfere with a simple chair to tub transfer and/or donning/doffing clothing. Individuals with unhealed fractures or contractures may have physical limitations that could affect their ability to participate safely in the study procedures. Any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Well said. The ninth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have an unhealed pressure sore of any grade and/or open skin areas. Open wounds or pressure sores may increase the risk of infection or complications during the study procedures. Excluding individuals with unhealed pressure sores helps ensure participant safety. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. The tenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have an unstable medical/psychiatric condition or substance abuse disorder. Individuals with unstable medical or psychiatric conditions or substance abuse disorders may not be able to fully participate in the study or may be at increased risk of adverse events. Excluding these individuals helps ensure participant safety and data integrity. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The eleventh exclusion criterion is that participants should not have underlying health conditions or injuries that would impact their ability to tolerate a mild exercise response or hot water immersion. Individuals with underlying health conditions that may be exacerbated by mild exercise or heat therapy may not be suitable for the study. Excluding these individuals helps ensure participant safety. Any thoughts or questions about this criterion?",
            "Well said. The twelfth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have uncontrolled orthostatic hypotension, where blood pressure does not return to normal within 2-3 minutes after standing or transferring. Individuals with uncontrolled orthostatic hypotension may be at increased risk of adverse events during the study procedures. Excluding these individuals helps ensure participant safety. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The thirteenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk for COVID-19, such as respiratory illness, compromised immunity, or chronic health conditions. Individuals with these underlying health conditions may be at increased risk during the study. Excluding these individuals helps ensure participant safety. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Well said. The fourteenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have any COVID-19 related symptoms, such as a new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, or other symptoms. Individuals with COVID-19 symptoms may be at risk of transmitting the virus to other participants or researchers. Excluding individuals with COVID-19 symptoms helps prevent the spread of the virus during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The fifteenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have traveled outside Canada or had close contact with anyone who has traveled outside Canada in the past 14 days. Travel increases the risk of COVID-19 exposure and transmission. Excluding individuals who have traveled outside Canada helps reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the study. Any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Well said. The sixteenth exclusion criterion is that participants should not have close contact with anyone with respiratory illness or a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19. Close contact with individuals who may have COVID-19 increases the risk of transmission. Excluding individuals with close contact with respiratory illness or COVID-19 cases helps prevent the spread of the virus during the study. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The seventeenth and final exclusion criterion is that participants should not be currently self-isolating. Individuals who are self-isolating may have been exposed to COVID-19 or have symptoms of the virus. Excluding individuals who are self-isolating helps prevent the spread of COVID-19 during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Considering the study's focus on assessing coronary artery lesions, it would be appropriate to include patients with intermediate coronary lesions, specifically those with diameter stenosis between 30% and 80% as visually estimated from coronary angiography. This will allow for a diverse and clinically relevant study population. What do you think?",

The first criterion we can consider is excluding patients who are ineligible for diagnostic intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or fractional flow reserve (FFR) examination. These diagnostic tests are essential for the study, so we need to ensure that participants can undergo them. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",

Previous bypass surgery could affect the accuracy of the diagnostic tests being evaluated in the study, so excluding these patients helps ensure the reliability of the results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I completely agree with you. Moving on to the next criterion, we should exclude patients who have had a myocardial infarction within 72 hours of coronary angiography. Recent myocardial infarction could confound the results of the diagnostic tests, so excluding these patients helps minimize potential bias. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",

Patients with serum creatinine levels greater than 150 umol/L or glomerular filtration rates less than 45 ml/kg/1.73 m2 should be excluded. Impaired renal function could impact the use of contrast agents and adenosine during the diagnostic tests, so excluding patients with renal dysfunction helps minimize potential risks. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Allergic reactions to these agents could pose a safety risk during the diagnostic tests, so it's best to prevent such adverse events by excluding patients with known allergies. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I fully agree with you. We're almost done with the criteria design. The next criterion we should consider is excluding patients with a life expectancy of less than 2 years. Patients with limited life expectancy may not benefit from the study procedures, so it's best to focus our resources on participants who are more likely to benefit. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Lastly, let's discuss the final exclusion criteria. Patients with an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) pullback that does not cover the entire lesion should be excluded. Complete imaging of the target lesion is necessary for accurate assessment, so excluding patients with incomplete IVUS coverage helps ensure the quality of the data. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
