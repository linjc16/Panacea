            ".\nThe second study arm aims to understand the effectiveness of the health check program, by recording people's physical and mental health, as well as their level of satisfaction with their health status before and after the intervention. The third study arm focuses on investigating the efficacy of the health check program on improving people's self-efficacy for their health-related behaviors. To achieve this, pre- and post-tests with different measures of self-efficacy from three different aspects will be administered, including (1) General self-efficacy for health, reflecting individuals' ability to engage in healthy behaviors, (2) Social-environmental self-efficacy for health, which reflects individuals' ability to adapt to their social and economic environment for health purposes, and (3) Environmental self-efficacy for health, which reflects individuals' ability to cope with challenges in the context of their environment to maintain their health. The fourth study will examine the impact of the health check program on improving residents' perceptions of healthy lifestyles. This study will look at the changes in health-promoting lifestyle profiles pre- and post-test using the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile-II (HPLP-II) instrument. The fifth study aims to check the effects of the health check program on improving people's satisfaction with the service received from the program. A pre-post evaluation will also be conducted to assess the levels of participants' satisfaction with the program using items adopted from the literature.\n.\n. Fetal fibronectins: markers in predicting spontaneous labor and birth.\nFetal fibronectins (FF) are proteins found in various body fluids. Its presence in cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) indicates a risk of preterm labor and delivery. The purpose of this study was to compare and correlate the various markers, fFNs, NTproBNP, and IL-8, with the duration of pregnancy and labor. The study was conducted on 43 pregnant women at gestational age range 6-12w. A sample was taken from the CVS and transferred into a sterile tube. Serum was obtained for NTproBNP and IL-8 assay. An increase in fFN (94.56",
            "Veterinarian Calls to a Veterinary Emergency and Referral Center Compared with Veterinarians in Private Practice.\nVeterinary emergency and referral centers are a relatively recent addition to the veterinary practice landscape in the USA. The Veterinary Emergency and Referral Center at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine has been open since 2000 serving cats and dogs and providing a referral service for veterinary specialties. Our objectives were to determine: 1) how frequently calls were initiated by veterinarians and their staff when compared to clients coming in person, 2) if calls were placed by private practice veterinarians working in the region for themselves or for employers, 3) if calls were made by veterinarians on the medical staff of the referral center. Call logs were reviewed from August 20, 2007 thru December 31, 2010 (959 days). The majority of calls were placed by clients coming to the clinic, approximately 39% were placed by private practice veterinarians 6% of the time was placed by veterinarians employed by an employer. Calls placed by referral center staff physicians were very rare. Calls originating from those in private practice were often from practices employing one to 4 veterinarians and were most common in the afternoon hours. This study provides support for the idea that the number of veterinarians within a relatively close distance could impact outcomes and costs of services. The preciousness of time for the chronically ill and the meaning of life.\nHeath discusses the fact that a chronic illness forces the person to \"step back,\" to confront the inescapable issue of ultimate meaning. He suggests that the key for such a person is developing a commitment to a particular view of the purpose of life, and that it is not necessary to face death to gain this.

            "Dose reduction using multishot echo\u2010planar imaging for high\u2010resolution functional MR neuroimaging\nA new sequence combining multishot\u2010TR\u2010EPI with parallel readout gradients has been proposed to increase the signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio (SNR) of echo\u2010planar imaging (EPI)\u2010based functional MR studies. In order to assess the benefits of multishot imaging, the signal evolutions of multiband (multishot) echo\u2010planar imaging (mb\u2010TR\u2010EPI) and conventional single\u2010band echo\u2010planar imaging (sb\u2010TR\u2010EPI) were compared to the noise variance over time during high\u2010resolution (2.8\u2010mm2 in\u2010plane resolution) fMRI brain studies at 3T. In addition, a new analysis method to reduce the acquisition time needed for a functional MRI study was developed using the temporal evolution of the noise variance derived from the signal time course, and the effect of multishot imaging was investigated, as well as acquisition efficiency when using multishot imaging in a T2\u2010weighted structural experiment. The mb\u2010TR\u2010EPI sequence showed that a higher scan speed (\u223c12% reduction in the acquisition time) can be achieved by multishot imaging. Moreover, the method of analyzing noise variance by signal time courses was not applicable to the sb\u2010TR\u2010EPI sequence. The time\u2010varying noise variance is a good index to assess the acquisition efficiency and determine the optimal TR, depending on the number of signals averaged. J. Magn. Reson.

            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
