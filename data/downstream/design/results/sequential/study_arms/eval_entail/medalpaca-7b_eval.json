Arm 2 - Tai Chi Easy 1 (the experimental group): This group/ arm will receive the Tai Chi Easy program. Participants will receive minimal instruction and encouragement to complete eight weeks of Tai Chi Easy sessions via either a remote video link-up or in a group with a local instructor. Group sessions, usually lasting 30 minutes, take place once or twice a week for eight weeks. Between sessions, participants continue to do the exercises on their own as recommended, usually at home. This allows people with busy schedules to improve their health on their own schedule, in their own home or other convenient location such as a park or senior center. Tai Chi Easy is adapted to make the movements easy for people of any ability or disability, since the adaptations can be done quickly. Tai Chi Easy reduces many of the complexities and difficulties of \"traditional\" Tai Chi through a series of simple adaptations to overcome the challenges of balance, flexibility, and coordination that arise from a sedentary lifestyle. It is also designed to overcome many of the cultural barriers that prevent individuals from attempting Tai Chi by using accessible techniques that can be done seated or standing. Tai Chi Easy includes instruction in a gentle form that can be performed seated in a chair or standing with assistance. Simple breath work and guided relaxation techniques will also be taught. Tai Chi Easy enables its practitioners - regardless of age or physical ability to experience many of the health benefits of Tai Chi. The primary benefits are stress reduction and improved health, especially for pain relief and improved joint and bone health. It teaches participants to use their own body weight to provide gentle resistance for muscle building and increased circulation while at the same time teaching them a form of deep meditation. The adaptations can be found on my website. http://www.taihealth.com/tai-ch easy.htm. The goal is to create strong and vital people so that chronic pain can be managed or relieved. The effects of Tai Chi Easy are cumulative. The more one practices the simpler form taught, the increased benefits will be realized as time passes."

            "So, we have designed the study arms and have specified the interventions and outcomes for each one of them. It's time to finalize the study design.\nSTROBE-type statements are items that can be used to describe the contents of a structured, standardized title and a structured, standardized abstract for a research study. The STROBE-type statements below can be applied directly to the example presented in the previous video. \nStudy Rationale\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of a tracheostomy management protocol implemented within a Swiss paraplegic center.\nThe study protocol includes three arms. The first arm will consist of a cohort of patients that receive usual care. A second arm will include a cohort of patients who will undergo the intervention of interest: a decannulation management protocol. The last arm will consist of a cohort of patients whose tracheostomies will be decannulated by the aforementioned protocol. The main outcome measures of interest are hospitalization times, complication rates, and quality of life measurements.\nThe study population will consist of all adult patients who require a prolonged tracheostomy at a Swiss paraplegic center.\nThe time period for enrollment for the current study is set to commence in January 2020 and will end no later than December 2023.\nThis trial is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. The sample size has not yet been determined.\nThe present study has not yet been published, and no publications have been authored by the investigators.\nAnyone with significant interest in the study is encouraged to participate in a consultation meeting for the study protocol. No formal approval from an institutional review board is required at present.\nConsidering the specific context and circumstances of the research question, there are no known risks associated with participation.\nThere is no plan to publish or distribute any study results at present."

During the screening and baseline period, patients are not given any predefined intervention and are asked to follow the healthy lifestyle and medication regimen.

By looking at the quality of life outcomes in different age groups, we can analyze the effectiveness of niraparib in different patient populations. That's a great idea!

Patients must be between 40-80 years old, have HbA1c < 8%, Ejection Fraction > 40% and NYHA class 2 or 3 and be ambulatory.

Outcomes are assessed at 2 and 12 weeks (with phone calls at 4 and 8 weeks). Follow-up calls will be made at 30 and 90 days after discontinuation of the study drug. Adverse events will be treated with an additional 2 weeks of HL. The primary endpoint will be the between-group difference in the change from baseline to week 12 in the KCCQ Clinical Summary Score. Key secondary endpoints are 12-week cardiac marker levels. Sample size is 50 per arm, with a 0.05 level and 80% power to detect a 15-point difference between treatment groups in the KCCQ Clinical Summary Score. It is estimated that 72 participants would be needed if 25% of the planned dropouts are at 12 weeks. The contracted research organization will implement processes to monitor adherence to Good Clinical Practices, SOPs, and the study protocol. Toxicology testing will be done on the first 20 participants who experience a severe adverse event. A Data Monitoring Committee will be established to monitor the study conduct and safety data and review for futility. Any potential safety signals would be referred to the safety monitoring committee (SMC). Patient follow-up will be for 30 days after the last dose of drug."

            "The number of arms in the trial should probably be 2, 3, or 6, in order to have adequate power, along with the control group. You'll want to make sure that no other interventions are administered during or after the intervention phase (these would go into the confounding factors). You might want to use a washout period and/or a screening period before and/or after, in order to make sure that the intervention group is comparable to the control group before being subjected to the intervention. There are several blinding methods which could be employed, but if it's a surgical trial, I would highly recommend blinding both the subject and investigator. Any data collected before the intervention phase should be properly managed to avoid confounding factors. This usually takes the form of a prospective case register, or a core-lab. During the intervention phase, please make sure subjects are kept in groups, and try to reduce extrinsic variables as much as possible (don't have them wear different colors, don't have one nurse administer treatments, etc). Your study design should include a washout period and/or a followup period for sustainment of effect. Any serious unforeseen complications should have a plan in place to address them, and followup data should be collected for adverse effects.

            "Certainly. The interventions in each arm will be the same, except for the transcortical surface texture. Those in the experimental arm will have Rex implants with a machined surface, whereas those in the comparator arm will have Rex implants with a rough surface. The machined surface will help us assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes of osseointegration with a machined transcortical portion. The rough surface will serve as a comparison to the machined surface, evaluating the outcomes of the same implant with a different surface texture.",
            "The machined surface of the Rex implants has been shown to reduce microleakage and inflammation. However, rough surfaces have also been shown to promote better integration and osseointegration. Therefore, we want to compare the effectiveness of each surface in the same clinical scenario.",
            "Certainly. The complete study arms will be as follows: Experimental arm 1: Rex transcortical implants with machined surface (active arm): \u2022 Implant placement will use the standard surgical protocol, including adequate bone removal, drilling of a straight line, the addition of collagen, and placement of the Rex implant with a machined surface. 2.5 mm bone taper for machined implants and 1.5 mm for roughened implants will be used, according to the brand's protocol. Random allocation to the two types of surfaces will be done for each implant. Active comparator arm 1: Rex transcortical implants with a roughened surface (passive arm): 2.5 mm will be placed according to the brand's protocol for roughened implants for all patients. Arm 2: Rex transcortical implants with machined surface (passive arm): the same insertion protocol and 2.5 mm bone taper will be used as the active arm. Random allocation to the two types of surfaces will be performed for each implant. The clinical and radiographic outcomes will be assessed.  Both control and experimental arms will be evaluated radiographically 3, 9, and 12 months after placement to check bone crest-to-implant ridge width and bone-to-implant osseointegration. Evaluation of clinical outcomes will be done with the following criteria for each patient: implant survival rate, peri-implant marginal bone loss, peri-implantitis, crest height, and plaque control. This protocol allows us to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of rough versus machined implants for implant placement in narrow ridges with minimal bone. Additionally, it can help us understand the influence of surface roughness of implants in improving the clinical outcomes of implant therapy in this specific situation.  Interested individuals can contact me for the complete protocol. \nAdapting to local conditions is important. Some clinical situations require special attention and specific protocols to provide optimal outcomes. Using the appropriate design and surface of implants can optimize clinical and radiological results. We hope that this case example serves as a template and inspiration for similar studies in other clinical situations."

It is thought to be largely due to Type 2 immune dysregulation.1 Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the activity of the Delta and Kappa subtypes of the IL-4 receptor on mast cells and some keratinocytes, resulting in decreased IgE and IgG type I cytokine responses. It is licensed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and children 12 years of age or older who are not adequately treated with topical or corticosteroids. It is applied as a 300-mcg dose by subcutaneous injection every two weeks."
