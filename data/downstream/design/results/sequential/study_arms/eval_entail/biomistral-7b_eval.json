The administration of intramuscular doses of M72/AS01E-4 vaccine is designed to activate the immune system by the vaccine delivery system and the adjuvant. The recombinant protein antigens expressed by the M72 recombinant protein vaccine are introduced into antigen-presenting cells and presented to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are important for providing effective immune responses against M.tb infection. The AS01E-4 adjuvant is a nano-emulsion-based adjuvant system that consists of 95% squalene and surfactant emulsifiers polysorbate 80 and Tween 85 (25% of the squalene's volume). AS01E-adjuvanted vaccines have a good safety profile and the capacity to induce strong systemic and mucosal immune responses . The use of intramuscular doses instead of subcutaneous or intradermal doses is justified by the fact that M72/AS01E-4 vaccine is expected to stimulate antigen-presenting cells capable of presenting antigens to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells more efficiently at the deep tissues rather than at the surface layer of the skin.",

            "That's a good point, and I agree that it's important to evaluate the effectiveness of cemiplimab and cemiplimab/fianlimab in treatment-naive patients. Including treated patients may introduce confounding effects on the results and limit the ability to draw meaningful conclusions. What other exclusion criteria are being considered?",

            "I agree that a study arm to evaluate the efficacy of cemiplimab alone is crucial. Now, moving on to cohort B, the participant group/arm comprises individuals who are receiving cemiplimab as a combination therapy with fianlimab. The intervention/treatment for this arm is cemiplimab (350 mg administered IV) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle and fianlimab (1 mg administered SQ) on Days 9, 16, and 23 of each 21-day cycle for a total of 4 cycles of co-treatment. The other names for fianlimab are Tadekinig alpha and the approved brand name is MEDI8375. The rationale for including the cohort is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of fianlimab in combination with cemiplimab in treating microsatellite unstable localized or locally advanced colorectal cancer in older patients. The addition of this arm will determine if the combination treatment of cemiplimab and fianlimab is more effective compared to the monotherapy (i.e., Cohort A) in treating the disease. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "The second study arm is the experimental cohort B. Patients in this arm will receive cemiplimab combined with fianlimab (500 mg administered IV) on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 4. Cemiplimab is administered as described for cohort A, while fianlimab is given at 960 mg on Days 1 to 5 of Cycles 1 to 4 for a total of four doses. The combination of cemiplimab with fianlimab is necessary to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD exposure of fianlimab in combination with cemiplimab. It will also elucidate their combined preclinical efficacy in colorectal cancer by leveraging synergistic antitumor activity based on preclinical pharmacology and pharmacodynamics assessments. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "Absolutely! Including a study arm with the combination treatment can provide valuable insights into potential synergistic effects. Now, we have the two experimental study arms covered. Next, let's consider the control cohort."

CSF proteins from peripheral circulation: This method involves identifying proteins that are present in both the CSF and peripheral blood. Inhibitors targeting proteins that are present in both the CSF and peripheral blood can act by affecting blood\u2013brain barrier transport and thus the movement of proteins into the CSF.2. Biomarker candidates: Proteomic studies have identified potential CSF biomarkers that can also be measured in peripheral blood. For example, we can assess the levels of neurodegenerative markers such as synuclein, p-tau, t-tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and total tau/hyperphosphorylated-\u03c4 (p-\u03c4) ratio in both the CSF and peripheral blood as they are indicative of Parkinson's disease progression. We can also assess the levels of inflammatory markers such as cytokines in both the CSF and peripheral blood.3. Imaging markers: Peripheral images (i.e., retinal images) obtained using retinal imaging systems (cellular retinal camera) can detect proteins that are present in the CSF and are indicative of early neurodegenerative changes such as L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) and cognitive dysfunction. These protein biomarkers can be identified from retinal images using artificial intelligence (AI).4. Transporter activity: Candidate therapies can be assessed based on their ability to transport across the BBB in the CSF and peripheral blood using cell-based assays and animal models to determine whether they are able to act as drug delivery vehicles.",

It might be helpful to focus on improving students' empathic ability to notice non-verbal and emotional cues. For example, you could encourage empathic responding through observation and empathy lab programs . Furthermore, you could introduce self-awareness and emotional management activities through reflection lab programs  to help students better understand their emotional response to patients' stories and how it affects their empathy. Finally, you could include emotional expression exercises  to practice effective empathy skills in real-life situations.

However, if you are planning to evaluate a new intervention, such as a new drug, then you will need to conduct a clinical trial and your study may fall under one of the four phases of the trial. For example, if you conduct a clinical trial to evaluate whether your intervention is more effective than the existing intervention, it would be considered as a phase III trial.

A stable isotope is a version of a naturally occurring element in which several nuclei have certain atomic nuclei replaced with a different nuclei, making them resistant to radioactive decay. In this case, we will use 2H5-Phenylalanine, also known as p2Hyl. p2Hyl is a synthetic amino acid with five deuterium atoms replacing hydrogen atoms in the phenylalanine molecule. The deuterium atoms cause the p2Hyl to be metabolized and excreted at a slower rate than phenylalanine . The main difference between 2H5-Phenylalanine and phenylalanine is that deuterium atoms are slightly heavier than hydrogen atoms, which slows down metabolism. This allows for more precise and easier measurements of albumin catabolic rate.

An RCT is a superior design to cohort designs when assigning cause\u2013effect relationships to treatments, where confounding factors are better addressed. It also prevents confounding bias by using allocation concealment during the recruitment and randomized assignment to treatment/placebo among study participants. There are several types of RCT designs: parallel RCTs, crossover, factorial, and stratified. Parallel RCTs recruit participants to treatment and placebo cohorts. Crossover trials involve a single cohort of participants that are randomly assigned to either treatment or placebo at separate visits. The advantage of a cross-over design is that it doesn't require participants to receive both treatments. Factorial RCTs evaluate two treatments by randomly assigning participants to treatment and control groups. Finally, stratified RCTs recruit participants in different subgroups (strata) to assign treatment and control groups.

This is critical for cancer treatment as it allows researchers to determine the optimal dose of a drug that can be used to treat the cancer without causing unacceptable toxicity. Similarly, dose exploration arm is used to determine the efficacy of a dose of the drug. The exploration dose has to be within the upper limit of the safe dose range.

Additionally, the use of single-subject designs can be an important tool to examine the possible effects of treatments or therapy in populations where randomized controlled trials cannot be easily implemented using traditional group designs14. A number of different procedures can be taken when implementing the single-subject design, although a standard procedure known as the multiple-baseline design is often used for single-system designs. In this approach, the participant receives the treatment of interest after sufficient data has been collected to demonstrate a reliable baseline, and the data collection continues until post-treatment data are collected, which generally demonstrate a change in the target behavior compared to the baseline.

This study arm is designed to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the dual immune checkpoint blockade without priming the immune system with a neoantigen vaccine (FusionVAC-22) first. The treatment sequence of FusionVAC-22 followed by TecentriqTM is intended to generate a more robust T-cell response directed against the common neoantigens on FLC-infected cells that are expressed by most FLC patients. What do you think about this arm?",

As Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma is a rare cancer, clinical studies on it are typically underfunded. Because of this, it may be challenging to secure sufficient recruitment numbers to compare the effectiveness of the treatment arms. To address this potential issue, we can include an arm of treatment that acts as a \"positive control\" study. This arm will allow us to test the safety and immunogenicity of FusionVAC-22 in the absence of treatment effects caused by chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, or any other forms of cancer therapy. We can label this arm as \"Control: Peptide vaccine alone\". FusionVAC-22 in this arm will be administered according to the same schedule and methods as described in the experimental arm. This will help assess the safety of the treatment, with special attention paid to any adverse events or immune-related side effects. What do you think about adding this control arm?",

Including a supportive care arm can give us valuable information on the benefits of other interventions, such as specific dietary restrictions, symptom management, and patient support services.

As discussed earlier, the experimental intervention will involve implants with a machined transcortical portion and the active comparator will include implants with a roughened transcortical portion. Both types of implants will undergo bone consumption followed by bone expansion procedures in each study arm. However, the timing and approach of bone consumption and bone expansion will vary between the two study arms. For the experimental group, the implants with a machined portion will be placed first, and then the bone consumption procedure will be initiated. After enough bone volume is obtained, the implants will be subsequently prepared to receive a dental crown by the bone expansion procedure. This sequence of bone consumption first followed by bone expansion is chosen based on previous research by Abbasian et al.  and Dahiya et al. .",
            "The research question of the clinical trial that you are designing is to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of dental implants placed in edentulous narrow ridges using single-implant-supported mandibular complete fixed-bridge restorations. In addition to that, the aim is to study the bone remodeling between various implant surfaces. In this context, the experimental arm, namely, Rex Ti implant (with a machined surface transcortically), will be used in this trial to compare it with the active comparator arm, namely, Rex Ti-3 implant (with a roughened surface transcortically). These two implant-system options have shown good results in clinical studies and meta-analyses performed in the last 5 years. The study protocol will provide a scientific answer on which of the two implant-surface modifications, the machined or roughened, is superior in achieving better results in single-implant-supported mandibular complete fixed-bridge restorations placed in edentulous narrow ridges. In this context, the rationale for choosing Rex Ti implant as the experimental arm is that some evidence suggests that implants with roughened surfaces may provide a more secure and stable platform for supporting the restoration, particularly in situations with limited bone density or compromised bone quality. Thus, it is important to assess whether or not these implant surface modifications indeed provide additional benefits in terms of bone remodeling. The rationale for choosing Rex Ti implant as the active comparator arm is that it has a different surface topography, and it has shown good results in previous research. Therefore, this design provides an opportunity to carry out a direct comparison between the effects of these two implant surface modifications on the clinical and radiographic outcomes.",
            "Of course. Study Arm 1 will use implants with the experimental intervention, which involves implants with a machined transcortical portion combined with bone consumption and the bone expansion method. Study Arm 2 will use implants with the active comparator intervention, involving implants with a roughened transcortical portion with bone consumption and the bone expansion method. This comparison will help in understanding whether there are any differences in the outcomes in terms of osseointegration, bone density, and marginal bone height between implants with a roughened transcortical portion and implants with a machined transcortical portion."

This arm differs from arm 1 only in that it excludes 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 radioligand therapy, EBRT is the only treatment option. We can also mention that the rationale for this arm is to assess safety and feasibility of EBRT alone for treating biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.",
            "Based on the information provided so far, the second study arm could be called \"Control 1\". In this arm, the patients would receive external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and Fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose-Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (fHIFU) treatment. The rationale for this arm is to provide a control intervention that is comparable to the main treatment arm (Experimental: Treatment (EBRT, 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1)) but without the addition of the new drug (177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1). EBRT is used to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors, while fHIFU is a minimally invasive treatment that uses high intensity focused ultrasound to heat and destroy prostate cancer cells. The purpose of this control arm is to provide a benchmark against which to compare the effectiveness and safety of the main treatment arm. Additionally, the use of biospecimen collection, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography allows for monitoring and evaluation of treatment response and side effects. What are your thoughts on this study arm design, and should we explore adding any additional study arms?",
            "Great choice! Here are some ideas for inclusion and exclusion criteria: patients should have prostate adenocarcinoma and PSA relapse but no evidence of intractable metastasis (asymptomatic/minimal symptoms). Additionally, they should have had a PSA response to previous anti-androgenic therapy and undergone a minimum of 4 weeks of anti-androgen withdrawal prior to the 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment. Their ECOG score should be between 0-2. In terms of exclusion, patients with history or risk factors for renal and hepatic failure, or severe neurological deficits should be excluded. Does this work for you?",
            "Absolutely! Here are some suggestions for the inclusion criteria: patients should have adenocarcinoma of the prostate, post radical prostatectomy with detectable PSA, and clinical PSMA PET/CT findings of pelvic uptake only (prostate bed, pelvic lymph node uptake, or both). Their ECOG/Zubrod performance status should be between 0-2, and they should be over 18 years of age. As for the exclusion criteria, patients with contraindications to radiotherapy (including active inflammatory bowel disease, prior pelvic radiotherapy, or prior radioligand therapy), risk factors for Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy (baseline >= grade 2 myelosuppression, renal insufficiency, or xerostomia), definitive findings of systemic metastasis, unacceptable medical or radiation safety risk, unmanageable urinary tract obstruction or hydronephrosis, or severe acute co-morbidities should be excluded.
