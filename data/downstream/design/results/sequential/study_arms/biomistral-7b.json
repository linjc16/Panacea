            "Great, let's add the control arm where they receive no intervention as the first step. Now would be a good time to consider the desired outcomes. What would you like to measure in the trial and why? This will help identify the outcomes that would show a difference between the study and the control groups.",
            "Perfect. For the third study arm, we could add another group of participants who also engage in the self-management intervention and nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class in addition to receiving telephonic health coaching sessions with a care manager or behavioral health expert to improve patient activation for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the behavioral health component in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. This arm will help us understand the impact of adding additional behavioral counseling sessions on improving outcomes and activating patients. What do you think?",
            "Got it! We can name the control group as \"Group Self-Management,\" the second study arm as \"Tele-health Self-Management,\" and the third study arm as \"Self-Management with Health Behavior Change Counseling.\" Now we need to determine the sample size and set up the study outcomes to evaluate these interventions."

            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
