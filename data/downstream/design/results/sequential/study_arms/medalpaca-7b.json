            "Another arm could be for behavioral health behavior change counseling alone. This arm will allow us to compare the effects of the self-management program with the effects of psychological intervention alone. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! So, would you be able to provide resources such as eligibility criteria, CONSORT flowchart, and other details for the study plan?",
            "Wonderful! Now that we have a treatment plan in place, let's discuss the primary and secondary outcome measures for the study. The primary outcome measure will be patient activation, assessed using the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). The secondary outcome measures will be changes in low back pain-related disability and pain, assessed using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and the Oswestry Disability Index, respectively. What do you think?"

            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Perfect! Here are the full study arms for the trial:\n\n1. No Intervention: Control\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants receive no intervention.\n\n2.
