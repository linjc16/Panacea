Perilesional interstitial fluid volume expands due to increased local edema and inflammation as well as decreased fluid resorption. The proposed mechanism of action is to promote clearance of edema and interstitial fluid, as well as reduce inflammation and tissue swelling. 20 patients will be initially enrolled in each dose group. The primary safety outcome will be an evaluation of dose\u2010limiting toxicity (DLT). The primary efficacy outcome will be efficacy assessment of PLC on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) MRI at weeks 2 and 8. A dose expansion Phase 2 study will be conducted if 2 or fewer of the 20 patients in a given arm experience DLT. Methods: Eligible participants are aged 18 to 80, have suffered a stroke within 2\u201028 days prior to enrollment, and have a hemorrhagic infarct of at least 4cm2 and a PLC. Patients will be hospitalized for four weeks and monitored at 2\u2010week intervals. This project will result in the use of 464 participants. Patients will be enrolled sequentially by dose.

            "My pleasure!\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\n\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nEarly diagnosis and intervention could promote tumor prognosis and improve patient survival. At the same time, it also provides a good chance for patients to undergo radical surgery. However, during the early cancer stage, the tumor is not easy to identify by using traditional imaging techniques. In order to further improve the detection ability of early cancer, the early detection of endoscope ultrasound-based contrast enhanced imaging has attracted the attention of researchers.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nLung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the world, and early-stage disease is rarely detected because of a lack of early symptoms. A variety of tumor markers can be used to screen for early or locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, including CEA, NSE, and so on. In addition, a variety of imaging detection means can be used to detect lung nodules, such as CT, MRI, and so on. However, some of the abovementioned tumor markers have high false positive and false negative rates, and some imaging tools have problems such as high false positive and false negative rates, high cost, and radiation. At the same time, only a few patients can be screened for early tumors, and the curative effect of treatment such as surgery on early tumors is greatly improved. This paper designs an intelligent early lung cancer screening platform based on CT images. The platform uses computer vision technology to optimize the lesion detection algorithm to solve the problem of low detection efficiency of early lesions. At the same time, a new algorithm of early lung lesion diagnosis is established, so as to realize the more accurate detection of early lung cancer.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Research on Contrast-enhanced Ultrasonography of Early Non-small Cell Lung Cancer\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nBronchiolitis Cystic Fibrosis, Early Solid Tumor of Lung\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Diagnostic Test: contrast-enhancement ultrasonography\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Clinical patients in clinical stages IA-IIIB who are pathologically confirmed as non-small cell lung cancer, and patients with clinical stage"

Methods: From November 2016 to November 2018, a prospective single\u2010arm nonrandomized Phase 2 trial will be conducted in patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. Patients will receive orally 400 mga of crizotinib on days 1\u20137 every four weeks, aspirin 100 mg twice weekly, and methotrexate 6.5 mg/m2 weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. The primary endpoint of this study is progression\u2010free survival. Secondary endpoints are safety and overall survival, and objective response rate. Discussion: The combination of crizotinib, aspirin, and methotrexate has demonstrated an excellent safety profile in other cancers, including gastric cancer and NSCLC. Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer have few treatment options available and have a prognosis of 6 months and a response rate of <14%. Crizotinib is the standard therapy for the treatment of lung cancer following EGFR mutation, and EGFR mutations are frequently expressed in gallbladder and cholangiocarcinoma. This clinical trial will assess the efficacy of the EGFR inhibitor Crizotinib combined with aspirin and methotrexate for advanced biliary tract cancer. \n\n1.Background\nHistorically, biliary tract cancer occurred at a frequency of about 2\u20133 times per 100.000 persons <3 years old, 11\u201312 times per 100.000 persons 30\u201349 years old, and about 27\u201331 times per 100.000 persons 50 years old"

Individuals on the wait\u2010list will receive the Tai Chi Easy after 8 weeks/16 sessions. The trial is comprised of three arms: Active Treatment, Wait\u2010List Control, and Enriched Enrollment Control. The Intervention component of the study is a virtual version of a behavioral intervention called Tai Chi Easy, which is a manualized 8\u2010week group\u2010based intervention that incorporates elements of cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (CBT), exercise science, and traditional Chinese medicine.

After informed consent is obtained, the patients will be in the prone position for 16 hours. During this period, the patients will be monitored by EIT every 4 hours to measure ventilation-perfusion matching. The patients will be in the supine position for another 8 hours, and the EIT monitoring will be performed every 2 hours during this period. \nThe study will be terminated earlier than expected if the patient shows any of the following: \n1. Respiratory failure \n2. Hemodynamic instability \n3. Severe deterioration of organ function \n4. Death \n5. Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy \n\nTarget number of participants: 50",
            "It is well known that CARDS results in diffuse pulmonary damage and reduced ventilation-perfusion matching. In non-COVID19-ARDS, the distribution of ventilation-perfusion mismatch is heterogeneous, with more ventilation in the dorsal lung. In CARDS, by contrast, the ventilation-perfusion mismatch is more uniform throughout the lungs, with less dorsal-ventral gradients.\n\nIn this study, we aim to determine the effect of prone positioning on ventilation-perfusion matching in COVID19-associated ARDS (CARDS) and non-COVID19-associated ARDS (non-CARDS). By measuring the pulmonary function using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) before and after proning, we will compare the changes in ventilation-perfusion matching between the two groups to understand the mechanism of CARDS and guide clinical management.",
            "I'll be happy to do that. However, in order to ensure that the data collected accurately reflects the study design, it would be helpful for me to provide some feedback on it before you output anything.\n\nHere are my suggested modifications:\n\nRecommended revisions for Title: Change \"Lung\" to \"Pulmonary\" to reflect the lung, not the organ, as the study is investigating electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measurements of the lung parenchyma, which is a subdivision of the lung.\n\nCorrections to the Study Type and Phase: Change \"Phase III\" to \"Phase II\" or \"Phase III\" to \"Phase IV\", as applicable. These are non-interventional trials, thus the last phases of a drug's development and use. If the trial is being conducted to understand the efficacy of an intervention or treatment, the study design should be revised to reflect that.  \nIdeally, the study design should reflect the purpose of the trial, be clearly stated and structured in simple, concise language, and be understandable to non-medical professionals. In addition, it should adhere to accepted practices and protocols within the field of medical research. \n\nProspective, observational study. 45 ARDS patients receive the prone position intervention. Controls are 45 patients with COPD in the prone position.\n\nProspective, observational study. 45 COVID19 patients receive the prone position intervention. Controls are 45 patients with non-COVID19 ARDS in the prone position. \nIf you would like to include both of these arms as separate studies, they can be output separately or in the same document, provided that the study design and objectives are appropriately reflected in each arm.

The first study arm, which focuses on COVID19-associated ARDS (CARDS), is necessary to specifically investigate the impact of prone positioning on ventilation-perfusion matching in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS. By comparing the results of this group with the non-COVID19 ARDS group, researchers can determine if there are any unique characteristics or responses in COVID-19 patients that may influence the effectiveness of prone positioning.\n\nThe second study arm, Non-COVID19-associated ARDS (non-CARDS), is crucial for providing a comparison group to the CARDS arm. By including patients with ARDS from non-COVID-19 causes, researchers can assess the generalizability of the findings and determine if the effects of prone positioning on ventilation-perfusion matching are consistent across different etiologies of ARDS. This comparison is essential for drawing meaningful conclusions about the overall efficacy of prone positioning in improving oxygenation in ARDS patients.",

Participants from each group will undergo the diagnostic test of Next Generation Sequencing, ensuring a minimum DNA amount of over 50ng in bile, tissue, and tissue samples for effective genetic analysis. Are there any criteria for inclusion or exclusion in this study? [INSTRUCTOR] No, it's a feasibility study, so there are no inclusion or exclusion criteria at this point as we are merely testing the feasibility of collecting and analyzing the different samples. However, to ensure the accuracy of the results, we will only include resectable BTC patients. Finally, are there any significant limitations that you foresee in implementing this study?

PATIENT AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 58 female hypercholesterolemic patients (49\u201077 years of age) with a mean serum cholesterol level of 7.17 +/\u2010 0.90 mmol/l (N=58). Twenty\u2010nine patients were selected to test a low saturated fat, high carbohydrate diet (n=15) and a low saturated fat, high unsaturated fat diet (n=14). The other 29 patients were selected to test a low carbohydrate, high saturated fat diet (n=14) and a low carbohydrate, high unsaturated fat diet (n=15). All 58 patients received their assigned diet for 16 weeks. The control of cardiovascular risk factors, blood biochemistry, and inflammatory markers were made at the beginning and at the end of the assigned period and, in case of persistence of symptoms, they were further evaluated with Holter.RESULTS: The high unsaturated fat diet had a similar effect on the serum cholesterol level in the two diets, as well as a similar effect on blood pressure. The increase of serum triglycerides was more pronounced on the carbohydrate diet, but lipoprotein levels remained almost identical. Inflammatory markers were similar in both diets, so they were all grouped together. A decrease in serum CRP occurred in all cases, with the exception of patients on the carbohydrate diet. The control of the clinical status was satisfactory in both diets.CONCLUSION: In this study population, we did not find significant differences between diets, but only differences between dietary regimens in the increase of serum triglycerides and serum CRP.\n\n1.

Primary outcome: sexual response based on the sexual response cycle described by Masters and Johnson, where different phases of sexual arousal:\n- The desire phase: The desire phase is a state of sexual excitement that begins with the perception of erotic stimuli.\n- The excitement phase: This is the second phase of the sexual response cycle. The sexual organs become highly responsive during this phase and the person experiences rapid breathing, increased heart rate, vaginal lubrication, and swelling and dilation of the blood vessels in the penis, which can lead to an erection. Excitement phase is essential for the development of orgasm.\n- The orgasm phase: An orgasm occurs when a person reaches an intense state of sexual excitement and release, accompanied by muscle contractions and a release of sexual tension.\n- The resolution (or refractory) phase: This is the final stage when the body returns to a calm, relaxed state.\n\nSecondary outcome\n=================\n2. Secondary Outcome: Sexual dysfunctions: Sexual dysfunctions are conditions that can affect a person's ability to enjoy a healthy and pleasurable sexual life. It is common for both men and women to experience sexual dysfunction at some point in their lives, and it can occur as a result of physical or psychological factors.\nThe most common sexual dysfunctions in women include: Hypoactive sexual desire disorder: this is a condition in which a woman has a low level of sexual desire or lacks interest in sexual activity. It is sometimes caused by physical or psychological factors, such as hormonal changes, relationship problems, stress, or medications. Arousal disorder: this is characterized by difficulty becoming aroused or attaining an orgasm. Physical factors, such as medication use or hormone imbalances, can contribute to arousal disorder. Female orgasmic disorder: Some women may have difficulty achieving orgasm during sexual intercourse or masturbation. This can occur due to physical or psychological factors, such as stress, relationship issues, or lack of sexual stimulation. Sexual pain disorder: this is characterized by pain during sexual intercourse, sometimes referred to as dyspareunia. It can result from physical factors, such as vaginal dryness or infection, or psychological",

Abstract:\nBackground: Many studies have shown that yoga therapy has a positive impact on mental health and physical wellbeing. It can reduce stress levels, improve sleep quality, enhance immunity, and increase flexibility and strength. However, most of these studies have focused on individual or group yoga sessions, rather than yoga therapy provided by a qualified yoga therapist. Additionally, many health conditions are associated with mental health issues, such as stress and anxiety, which can affect the effectiveness of the therapy. Therefore, this study aims to assess the efficacy of yoga therapy provided by a yoga therapist in improving the mental health and physical wellbeing of patients with health conditions affected by stress and anxiety. Methods: This randomized control trial will be conducted on 70 patients diagnosed with health conditions that are associated with stress and anxiety. The patients will be randomly allocated into two groups: a yoga therapy group and a control group. The yoga therapy group will receive 12 sessions of yoga therapy provided by a qualified yoga therapist, while the control group will receive standard care for their health condition.

It causes incomplete emptying of the bladder leading to residual urine. The primary objective of the study will be to compare the efficiency of trans\u2010sphincter injections of botulinum toxin vs. onabotulinumtoxinA in patients with urinary retention after SCI with regards to efficiency in the treatment of urinary hyper\u2010reflexia and reduction of postvoid residual urine. We hypothesize that in case of sphincter hyper\u2010reflexia the injection of trans\u2010sphincter Botox will lead to more durable relief than onabotulinumtoxinA. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: This study is a prospective, double\u2010blind, randomized, controlled trial. It will be conducted in the Department of Urology\u2010Urodynamics, Medical University of Warsaw. Patients who were clinically assessed for a spinal lesion for a few months before the study with residual urinary flow over 100 ml after 4 hours will be included in the study. The study will include 30 patients, 15 in each group. A simple randomization method will be applied. The primary endpoint will be the difference in the proportion of responders in the 2 groups after the treatment. We hypothesize that there will be at least 15% higher efficiency of the injection of Botox compared to onabotulinumtoxinA based on previous study reports. The secondary endpoint will assess the difference in the treatment duration between the 2 groups. The differences in the treatment duration between the 2 groups will be tested for normality and if it will be normally distributed we will use the Student t\u2010test, otherwise we will use the Mann\u2010Whitney U test. The effect of each intervention will be analyzed in terms of the mean difference in the treatment duration, standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals.

            "Excellent! The first study arm is described as \"Sleep Restriction\". Can you please provide further details about this study arm? \n\nAim and hypothesis\nThe aim of the first study arm \"Sleep Restriction\" is to examine the effect of sleep restriction on the severity of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms in women. The researchers hypothesize that sleep restriction will decrease the severity of PMS symptoms.\n\nStudy design\nThe study design for the first study arm \"Sleep Restriction\" is randomized controlled trial with a 2-week treatment period. The participants will be randomly assigned to receive either sleep restriction or placebo (sleep extension).\n\n\nIntervention\nThe intervention for the first study arm \"Sleep Restriction\" involves restricting participants' sleep to a certain number of hours per night, which will vary depending on the individual's baseline sleep duration. The participants will be instructed to maintain this sleep restriction schedule for the duration of the treatment period.\n\n\nOutcome measures\nThe outcome measures for the first study arm \"Sleep Restriction\" include the severity of PMS symptoms, as measured by the Hamilton-Moser Inventory and the Hamilton-Depression Inventory. The researchers will also collect sleep data using polysomnography, and the participants' mood and well-being will be assessed using questionnaires.\n\n\nRationale\nThe rationale for using sleep restriction to treat PMS symptoms is based on the hypothesis that sleep restriction can improve sleep quality and quantity, which can in turn alleviate the severity of PMS symptoms.\n\n* This response was generated by a Language Model based AI system.\n*** This response was edited by a human for grammar, spelling, and organization.\n```\n\n```",

            "Study of the Influence of Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer Residual After Sublobar Surgical Treatment\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nLung cancer is the most common lethal cancer in humans in the world and 70% of all lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The disease incidence of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 10% of lung cancers in the world. According to the 2017 Chinese lung cancer experts' consensus, patients with lung cancer after surgical resection were given postoperative radiotherapy. If the tumor remains after surgery due to inadequate resection of the tumor (positive resection margin), there will be a 50% chance of relapse within 1 year. Among patients with residual tumors after sublobar resection, radiotherapy is generally performed until the lung volume is less than 1/3 of the total lung capacity. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the influence of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) on patients with lung volume less than 1/3 of the total lung volume.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPostoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has been confirmed to be effective in reducing the recurrence rate of NSCLC after sublobar lung resection. In view of the small percentage of SCLC, few cases of the tumor residue after sublobar lung resection have been reported, especially postoperative radiotherapy, few cases of postoperative SBRT have been reported. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether SBRT can reduce the recurrence rate after sublobar radical resection for patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer. It is hypothesized that stereotactic body radiotherapy can significantly reduce the 2-year recurrence rate of small cell lung cancer tumor residual after partial lobectomy, thereby improving the survival rate of patients with tumor residual after partial lobectomy. To provide evidence for patients with small cell lung cancer tumor residual after partial lobectomy, this study will analyze the postoperative efficacy of small cell lung cancer patients with 3-year survival or less tumor residual after sublob"

A novel formulation hydrogel adhesive (KM40C) has been developed to improve the adhesion of an ultrasound adhesive with low adhesive power (KM40A). The objective of the study is to compare the skin adhesive properties of KM40C with KM40A. Hypothesis: Hydrogel adhesive KM40C has improved skin adhesive properties compared to hydrogel adhesive KM40A.

Specifically, resilience is conceptualized as a trait that is linked to multiple aspects of health, including physical and mental well-being. While there is no definitive way to measure the construct, a variety of tools have been developed to assess resilience. One widely used measure is the Brief Resiliency Scale, a self-report questionnaire that measures the tendency to bounce back from stressful events. Studies have found that higher resilience scores are associated with better physical and mental health outcomes. For instance, individuals with high resilience are more likely to maintain their physical health and report lower rates of depression and anxiety.

These details should be clarified in the study protocol. \n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground Psychiatric disorders account for half of the disability among active duty military personnel and are associated with reduced readiness, increased medical health care costs, and medical and operational performance decrements. Despite the high prevalence and tremendous impact of major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the military, interventions currently available to military service members are limited and face poor adherence. To address this treatment gap, our team has developed an integrative treatment platform, a mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication management app called Army Health for Soldiers. In a pilot study, we demonstrated that Soldiers in Army Health use it frequently, report symptom remission after using Army Health for a total of just eight weeks, and most would recommend that family members use the mobile app as well. These results highlight the potential of mobile behavioral interventions in the military setting. Despite these preliminary findings, a definitive trial to test the efficacy of the Army Health approach is necessary. Army Health's use of evidence-based CBT to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression, coupled with integrated primary care and prescription management and an innovative coaching platform, makes it well-positioned for further study. Hypothesized Study Hypothesis It is hypothesized that 1) adherence to Army Health is associated with treatment gains and 2) individual differences (moderators) impact a patient's response to Army Health. Primary Aim Identify the key psychological and behavioral factors leading to differential response to Army Health. 1) Moderators of Treatment Response (Hypothesis) a) Study aim: Evaluate how patient characteristics affect engagement with and outcomes of treatment in Army Health. There will be special attention placed on treatment adherence. b) Data Analysis Plan: A hierarchical approach",

Let's move on to the primary outcome measures for this study. \n\nAbstract:\nThe aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel 6\u2010week behavioral intervention for children aged 8\u201012 years with overweight or obesity, and to evaluate parent and child acceptability and feasibility of the intervention in families with 1 child or twins. METHODS: Parents' acceptability of the intervention was examined over the 6\u2010week period, and a single follow\u2010up assessment was conducted at 3 months to assess maintenance rates for the intervention, the impact of social support and physical activity from parents, and perceptions of intervention effects. Fifty\u2010six parents of children aged 8\u201012 years (20 male, 41% Hispanic) with overweight or obesity (BMI>85th percentile) or obesity (BMI>95th percentile) were involved in the study. Parents received 2 60 min phone sessions from a registered dietitian and were asked to follow a reduced energy balance meal plan. Children received two 30 min phone sessions from a pediatric exercise physiologist during which physical activity recommendations (>120 min/day) were provided. Parent\u2010reported acceptability was high (90% were \"Very Satisfied\" and \"Satisfied\") and children reported that they had \"Lots of fun\" on a total of 75.4% of days spent exercising. On average, children were physically active for 0.0 minutes/day prior to the intervention, and this increased to 77 minutes, 56 minutes, and 42 minutes/week, respectively, at 1, 2, and 3\u2010month follow\u2010up assessments. After 6 weeks and 3 months, 47% and 42%, respectively, of parents reported that they had been able to consistently implement the proposed diet changes.CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this pilot study demonstrate the feasibility of a family\u2010based intervention for overweight or obese children aged 8\u201012 years. Although further research is required to confirm the efficacy of the intervention, the results indicate that parental and child engagement with the intervention was high and that the program may be easily implemented in clinical settings",
            "You're welcome. Now, let's discuss the research design and methodology of the study.

            "Yes, there are a few more points worth mentioning. Firstly, the study arm design includes a placebo control group receiving placebo injections instead of Ziv-Aflibercept. This is to evaluate the effects of Cemiplimab alone and in combination with Ziv-Aflibercept. Secondly, the duration of the trial varies depending on the individual participant's response and tolerability of the treatment. If the participant has stable disease or better during the treatment period, the treatment will be continued for up to 24 months. In case of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, the treatment may be discontinued earlier. However, if the participant withdraws voluntarily or is excluded from the study, the study arm design includes a 2-week safety evaluation and an active surveillance period for up to 30 days after study drug discontinuation.

Preoperative depression score will be calculated by using the Patient Health Questionarie-2 (PHQ2) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) as well as by a pre-operative depression diagnosis in clinical practice. We will assess postoperative chronic pain and quality of life over a period of 9 months. Patients will also undergo blood testing for serum levels of serotonin and tryptophan.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to detect the impact of depression on the outcome, namely chronic pain, after cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gallstone. The first objective of this study is to assess the risk of chronic pain development according to the 3 preoperative PHQ2 and preoperative depression diagnosis during clinical evaluation after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gallstone. The second objective is to detect the impact of perioperative depression diagnosis on the quality of life and the long-term chronic pain development after uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is the most common form of diabetes and more common in people who are overweight or obese. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that BMI is a strong predictor of insulin resistance in non-obese individuals, and in such studies, weight reduction has improved glycemic control. There is evidence that in type 1 diabetes, obesity is associated with an increased incidence of diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and atherosclerosis. This study will attempt to determine if the reduction in insulin dosage as a result of weight reduction in overweight patients with type 1 diabetes will yield improved glycemic control and a reduction in inflammatory parameters. Patients with type 1 diabetes are screened as to eligibility and if so, have a weight history taken and anthropometric measurements done. Blood samples are sent for insulin dosage estimation and for testing for Incretin hormones (Glucagon-Like-Peptide 1, Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide and Amylin).

All women who are pregnant, lactating, or planning for pregnancy are excluded. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes or HbA1c >8 percent. Women of childbearing age are excluded because of the concerns involved in weight reduction and use of an insulin pump during pregnancy. If a woman is not pregnant at enrollment and has negative pregnancy tests, she is given oral contraceptive for contraception. A woman who discontinues the oral contraceptive can continue in the study as long as she has negative pregnancy tests.

Patients with biopsy proven primary colonic or rectal cancer with prior or concurrent chemotherapy treated by intraindividual bilateral (N = 69) or routine incisional biopsy (N = 170) were included. We compared disease\u2010free and overall survival (DFS, OS) in a non\u2010randomized trial. The primary endpoint of this study was DFS.RESULTS: Intragroup analysis of patients undergoing bilateral incisional biopsies (N = 29), those with positive lymph nodes (pN+) had shorter DFS and OS in comparison to patients with negative lymph nodes (pN0) (38 % vs. 72 %, p = .002; Kaplan\u2010Meier estimate [Log rank (LR)\u2010Test]). Contrary, patients undergoing bilateral intraindividual rectus sheath biopsies (N = 40) had no significant differences in DFS (29 % vs. 42 %, p = .163 [LR\u2010Test]). The intragroup analysis of patients undergoing bilateral incisional biopsy (N = 29) revealed no significant differences in DFS (29 % vs. 42 % [LR\u2010Test]). The overall survival showed an equivalent median survival in both groups of between 18 months and 5 years postoperatively.

This study aimed to determine whether PPI use is associated with increased CAP\u2010related and CDI\u2010related hospitalization in a population\u2010based setting. We extracted the data of PPI users from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2000\u20102014). The primary outcomes were first\u2010time CAP\u2010related and CDI\u2010related hospitalizations between 2000 and 2014. In total, there were 2,032,114 PPI users, with a mean age of 72.14 +/\u2010 14.99 y. Among all patients, the incidence densities were 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71\u20101.73) for CDI and 3.94 (95% CI: 3.93\u20103.96) for CAP. After adjusting for covariates, we found that the PPI group did not have a significant increased risk of hospitalization due to CAP and CDI (hazard ratio: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01\u20101.04 and hazard ratio: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97\u20101.00, respectively). Among users who switched PPI brands (101,061), the 2nd brands (lansoprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole) did not significantly change the risk of hospitalization due to CAP or CDI. In conclusion, PPI use was not significantly associated with increased risk of hospitalization due to CAP or CDI.

Infections, including respiratory tract infections (RTIs), are common complications following OHCA, and antibiotic administration within the first hour of survival has shown some benefit. However, the optimal timing of antibiotic treatment remains uncertain in this population. We aim to evaluate the effect of early antibiotic treatment within the first hour of survival versus late antibiotic treatment after admission on 30\u2010day mortality and infection rates. The study will be nested in a multicenter randomized controlled trial of OHCA patients with predicted outcome of survival within the first hour of survival (based on Glasgow Coma Scale score, pupillary responses and blood pressure >/= 90 mm Hg), and excluded patients with a clear cause of cardiac arrest such as asphyxia due to cardiac arrest or trauma are randomized to early antibiotic treatment within the first hour of survival or later antibiotic treatment after admission. Our primary outcome is 30\u2010day mortality and key secondary outcomes are infections rates. We aim to analyze 800 patients in each study arm. This study will provide important data on the timing of antibiotic treatment in OHCA patients with potential benefit due to reduced infections and improved survival in patients treated early.",

In addition, we hypothesize that narrative group counseling, one of the techniques used in stress management, will be effective in improving psychological resilience among health workers. METHODS: This study is a preliminary study of narrative group counseling for health workers who work night shifts. This will be conducted as a randomised controlled trial with 2 study arms. Participants recruited from among the nursing (n = 50) and healthcare personnel working in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, plastic surgery, cardiology, dermatology and hematology at a Turkish state hospital will be randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups at a ratio of 1: 1. Group 1: Experimental group (n = 25) Group 2: Control group (n = 25). Intragroup comparisons will be conducted using paired t-test, Mann Whitney U test and Pearson's chi-square test, and the independent t-test will be used for intergroup comparisons. RESULTS: The study will be completed in 2022. For those whose participation in the study has been accepted and are in the experimental group, 6 narrative group counseling sessions will be offered. Data on stress and psychological resilience will be collected before the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth and tenth group counseling sessions, immediately after the sixth group counseling session, immediately after the end of the study, 1 and 3 months after the completion of the study. DISCUSSION: While the prevalence of psychological distress in the general population varies between 7.4% and 12.7%, this rate is 30% among health workers. Narrative group counseling has been reported to be useful in reducing burnout, improving psychological resilience and improving sleep quality in people from different occupational groups.

Mostly it arises from lipid peroxidation and is considered as a marker of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate 1,4\u2010DOA levels in the urine of patients with recent and established Parkinson's disease (PD), in an attempt to test whether it could represent a suitable biomarker of the disease. Subjects enrolled were 30 PD patients, at disease stage III\u2010IV, 30 in the early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD III\u2010IV) and 30 healthy volunteers. We used high\u2010performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methodologies with fluorescence detection to measure the levels of 1,4\u2010DOA in their urines. Patients with established PD had significantly higher levels of 1,4\u2010DOA compared to controls. Significant differences were observed between early PD and those with established PD, suggesting that it could represent a useful marker of the progression of the disease. Furthermore, the levels of 1,4\u2010DOA correlated positively with the clinical picture of PD. These data were consistent with other studies that have previously shown an association between Parkinson's disease and lipid peroxidation. 1,4\u2010DOA could represent a new marker of oxidative stress and a possible predictor of disease progression. 1,4\u2010DOA may be used as a new molecular target for clinical applications.",

We propose to develop and test a blood-derived product made in our laboratory, from a safe subset of donated blood that cannot be transfused into patients (plasma exchange units). As such, our focus is on the use of a blood derived by-product (ex. stem cells) which cannot be used in patients due to incompatibility. In turn, this will enable a more cost-responsible strategy, as these cells can be isolated from discarded blood products, which would otherwise be destroyed. While other groups are working to find ways to isolate and manipulate stem cells from blood, our proposal is unique in that ours are not stem cells. Instead we propose to isolate and re-use the same specific white blood cells (which are found naturally in large numbers in normal plasma), and isolate these from donated plasma (which is typically discarded). In turn, this will enable a more cost-responsible strategy, as these cells can be isolated from discarded blood products, which would otherwise be destroyed. The investigators propose to test the ability to isolate, culture, and re-infuse these white blood cells, in order to generate additional white blood cells that can be given to sickle cell patients to help prevent and treat sickle cell crises (an unpredictable episode that causes sudden, intense pain). Furthermore, our studies could potentially create a safe source of these cells for use in sickle cell patients.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this proposal is to develop a novel clinical application of bioengineered blood derived products for patients with sickle cell disease.

We will examine the feasibility of isolating, culturing, and infusing these cells in humans.

For BDS group, this rate was 1.3% which was significantly lower than that for MTFS group. MTFS was associated with the following complications: pain, nausea and vomiting, fever, respiratory infections, bleeding, and emphysema. Among the patients using BDS, there was one minor local infection and one case of nausea and vomiting. Patients using BDS reported significantly higher pain scores at 12, 24, 48 and 96 h postoperatively. Patients using BDS had significantly reduced median length of hospital stay. MTFS and BDS were both effective for achieving hemostasis during endoscopic procedures, BDS may have more advantage in pain management after endoscopic suturing surgery because of its biodegradable and biocompatible properties."

Although ICI can have a good efficacy rate and long-term control rate for a small number of patients, however, due to immune-related adverse events (irAEs), its incidence rate is about 75%, and the risk of death from irAEs is about 1% , moreover, 30% of patients can not benefit from the treatment. These patients are still in urgent need of better methods to predict ICI therapy outcomes.

            "Abstract:\nIntroduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are used to treat several neoplasms including melanoma. Colitis is the most common immune\u2010related adverse event (irae) and is characterized by high incidence and morbidity rates. Endoscopic findings are non\u2010specific, often leading to unnecessary colonoscopies. There is a lack of validated biomarkers and the diagnosis is based mainly on histopathological specimens, often from non\u2010biopsy proven sites. Colon resection with surgical enterostomosis is the last treatment option in severe cases, however, it is associated with a reduction in quality of life and higher treatment costs. Aims & Methods: 50 patients with grade 2 irae to ICI were allocated in four groups. After a colonoscopy the tissue sample with the highest grade of inflammation was processed to histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC analysed four different markers: Lymphocyte antigen 96 (CD96) is part of the NK family of receptors; Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PDL\u20101) is a B7 family member and is used to predict anti\u2010PD1 response in non\u2010small cell lung cancer patients; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is an angiogenesis\u2010related tyrosine kinase and; 4\u20101BB, or CD137, is an activating costimulatory receptor of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) superfamily. Colonic biopsies from patients that have not received immunotherapy (controls) were used. Results: The expression of CD96 (MFI=67.4\u00b116.7) and PD\u2010L1 (MFI=93.1\u00b195.2) was higher in the ICI group (p < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the MFI of CD96 and PD\u2010L1 (Rho = 0.716, CI95% = 716.1\u2010761.9). On the contrary, the expression of CD\u2010137 was not significantly different between both groups (MFI=8.",

We report the comparative treatment response of ir\u2010c patients treated at our institute, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of ir\u2010c.. Methods/Principal Findings: We retrospectively analyzed clinicopathological data of 120 ir\u2010c patients undergoing treatment at our institute and divided them into four study arms based on their treatment regimen: I.

As a prospective, single arm phase II study, our aim was to evaluate effectiveness of ECP in Japanese patients with post\u2010polycythemia vera (PPV) myelofibrosis and to describe the toxicity and tolerability seen with this agent. Twenty patients with JAK2 V617F mutation positive PPV myelofibrosis were treated with ECP. Thirteen patients underwent cytoreduction with hydroxyurea, and others did best supportive care (BSC). The median follow\u2010up was 56 months. Of the 16 evaluable patients, the best response was PR in 14 (87.5%), with four (25.0%) of them having CR. The median duration of PR was not reached. The overall response rate was 93.8% (95% CI: 67.4%\u201099.3%). The median time to response was 3.1 months (range, 1.6\u20108.0). There was a trend toward response to ECP within the first year of treatment (p = 0.1). There was no significant difference between the hydroxyurea\u2010treated or BSC\u2010treated patients regarding all efficacy variables examined. The most common toxicities included nausea (32.1%), fatigue (32.1%), and vomiting (21.7%). There was one treatment\u2010related Grade 3 QTc prolongation and no Grade 4 adverse events. Conclusion: ECP shows a favorable safety and tolerability profile and an encouraging response rate in Japanese patients with PPV.

This will allow us to determine the unique effects of ECP treatment on the immune cells in the intestinal tract and compare the results with patients with ICI colitis. We can call this arm the \"Other Immune-mediated Diseases\" arm. \n\nStudy Design\n=================\nAll participants will receive ECP treatment for 12 weeks. At baseline, before treatment, and at follow-up, the patients undergo an intestinal biopsy to allow for analysis of immune cells in the intestinal tract. The study will include participants with ICI colitis who are receiving ECP treatment, a control group to compare results with, patients with ICI colitis who are not receiving ECP treatment, patients with ICI colitis who are receiving immunosuppressants or anti-inflammatory drugs, and patients with other immune-mediated diseases.\n\nOverview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nExtracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an established treatment for several autoimmune disorders. The mechanism of action is thought to involve the manipulation of the immune response through the elimination of activated T cells and the induction of regulatory T cells. Recent studies have suggested that ECP may be effective in treating immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced colitis (ICIcolitis). However, the specific mechanism of action of ECP on the immune cells in the intestinal tract of patients with ICIcolitis is largely unknown. Intestinal biopsies from patients with ICIcolitis undergoing ECP treatment may provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of action and potential biomarkers for monitoring treatment response. Therefore, this pilot study will analyze immune cells in the intestinal tract of patients with ICIcolitis undergoing ECP treatment to determine whether the treatment modifies the immune cell profile and assess the potential for biomarkers.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is a pilot study to evaluate whether ECP treatment modifies the immune cell profile in the intestinal tract of patients with ICI colitis. The study will enroll a total of 45 patients with ICI colitis, including 30 patients who are receiving ECP treatment and 15 patients who are not receiving ECP treatment. All patients",

The study will evaluate whether people who have recently experienced dizziness would prefer a game based on physical therapy principles for balancing over a classic computer game played in a similar way. Participants in this study will be recruited from the community by advertisements in senior centers and assisted living and long-term care facilities, and also from the clinics of the participating sites (University of Utah's Aging & Vision Lab and the Cleveland Clinic Dizziness and Balance Disorder Center). These participants will be 60 years of age or older. The subjects must be in good health as determined through a brief history, brief vision test, and brief screen for cognitive function. Participants who are found to have symptoms of balance and/or dizziness will be asked to return to that clinic to complete more extensive balance testing for 15 minutes. Participants will be informed that the purpose of the testing is to help determine whether this video game improves balance. We plan to test 124 participants. Those in Arm 1 will play a computer game based on the popular Nintendo Wii game, Boxing. This game will use a Wii-mote in a manner mimicking common boxing techniques. The game does not require physical activity and is designed to encourage players to stand still. Arm 2 will play a game designed as a more challenging version of Arm 1. However, it will require the player to stand up and balance, rather than to sit in a chair and play. It will also challenge the player physically with arm movements as well as simple punches with the hands. Arm 3 will play the game which is currently marketed for home use by Microsoft called Kinect Adventures. Kinect Adventures is a video game designed to be played without a controller, using the player's movements as a controller. Players use their whole body and arms. This game challenges both the eyes and body to a greater extent than Arm 1 does. The test will be done over the course of a day for approximately four hours.

The use of neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with locally advanced CRC. However, the timing of neoadjuvant therapy is still under debate. This study aims to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with locally advanced CRC based on the timing of the treatment. Methods: This was a single\u2010center retrospective study. We identified patients with locally advanced CRC who received neoadjuvant therapy between January 2013 and June 2018. The patients were divided into two groups based on the timing of neoadjuvant therapy: preoperative (group A) and postoperative (group B) treatment groups. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics, surgical outcomes, and survival outcomes between the two groups. Results: A total of 203 patients with locally advanced CRC were included in the study. The median age was 65 years (IQR 56\u201371 years), and the median tumor size was 45 mm (IQR 35\u201364 mm); 54.6% of patients received preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (group A) and 45.4% received postoperative neoadjuvant therapy (group B). There was no significant difference in the clinicopathological characteristics between the two groups. The rates of R0 resection, postoperative morbidity, and mortality were similar between the two groups. The 5\u2010year overall survival (OS) and disease\u2010free survival (DFS) rates were also comparable between the two groups (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.58\u20132.42, p=0.592 for OS; hazard ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 0.88\u20133.12, p=0.112 for DFS).

The trial was conducted over an 8\u2010week period, during which the treatment group used the SIBTime app while the two control groups received the app after 8 weeks of intervention. The primary outcome was sibling conflict, assessed using the CKAS (Conflict between Children and Adolescents Scale) and measured by questionnaires. Secondary outcomes included parents' perceived happiness, satisfaction, and stress, assessed using questionnaires and interviews. Results: The SIBTime app was effective in reducing sibling conflict and improving parents' perceived happiness, satisfaction, and stress.

In addition to traditional assessments of effectiveness and acceptability, we will also be using qualitative methods to capture parental perceptions of engagement with the app and the barriers and facilitators to use.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study uses a hybrid mixed methods approach in which parallel quantitative and qualitative arms will be used to examine the preliminary efficacy of a web application tool, SIBTime, with a treatment group of parent-child dyads. After reviewing the literature and reviewing existing assessment and treatment options, the SIBTime tool was specifically designed to target two common outcomes associated with having a child with a disability: decreased caregiver burden and increased caregiver resilience (both psychosocial). SIBTime is both mobile and web-based, and it leverages modern technology to provide caregivers with a tool that addresses the specific challenges they encounter in caring for a child with a disability and the resilience-related factors that could help them cope more effectively with their situation. SIBTime uses a three-pronged approach to provide caregivers with specific support and education in three distinct domains: coping skills education (i.e., behavioral strategies for managing challenging behaviors), self-care education (i.e., education about the mental health and wellness needs of caregivers), and peer support through a social networking platform that enables anonymous connection with other caregivers of children with disabilities. We also incorporate motivational interviewing (MI) principles within the app to engage users and foster sustainable behavior change. MI principles serve as a foundation for the app and provide an evidence-based approach to guide interactions between the app and its users.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Long-term Impact of SIBTime\u2122 Version 2.0 on the Well-being of Australian Caregivers: The SIBTime Study\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCaregiver, Disabilities, Behavior Problems, Burnout\n\nInter",

And we would be happy to provide any additional assistance if needed. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground and Aims: Infections caused by fungal pathogens are often difficult to treat with limited therapeutic options. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of FV471 for the treatment of patients with fungal pulmonary, pulmonary aspergillosis (IFA), mucormycosis (MO), fusariosis (FUS), and deep, persistent, or recurrent endemic mycoses. Methods: In a Phase 3 trial, 234 patients with fungal pulmonary mycoses treated with FV471 (184 patients) or placebo (50 patients) were followed up for at least 12 weeks or until death or end of treatment. The primary study objective was to evaluate the clinical success, which included a composite endpoint of death from any cause or discharge with any improvement in respiratory symptoms (improvement in dyspnea, infiltrates, fever and/or weight loss). Clinical success with FV471 was 76% with a hazard ratio of 2.45 (p<0.0001) compared to placebo. Clinical failure with FV471 was 24% with a hazard ratio of 0.36 (p=0.003). Safety was assessed by collecting patient data for 72 weeks or until death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that FV471 has a significantly lower incidence of all\u2010cause mortality and clinical failure compared to placebo and is safe in the treatment of patients with pulmonary fungus infections.

METHODS: Two hundred and seventy ambulatory, community\u2010dwelling older adults (mean age: 76.9 years, 60.7% women) with at least 2 functional limitations were recruited and randomly allocated to exercise and education (treatment, n = 105), self\u2010paced walking (control, n = 105) or their usual care activities (usual care, n = 67). The exercise and education groups participated in standardized, individually tailored, home\u2010based exercises and education activities for 6 months. We used intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis. Functional performance (Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale score), functional capacity (self\u2010paced walking) were assessed every 3 months for 1 year, perceived exertion was assessed every 3 months for 6 months and functional health status (SF\u201036/Short Form\u201036) was assessed at baseline and after 6 months. The change in these outcomes were compared between groups using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. RESULTS: A significant main effect over time was observed for the total FIM score, 6\u2010minute walking distance, and perceived exertion. There were also significant interaction effects on the total FIM score and perceived exertion. Significant treatment differences over time were observed, with the exercise and education group having a greater increase in the total FIM score and lower perceived exertion score than the usual\u2010care group at 6 months. There were no significant treatment differences in self\u2010paced walking distance over time. There was no significant main effect over time on functional health status.

IMRT technology has become the mainstay of radiotherapy for breast cancer, but for patients with hypersensitivity, IMRT radiotherapy can cause significant skin and chest wall toxicity. The ETHOS system is an advanced IMRT device that enables ultrathin multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) and superior dose conformity, thus reducing toxicity. However, ultrathin MLCs can produce artifacts during the planning process, limiting their clinical application. To address these challenges, the study team proposed to use ultrathin MLCs with adaptive radiotherapy (ART) techniques to further improve the effectiveness and safety of IMRT treatment.The primary aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of ART with ultrathin MLCs in reducing the incidence of dermatitis and other side effects. In addition, the researchers aim to evaluate the feasibility of ART with ultrathin MLCs, as well as the impact on the clinical outcomes of patients treated with this technique.Who can participate?Patients with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing IMRT radiotherapy with good treatment compliance, who meet the following conditions will be included in the study: (1) women aged 18-75, (2) ECOG score <= 2, (3) no history of radiotherapy",

In the United States alone, coronary artery disease (CAD) afflicts over 9.5 million people. CABG, or coronary artery bypass grafting, is the most commonly performed heart surgery in the United States. Yet, post-CABG rehabilitation is significantly underutilized. Patients who undergo CABG are at high risk of developing heart failure and post-operative depression and are subject to chronic pain. These factors have been associated with poor functional status, quality of life, and outcomes. Several studies have shown that pre-operative exercise can improve both function and outcomes in cardiac patients undergoing CABG. Unfortunately, many cardiac patients do not receive pre-operative physical therapy. In addition, 1 out of 5 patients are readmitted within 30 days and most patients do not initiate a post-operative rehabilitation program after hospital discharge. The investigators have recently been funded by the NHLBI (R03HL105604) to conduct a clinical trial studying the effects of physical therapy, nutritional counseling, and heart health education (Phase 1) as adjunctive therapy prior to CABG (n=20) and comparing the results of this program to an optimized post-CABG therapy program (Phase 2). The current study (Phase 3) proposes to build on the results of Phase 1 and phase 2, and test the feasibility a clinical trial to evaluate the impact of a comprehensive, multimodal rehabilitation program with the goal of implementing the study intervention in a large, multi-center clinical trial to test its efficacy.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Randomized Control Trial of Physical Performance (EXER) and Exercise Tolerance (EXTE) Comparing Pre and Post"

This group will be the experimental group for the HDM adaptation.",
            "In both the adaptive and the maladaptive placebo comparator arms, participants will receive placebo and be exposed to House Dust Mites (HDM) in the aeroallergen challenge chamber. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Dupilumab versus placebo in individuals with adaptive and maladaptive phenotypes, respectively. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Allergic diseases have reached epidemic levels worldwide, with a significant impact on health and quality of life. Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the shared receptor subunit of interleukin (IL)\u20104 and IL\u201013, which are key cytokines involved in the inflammatory response associated with allergies. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of dupilumab in allergic disease in humans, using asthma as a model system.METHODS: A randomized, controlled, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trial will be performed in healthy participants aged 18\u201065 years with a history of asthma, with specific sensitivity for house dust mites. On the basis of methacholine challenge and blood eosinophil counts, participants will be stratified to undergo aeroallergen challenge with increasing concentrations of house dust mites while receiving either dupilumab or placebo. The primary outcome will be the change in asthma symptoms during acute exposure to house dust mites.Secondary outcomes will include airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, and quality of life measures related to asthma. The study will enroll 64 subjects.RESULTS: The results of the study are expected to shed light on the role of dupilumab in allergic disease and its potential clinical utility in treating this condition. By understanding the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effect, the findings may lead to new therapies for allergies, which are currently a major public health concern.CONCLUSION: The planned study constitutes a phase I trial with a placebo control of a novel treatment for allergic disease. Its results may help further our understanding of allergies and potentially lead to safer and more effective treatments.\n\nBackground\nAsthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by inflammation of the airways and hyperactivity of smooth muscle cells.

Methods: The study was approved by the ethics committee and conducted by the Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University and randomized. Patients were randomly divided into three groups, the first group received concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the second was treated with chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy, and the third was treated with combination of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The evaluation indexes included tumor volume, tumor volume, tumor volume, PET\u2010CT evaluation, and long\u2010term survival. Results: Compared with the control group, the efficacy of the chemoradiotherapy control group was better than that of the other two groups in the treatment of patients with stage IV disease who underwent postoperative radiotherapy alone. The chemoradiotherapy control group had a significantly better long\u2010term survival rate than that of the other two groups. It is considered that the postoperative tumor volume has prognostic significance for the prognosis of patients with advanced lung cancer.

It is estimated that approximately 5 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year, making it the most common form of cancer in the country. While sun protection is crucial in preventing skin cancer, the efficacy of sunscreens in real-world conditions is often compromised by factors such as water immersion, sweating, and perspiration. Long-wear sunscreens containing metal oxide particles have been developed to address these challenges. Sunscreen -R43 is a newly developed long-wear sunscreen that contains titanium dioxide and zinc oxide as its active ingredients. This study aims to evaluate the water resistance of Suncreen -R43 by assessing its SPF values in static conditions and after 80 minutes of water immersion. This will be done using the erythema method. The study also aims to assess the influence of repeated application of Sunscreen -R43 on the incidence of skin cancer and the percentage of SBCs (Sunburn Cells) in the skin.

Patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures experience significant pain and functional limitations, in addition to increased mortality, morbidity, and associated fractures. NICE guidelines (2016) and NHS evidence (2019) recommend that kyphoplasty should be available to patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures without neurological compression and with the presence of severe acute pain. A literature review has shown that kyphoplasty is a safe and well-accepted therapy. However, in some cases, patients may require an alternative approach. The objective of this pilot study is to assess the effectiveness and outcomes of treatments with porous titanium microspheres compared with treatments of kyphoplasty using different types of material (alternative) from patients in emergency osteoporotic vertebrae fractures without neurological compression, presenting severe acute pain.

Study hypothesis 2. Study background2-1. The use of porous trabecular titanium microspheres for kyphoplasty treatment may potentially have advantages in terms of pain control, reduction of kyphotic deformity, and overall safety compared to standard polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) injection. The use of these microspheres may also have a role in the preservation of bone marrow and microvascular network integrity. Based on their porous structure, they allow for the re-establishment of bone volume and architecture, and may improve functional outcomes. Additionally, the mechanical strength of these microspheres is similar to that of PMMA, making it a viable alternative for kyphoplasty treatment. However, the efficacy and safety of this intervention needs to be evaluated in a clinical setting.This study aims to compare the clinical, radiological, and functional outcomes of using kyphoplasty with porous trabecular titanium microspheres vs. standard PMMA injection in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) due to osteoporosis. 3. Research design and hypothesis (aims)The aim of this study is to investigate the use of porous trabecular titanium microspheres in kyphoplasty treatment for osteoporotic VCFs by comparing the clinical, imaging, and functional outcomes between this intervention and the standard PMMA technique. This study hypothesizes that the use of porous trabecular titanium microspheres may improve clinical, radiological, and functional outcomes compared to PMMA injection alone. 4.

Objectives: We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a pain science education conference for students majoring in medicine and dentistry. Methods: This study was a one\u2010group pre\u2010post design with a delayed control group for students who did not participate in the conference; the latter did so only at the University of the Basque Country. All participants filled in the Spanish adaptation of the Understanding Pain Questionnaire (UPQ\u20102) before and after the conference. Paired t\u2010tests were used to assess the changes in the UPQ\u20102 score. The effects of the questionnaire were compared with those of self\u2010perceived pain knowledge using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis H test. Results: The participants' global pain knowledge increased significantly (UPQ\u20102 \u2265 45) after attending the conference. Furthermore, those who passed the pain science pre\u2010test (UPQ\u20102 \u2265 54) exhibited significant increases in global pain knowledge and pain science knowledge in the main pain areas (UPQ \u2265 54) after participating in the conference. Conclusions: This pain science education conference was effective for all students and promoted significant improvements in their pain science knowledge. Students who received better scores on the pre\u2010test required a better understanding of the different pain domains and areas.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe understanding of chronic pain is a priority research area globally; patients are commonly misinformed about the biological and psychosocial mechanisms underlying it . Patients\u2019 lack of understanding of pain is a significant barrier to pain management, which can contribute to fear, disability, and stigmatization . In fact, studies show that patients with pain and related conditions are poorly equipped to cope with changes in their pain status and often lack useful knowledge about pain . Patients might develop misconceptions about pain that may lead them to exaggerate the severity of their symptoms . In contrast, patients who are well versed in the concept of pain (e.g., its mechanism, causes, and treatment) are likely to be active in managing their pain and recovering to their previous level of function .\nDue to its interprofessional nature, chronic or recurrent pain affects various health professions, including medicine and dentistry. In Spain, the prevalence of chronic pain in dental clinics is",

The choice of these medications is based on data demonstrating that each acts on one of the three major systems that modulate blood pressure. The 3-Drug combination was chosen because of the availability and low cost of these medicines and because data from multiple large clinical trials have demonstrated the safety of these drugs.\n\nHydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic (lowers blood pressure in part by reducing the volume of blood in circulation.\n\nAmlodipine, a calcium-channel blocker, lowers blood pressure by slowing down the heart and dilating blood vessels.\n\nLozazepam, a vasodilator, lowers the blood pressure at the heart level by opening the arteries.\n\nPatients will perform 25 minutes of aerobic exercise (walking) and strength exercises (3 sets per muscle group). Strength training will focus on the major muscle groups (arms, legs and trunk). Each patient will progress through 30 different exercises that target all major muscle groups.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. Methods: A total of 30 patients with psoriasis vulgaris were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to two groups: the etanercept group and the placebo group. The etanercept group received etanercept 50 mg twice weekly for 12 weeks, while the placebo group received a placebo twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients achieving at least 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and the proportion of patients with a decrease of at least two points on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Results: After 12 weeks of treatment, the etanercept group had significantly greater improvements in the PASI (p<0.001) and DLQI (p<0.001) scores compared to the placebo group. The rates of adverse events were similar between the two groups. Conclusion: Etanercept is an effective and safe treatment option for psoriasis vulgaris.",

METHODS: Between January 2014 and December 2017, 308 elderly patients with malignant gastric tumor were admitted to our hospital and divided into a younger group (<70 years old) and an older group (\u226570 years old). The incidence of postoperative complications was analysed. The risk factors of postoperative complications and DGE in these patients were investigated. RESULTS: In total, 241 postoperative complications occurred in these patients. The incidence of postoperative complications and DGE in the younger group was 123/160 (76.9%) and 47/160 (29.4%), respectively. The corresponding incidence of patients aged \u226570 years was 86/148 (58.0%) and 31/148 (20.9%), respectively. The incidence of postoperative complications and DGE in the older group was lower than that in the younger group in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Multivariate Cox proportional regression hazards analysis showed that age and histology were independent risk factors for DGE and postoperative complications in elderly patients with malignant gastric tumor. Age is a predictive factor for DGE and postoperative complications in these patients. CONCLUSION: The incidence of postoperative complications",

The mean dose at the onset of symptoms was significantly lower in the former patients than in the latter ones (1.3 vs. 4.2 mg/day; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between these groups in the mean daily dose of dopamine agonist on the day the symptoms developed. All the former patients suffered from paresthesias. Myalgias tended to be accompanied by paresthesias in these patients. All the former patients reported that their symptoms developed soon after treatment with ropinirole and that there were no prodromal symptoms. There was no significant difference between these groups in motor scores. There was no significant difference between these groups in the age, sex or mean duration of Parkinson's disease. However, the prevalence of postural hypotension and orthostatic symptoms, and the dose of antihypertensive medication, were significantly lower in the former patients than in the latter ones. We conclude that our results indicate that the adverse effects induced by ropinirole may be related to the patients' age, treatment regimen and presence of postural hypotension and orthostatic symptoms. Therefore, elderly patients with postural hypotension should be carefully watched. In addition, we recommend that the dosage should be titrated as slowly as possible and that it should be stopped immediately if adverse effects develop.",

            "Very good. Now, please tell me the names of each of these drugs. \n\nAbstract:\nINTRODUCTION \u2010 A significant number of acute and chronic conditions are linked to high rates of myocardial injury and death in people with heart failure (HF). Thus, there is a need to find new therapeutic targets or interventions for the management of myocardial injury. Our group discovered that inhibition or genetic deletion of the glucose transporter GLUT1 (GLUT1) reduces myocardial ischemic and reperfusion injury in mice. Since that observation, GLUT1 has been shown to play a role in mediating stress\u2010induced hypertrophy and oxidative stress as well as renal function. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of the GLUT1 in the heart failure pathophysiology, and to test the therapeutic potential of the GLUT1 inhibitor, GLUT14, for the treatment of chronic HF. It is expected that treating HF patients with GLUT14 will lead to improvement in LV systolic function and LV diastolic function as well as reduced fibrosis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS \u2010 This is a double\u2010blinded, placebo\u2010controlled, multicenter parallel group phase II trial involving 15 European centers. About 90 adults with HF, NYHA class II\u2010III, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 45\u201055%, and who are on optimal HF therapy, will be randomized to 12 weeks of GLUT14 250 mg/day or matched placebo. The primary outcome is change in LVEF at 12 weeks, using CMR imaging. Echocardiography as secondary endpoint, and serum creatinine as explorative endpoint will also be assessed. A total of 80 patients (40 per arm) will be needed for 80% power to detect a 5% absolute difference in LVEF, and allow for a 20% drop\u2010out rate.

The exclusion criteria were: presence of any middle ear or inner ear disease, history of prior ear surgery, or a history of middle ear trauma of the affected ear. Interventions: 4 mg of intratympanic dexamethasone was injected into the middle ear through the tympanic membrane for four consecutive weeks. (Group 1: 1 mg/ml dexamethasone. Group 2: 2 mg/ml dexamethasone. Group 3: 1 mg/ml dexamethasone with gentamicin . Group 4: 3 ml/ml normal saline). The outcomes of this study were hearing recovery (15 dB or more), hearing improvement (>5 dB), and the difference of the thresholds between 2 years after the treatment and the initial threshold. The results of hearing recovery and improvement were analyzed using chi square or fisher exact probability tests, and the difference of the thresholds between 2 years after the treatment and the initial threshold was analyzed using the paired t\u2010test. For all tests, p values under 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Twenty eight patients were enrolled and randomly assigned into one of the four groups. 18 patients (64.3%) were in group 1, 4 patients (14.3%) were in group 2, 4 patients (14.3%) in group 3, and 2 patients (7.1%) in group 4.

Microscopic colitis (MC) can cause symptoms of chronic watery diarrhoea, however it has a similar presentation to other conditions and is therefore often overlooked. Accurately diagnosing MC is beneficial as it can be effectively treated with medications such as bismuth and budesonide. The aim of this study is to validate an existing clinical scoring system to predict the presence of chronic watery diarrhoea caused by MC. It is important to note that this diagnostic test can provide a quick and easy way to distinguish between MC and other conditions that cause watery stools.Who can participate?Adults (aged 18 and over) who are referred from the community with a diagnosis of chronic watery diarrhoea can participate in this study.What does the study involve?Each participant\u0092s clinical data will be collected. In addition, they will have blood tests (including F faecal Calprotectin [f-cal] level). If no bowel preparation has been received within the last eight weeks, they will then be asked to provide a stool sample. In these cases, they will also undergo a colonoscopy procedure and have small samples of inflamed tissue taken from their intestines. These samples will be tested for inflammation and disease activity using a laboratory technique known as histology.What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?There are no direct benefits to participants from taking part in this study. However, they will receive standard care by Gastroenterologists within the United healthcare system. There are no particular risk associated with taking part in this study.Where is the study run from?King\u0092s College Hospital and St Thomas\u0092 Hospital (UK)When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?September 2021 to December 2021Who is funding the study?There is no external",

Now let's talk about the study's target condition or disease. \nMinimally Invasive Hip Resurfacing\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients undergoing anterior primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and posterior primary THA when a novel minimally invasive (MIS) approach is used. The novel MIS approach is based on a less invasive approach to the gluteus maximum (GMax), a minimally invasive approach to approach to the hip capsule, and a modified surgical procedure to implant the hip components. The investigators believe that this combination of factors is important for good patient outcomes. The investigators propose to assess clinical and radiographic outcomes of this approach in patients undergoing THA for end-stage arthritis utilizing two groups. The study group will be comprised of 100 patients undergoing minimally invasive hip resurfacing (MIS-HR) with the ObsID-GMax system. A historical cohort of patients having a conventional posterior approach to primary THA at the same institution for end-stage hip arthritis will be used as direct comparators (Post Control, n=100). The investigators will compare patient outcomes at 1, 3 and12 postoperatively for the MIS Group versus the Post Control Group. The investigators hypothesize that minimally invasive hip resurfacing technique will result in comparable outcomes as posterior primary THA. The investigators also expect no difference in postoperative outcomes between the minimally invasive and posterior approach in this population.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe investigators propose to assess clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients undergoing THA for end-stage arthritis utilizing two groups.

Endothelial repairing peptides (ERPs) are components of the body\u2019s inflammatory reaction that have been shown to improve the clinical characteristics and outcomes of PDR patients by controlling the inflammatory response. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of tadalafil on the clinical characteristics, serum concentrations, and urinary excretion of svPSEL\u20105 in men with PDR and vasoreactive ED who receive intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment\n\nPatients and methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over intervention trial was conducted on 16 men with PDR, vasoreactive ED, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment with aflibercept. For each patient, tadalafil or a placebo were given for one month and then crossed over to the other for the following month. Serum and urine samples were collected before treatment and at the end of the study\n\nResults: There was no significant difference in the mean age of participants ("

The diagnostic yield of the current methods for identifying patients with PAH is limited, and new methods are needed to improve outcomes for patients. Preliminary studies have suggested that preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) techniques can be used to detect PAH in embryos, potentially allowing for the selection of embryos that are free from the disease. In this study, the investigators will develop and validate a PGD protocol for the detection of PAH in patients undergoing IVF treatment. The study will be conducted on patients with suspected PAH who have been referred for genetic testing. PGD will be performed to identify clinically significant genetic variants associated with PAH, and the results of the PGD assay will be compared to the current diagnostic methods. If the PGD assay is successful, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of PGD on pregnancy outcomes in patients with suspected PAH.\n-----------------\nTo develop and validate a PGD protocol for the detection of clinically significant genetic variants associated with PAH in patients undergoing IVF treatment.\n\nIntervention\n-----------------\nIn the laboratory phase, the investigators will develop and validate a PGD assay using a cohort of patients with suspected PAH. PGD will be performed using a targeted sequencing approach, which involves sequencing the DNA of selected genes known to be associated with PAH. The investigators will also conduct a retrospective analysis of previous genetic testing data from patients with suspected PAH to identify clinically significant genetic variants that were not detected using the current diagnostic methods. In the clinical phase, the investigators will enroll patients with suspected PAH",

Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nAbstract:\nBackground \u2010--- Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis, and current treatment strategies are still largely incapable of slowing disease progression. PDAC harbors frequent alterations in the oncoprotein KRAS. The activation of K\u2010Ras by mutation or altered glycosylation has been demonstrated to promote cancer progression. Targeting KRAS\u2010related signaling through downstream effectors, such as RAF, may halt disease progression. Purpose \u2010--- RAF kinase inhibitors have been studied in clinical trials for PDAC but have not improved outcome. MEOS is an investigational agent that inhibits the activation of RAF by down\u2010regulating Ras palmitoylation. Phase 2 studies examining MEOS in combination with chemotherapy have been reported. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of MEOS in monotherapy in PDAC. Patients and Methods \u2010--- Patient accrual has been completed for this ongoing phase 2 clinical trial. Enrollment criteria include a confirmed diagnosis of Stage III or IV PDAC by histology or cytology, measurable or evaluable disease, age \u2265 18, ECOG performance status \u2264 2, and no prior chemotherapy\u2010containing systemic therapy. MEOS is administered as a one\u2010hour intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8, repeated every 28 days. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST as evaluated by an independent review committee. Secondary endpoints include progression\u2010free survival (PFS) and safety. Results \u2010--- As of July 15, 2016, 65 patients have been treated and evaluated for response. The median age was 66, median ECOG performance status was 1, and 33% were female. KRAS mutation status was available for 46% of patients, and wild\u2010type disease was found in 31%. Treatment\u2010related toxicities have been mostly low grade as expected. Among those patients evaluable for response by RECIST (N = 52), 6% achieved a partial response, but 38% had",

This is important because the lack of cardiac tissue is a key determining factor for future heart failure and cardiac transplant. We also investigate the relationship between the change in cardiac function and the patient's state of health (New York Heart Association) and cardiac remodelling.\n\nDetailed Description\n=================\nPatients who had an elective heart MRI to observe cardiac function were surveyed. In addition, various examinations such as blood examination, urine examination, chest x-rays and electrocardiograms were performed for each patient. The change in cardiac function was evaluated by comparing the data (short axis view) measured in the patients with that of healthy people with age- and gender-adjusted normal values. The study is approved by the ethics committee of our institute (IRB approval number: E1903) and the Clinical Studies Center of our facilities.\n\nOfficial Title\n=================\nObservational Study of the Effect of Short Sequence Heart MRI on Evaluation of Cardiac Function\n\nConditions\n=================\nCardiomyopathy\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n=================\n* Diagnostic Test: MRI and MRS\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients with cardiomyopathy who have undergone elective heart MR imaging, including cardiac function, are between the ages of 20 and 85; Patients with no other coexisting medical conditions are considered stable and have not had any abnormal clinical laboratory findings for the past 3 months; Patients who have not received or are not receiving medication within the past month and are not likely to receive it during the one-year follow-up period; Patients with left ventricular thrombus and the presence of other acute or chronic cardiac diseases and/or significant non-cardiac diseases are not included.

The end point of this study will be the incidence of CYP19 inhibitor-resistant cells in tumor-related tissue.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind study comparing the efficacy of Tibolone 2.5 mg and 1000 \u00b5g of tibolone in the inhibition of CYP19 in breast cancer patients under Tamoxifen treatment. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tibolone in the inhibition of CYP19 in human ER-positive breast cancer patients and evaluate the time course of the CYP19 inhibitory effect. This trial consists of two different arms. Arm A will receive tibolone 2.5 mg and arm B will receive tibolone 1000 \u00b5g. All patients will also receive tibolone for two weeks prior to surgery, as well as during an additional four weeks after surgery to monitor the CYP19 status of their tumors. The primary endpoint will be evaluated at least 10 days after stopping tibolone treatment, which will then be compared to the time-course of CYP19 inhibition. The primary endpoint is the percentage of CYP19-negative tumors in patients receiving tibolone. Secondary endpoints are: The difference in time needed for a decrease in the number of CYP19-positive tumors and the time needed for the number of CYP19-negative tumors to reach 80%. Changes in hormone receptor status and AUC/AUCB values before and after tibolone treatment. Safety and tolerability of tibolone, with special emphasis on tamoxifen. Pharmacokinetics of tibolone.",
