In this arm, participants will receive PB-718 injections at a dose of 0.01 to 100 mg/ml. They will receive the injections every day for 5 days. The intervention for this arm will be the administration of PB-718. This arm is necessary to assess the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of PB-718 at varying doses and to understand its potential benefits and risks in Chinese obese subjects.",

Each session will consist of a brief check-in, presentation of state-of-the-science information on graft versus host disease and survivorship, and discussion of self-management and coping strategies to deal with stress, pain, and fatigue. Participants will also receive an intervention manual with information about graft versus host disease and relaxation exercises. The intervention sessions will be conducted over video conference to minimize in-person contact during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "Based on the design of the Horizons Group intervention, it would be beneficial to have a control group that receives standard of care. This arm can be labeled as the \"Control Group\". Participants in this arm will receive standard care for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic graft-versus-host disease. The control group will not receive any additional intervention or treatment.",
            "Based on the goals of your trial, you may want to consider a control arm where participants receive standard care without the intervention. This would allow you to compare outcomes between the experimental arm and the control arm. Alternatively, you may want to explore a combination arm where participants receive both the experimental intervention and standard care. This would provide additional benefits to participants while still allowing you to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.",

Patients must have at least five progressing or new metastatic lesions that are amenable to locally-ablative therapies. Patients must be on, and candidates to continue, current systemic treatment (chemotherapy, biologic, and targeted therapy). The study will consist of a single arm with patients receiving treatment with locally-ablative therapies (e.g., cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation). The choice of the local ablative treatment will remain at the discretion of the study investigator based on tumor location and disease characteristics. For cryoablation/radiofrequency ablation, pre- and post-treatment imaging assessment will consist of standard cross-sectional imaging using multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 30 days prior to the first ablative therapy treatment and at the next standard of care CT/MRI as part of a routine assessment or within 3-6 months of the final treatment. An optional endoscopic follow-up (if clinically indicated) will be performed at the discretion of the treating physician. The duration of the treatment will be considered not to exceed 14 months. If the progression of the disease occurs before completion of the treatment, the therapy will be stopped.\n\nReasoning:\nThis study arm follows the reasoning that locally ablative treatments, such as cancer Cryoablation or cryosurgery, can help shrink the lesions or slow down tumor progression in oligoprogressive patients.

The intervention/treatment for this arm would be Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or interventional radiology (IR) ablation therapy using the Ablative local therapy device. This arm will help assess the efficacy of locally ablative therapies in combination with systemic therapy for oligo-progressive solid tumors.",

            "Certainly! In the active comparator arm, the two interventions are DC cardioversion (DCCV) and pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). DC Cardioversion involves the use of a direct current shock (DCCV) to restore sinus rhythm by reversing persistent AF. Pulmonary vein isolation focuses on electrically isolating the left atrial (LA) electrical drivers from the pulmonary veins in order to maintain sinus rhythm. The implantable loop recorder will be inserted in the pre-pectoral area, and two femoral sheaths will be inserted at the groin area. Do you have any specific requests or suggestions for this arm?",
            "Of course. In the sham comparator arm, patients will only undergo DC cardioversion. The two femoral sheaths will also be inserted at the groin area in all patients on the day of randomization, similar to the active comparator arm.

Is there anything you'd like to add or modify for this arm?",
            "Absolutely. The DC cardioversion in this arm is similar to the active comparator arm. It will be performed if the patient is still in AF at the end of the procedure. In the sham group, the femoral venous sheaths will be used under local anesthetic for pacing of the pHem nerve. This sham procedure, which involves the use of a quadripolar cathater, mimics the catheter ablation procedure in the active comparator arm.

Two femoral sheaths will also be inserted at the groin area in all patients on the day of the procedure prior to randomization. Is there anything you'd like to add or modify for this arm?",
            "Absolutely. For the pulmonary vein isolation, a catheter ablation technique will be used to create electrical isolation around the pulmonary veins, preventing pulmonary vein ectopy from triggering atrial fibrillation. This is a crucial step in comparing the efficacy of ablation versus cardioversion in reducing AF recurrence. As for the DC cardioversion, it will be performed if the patient is still in AF at the end of the pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The implantable loop recorder, known as the Reveal device, will be inserted in the pre-pectoral position under the skin with local anesthetic and sedation at least a week before randomization. It will provide continuous recording of the heart rhythm and rate, which can be downloaded via a home monitoring system to establish the primary endpoint of the study. Lastly, two femoral sheaths (7Fr) will be inserted using ultrasound guidance under local anesthetic. These sheaths will serve as the access route for cardiac catheter insertion during the procedure. Do you have any questions or suggestions regarding these interventions?",
            "Certainly. In the sham comparator arm, patients will undergo DC cardioversion (DCCV) along with a sham procedure. Similar to the active comparator arm, an implantable loop recorder will be inserted in the pre-pectoral area with local anesthetic at least one week before randomization. Two femoral sheaths will also be inserted at the groin area in all patients on the day of the procedure prior to randomization.

Is there anything you'd like to modify or add for this arm?",
            "Absolutely. As in the active comparator arm, DC cardioversion will be performed to treat irregular heart rhythms, specifically atrial fibrillation. The implantable loop recorder, the Reveal device, will be inserted in the pre-pectoral position under the skin with local anesthetic and sedation at least a week before randomization. It will provide continuous recording of the heart rhythm and rate for data collection. Two femoral sheaths (7Fr) will also be inserted using ultrasound guidance under local anesthetic. In addition, a sham procedure will be performed after randomization, along with intermittent phrenic nerve pacing.

Based on the information you've given me so far, I suggest the following study arms:\n\n1. Experimental: VR-TrAC\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the VR-TrAC group will follow the Virtual Reality Training for Aggression.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The VR-TRAC group will undergo a 16-session training program focused on aggression control using virtual reality technology. The training is based on the Virtual Reality Aggression Prevention Training (VRAPT) protocol developed by Klein Tuente et al. The sessions are structured to target different stages of information processing related to aggressive behavior, including early and late stages. Participants will practice handling aggressive-inducing situations in virtual reality scenarios.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is essential to assess the effectiveness of the VR-TRAC intervention in reducing aggression among the prison-based population. The structured training program using virtual reality technology allows for a controlled and immersive environment to practice aggression control strategies. By comparing the outcomes of this group with the control group, researchers can evaluate the impact of VR-TRAC on aggression regulation.\n\n2. Other: Care as Usual\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the Care as Usual group will receive standard care provided in the prison setting.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Care as Usual (CAU) in prison consists of treatments aimed at stabilizing psychological states, such as pharmacological treatment, supportive contact, or transfer to a Penitentiary Psychiatric Centre for necessary interventions.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as the control group for comparison with the VR-TRAC intervention group. By including a group that receives standard care practices in the prison environment, researchers can evaluate the additional benefits of the VR-TRAC program in reducing aggression beyond what is typically provided. This arm helps assess the incremental value of the VR-TRAC intervention in improving aggression control outcomes compared to standard care practices.",

Participant Group/Arm: Time-restricted eating\n   Intervention/Treatment: All participants will follow the time-restricted eating protocol while fasting. The first 5-6 weeks of intervention training will follow a ramp-up protocol, with a gradual increase in fasting periods. All subjects will fast for a minimum of 16 hours per day for the duration of the intervention. Participants will have one group class or lunch meeting per week and will be instructed to follow a self-directed food plan consistent with time-restricted eating that includes a gradual increase of 20% for all meal quantities. Participants will be allowed to consume only calorie free beverages (such as tea, black coffee, water, sugar-free gum), at will.\n\n2. Participant Group/Arm: Successful aging comparison group - LEARN\n   Intervention/Treatment: Participants will receive 1 hour of education on topics relevant to healthy aging. Lectures will occur during group classes, lunch meetings, and/or via Zoom. Topics will include healthy aging, stress reduction, sleep, healthy eating, exercise, mind-body exercise (i.e. tai chi, yoga), healthy communication, and social relations. Participants will have one group class or lunch meeting per week."

Is there anything else you would like to discuss regarding the study arm design?",
            "Certainly! Based on the information provided, it seems that your target population should be overweight older adults (age > 65 years) who are at high risk of cognitive decline due to self-reported cognitive difficulties. You can consider including participants who have normal age-, gender-, and education-adjusted performance on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-M) and respond positively to questions related to memory, word finding difficulties, or planning/organization difficulties on the Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire. Additionally, participants should provide informed consent and be willing to be randomized to either intervention group. As for exclusion criteria, you may want to exclude individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cholelithiasis, liver or renal disease, cancer, or progressive degenerative neurologic disease. It's also important to exclude those with significant cognitive impairment, severe rheumatologic or orthopedic diseases, or severe psychiatric disorders. These are just some suggestions to consider for your inclusion and exclusion criteria.",

Experimental: Group 2: Picture-based prevention education only (no educational course)\n- Participant Group/Arm: This group will only receive picture-based prevention education without participating in an educational course.\n- Intervention/Treatment: The participants will have access to visual aids for understanding and preventing hand eczema but will not receive the additional training provided in the educational course.\n- Reasoning: This study arm is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of picture-based prevention education alone in preventing hand eczema. By isolating this intervention, researchers can determine its impact on the outcomes compared to the group that receives both visual education and a course. This arm helps to assess the specific contribution of visual aids in preventing hand eczema among hospital cleaners.\n\n3. Placebo Comparator: Group 3: Placebo (control)\n- Participant Group/Arm: This group will serve as the control group and will not receive any picture-based prevention education or educational course.\n- Intervention/Treatment: The participants in this group will not have access to the interventions provided to the experimental groups.\n- Reasoning: This study arm is essential to establish a baseline for comparison with the experimental groups. By having a control group that does not receive any intervention, researchers can determine the true impact of the picture-based prevention education and educational course on preventing hand eczema. This arm helps to control for any external factors that may influence the outcomes and allows for a more accurate assessment of the interventions' effectiveness.",

Sham Comparator: Attention control\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will receive attention control in the form of static stretching.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Participants in this arm will undergo static stretching of eight major muscle groups.\n   - Reasoning: The attention control arm is necessary to compare the effects of aerobic exercise with a non-aerobic intervention. By including this arm, researchers can determine if any observed effects are specific to aerobic exercise or simply the result of increased physical activity.\n\n2. Experimental: 75 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 75 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is designed to test the effects of a low dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity in colon cancer survivors. By including different doses of exercise, researchers can determine the optimal amount needed to achieve the desired outcomes.\n\n3. Experimental: 150 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 150 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm aims to evaluate the effects of a moderate dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity. By comparing this arm to the 75 min/wk arm, researchers can assess the impact of increasing the exercise duration on the outcomes of interest.\n\n4. Experimental: 225 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 225 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is designed to test the effects of a high dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity. By including a higher dose arm, researchers can assess whether increasing the duration of exercise further improves outcomes compared to the lower dose arms.\n\n5. Experimental: 300 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 300 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is included to evaluate the effects of a very high dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity. By comparing this arm to the other dose arms, researchers can determine if there is a ceiling effect or if higher doses of exercise continue to provide additional benefits.",

This will be combined with daily endocrine therapy for 36 months. For postmenopausal women, the endocrine therapy options are Letrozole 2.5 mg orally once daily continuously, Anastrozole 1 mg orally once daily continuously, or Exemestane 25 mg once daily continuously. For pre/perimenopausal women and men, the endocrine therapy options are the same as for postmenopausal women, but in combination with Goserelin or Leuprolide administered subcutaneously. What are your thoughts on this specific participant group/arm and intervention/treatment?",
            "I'm glad you find the suggestion suitable. This arm will provide valuable data on the safety and efficacy of the combination treatment. Is there anything else you would like to discuss or any other study arms you want to design?",
            "Definitely! Considering the effectiveness of Ribociclib with endocrine therapy, you might want to explore a comparative arm where participants receive only endocrine therapy without Ribociclib. This would allow you to evaluate the added benefit of Ribociclib in terms of invasive breast cancer-free survival. Additionally, you could consider a control arm where participants receive a placebo instead of Ribociclib. This would help determine the specific contribution of Ribociclib to the treatment outcomes. How do these suggestions sound to you?",
            "Excellent! Including these arms will enhance the robustness of your study. To summarize, here are the full study arms for your clinical trial:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. Experimental: Ribociclib + endocrine therapy\nParticipants will receive Ribociclib 400 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle, in combination with daily endocrine therapy for 36 months. The endocrine therapy options are based on the participant's menopausal status, and for pre/perimenopausal women, it will be combined with Goserelin or Leuprolide administered subcutaneously.\n\n2. Comparative: Endocrine therapy only\nParticipants will receive only endocrine therapy without Ribociclib. The endocrine therapy options will be the same as in the experimental arm.\n\n3. Control: Placebo\nParticipants will receive a placebo instead of Ribociclib, in addition to the same endocrine therapy options as in the experimental arm.\n\nThese study arms will allow you to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Ribociclib in comparison to endocrine therapy alone and placebo.

            "Do you have any specific phase for this trial?",
            "Excellent. Now, let's discuss the design details of the trial. Can you provide me with the criteria for inclusion and exclusion?",
            "Thank you for providing the comprehensive criteria. Now, let's move on to the design of the study arms. We will start with the experimental arm. Please provide the participant group/arm and the intervention/treatment for this arm.",
            "Thank you for that information. How will the participants be allocated in this trial?",
            "Thank you for that information. Based on the details you've provided, I recommend designing a study arm called \"Experimental Arm - Adaptive abdominal radiotherapy.\" This arm will include patients who will be treated with a customized dose regimen using adaptive radiotherapy. The intervention/treatment for this arm will be \"Dose Regimen: Adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy.\" This treatment involves a customized dose regimen and adaptive radiation therapy delivered using stereotactic body radiation, which can help personalize treatment for individual patients. This arm is essential for evaluating the efficacy and safety of adaptive radiation therapy in patients with abdominal metastases from malignant neoplasms.",
            "Certainly! In the experimental arm, participants will receive adaptive SBRT for abdominopelvic metastases using the CyberKnife system. The treatment will involve performing 3-dimensional image-guided CBRT on day one, followed by a conventional dose prescription. On the next day, the patients will receive a 100% boost dose to the PTV followed by 5 fractions of 10 Gy to the PTV. The number of treatment fractions can be adjusted based on the size and location of the target metastases. The CyberKnife system is a highly precise radiation therapy device that can accurately beam radiation to the tumor, while minimizing radiation exposure to nearby healthy tissue. This adaptive approach allows for continuous monitoring and adjustment of the treatment plan throughout the course of radiation therapy, ensuring the most accurate and effective dose delivery.",
            "I completely agree with you. The experimental design allows for the evaluation of the adaptive radiation strategy and dose escalation in a controlled and systematic manner. By assessing treatment success at different dose levels, we can identify the acceptable doses for further clinical evaluation. Additionally, the low-dose level will serve as a reference point, helping us evaluate the incremental effect of increasing the dose. This design will provide valuable information on the feasibility and potential benefits of adaptive SBRT.",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, shall we finalize the study arm design?",
            "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your clinical trial!"

            "Thank you for providing the criteria. Now, let's move on to the design details. What will be the primary purpose of this trial?",
            "Understood. And what is the intervention model for this trial? Is it a single group assignment or a randomized controlled trial?",
            "Thank you for that information. Now, let's discuss the study arms. Based on the details you've provided so far, I recommend an experimental arm. In this arm, participants will receive adaptive stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) for abdominopelvic metastases. The simulation and treatment will be performed over 3-4 weeks per dose escalation. What do you think about this design?",
            "Certainly. Adaptive SBRT is a precise radiation technique that allows for the safe delivery of ablative radiation doses. It utilizes diagnostic quality onboard imaging incorporated within radiation treatment machines. This technology enables the generation and delivery of radiation plans specific to the patient's anatomy at the time of treatment. The goal of this study is to utilize adaptive radiation therapy to deliver ablative radiation with low toxicity rates in a patient population with technically challenging disease.",
            "Absolutely! Maximizing target coverage while maintaining a grade 3+ toxicity rate no greater than 10% is one of the key objectives of this trial. The inclusion of patients with technically challenging disease will allow us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adaptive SBRT in this specific population. This arm will provide crucial information for future treatment strategies.",
            "I'm glad you see the value in this design. Now that we have discussed and finalized the experimental arm, let's summarize the study arms:\n\nStudy Arms:\n- Participant Group/Arm: Experimental: Adaptive Stereotactic Body Radiation\n- Intervention/Treatment: Radiation: Adaptive Stereotactic Body Radiation\n- Description: Simulation and treatment to be performed over 3-4 weeks per dose escalation. Radiation therapy is given following generation of planning imaging at the time of simulation. This arm aims to utilize adaptive radiation therapy technology to deliver ablative radiation with low toxicity rates.",
