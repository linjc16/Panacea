The participant should have audiogram results consistent with a diagnosis of profound or severe sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). As per the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), this could be classified as auditory neuropathy/dysplasia (ANSD) or conductive hearing loss (CHL).",

The participant should meet any of the following criteria:\n   - Has a CI in each ear, a contralateral CI in both ears, or an active CI in at least one ear. This criterion is reasonable as we want to focus on participants who have not undergone cochlear implantation, as this procedure could alter the outcome of the study.\n   - Is under treatment for conductive hearing loss using a bone anchored hearing device or tympanostomy tube. Excluding participants with conductive hearing loss ensures that the study population consists of individuals with congenital sensorineural hearing loss specific to the genetic mutations under study.\n   - Is unwilling, unable, or unlikely to comply with follow-up visits. This criterion is important for maintaining the integrity of the study. We need participants who can adhere to the follow-up visits to obtain accurate data over time.\n   - Is enrolled in another interventional study that would confound the results of this study. To prevent interference from other studies, we need to exclude participants who are enrolled in interventional studies.",

Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\" This criterion ensures that patients with unresolved toxicities from prior treatments are excluded from the trial to prevent exacerbation of side effects and ensure patient safety. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our primary concern. Now, the next criterion is: \"Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients who may be at higher risk of severe immune-related adverse events with the investigational therapy based on their prior treatment history. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Minimizing the risk of severe adverse events is of utmost importance. Let's move on to the next criterion: \"Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\" This criterion is important to exclude patients with active or recent history of other malignancies that may confound the assessment of the efficacy of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I agree. Maintaining the focus on the specific types of cancer under study is crucial for meaningful evaluation. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients with brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease, as these patients may require specific treatment approaches and have different prognosis compared to patients without central nervous system involvement. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Excluding patients with central nervous system involvement helps maintain the homogeneity of the patient population and facilitates accurate evaluation of the investigational therapy. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\" This criterion is important to ensure patient safety and avoid potential severe allergic reactions to the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our top priority. Now, we have reached the final criterion: \"Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\" This criterion is essential to protect the safety of pregnant women and unborn children, as well as to prevent potential exposure of infants to the investigational therapy through breastfeeding. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Protecting the safety of vulnerable populations is paramount. Based on our discussion, here are the full criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nKey Inclusion Criteria:\n- Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumor.\n- Having received and failed or was intolerant to standard of care for advanced disease or not eligible for standard of care therapy.\n- Measurable disease.\n- ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n- Adequate organ function.\n- Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n- Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\n- Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\n- Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\n- Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\n- Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\n- History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n- Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

Cohort 1 includes patients planning therapy with cytotoxic therapy, with or without an androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitor (ARPI). Cohort 2 includes patients planning therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), with or without an ARPI, and not planning cytotoxic therapy. Patients in both cohorts may also enroll if they meet certain timeframes related to starting therapy. Any questions so far?",
            "Exactly! Now, it's important that patients have adequate blood counts. Specifically, leukocytes (WBC) should be \u2265 2,500/mcL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be \u2265 1,500/mcL, and platelets (PLT) should be \u2265 80,000/mcL. Patients must also be able to lie flat and still for approximately 15-20 minutes and tolerate FDG-PET/CT radiographical imaging and radiation treatment planning and delivery. These are necessary for the procedures involved in the trial. Are you following along?",

However, patients will be ineligible if another known malignancy makes it difficult to interpret if FDG-avid lesions represent prostate cancer or if it's expected to interfere with standard therapy for prostate cancer for 2 years from study enrollment. Additionally, patients must have a life expectancy of at least 6 months and the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent document. Any questions about these criteria?",

Patients with prostate cancer that is castration resistant, defined as two consecutive rising PSA values despite testosterone level < 50 ng/dL, will be excluded. Patients who started androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) more than 26 weeks prior to enrollment will also be excluded. Any questions about these exclusions?",
            "Exactly! We also have additional exclusion criteria. Patients who started intensification of therapy beyond ADT (e.g., AR pathway inhibitor, cytotoxic therapy) more than 26 weeks prior to registration will be excluded. Subjects with a known allergy to contrast material and/or contraindication to FDG-PET will also be excluded.

            "Excellent. Now, let's discuss the third inclusion criterion. It is \"Obese and overweight subjects as defined by a body mass index (BMI) of 27 \u2264 BMI \u2264 45 kg/m2\" at screening and randomization. This criterion is important because the trial specifically targets obese individuals, which aligns with the goal of investigating the safety of the intervention. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you think so. Moving on to the fourth inclusion criterion it states, \"Use of effective contraception during the study period.\" This criterion is to prevent pregnancy during the study period as the safety of the drug in pregnant individuals may not be known. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "I completely agree. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is \"Pregnant, planning pregnancy in the next 3 years, or lactating.\" This criterion is important to protect the health of both the mother and the fetus or infant, as the effects of the drug on pregnancy and lactation may not be known. What do you think?",
            "Precisely. Now, let's discuss the second exclusion criterion. It is \"On an active form of weight loss therapy at home within the past 12 months.\" This criterion helps to ensure that participants are not currently actively pursuing weight loss with other methods, which could interfere with the study drug's effectiveness. What do you think?",
            "Correct. Lastly, we have the third exclusion criterion, which is \"History of certain cardiovascular conditions within 12 months prior to screening.\" This criterion helps to identify participants who may have underlying cardiovascular conditions that could affect the outcomes of the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I agree. Lastly, the fourth exclusion criterion is \"Currently participating in an investigational drug, investigational medical device, or investigational surgical device study.\" This criterion ensures that participants are not concurrently participating in other trials that could affect the outcomes of this trial. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, for the fifth exclusion criterion, we have \"History of any disorder or condition which might increase the risk of cardiovascular events.\" Participants with certain medical conditions may be at higher risk for cardiovascular events, and excluding them can help ensure the safety of participants in the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Lastly, let's discuss the sixth exclusion criterion, which is \"Any other serious clinical condition and/or abnormal laboratory results.\" Participants with other serious health conditions may be at a higher risk for adverse events and may not be suitable for the trial. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Lastly, the seventh exclusion criterion is \"History or risk of suicide.\" Participants with a history or risk of suicide may have underlying mental health issues that could impact their safety during the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "That's correct. Now, for the eighth exclusion criterion, we have \"Inadequate contraception.\" Participants who are not using effective contraception may be at risk for pregnancy during the trial and could confound the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Based on our conversation, here are the full criteria for the trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Patient age \u226518 years at screening.\n2.

Pregnancy can affect oxygenation and airway management, and including pregnant patients in the study could introduce additional variables that may confound the results. What are your thoughts on these exclusions?",
            "Absolutely. We should also exclude patients with cognitive impairment that makes consent to the study impossible. Informed consent is a critical component of clinical research, and including patients who are unable to provide consent due to cognitive impairment would violate ethical guidelines. Excluding these patients helps protect their rights and ensures that only individuals who can fully understand the risks and benefits of participating in the study are included. Additionally, we should exclude patients with known but untreated heart disease, such as persistent foramen ovale (PFO) or recent congestive heart failure, as it could complicate comparability within the groups. Patients with untreated heart disease may have underlying conditions that could impact their oxygenation and airway management, potentially confounding the results of the study. Excluding these patients will allow us to more accurately assess the impact of nasal continuous positive airway pressure on oxygenation in high-risk patients without the influence of untreated heart disease. What do you think about these additional exclusions?",

This criterion will help identify participants with abnormal urodynamic findings, which is a key characteristic of bladder pain syndrome. Including women with abnormal urodynamic results will provide valuable insights into the impact of nerve stimulation therapy on voiding patterns and symptoms in this population. Does that work for you?",

This is important to avoid confounding factors that could impact the study outcomes. Excluding participants with other conditions that mimic bladder pain syndrome symptoms will help ensure that the study results reflect specifically the effects of treatment on bladder pain syndrome. What do you think?",

            "I'm glad you agree. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Female patients of childbearing potential should use highly effective birth control methods. This is necessary to prevent potential risks to the fetus and ensure safety during the study period. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The last criterion for inclusion is that participants must be willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study. Informed consent is a fundamental ethical requirement in clinical research to ensure that participants are fully aware of the study procedures, risks, and benefits. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Wonderful! We have successfully designed the inclusion criteria. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Are you ready to proceed?",
            "Great. The first exclusion criterion is that patients who have participated in another clinical trial with any investigational agents within 30 days prior to study entry or 5 half lives of the study drug should be excluded. This is to prevent potential confounding effects of previous investigational treatments on the study outcomes. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The next criterion is the presence of medical or psychological conditions that would prevent the participant from understanding or signing the informed consent. We need to exclude patients who may not be able to fully comprehend the study procedures or provide informed consent. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you understand the importance of this criterion. The next exclusion criterion is a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Fibroblast Activating Protein Inhibitor or other agents used in the study. This is to prevent potential allergic reactions or adverse events in patients with known sensitivities. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The next criterion is the inability to remain still for the entire duration of the exam. Patient cooperation and the ability to remain still are essential for the success of imaging procedures. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. The next criterion is life expectancy. Patients with a life expectancy of less than 6 months should be excluded. This is because patients with a short life expectancy may not benefit significantly from the diagnostic test, and their inclusion may introduce bias in the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The next exclusion criterion is the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Patients with an ECOG performance status greater than 2 should be excluded. Patients with poor performance status may not tolerate the diagnostic test well and may provide unreliable results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you understand the rationale behind this criterion. The next exclusion criteria are compromised renal function and altered hepatic function. Patients with impaired organ function may be at increased risk of complications from the diagnostic test. What are your thoughts on these criteria?",
            "Absolutely. The next exclusion criterion is pregnancy and lactation. Pregnant or lactating women should be excluded to protect the fetus or infant from potential harm. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. The last exclusion criterion is the exclusion of subjects who are deprived of their freedom by administrative or legal decision or who are under guardianship. This is to ensure that participants are able to provide voluntary informed consent. What do you think about this criterion?",

This is necessary because the study aims to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention specifically for patients with serious mental illness. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely right! Moving on to the next criterion, we have the severity of illness. Patients should have a minimum 28-day treatment goal (based on clinical estimation), which means that their psychiatric symptoms warrant hospitalization. This criterion ensures that we include patients who require intensive treatment and support. What are your thoughts on this?",

Now, let's continue with the second exclusion criterion. We should exclude participants with physical diseases that prevent them from speaking, moving, or understanding the study procedures. Participants need to have the necessary physical capabilities to engage in the intervention and study requirements effectively. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! By excluding participants with substance-related disorders, we can ensure that the intervention's impact on SMI-related behavioral issues is accurately evaluated. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion. We need to exclude participants who are receiving current psychiatric hospitalization for aggressive behavior. This ensures their safety and avoids potential confounding factors that may affect the study outcomes. What do you think?",

Now, let's discuss the next criterion, which focuses on stable hepatic and renal function. This criterion helps minimize the risk of adverse effects from the drug. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Stable hepatic and renal function is a critical factor to consider for participant safety. Now, let's move on to the next criterion, which is the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) requirement. This criterion ensures that participants have adequate cardiac function to safely receive the drug. Any suggestions or concerns regarding this criterion?",
            "I agree with you. A minimum LVEF of \u226540% is necessary to minimize the risk of cardiac complications. Now, let's discuss the next criterion, which is about concomitant treatment within standards of care guidelines for DMD. Any suggestions or concerns here?",
            "That's a good approach. Following the standards of care guidelines for DMD ensures that participants receive appropriate concomitant treatment. Now, let's move on to the next criterion, which is about non-invasive mechanical ventilation. It states that non-invasive mechanical ventilation is permissive if used for less than 16 hours per day. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I agree with your assessment. Allowing non-invasive mechanical ventilation for less than 16 hours per day strikes a balance between participant comfort and safety. Now, let's discuss the next criterion, which is about being affiliated with a French social security. Do you have any suggestions or concerns regarding this criterion?",
            "You're correct. This criterion is essential for complying with the specific regulations and logistics of the study location. Now, let's move on to the last criterion for Phase 1, which is obtaining the informed consent form signed by the patient or legal guardian(s). Any suggestions or concerns here?",
            "I completely agree with you. Obtaining informed consent is a fundamental requirement in any clinical trial. We have now completed the inclusion criteria for Phase 1. Shall we move on to discussing the inclusion criteria for Phase 2a?",
            "Great! Before we continue, I'll summarize the inclusion criteria for Phase 1 that we've discussed so far:\n1. Boys of \u22656 years of age and \u226514 kg body weight.\n2. Ambulatory or non-ambulatory status.\n3. Patients willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.\n4.

The first inclusion criterion is \"History of SCAD as confirmed by coronary angiography or cardiac computed tomography angiography for SCAD patients.\" This criterion is necessary to ensure that the participants in the study actually have the condition being studied. It is important to have a clear diagnosis of SCAD in order to accurately compare sympathetic function and arterial health between SCAD patients and control participants.

            "Alright. Could you also tell me the study type and phase of the trial?",
            "Thank you for providing that information. Now, let's start with the inclusion criteria. Based on the details you've given me, here's what I suggest for the inclusion criteria: Firstly, the participants should be male or female who are 18 years old or above at the time of inclusion. This is to ensure that they are legally able to provide informed consent. What do you think?",
            "Great! Now, moving on to the second inclusion criterion. Since the trial is focused on pulmonary health parameters and cardiac output monitoring, it would be appropriate to include patients currently admitted in the ICU who are indicated for cardiac output monitoring using a pulmonary artery catheter. Additionally, they should require pressure or volume controlled mechanical ventilation using an ETT. This will ensure that the participants have the specific medical conditions and treatment requirements necessary for the study. What do you think?",
            "Perfect. Now, for the third inclusion criterion, it's important to obtain signed and dated informed consent from the participants. This ensures that they fully understand the study procedures, risks, and benefits before agreeing to participate. Can we include \"provision of signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) by the patient or a trusted person\" as the third inclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the information provided, we can establish the first exclusion criterion as \"male or female under the age of 18 years old at the time of screening.\" This is to protect minors who may not fully understand the risks and benefits of participating in the study. What are your thoughts?",
            "Alright. For the second exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients who are under guardianship. Since patients under guardianship may not be able to provide informed consent for themselves, it's important to ensure that all participants are able to make their own decisions about participation. Can we include \"patient under guardianship\" as the second exclusion criterion?",
            "Good. Now, for the third exclusion criterion, it is suggested to exclude patients who require tidal volumes of less than 250cc. This is to ensure that the participants have similar baseline characteristics and are receiving standard mechanical ventilation settings. Patients requiring very low tidal volumes may have different physiological responses that could confound the study results. Shall we include \"patient who requires tidal volumes of less than 250cc\" as the third exclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on, for the fourth exclusion criterion, it would be appropriate to exclude pregnant patients. Pregnancy can affect pulmonary health parameters and introduce confounding variables, so excluding pregnant patients helps to ensure that the study results are not influenced by this factor. Can we include \"pregnancy\" as the fourth exclusion criterion?",
            "Very well. Now, for the fifth exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients whose care requires the use of an anesthetic conserving device. The use of such devices may impact pulmonary health parameters and could interfere with the study results. Shall we include \"patient whose care requires the use of an anesthetic conserving device\" as the fifth exclusion criterion?",
            "Perfect. Let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion. It is suggested to exclude patients whose care requires a closed-loop ventilator. Closed-loop ventilators may have different settings and mechanisms compared to standard mechanical ventilation, potentially affecting the study outcomes. Shall we include \"patient whose care requires a closed-loop ventilator\" as the sixth exclusion criterion?",
            "Great. Now, for the seventh exclusion criterion, it is important to exclude patients who are unable to tolerate a transient increase in inhaled CO2. Some patients may have underlying conditions that make them more sensitive to changes in CO2 levels, so excluding them ensures their safety. Can we include \"patient who is unable to tolerate a transient increase in inhaled CO2\" as the seventh exclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent. Finally, for the eighth exclusion criterion, it is advisable to exclude patients who are unable to tolerate a transient inhalation of N2O or are contraindicated to N2O use. This exclusion helps to ensure the safety of participants by excluding those who may have adverse reactions to N2O. Can we include \"patient who is unable to tolerate a transient inhalation of N2O or is contraindicated to N2O use\" as the eighth exclusion criterion?",

            "Thank you for providing those details. Now, let's start with the inclusion criteria. Based on the information you've given me, I suggest the following inclusion criteria: \n1. Age \u2265 18: This criterion ensures that the study participants are adults who can provide consent and are likely to have a similar response to the treatment. What do you think?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Considering the mechanism of action of heparin in preventing the development of acute lung injury, I suggest including patients with a PEEPI above 15 cm H2O. Increased positive end-expiratory pressure indicates more severe airway obstruction, which is associated with a higher risk of acute lung injury. What are your thoughts?",
            "Great! Now, let's consider the third criterion. I suggest, \"Female of childbearing potential must be using adequate birth control.\" This is important to prevent potential risks to pregnant patients and protect the safety of fetuses.",
            "Perfect. Now let's consider the time frame. I suggest a criterion of \"Between 30 minutes and 16 hours of initial smoke exposure.\" This ensures that patients are included in the study at an early enough stage to potentially benefit from the intervention before the onset of acute lung injury.",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, let's discuss the fifth criterion. How about \"Age > 16 years\"? This criterion ensures that the study population is adults who can provide informed consent and are likely to experience the effects of the intervention in terms of acute lung injury prevention. It also ensures consistency in reporting outcomes.",
            "You're absolutely right. Lastly, for the inclusion criteria, we have \"Oxygen saturation greater than 90% before intubation\". Patients with a high oxygen saturation are more likely to tolerate intubation and anesthesia, minimizing the risk of acute lung injury during the procedure. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The last inclusion criterion is \"Post-smoke inhalation, pulmonary function is more than 70% of predicted FEV1 and FVC.\" This criterion ensures that patients have relatively preserved lung function, allowing them to safely undergo bronchoscopy and receive the study treatment. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the information you've provided, I can suggest the first criterion: \"Previous pulmonary disease predisposing to hypoxia on minimal ventilatory support\". This criterion ensures that we exclude patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions that may confound the results of the study. What do you think?",
            "Great. The next criterion is \"Sputum production greater than 5 mL.\" Increased sputum production can be a sign of airway inflammation and lung damage, which are important in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury.",
            "Excellent. Now that we have designed all the inclusion criteria, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. We'll start with the first criterion: \"Admission for treatment of acute lung injury.\" Patients with acute lung injury may have their respiratory status compromised, which could confound the results of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The next criterion is \"Evidence of pneumonia at presentation (defined as any evidence of pneumonia on CXR).\" Excluding patients with pneumonia helps to prevent the overlap of symptoms and complications between different respiratory conditions.",
            "Great. Moving on, we have \"History of previous cardiac arrest.\" Patients with previous cardiac arrest may have underlying cardiac issues that could complicate the assessment of acute lung injury and the response to the intervention. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Moving on, we have \"Anticipated difficult venous access or inability to complete lung ultrasound studies.\" We want to ensure that patients can safely undergo study procedures and have adequate monitoring and assessment throughout the trial.",
            "Absolutely. Moving on, we have \"Coagulation disorders and/or ongoing use of anti-coagulants or anti-platelet drugs.\" Patients with coagulation disorders or ongoing use of anti-coagulants or anti-platelet drugs may be at risk of bleeding complications with the administration of heparin.",
            "That's correct. The next exclusion criterion is \"Active use of anticoagulant therapy or heparin-induced coagulopathy\". Active anticoagulant therapy or heparin-induced coagulopathy can alter hemostasis and increase the risk of bleeding complications with heparin therapy.",
            "Excellent! The final exclusion criterion is \"Lung protective ventilation strategy for > 24 hours\". Patients who have been on lung protective ventilation for more than 24 hours may have developed complications that could affect the outcomes of the study.",

            "Perfect. Now let's start designing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We'll begin with the inclusion criteria. Based on the information you've provided, I can suggest the first criterion: \"Adult patients indicated for elective intubation.\" This is important because patients who require intubation are likely to have more severe smoke inhalation injury and are at a higher risk for developing acute lung injury. What do you think?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's move on to the second criterion. How about \"History of being trapped in a house or industrial fire\"? This ensures that patients have a clear history of smoke inhalation injury, which is the target population for the study.",
            "Precisely. The next criterion is \"Production of carbonaceous sputum.\" Carbonaceous sputum is a common finding in patients with smoke inhalation injury and indicates exposure to toxic substances. This criterion helps to identify patients with significant inhalational trauma. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Great. Moving on, we have \"Perioral facial burns affecting nose, lips, mouth, or throat.\" Perioral facial burns are indicative of exposure to smoke and hot gases, increasing the likelihood of inhalational injury. This criterion helps to identify patients with a higher risk of acute lung injury. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's discuss the next criterion. How about \"Altered level of consciousness at any time after the incident and including confusion\"? Altered mental status is a sign of systemic toxicity and can indicate severe smoke inhalation injury.",
            "That's correct. Moving on, we have \"Symptoms of respiratory distress including a sense of suffocation, choking, breathlessness, and wheezing or discomfort affecting the eyes or throat, including irritation of the mucosal membranes.\" Respiratory distress is a common symptom of smoke inhalation injury and is associated with acute lung injury. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The next criterion is \"Signs of respiratory distress including stertorous or labored breathing, and tachypnea or auscultatory abnormalities, including crepitations or rhonchi.\" These signs are indicative of airway compromise and lung injury, which are important factors in the development of acute lung injury.",
            "Exactly. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. How about \"Hoarseness or loss of voice\"? Hoarseness or loss of voice can indicate injury to the upper airway, which is a common finding in patients with smoke inhalation injury.",
            "Great. Now, let's discuss the last inclusion criterion. How about \"Evidence of bronchial burn by bronchoscopy to assess the severity of inhalational trauma\"? Bronchoscopy is a direct method of assessing the extent of airway injury in patients with smoke inhalation injury.",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. We'll start with the first one. How about \"Burn injury > 24 hours\"? Patients with burn injuries that are more than 24 hours old may have already developed complications that could confound the results of the study.",
            "Precisely. The next exclusion criterion is \"History of pulmonary diseases.\" Pre-existing pulmonary diseases may influence the development of acute lung injury and could affect the response to the intervention. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "That's correct. Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion. How about \"Pregnancy or breastfeeding\"? Pregnancy and breastfeeding can introduce additional risks for both the mother and the fetus/infant.",
            "Exactly. The next exclusion criterion is \"History of allergy to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).\" Allergic reactions to heparin or a history of HIT can lead to serious complications in patients receiving heparin therapy.",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's discuss the fifth exclusion criterion. How about \"History or laboratory evidence of coagulopathy\"? Coagulopathy can increase the risk of bleeding complications with heparin therapy.",
            "That's correct. Lastly, we have the sixth exclusion criterion. How about \"Burns area > 50% of total body surface area\"? Patients with extensive burns may have systemic complications that could overshadow the effects of the intervention on acute lung injury.",
            "Absolutely. Based on our discussion, here are the full criteria for your clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Adult patients indicated for elective intubation.\n2.

            "Thank you for providing all the necessary information. Now, let's start designing the criteria for your clinical trial. We'll begin with the inclusion criteria.",
            "Alright. The first inclusion criterion is patients with a history of Idiopathic Recurrent Pericarditis (IRP) resistant to colchicine. This is necessary because we want to target patients who have not responded to the standard treatment with colchicine, in order to assess the efficacy of adding hydroxychloroquine to the treatment regimen. Does that make sense?",
            "I agree. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Participants should have a diagnosis of idiopathic recurrent pericarditis, which should be confirmed by pericardiocentesis upon the initial presentation of active pericarditis. This ensures that the participants have the specific condition being studied and have undergone a necessary diagnostic procedure. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Now, let's discuss the third inclusion criterion. We need to include patients who have not obtained adequate control of their pericarditis with corticosteroid-based therapy. This criterion ensures that the participants have refractory or resistant pericarditis, making them suitable candidates for the study. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. We should exclude patients with a history or suspicion of viral or bacterial pericarditis. This helps ensure that the study results are not confounded by other underlying causes of pericarditis, which could affect the outcomes of the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Moving on, the next inclusion criterion states that patients with recurrent pericarditis should have glucocorticoid dependence, with clinical and/or ECG signs, and an increase in pericardial effusion during the therapeutic discontinuation of glucocorticoids. This ensures that the participants require additional treatment options beyond glucocorticoids, making them suitable candidates for testing new medications like hydroxychloroquine. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's discuss the last inclusion criterion. We need to ensure that participants are competent and willing to give informed consent for participation in the study.

Now, let's discuss the exclusion criteria. Should we exclude patients who cannot obtain an MRI or FDG PET scan with contrast?",
            "Exactly. These imaging techniques are crucial for measuring glycolysis in brain tumors, and excluding patients who cannot undergo these scans will ensure that we gather the necessary data for the study. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion. Should we exclude patients with ferromagnetic implanted devices that might produce a safety hazard?",

            "Excellent! Including first-time stroke patients will indeed provide us with valuable insights. Now, let's move on to the third criterion: hemiparesis. This ensures that participants have the specific motor deficits associated with stroke, which is crucial for studying the relationship between proprioception, reaction time, and gait and balance parameters. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Perfect! I'll include hemiparesis as the third criterion. Now, let's discuss the fourth criterion: time from stroke to 3 months. Limiting the time frame to 3 months helps to capture the acute phase of stroke recovery when proprioception deficits may have a significant impact on gait and balance. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Exactly! Including the time frame of 3 months will provide us with valuable insights into the immediate effects of proprioception deficits. Now, let's move on to the fifth criterion: age 30-75. Restricting the age range helps to control for age-related factors that may influence proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance parameters. What do you think about this age range?",
            "Perfect! We're making great progress. Now, let's discuss the sixth criterion: grade 3-5 in the Functional Ambulation Category. This criterion ensures that participants have a certain level of functional mobility, which is necessary for assessing gait and balance parameters. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Including participants with a specific grade in the Functional Ambulation Category will help us ensure that the study focuses on individuals with a certain level of functional mobility. Now, let's move on to the seventh and final criterion for inclusion: walking without orthopedic support. This criterion ensures that participants have the ability to walk independently, which is important for evaluating the impact of proprioception on gait and balance. What is your opinion on this criterion?",
            "Great! Including participants who can walk without orthopedic support will help us accurately evaluate the impact of proprioception on gait and balance. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Are you ready to discuss the exclusion criteria?",
            "Fantastic! Let's begin with the first exclusion criterion: lack of informed and voluntary consent of the patient. Excluding participants who do not provide informed consent maintains ethical standards and ensures that all participants are fully aware of the study and its implications. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Prioritizing informed consent is crucial for maintaining ethical standards. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion: second or subsequent stroke. Excluding participants with multiple strokes helps to control for potential confounding variables that may arise from recurrent strokes. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! By excluding participants with multiple strokes, we can focus on the effects of proprioception deficits in individuals experiencing their first stroke. Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion: stroke of the brainstem and cerebellum. Excluding participants with strokes in specific brain regions helps to focus on the impact of proprioception deficits on gait and balance parameters in stroke patients. What is your opinion on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. By excluding participants with strokes in the brainstem and cerebellum, we can isolate the effects of proprioception deficits on gait and balance in other brain regions. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion: epilepsy. Excluding participants with epilepsy helps to control for potential confounding factors that may affect proprioception, reaction time, and gait and balance parameters. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Excluding participants with epilepsy will help us control for potential confounding factors and isolate the effects of proprioception on gait and balance. Now, let's discuss the fifth exclusion criterion: disorders of higher mental functions. Excluding participants with cognitive impairments helps to ensure that participants can accurately complete assessments related to proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Precisely! By excluding participants with cognitive impairments, we can ensure that the study's assessments related to proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance are completed accurately. Now, let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion: coexisting neurological, rheumatological, orthopedic diseases. Excluding participants with other conditions helps to isolate the effects of stroke and proprioception deficits on gait and balance. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! By excluding participants with other conditions, we can isolate the effects of stroke and proprioception deficits on gait and balance more accurately. Finally, let's discuss the seventh and final exclusion criterion: use of orthopedic supplies during locomotion. Excluding participants who use orthopedic supplies during walking helps to ensure that the study focuses on the impact of proprioception on gait and balance without the confounding effects of external support devices. What do you think about this criterion?",

The first criterion is the presence of chronic or prolonged diseases that may affect immunogenicity. This is to ensure that the immune system of the participants is not compromised. Another criterion is the use of any investigational drug or vaccine within a certain timeframe before enrollment. This is to avoid potential confounding effects on the immune response to the rotavirus vaccine being studied. The third criterion is the evidence of rotavirus infection in the last 14 days. This ensures that the participants are not currently affected by rotavirus, which could affect the safety and immunogenicity assessments. The fourth criterion is the history of intussusception. This is to exclude participants with a medical condition that could be exacerbated by the rotavirus vaccine or its components. The fifth criterion is the history of allergy caused by egg-derived vaccine, lactose intolerance, galactosemia, malabsorption disorders, or any history of serious allergic reactions. This is to exclude participants with allergies or medical conditions that could lead to adverse reactions to the vaccine or its components. The sixth criterion is the concomitant administration of immunomodulators or immunosuppressive drugs. This is to exclude participants whose immune system is altered, which could affect the interpretation of the study results.

            "Thank you for providing that information. Now, let's focus on designing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We'll start with the inclusion criteria. The first criterion is that the patient should be 18 years or older. Can you confirm if that's correct?",
            "The first inclusion criterion is age of \u2265 18 years. This is necessary to ensure that participants are adults who can provide informed consent for participation in the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great. Moving on to the next criterion. Male or female patients with an age of 18 years or older, admitted in the intensive care unit. By including patients of both sexes and a minimum age of 18, the trial aims to evaluate the use of the device in a broader population. Shall we include this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Let's proceed to the third criterion. It mentions that informed consent should be obtained before any study-related procedure is performed. This includes any interventions, biological investigations, and the insertion of the CytoSorb device. This criterion ensures that participants have given their consent before any study-related procedures are carried out. Should we include this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Moving on to the fourth criterion. It states that participants must have a serum total bilirubin > 26.5\u03bcmole/L (> 4.5mg/dL) on admission, based on Child - Pitt score. This helps to distinguish between acute and chronic liver failure in patients with ACLF. Do you think it's a necessary criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on to the fifth criterion. It mentions that patients who have received treatment with cYsorb during their hospital admission prior to acute decompensation event are eligible. This helps to ensure consistency in treatment administration across study participants. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. We're almost there. The sixth criterion specifies that participants must have a prothrombin time greater than 5 seconds longer than the upper limit of the respective institution. This indicates significant liver dysfunction and a high risk of bleeding complications, which could be impacted by the CytoSorb device. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Lastly, let's discuss the seventh criterion. It states that participants should be at risk for bleeding or have a known bleeding disorder. Coagulopathy is a common complication in patients with ACLF, and assessing bleeding risk or the presence of bleeding disorders is important for participant safety during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Now, let's move on to the eighth criterion. It specifies that participants must have a diagnosis of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is a structural alteration of the liver that is often present in patients with ACLF and is important for defining the clinical syndrome of ACLF. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Wonderful. We're making great progress. The second exclusion criterion is patients who developed hepatic encephalopathy (\u2265 2) < 7 days before inclusion in the study. This ensures that participants have a recent development of hepatic encephalopathy, which may impact treatment response and confound study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. Let's proceed to the third exclusion criterion. It specifies that patients who are expected to undergo liver transplantation within the next 24 hours are excluded. Participants who are likely to receive a liver transplant within a short timeframe may have different treatment goals and outcomes, making them unsuitable for the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Moving on to the fourth criterion. It states that participants who are not expected to survive more than 2 days should be excluded. This criterion focuses on participants with a grave prognosis and ensures that the study intervention is targeted towards those who are most likely to benefit from treatment.

            "Alright. The first inclusion criterion is adult patients (\u2265 18 years) admitted to the University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA), Belgium. This criterion ensures that the study population consists of adults who are receiving care at a specific hospital, allowing for standardized treatment and monitoring. Do you agree with this criterion?",

Obtaining informed consent is crucial to ensure that participants understand the study procedures and risks involved. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Let's proceed to the third criterion. It specifies that participants must have acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) grade \u2265 2. This ensures that the study focuses on patients with significant liver dysfunction. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect. We're making progress. The fourth criterion states that participants must have experienced an acute decompensation event with an identifiable trigger. This helps to ensure that participants have a clear cause for their liver failure, allowing for more targeted treatment and analysis. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on to the fifth criterion. It states that participants must have hepatic encephalopathy grade \u2265 2. The presence of hepatic encephalopathy at a certain severity level ensures that participants have significant neurological symptoms related to their liver failure, which may impact treatment outcomes. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great. Let's move on to the sixth criterion. It specifies that participants must have acute kidney injury (AKI) according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria stage 3. AKI is a common complication of ACLF, and using standardized criteria helps to ensure consistency in diagnosing and monitoring kidney function in participants. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Now, let's discuss the seventh criterion. It states that participants must have a serum bilirubin level \u2265 10 mg/dl. Elevated bilirubin levels are a marker of liver dysfunction, and this criterion ensures that participants have significant liver impairment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. We're almost done with the inclusion criteria. The last criterion is that participants must have hemodynamic instability with vasopressor support. This means that participants requiring vasopressor support for hemodynamic instability have severe circulatory issues that may impact treatment response, making them appropriate for the study.

            "Great. We have successfully designed all the inclusion criteria for your clinical trial. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Shall we continue?",
            "Fantastic. The first exclusion criterion is known patient will against participation in the study or against the measures applied in the study. This criterion respects the autonomy of participants who do not wish to be involved in the study or receive specific interventions. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Moving on to the second exclusion criterion. It states that a decision made prior to inclusion to stop further treatment of the patient within the next 24 hours excludes them from the study. Participants who are not expected to continue treatment for at least 24 hours may not benefit from the study intervention, making them unsuitable for inclusion. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. Let's proceed to the third criterion. It states that participants with no complete remission of malignancy, including hepatocellular carcinoma, within the past 12 months, should be excluded. This criterion ensures that participants with active malignancies that may confound the study results or impact their overall prognosis are excluded. What do you think about this criterion?",

It's important to have clear criteria to ensure the study focuses on the target population and delivers the desired outcomes. We'll start with the inclusion criteria. Based on the information you provided, the first criterion could be \"Age 65 years and older.\" This is because older adults are more likely to need advance care planning and have the necessary cognitive ability to engage in the process. What do you think?",
            "For the first inclusion criterion, we can consider participants who live in METs program PSH or any similar supportive housing program. This criterion will ensure that our participants are from a supportive housing program, which is likely to include individuals with experience of homelessness or housing insecurity.

Additionally, participants with active autoimmune disorders may not be able to tolerate the investigational drug. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Precisely. Now, for the final inclusion criterion, we need to ensure that participants can understand, provide informed consent, and remain on study-sanctioned treatment and assessments throughout the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Now, let's move on to women of child-bearing potential and men. We need to address fertility and contraception requirements. How about including \"Must use effective birth control during the course of the study\"? This will prevent the risk of potential harm to a fetus if a participant becomes pregnant during the trial.",

            "Great. Based on the information provided, we can establish some initial exclusion criteria. One criterion could be \"Previous treatment with a STK11/LKB1 inhibitor\". Excluding participants who have previously received this type of inhibitor helps to evaluate the investigational drug in treatment-naive patients. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you understand the rationale behind it. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. How about excluding participants who have received prior immune checkpoint inhibition within 12 weeks prior to day 1? This ensures that participants have not recently been exposed to similar therapies that could confound the study results.",
            "Exactly. Moving on, we should consider excluding participants who require concurrent anticancer treatments. This ensures that participants will not be receiving conflicting or overlapping therapies that could interfere with the efficacy or safety of the investigational drug. Do you agree with this criterion?",

Participants with concurrent severe or uncontrolled cardiac disease, interstitial lung disease, unstable or uncontrolled endocrine system diseases, active infections requiring parenteral therapy, and uncontrolled hypertension, among others, are excluded. The goal is to minimize potential confounding factors that could affect safety and efficacy outcomes.",
            "Precisely. The final exclusion criterion is participation in another anticancer or unrelated clinical investigation within the past 28 days or a longer period if deemed necessary by the site investigator. Participants with recent exposure to another investigational drug or study may affect the interpretation of the study results.",

            "Absolutely. Lastly, we have two more exclusion criteria. The first one is known hypersensitivity or contraindication to pembrolizumab or any of its components. This criterion excludes participants who may have allergic reactions to pembrolizumab, which is being used in combination with the investigational drug.",
            "Exactly. Lastly, the final exclusion criterion pertains to any prior toxicity (Grade 3 or 4) related to immunotherapy leading to treatment discontinuation, with the exception of the history of immunotherapy-related endocrinopathy controlled with ongoing medical management.
