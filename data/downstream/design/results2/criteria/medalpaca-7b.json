            "A cutoff of 70% neoplastic cells is often used to assess purity of cell lines in vitro. However, as cancer cell lines are usually established in vitro and not from fresh tumor tissues, this cutoff is irrelevant for the design of the study. We therefore suggest to remove the fourth criterion.  We can proceed with the following proposed inclusion criteria:\n1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage III-IVa Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) based on AJCC 7th edition.\n2. Receiving definitive treatment with either radical surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy + adjuvant chemotherapy, or definitive chemo-radiotherapy (CRT)\n3. Minimum follow up of 2 years or subject had disease recurrence within 2 years after treatment.\n4. Accrual of at least 50 patients.\nWhat about the exclusion criteria?",
            "Great, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. I suggest the following criteria:\n1. Patients with unresectable tumors (for surgical resection samples) or medically inoperable patients.\n2. Patients with neoplastic lesions without cellular atypia.\n3. Patients with insufficient tumor for molecular analysis (tissue availability). \nWhat do you think of these criteria?",
            "Great! We're almost done with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. One last thing we need to do is specify any other criteria that may help narrow down the patient population. For this, we can use the population to be screened. In this case, it's \"OPSCC\", which stands for Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Do you have any other clarifications or would you like me to continue with the study design?"

            "Absolutely! The requirement for neoplastic lesion containing \u2265 70% neoplastic cells ensures that the samples used for mutational and epigenetic analysis are of high quality and contain enough neoplastic cells for accurate assessment. This criterion helps to minimize potential errors or inaccuracies in the analysis, thus improving the reliability of the study results. Does that clarify the importance of this criterion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the information provided, here's what I suggest for the exclusion criteria:\n\n1. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis.\n2. Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these exclusion criteria?",
            "Excellent! So here's the complete set of criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage III-IVa OPSCC, according to AJCC 7th Edition.\n2. Managed with definitive treatment modality (either radical surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy \u00b1 chemotherapy or definitive chemo-radiotherapy).\n3. Minimum follow up of 2 years or who had disease recurrence within 2 years after the end of treatment.\n4. Neoplastic lesion contains \u2265 70% neoplastic cells.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis.\n2. Patients who have been managed with palliative intent.\n3. Patients with previous history of head and neck cancer are not eligible.\n\nPlease make sure to document these criteria accurately. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
