            "A cutoff of 70% neoplastic cells is often used to assess purity of cell lines in vitro. However, as cancer cell lines are usually established in vitro and not from fresh tumor tissues, this cutoff is irrelevant for the design of the study. We therefore suggest to remove the fourth criterion.  We can proceed with the following proposed inclusion criteria:\n1. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, histologically confirmed stage III-IVa Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) based on AJCC 7th edition.\n2. Receiving definitive treatment with either radical surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy + adjuvant chemotherapy, or definitive chemo-radiotherapy (CRT)\n3.

It helps in controlling for developmental differences that may affect the outcomes of the study. Can you think of any other age-related criteria that could be important?",
            "That's a valid point. We can include the criterion \"Gestational age between 37-42 weeks\" to ensure that participants are born full-term. This would help in controlling for potential developmental differences related to prematurity. Let's move on to the next criterion.",

The fourth criterion is that patients cannot have significant other comorbidities such as neurologic conditions, terminal illnesses, or cardiopulmonary disease, as well as cognitive impairment that would prevent the ability to provide informed consent. This ensures that patients included in the study are healthy enough to undergo the procedure and have the cognitive capacity to provide consent. Do you have any comments on this criterion?",

This ranges from relatively young patients with a high risk of osteoporotic fractures to patients with long-standing osteoporosis who might be more likely to fracture. What do you think of this criterion?",
            "Excellent! The sixth criterion is the exclusion of patients with acute neurological deficit. Patients with a history of acute neurological deficit, such as spinal cord injury, cord compression, or recent back surgery, are excluded from the study to avoid adding confounding variables that may influence the outcome. What do you think about this criterion?",

This ensures that patients included in the study have a confirmed diagnosis of osteoporosis, which is the underlying condition leading to vertebral fractures. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Good point! The fourth criterion is that patients should be favorable for inclusion in the study with signed informed consent and available for follow-up up to 1 year. Obtaining informed consent and ensuring availability for follow-up is important to ensure that patients are willing to participate in the study and can be followed up for a sufficient duration to evaluate the outcomes of the treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! The fifth criterion is the availability of adequate preoperative radiologic documentation, including CT or MRI of the lumbar spine, and RX required for evaluation of kyphosis. Adequate preoperative radiologic documentation is necessary to accurately assess the baseline condition of the patients and evaluate the outcomes of the treatment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Well said! The last inclusion criterion is the availability of adequate and comprehensive clinical information, including the presence of ODI score, MRQ, and VAS. Comprehensive clinical information, including functional scores and pain assessments, is important for evaluating the efficacy of the treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree with you. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is the presence of oncologic, metabolic, or endocrinologic diseases related to bone fragility. Excluding patients with underlying conditions that may affect bone fragility helps to ensure that the study population is not confounded by other factors that could influence the outcomes of the treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! The second criterion is age less than 55 years. Limiting the age range helps to ensure that the study population is more homogenous in terms of age and reduces potential confounding factors related to age-related differences in bone health and fracture risk. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! The third criterion is the exclusion of patients who have undergone previous treatment of arthrodesis, vertebroplasty, or percutaneous kyphoplasty for previous fractures. This helps to ensure that the study evaluates the outcomes of kyphoplasty treatment with porous titanium microspheres in treatment-naive patients. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said! The fourth criterion is the exclusion of patients with pre-existing neurological deficits in the lower limbs medullary or radicular prior to fracture occurrence. Excluding patients with pre-existing neurological deficits helps to ensure that the study focuses on the outcomes of kyphoplasty treatment for vertebral fractures without confounding factors related to neurological complications. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! The last exclusion criterion is the unavailability for follow-up for at least 1 year. Ensuring availability for follow-up is important for evaluating the long-term outcomes of the treatment. Excluding patients who are unavailable for follow-up helps to ensure that the study can adequately assess the efficacy and safety of the treatment over a sufficient duration. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

[USER_2] I think another important criterion for the inclusion of individuals is their age. Since the herbal chickpea pulao may interact differently with the body's metabolism at different ages, we may include an age range in the inclusion/exclusion criterion, for example, \"Must be aged between 40 and 60 years old.\" What do you think?  [/USER_2] Brilliant idea! I'll add it to our list. [USER_3] One more thing, how about adding \"No history of certain medical conditions or allergies to chickpeas and fenugreek seeds\" as an inclusion criterion to ensure the safety and efficiency of the study? [/USER_3] Excellent suggestion. I'll include that in the list as well. It's important to rule out potential risks and complications due to allergic reactions. [USER_4] Can we include a criterion to ensure a certain HbA1c level? For example, \"HbA1c must be less than 9 % or within the normal range.\" Is that a good idea? [/USER_4] No, we shouldn't include a criteria for HbA1c levels. HbA1c is a measure of average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months, but it's not a good indicator of blood glucose control on a daily or weekly basis. Additionally, having an HbA1c target may exclude individuals who are not able to maintain a specific blood glucose level due to various reasons such as lifestyle patterns or genetic factors.  Instead, we can include a criterion to ensure participants are actively managing their diabetes and are motivated to improve their blood glucose levels through lifestyle modifications and medication. [/]",

And lastly, how about one more criterion? \"Must have normal renal function.\" This criterion is to exclude individuals with impaired kidney function, as the study will involve consumption of the herbal chickpea pulao, which may not be tolerated by individuals with renal impairment. Do you have any comments or suggestions for this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The second exclusion criterion could be \"Individuals with pregnancy or lactating.\" Pregnant or lactating individuals may have different hormonal changes that could impact the blood glucose response to the herbal chickpea pulao, so excluding them will help to ensure that the results are specific to individuals with Type-2 diabetes and not affected by changes in hormone levels related to pregnancy or lactation. What do you think of this criterion?",

I suggest \"Must be able to consume chickpea rice pulao.\" Since the intervention involves consuming the herbal chickpea pulao, participants need to be able to consume this specific food item as part of the study protocol to accurately assess its impact on blood glucose levels. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now, for the third inclusion criterion, I propose \"Must not be on a vegan or keto diet.\" Individuals following a vegan or keto diet may have dietary restrictions that could impact the results of the study. By excluding individuals on these specific diets, we can control for potential confounding variables and ensure that the results are not influenced by other dietary factors. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion could be \"Healthy people without diabetes.\" Excluding healthy individuals without diabetes is necessary to maintain the focus of the study on individuals with Type-2 diabetes. Including healthy individuals without diabetes would not provide relevant data on the impact of the herbal chickpea pulao on blood glucose levels in individuals with diabetes. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, for the final exclusion criterion, I suggest \"People with less than 18 years of age.\" Excluding individuals under the age of 18 is important for ethical reasons and to ensure the safety of participants. Minors may require additional considerations and approvals for participation in clinical trials, and excluding them simplifies the study design and ensures that participants are legally able to provide informed consent. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

The inclusion and exclusion criteria of potential participants were provided to the nursing staff and physicians involved in the tube feeding procedure. The decision to participate in the study was left to the patient's discretion, and the informed consent was obtained from every patient participant before tube insertion.\nIn order to ensure low risk of bias, only inexperienced operators (who are not routinely involved with gastrostomy tube feeding) were assigned to the ultrasound examination of the inserted tubes. Moreover, two operators were involved per shift to increase reliability.\nThe number of randomly chosen ultrasound examinations for each tube insertion as per the set inclusion criteria was defined before the study. The assessment of the tube position was done directly after the tube insertion procedure while the patient is in a supine position.\nData collection forms were designed for the assessment of the position of both tubes: in \"standard\" and \"blind\" insertion. For each patient, the following data was recorded: patient demographics (age, sex, weight), type of tube inserted (PEG vs. JJ), and the location of the tube tip in the abdominal cavity (gastrohepatic, gastric retrosternal, subcapsular, and oesophageal) on two separate sheets. The assessments were double-checked for consistency by the second operator.\nThe results were transferred to a spreadsheet and analyzed by one of us (ARM). Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize the results. The sensitivity and the specificity of the blind insertion method of tube positioning were calculated as previously mentioned.17 The inter-observer and intra-observer variation of positioning was measured based on the results of repeat ultrasound examination in a randomly chosen 10% of the patients.

This criterion is essential as the intervention involves the administration of caffeine and sodium benzoate via intravenous injection. Participants must have the necessary access for the intervention to be administered safely and effectively. What are your thoughts on including this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Now, let's discuss the last inclusion criterion. How about including patients receiving prenatal care at Tower Health Obstetrical practices? This criterion ensures that participants are under the care of the same healthcare system, which may help in standardizing prenatal care practices and monitoring throughout the trial.",
            "Great. Now that we have finalized the inclusion criteria, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is hypertensive disorders. Excluding patients with hypertensive disorders is important as these conditions may impact the outcomes of the trial and could potentially interact with the intervention being studied. It is necessary to have a clear baseline health status to evaluate the effect of caffeine and sodium benzoate on the second stage of labor. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion: significant cardiac history. Patients with significant cardiac history may have underlying conditions that could be exacerbated by the intervention or may confound the results of the trial. Excluding these patients helps ensure the safety of participants and the validity of the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion: a positive drug screen for cocaine or amphetamines. Excluding patients with positive drug screens is important as these substances could interact with the intervention or affect the outcomes of the trial. Ensuring a drug-free population helps maintain the integrity of the study results. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's consider the next exclusion criterion: fetal malpresentation. Excluding patients with fetal malpresentation is necessary as this could impact the progression of labor and the outcomes of the trial. Studying a specific population with normal fetal presentation helps ensure the relevance and applicability of the results. What are your thoughts on including this criterion?",
            "Well said. Now, let's move on to the penultimate exclusion criterion: hepatic impairment. Excluding patients with hepatic impairment is important as these conditions may affect the metabolism and clearance of the intervention drugs, potentially leading to safety concerns or confounding results. Ensuring a healthy liver function helps maintain the safety and validity of the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's discuss the final exclusion criterion: lack of prenatal care. Excluding patients who have not received prenatal care is necessary as these individuals may have unknown health conditions or risk factors that could impact the outcomes of the trial. Ensuring a consistent level of prenatal care helps standardize the baseline health status of participants. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Well done! Based on our conversation, here are the full criteria for the clinical trial:\nInclusion Criteria: Nulliparous pregnant mothers at term (37 weeks gestation and above), 18-45 years of age, intravenous access, patients receiving prenatal care at Tower Health Obstetrical practices.\nExclusion Criteria: Hypertensive disorders, significant cardiac history, positive drug screen on admission for cocaine or amphetamines, fetal malpresentation, hepatic impairment to include a known history of fatty liver disease, cirrhosis or previously documented abnormal liver function testing (AST >39, ALT >52), lack of prenatal care."

            "That is great. And, what is the study phase?",
            "Great, let's continue with the next criterion. The next criterion is \"Age between 18 to 75 years\". This criterion is imposed to ensure that the patients enrolled in the study are within the normal range for the age group undergoing surgery. Including this criterion helps to avoid including patients, who might be too old or too young for the study's intervention protocol. Is this criterion also acceptable?",
            "Fantastic. Now we can move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is \"Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class IV or with contraindications for regional anesthesia\". The exclusion criterion aims to rule out patients who have contraindications such as co-morbidities or conditions that may affect the safety or efficacy of the intervention. Which of the following types of exclusion criterion do you think would be helpful to include? For example, \"Any significant aortic insufficiency\". Do you agree that this is helpful?",
            "Perfect. The last criterion for inclusion is \"ASA-Titrateable inderal dose less than 0.75 mg/kg body weight\". This criterion is necessary to ensure that patients are in a stable condition to receive the intervention. Only patients on a stable dose of short- acting inderal are included in the study. Does this criterion make sense and should it be included in the inclusion criteria?",
            "Brilliant. We have completed the discussion on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Is there anything else you want to add before we move on to the end of the form?",
            "Great. The second exclusion criterion is \"History of prior sternotomy, cardiotomy, and cardiac surgery\". Including patients with prior sternotomy, cardiac surgery, or cardiotomy may introduce confounding variables in the study, as these patients are likely to have different physiology and baseline characteristics compared to the general population undergoing elective sternotomy for a planned surgical intervention. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fabulous. The last exclusion criterion is \"Intravascular injection of local anesthetic agent\". This exclusion criterion is essential to ensure that the effect of the study drug is limited to the local area of application only and does not spread to other parts of the body. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Great. The last exclusion criterion is \"Pregnancy\". Excluding pregnant patients is necessary to avoid any potential harm to the fetus. Including pregnant patients would introduce a confounding variable that could bias the results. Do you think this criterion is reasonable?",
            "Excellent. The last exclusion criterion is \"History of spinal cord injury or brain injury or injury to the upper extremity\". Excluding such patients is essential as the intervention involves nerve block, which is contraindicated in patients with spinal cord or brain injuries or upper extremity injuries. Including these patients could pose a risk to their safety and invalidate the study findings. Do you concur with this as an exclusion criterion?",
            "Great. The last exclusion criterion is \"Inability to follow up within 7 days\". Excluding patients who are unable to follow up within 7 days of the procedure is crucial to assess the safety and effectiveness of the intervention. Including such patients would skew the data and risk compromising the study results. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Finally, the last exclusion criterion is \"ASA less than 1\". Excluding patients with less than ASA Status 1 is necessary to ensure that only patients who are at low risk of having a reaction to the intervention are included in the study. Including patients with less than ASA 1 status could skew the results towards a false positive or negative finding due to variability in risk factors and prevalence of disease. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Excellent. So based on our discussion, we can conclude that the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study are well-defined and appropriate for the aims and objectives of the study."

            "Thank you for the information. Now, let's move on to the design of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this trial. Let's start with the inclusion criteria. The first criterion is \"Patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery under median sternotomy\". This criterion is necessary as the study aims to examine the effect of the intervention specifically on patients undergoing cardiac surgery via sternotomy. Including only patients undergoing this specific type of surgery ensures that the results of the trial are applicable to the target population. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. The next inclusion criterion is \"Age greater than or equal to 18 years\". This criterion is important as it ensures that participants are adults who can provide informed consent and are likely to have similar physiological responses to the intervention. Including only adult patients also helps in reducing variability in the study population. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on to the third inclusion criterion, it is \"American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Status I-IV\". This criterion is essential as it helps in ensuring that patients included in the study have a similar baseline health status and are suitable for undergoing the intervention. Patients with ASA Status I-IV are considered to have varying degrees of systemic disease or comorbidities, and including them in the study population helps in assessing the generalizability of the results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Now, for the last inclusion criterion, it is \"Approval and sign of the informed consent\". Obtaining informed consent is a fundamental ethical requirement in clinical research. Including this criterion ensures that participants are aware of the study procedures, risks, and benefits, and have voluntarily agreed to participate. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is \"Allergy to local anesthetics\". Excluding patients with allergies to local anesthetics is important to prevent adverse reactions during the intervention. Including such patients could confound the results and pose a risk to their safety. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The next exclusion criterion is \"Puncture site infection\". Excluding patients with puncture site infections is necessary to prevent the spread of infection and ensure patient safety during the intervention. Infections can complicate the procedure and affect the outcomes of the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Moving on to the third exclusion criterion, it is \"Lack of signing of informed consent\". Excluding patients who have not signed informed consent is crucial to ensure that all participants are fully informed about the study and have willingly agreed to participate. Including patients without proper consent would violate ethical principles. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. The next exclusion criterion is \"Age less than 18 years\". Excluding patients below 18 years of age is important as the study is focused on adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Including pediatric patients could introduce confounding variables related to age-specific physiological responses. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Moving on to the fifth exclusion criterion, it is \"Emergency surgery\". Excluding patients undergoing emergency surgery is necessary as these cases may have different clinical characteristics and urgency compared to elective surgeries. Including emergency cases could introduce variability and confound the results of the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The next exclusion criterion is \"ASA greater than IV\". Excluding patients with ASA Status greater than IV is important as these patients may have severe systemic diseases or comorbidities that could affect the outcomes of the intervention. Including such patients could introduce confounding variables and impact the generalizability of the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. Now, for the last exclusion criterion, it is \"Preoperative acute respiratory failure\". Excluding patients with preoperative acute respiratory failure is essential as these patients may have compromised respiratory function that could affect the outcomes of the intervention. Including such patients could confound the results and pose a risk to their safety during the procedure. What do you think about this criterion?",

Our criteria include patients greater than 18 years of age, ability to give informed consent, no history of a musculoskeletal injury, Android or iOS smartphone with operating system 5.0 or higher, and no contraindications to using the application. The exclusion criteria include patients with contraindications to using a smartphone or the application, inability to adhere to the study protocol, and no musculoskeletal disease. Thank you for your help with formulating these criteria; they will help ensure a high-quality study.",
            "Fabulous! Let's specify the number of patients needed for our study. Determining the number of patients needed is critical for your study design. We can consider a range of criteria to determine the sample size. 1. Determine a power or precision value. This will vary by the sensitivity and specificity of the outcome you want to measure. 2. Estimate drop-out rate. This will depend on whether the study is retrospective or prospective, and can be influenced by factors like compliance with the protocol, number of follow-ups, or participant burden. 3. Decide whether the analysis is going to be hypothesis-driven or hypothesis-generating. A hypothesis-driven study needs fewer patients, whereas a hypothesis-generating study may need more patients to ensure statistically significant results. 4. Consider the budget and logistics. There is some level of variability in cost and time needed per patient between studies, as well as the number of sites needed and the number of patients per site. Let's say we want to detect a moderate risk ratio of 0.8 with a 80% power and expected drop-out rate of 10%. We'll assume that the patients are likely to be compliant and we will conduct a prospective study with 100 patients.

Including only patients who have received this treatment ensures consistency in the study population. What do you think about this criterion?",

Must be between the ages of 7 and 15. Inclusion Criteria Recruiting participants for a clinical study requires careful consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The process involves breaking down the criteria into progressively more specific subsets to ensure that the cohort is homogeneous. For example, for the study we are working on, the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be broken down like this: Inclusion Criteria 1. Children diagnosed with special learning disabilities, such as ADHD, ASD, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, or nonverbal learning disability. 2. Children who attend the special education and rehabilitation center regularly. Exclusion Criteria Children with exercise intolerance or any disease that prevents exercise.
