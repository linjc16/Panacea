            "Let me see if I understand your question correctly. You're asking why the fourth criterion requires a neoplastic lesion with a high percentage of neoplastic cells? \n\nYes, I think it's an important criterion. The tumor sample should have a sufficient amount of neoplastic cells to detect genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications. The cut-off of 70% was set based on the previous studies, which showed that the presence of a high percentage of neoplastic cells was necessary to obtain reliable and accurate results using genetic and epigenetic sequencing. Could you share more details about the fourth criterion, such as why you selected 70% and what data support this number?",

Studies have shown that obese individuals have a higher risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to lean individuals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in metabolic markers in obese individuals after bariatric surgery and investigate whether these changes were influenced by the type of bariatric procedure performed. This quasi\u2010experimental study recruited obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery between August 2018 and May 2019. 49 subjects were included, of which 26 received Roux\u2010en\u2010Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and 23 received sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Metabolic markers including Body Mass Index (BMI), lipid profile, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA\u2010IR) were measured before and after surgery. Data were analyzed using paired t\u2010test and the chi\u2010square test. A p\u2010value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in BMI, FBG, total cholesterol, low\u2013density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2010C), and HOMA\u2010IR in both groups (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in BMI, total cholesterol, low\u2013density lipoprotein",

The exercise group completed the training three times a week for 4 weeks prior to the surgery and 3 times a week for 6 weeks after the surgery. The exercise training was started approximately 6 weeks after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the IPSS score, and the secondary outcome measures included the QOL score, Mental health score, and body mass index.The IPSS and QOL scores were significantly lower at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the surgery in the preoperative exercise training group than in the postoperative exercise training group. The mental health scores were significantly higher in the postoperative exercise training group than in the preoperative exercise training group. The body mass index was significantly higher in the postoperative exercise training group than in the preoperative exercise training group at the 12th week.Preoperative and postoperative exercise training had similar effects on the recovery of LUTS. The preoperative exercise training group had a lower IPSS and QOL scores than the postoperative exercise training group, indicating that longer exercise duration reduced postoperative side effects and improved recovery.Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were enrolled in a study comparing preoperative and postoperative exercise programs for recovery from radical prostatectomy.

The tool, the 6\u2010item PREDICT scoring system is then used as soon as investigations have been done and the results considered.RESULTS: For 79 patients (66%) the tool recommended an invasive coronary investigation; the remaining 41 underwent a conservative management strategy which included an early non\u2010invasive ambulatory programme. Out of the 120 patients, 80 had a normal outcome, and 40 had an abnormal outcome confirmed initially or subsequently. Two patients with an abnormal outcome had their diagnoses made within 6 months, three had theirs made between 7 and 18 months, and two after 2.5 years. Forty\u2010eight (40%) of the 120 had a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), but only 21 (17.5%) had no abnormality on any of the investigations they had undergone.CONCLUSIONS: The 6\u2010item PREDICT scoring system is an effective tool in reducing the need for invasive coronary investigation.",

It is also an important contributor to caregiver strain and burden. Despite its high prevalence, the pain assessment in patients with dementia continues to be a challenge; the pain is frequently under\u2010recognized and under\u2010treated. The purpose of this study was, thus, to investigate the feasibility and impact on pain measurement of using the Patient InformatioN for Intensive Care Evaluation scale, the pain scale validated for the intensive care units, on 36 patients with dementia and pain in a geriatric rehabilitation unit. Patients were admitted from an acute hospital and had been referred to geriatric rehabilitation for neurologic or orthopedic decompensation. Patients were randomly allocated into control and intervention groups. Each one received standard care for pain management (opioids, nonopioids, or topical treatments); the intervention group was assessed using the PINNICLE scale in addition. Nurses received training on its use, as well as on the recognition and management of pain. The PINNICLE scale demonstrated its feasibility to be used in the evaluation of pain of patients with dementia. It allowed to identify painful situations, and even to detect a previously unrecognized pain condition. It was also possible to improve pain management and reduce medication use. Pain must be considered an essential clinical dimension of patients with dementia. The PINNICLE scale may be an important tool to improve management of pain for these patients.",

In addition, most of these proceedings papers are not published in scholarly journals, which may cast doubt on their quality. To improve these shortcomings, proceedings papers have been assigned a new status: Conference Proceeding (CP). This status has been defined as \"a conference paper that appears in the proceedings of a conference or symposium\", and is a good alternative to reporting preliminary results that have not yet been peer\u2010reviewed.

In spite of the advances in treatment of dementia, there are still 24.3 million individuals living with mild cognitive impairment who have no disease-modifying treatment options available. There is an unmet need for accessible and effective interventions for cognitive health in the aging brain. tDCS, a safe, non-invasive neuromodulation technique that utilizes weak electrical currents to modulate neuronal excitability, has emerged as a promising approach in cognitive rehabilitation. There is mounting evidence to suggest that tDCS can improve cognitive outcomes in a range of clinical conditions and healthy populations. However, there is still limited research on the use of tDCS for individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the context of cognitive functioning, mood, and sleep. OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on cognition, mood and sleep at 2 months. The secondary aim is to evaluate the effects on brain structure and function. Specifically, the study aims to: evaluate the short-term effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on the cognitive outcomes of verbal fluency, memory, and executive function evaluate the short-term effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on mood assessed by the PROMIS-mood instrument evaluate the short-term effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on sleep assessed through questionnaires (PSQI and PSQI-2) evaluate the effect of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise through functional brain imaging to assess whether changes in brain structure and function mediate improved cognitive performance in participants with mild cognitive impairment.

The second aim involved validating the questionnaire in a study that consisted of 50 patients that have undergone THA. The final aim focused on determining whether the score on the questionnaire reflects a significant improvement in health\u2010related QoL (HR\u2010QoL).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The QoL\u201050 questionnaire was developed using the method of test\u2010retest, reproducibility, and content validity. Fifty patients that have undergone THA are being used to test the face and concurrent validity of the questionnaire. We validated the developed questionnaire by comparing its sensitivity to the standard score of the generic EQ\u20105D\u20105L and the disease\u2010specific Short From Hip Scale (SF\u201012).RESULTS: Based on qualitative analysis, 10 items were selected as QoL criteria. The mean QoL score of patients pre\u2010 and postoperatively was 1.51 \u00b1 0.28 and 3.47 \u00b1 0.23, respectively. The Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire was 0.75. The QoL questionnaire showed high reliability for QoL changes (ICC = 0.98, P < 0.001). However, it showed slight agreement with the EQ\u20105D\u20105L questionnaire (ICC = 0.16, P < 0.001). The SF\u201012 questionnaire exhibited slightly greater agreement (r = 0.79, P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the QoL\u201050 questionnaire is a valid instrument for detecting HRQoL changes before and after THA.

On to the next one. \n\nIntroduction: While there is consensus that cancer treatments significantly impair physical function, there has been little attention paid to whether cognitive function is similarly affected. This could be particularly noteworthy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at high risk for cognitive decline. A previous meta-analysis demonstrated no significant cognitive changes with HNSCC treatment. However, no studies included patients with cognitive impairments and/or delirium at enrollment. Furthermore, all studies had a low risk of bias. The purpose of this study is to compare baseline cognitive function prior to initiation of treatment between newly diagnosed HNSCC patients with high risk for cognitive decline versus without using a validated tool. Method: Patients were recruited to the Neuro-Onco-Supportive-Treatment (NOST) clinical care trial at the University of Maryland (NCT03057184). Patients were randomized into the control arm vs the cognitive support intervention arm. High-risk criteria for cognitive decline included at least one prior stroke or moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment per screening assessment tools. For cognitive impairment, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used. Answering 6 or less questions correctly indicates mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. The cognitive support arm includes a cognitive enhancement protocol. Controls undergo standard symptom care per standard oncology care. Primary objective of the NOST trial is to determine the time to post-treatment cognitive decline (TCMD). Differences in TCM with cognitive impairment and without between arms will be reported according to the intent to treat (ITT) model. Secondary objective includes evaluating the feasibility of the cognitive protocol. Results: Preliminary data will be presented. Limitations: We anticipate high dropout rate due to the nature of the trial. Conclusion: This study will allow investigators to evaluate the degree of cognitive impairment within this high-risk group at baseline and compare the frequency of treatment induced cognitive decline (TDIC), comparing between the control and cognitive support arms of the NOST trial.",

However, despite the widespread use of music, there have been no previous studies in endoscopy clinics regarding the effect of music on anxiety, pain and patient satisfaction in the colonoscopy procedure. Colorectal cancer, which is the most common cancer in our country, affects about 7.4% of the population and is the second most common cause of cancer mortality in the world. Early diagnosis and treatment with rapid colonoscopy play a very important role in mortality and morbidity. Colonoscopy is a simple, noninvasive procedure and the golden standard for screening and symptom evaluation. In addition, with the use of conscious sedation, it can be performed as painless as possible without any harm to the patient. However, many patients have phobia and anxiety due to colonoscopy. Patients often experience anxiety and stress during the colonoscopy procedure. Colonoscopy with conscious sedation may cause side effects or complications related to sedation. Patients often experience some pain, anxiety and drowsiness during a colonoscopic examination.",

The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on LA function in AF patients are unknown. However, CPAP therapy can increase LA systolic function in congestive heart failure patients, the impact of CPAP on the LA in patients with AF and preserved systolic function is unknown.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CPAP therapy on LA volume, function, and electrical properties in non\u2010emergent AF patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; ejection fraction (EF)>50%).METHODS: This is a blinded, randomized, cross\u2010over trial in which patients with left atrial enlargement and AF with normal EF were randomized to CPAP or no CPAP for 6 weeks. Cardiac MRI was performed before and after treatment. The primary outcome was change in LA volume index. The change in regional and global longitudinal strain was examined as a secondary outcome.RESULTS: Eighteen patients with non\u2010emergent AF and normal EF were enrolled and underwent MRI (CPAP; n = 8 and no CPAP; n = 10). Mean age was 60.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7 years and 60% were male. Diastolic function was normal in all patients, and cardiac MRI revealed similar ventricular volumes and function in both groups before treatment. Six weeks of CPAP therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the LA volume index (CPAP vs. no CPAP: 35.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1\u00a0mL/m2 vs. 36.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2\u00a0mL/m2; P < 0.01). Additionally, the regional strain in the LA wall was significantly increased (39.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8% vs. 34.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8%; P < 0.01).

The purpose of the research is to evaluate the efficacy of the UP as an adjunctive intervention to the MS-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy (MS-CBT) and determine if its use is superior to the use of a waitlist control. It is hypothesized that participants assigned to the UP + MS-CBT condition will show a greater reduction in depressive symptomology, anxiety symptomology, and MS-specific distress than those assigned to the MS-CBT only or waitlist control conditions.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nRationale: Depression and anxiety are commonly reported symptoms in individuals living with a chronic illness such as MS, with rates approaching 50%. These symptoms can lead to decreased quality of life, decreased functioning, and adherence to treatment plans. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a recommended evidence-based therapy for depression and anxiety that has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms in individuals with MS. However, CBT is often not available or accessible to individuals living with MS, and it is often difficult to find practitioners with expertise in delivering both CBT and a cognitive approach to depression and anxiety in this population. The Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is a CBT-based intervention that has been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety in multiple populations and formats, including in-person settings, telehealth delivery, and as an individual and group modality. The UP has not been adapted for individuals with MS. This proposed pilot study will evaluate the effectiveness of the 12-week UP + MS-specific CBT in an adult population of MS. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate a revised UP that has been modified to address MS-specific issues. Based on feedback, it is envisioned that the UP",

Fifty\u2010six patients, 34 females and 22 males, 55.73 +/\u2010 16.68 years old with diagnosis of asthma will be recruited. They will be assigned randomly to treatment or control groups (n = 28). The treatment group will receive the Unified Protocol of Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders for 12 weeks, whereas the control group will not receive any intervention. The primary outcome will be assessed by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) at baseline, post\u2010treatment, 6\u2010week, 6\u2010month, and 12\u2010month follow\u2010up. The secondary outcome will comprise quality of life (as measured by the Asthma\u2010QoL), anxiety, depression, sleep, and mindfulness assessed at each assessment with the corresponding scale. A repeated\u2010measures ANOVA will be performed on outcome measures. Results. Preliminary data have been obtained in the first 23 patients enrolled (15 females and 8 males, mean age: 45.22 +/\u2010 18.84 years old).

So far, patients receiving the Unified Protocol showed significant improvement in comparison with the control group at 12 weeks after the end of the intervention. The impact of such treatment could be long\u2010lasting considering the improvement observed at the last follow\u2010up. Since few interventions are currently available for patients with asth",

The drug (hydrocortisone) used in this study is used frequently among critically ill infants, but the dose and length of time these drugs are used, and how long the drug stays in the body are unknown. For safety reasons, it is important to know about the metabolism (breakdown) and elimination (removal) of these drugs to help guide the dose and how long to give it to patients. Also, hydrocortisone binds to a certain protein in the blood while it takes a little time to reach the correct level. This study aims to help define how long the drug takes to reach the right level and how long it stays in the body. This study aims to enroll 22 very premature infants weighing up to 1000 grams after birth who are diagnosed with vitamin K dependent bleeding. Patients will be treated with hydrocortisone to manage bleeding. Blood will be withdrawn 4 times within 7 days for testing.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nProspective Study of Hydrocortisone Concentrations in Preterm Infants With Posthemorrhagic Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nVitamin K Dependent Hemorrhage\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Premature infant at <26 0/7 weeks gestational age born <1000 grams at birth, in the first 48 hours of life and requires the use of intravenous vitamin K for treatment of vitamin",

In addition, some patients receiving DEX\u2010IP therapy during awake surgery (AS) showed improvement in quality of life and cognition. Our pilot study is a single\u2010arm, prospective study which evaluated the safety and performance of DEX\u2010IP in patients who underwent AS for movement disorder. METHODS: The study design consisted of evaluation of safety, feasibility, and the effects of treatment on cognition and mood. Patients' safety, adverse events, and vital signs were assessed. Adverse events were defined as serious adverse events during AS and within 7\u00a0days. Cognitive and mood status were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: We conducted AS in 40 patients. The mean age was 66.3\u00b110.1 years, and 85% of the total patients (n\u00a0=\u00a034) were male. The mean duration of AS was 91.47\u00b136.01\u00a0min, and the mean infusion time of DEX\u2010IP was 77.43\u00b128.66\u00a0min. The most frequent adverse event was bradycardia, followed by hypotension, which often occurred during AS. No serious adverse events occurred. The mean MMSE score before surgery was 27.43\u00b11.68 and improved in 15 cases and decreased in 11 cases. In the HADS total score, the mean score before surgery was 6.18\u00b13.5",

Initially, we will use clinical evaluation and imaging studies to assess the patient's condition and ensure that they meet the inclusion criteria. Then, informed consent will be obtained for patients who are deemed eligible. Before surgery, we will obtain preoperative radiographs, CT scans, and MRIs. The surgical technique will be performed as follows: After positioning the patient prone, a posterior transpedicular approach will be used to enter the vertebral body through a 10- to 15-mm incision on the posterolateral aspect of the spine. The pedicle and superior and inferior endplates will be identified and reamed to create a channel. A balloon will then be inserted into the channel and inflated to create a cavity within the vertebral body. After deflating and removing the balloon, porous titanium microspheres will be filled into the cavity using a cannula. The excess material will be removed, and the wound will be closed appropriately. Postoperative management will consist of bed rest for 3 days, followed by ambulation and rehabilitation as tolerated. Postoperative imaging studies will be obtained to ensure proper placement of the microspheres and assess any complications. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months for clinical and radiographic assessment.

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing intervention on attitudes, beliefs, and self\u2010esteem in people with eating disorders. Methods: This study was a two\u2010group pre\u2010test and post\u2010test experimental design. The sample of this study included 30 patients with eating disorder. It was collected in stages 1 and 2 under the supervision of the researcher and in stages 3 and 4 by a trained therapist. After training both counselor groups and patients at home, the control group received routine care, but the intervention group was counseled using motivational interviewing for 4 sessions. Then, two weeks after counseling, the counselor and participants were evaluated. SPSS 22 was used to analyze and code the data, and the statistical population was compared using the t\u2010test. Results: The intervention group reported a significant difference in attitudes, beliefs, and the quality of life and self\u2010esteem before and after the intervention compared to the control group (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Motivational interviewing was an effective method in helping patients with eating disorders overcome negative attitudes and beliefs about themselves and their disease.",

The study will be conducted at approximately 20 hospital sites in the United States and Europe. Eligible patients must have been newly diagnosed, untreated aggressive large B cell lymphoma of the following histologic subtypes: T cell/Histocytic, T Cell Rich, Double HIT and NK cell lymphomas. Previous studies have shown that the B cell component of these aggressive lymphomas represents approximately half of the tumor. The BGB-A317 and ACT-301 components of this combination will target T cells and CD19+ B cells; thus, this combination targeted treatment is expected to impact two cells of the tumor (T+B+). In addition, the B cell component of this combination targeted treatment is expected to impact a previously untreated B cell component and may be expected to impact the efficacy of the treatment; this will be the key hypothesis of this study. The objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BGB-A317 and ACT-301 when used in combination to treat B cell lymphomas in this patient population.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Phase 1 Study Of BGB-A317 Combined With ACT-301 In Patients With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDiffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Biological: BGB-A317\n* Biological: ACT-301\n* Drug: Rituximab\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================",

When used together, the PET/CT integrated system is called PET/CT perfusion perfusion. The study method is based on PET/CT perfusion perfusion. It scans the abdomen, chest, and pelvis. The scan can be considered for the following patients. Abnormalities in 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT perfusion imaging are often considered indications of local malignant tumors, but abnormal signals may also be found in benign lesions such as inflammatory tissue. If the location, extent, and shape of the lesion are unclear, additional investigations such as biopsies are required. In addition, if there is more than one lesion, it is difficult to determine which lesion is responsible for the abnormality by PET/CT perfusion imaging.

There are also two secondary goals: 1. To assess for any changes in other areas of skin such as facial, breast, and abdominal skin. 2. To assess participants' perception of their perceived lymph and/or fluid state over the course of the 30 day use of the Apparel by using the Modified Lymphedema Questionnaire-20 survey.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Pilot Test/Prior to Market Feasibility Study Evaluating the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Early Signs of Efficacy of an Anti-Cellulite Lymphatic-Mimic Apparel\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCellulite\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Cell-u-Light compression pants\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Participant is age 18 and over.

            "You're completely right. By excluding participants on special diets for weight loss or other health issues, we can isolate the effects of the compression pants on cellulite appearance. Incorporating the exception of stable diets, such as the gluten-free diet for coeliac, ensures that the intervention's effectiveness is not confounded by pre-existing dietary restrictions.

What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "You're absolutely right. By excluding participants with a history of DVT, we can minimize potential risks or complications associated with compression therapy.\n\n*DVT refers to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a deep vein, typically in the leg. It can be a serious condition that requires medical attention.\n\n*Compression therapy involving the use of compression garments can provide graduated pressure to assist venous return and improve circulation. However, it is important to ensure that participants who have had a history of DVT are not at an increased risk of developing further complications if they engage in compression therapy.\n\nIt is recommended that healthcare providers evaluate each participant's individual medical history and ensure that compression therapy is safe for them.\n\n\nHere are some additional points to consider in relation to the exclusion criterion for participants with a history of DVT:\n\n1) Potential risks associated with compression therapy: Compression therapy can potentially increase venous pressure and blood flow in the deep veins, which could increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other complications for participants with a pre-existing condition like DVT.\n2) Medical evaluation: Participants with a history of DVT should undergo a thorough medical evaluation before enrolling in a study that involves compression therapy. This evaluation should include a review of the participant's medical history, a physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing to assess the risk of developing further complications.\n3) Follow-up and monitoring: Participants with a history of DVT should be monitored closely for any signs or symptoms of possible complications during the intervention period, including inflammation, pain, or swelling in the legs. If any concerns arise, prompt medical attention should be sought.\n\n*DVT stands for Deep Vein Thrombosis, which refers to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a deep vein, typically in the leg. It can be a serious condition that requires medical attention and can lead to complications like pulmonary embolism (PE) if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.\n\nIntroduction\n-----------------\nThis is a pilot study to ascertain the feasibility of recruiting a study group of patients suffering with cellulite and to identify any contraindications to the use of compression garment and UHF-EMF technology in",

The measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide has proven to be especially important during general anaesthesia in order to quickly detect possible hyper- and hypoventilation in the patient and to optimise ventilation according to these results. However, many of the current devices for non-invasive measurement of end-tidal carbon dioid are unreliable in children due to the use of a pneumo-tachograph or a mask capnometer in conjunction with a gas analyser. In addition, the use of these devices leads to an increase in dead space and work of breathing, and as a result to a deterioration of the patients' respiration.\nThe aim of the present study is to develop a device for the non-invasive measurement of end-tidal CO2 that is based on the measuring method of the NIST-ECCO2, which is a device for the invasive measurement of end-tidal CO2 using blood. This NIST-ECCO2 method has shown very good accuracy in adults, so the idea now is to adapt the non-invasive method of the NIST-ECCO2 to children. This can be done based on the fact that capnography in children and adults is based basically on the same physical principle, namely the Henry's law - which says that the CO2 content in the air is proportional to the partial pressure and CO2 concentration in the blood. Thus, the present study uses the same mathematical model of NIST-ECCO2, but this time with the aim of measuring the exhaled CO2"

Patients and Methods: This retrospective study compared 83 patients who underwent hemilaryngectomy from January 2009 to September 2020 with 67 patients who underwent total laryngectomy from January 2011 to September 2020 at a tertiary referral center in Tokyo. The primary endpoint was 5\u2010year overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were 5\u2010year disease\u2010specific survival (DSS), 5\u2010year failure\u2010free survival (FFS), and 5\u2010year progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Kaplan\u2010Meier method was used to compare the OS, DSS, FFS, and PFS rates. Cox\u2010proportional hazards regression analysis was employed to assess the effects of surgery type, treatment regimen, and other clinicopathological factors on OS. Statistical significance was established at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The 5\u2010year OS, DSS, FFS, and PFS rates did not significantly differ between hemilaryngectomy and total laryngectomy. The risk of distant metastasis in the total laryngectomy group was higher than in the hemilaryngectomy group (P = 0.034). The overall proportion of patients who developed complications after surgery did not significantly differ between the two groups (P = 0.553). Distant metastasis was the primary factor influencing OS (P < 0.001).

In order to develop a comprehensive list of recommended competencies for neuro\u2010oncology, the Joint Section on Neuro\u2010Oncology of the American Association of Neurosurgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons conducted a survey of fellowship\u2010training program directors to identify competencies important in the field of neuro\u2010oncology. The purpose of this study was to review this survey and report on the most commonly reported, important competencies required for competent neuro\u2010oncology fellowship training.METHODS: Two e\u2010mail surveys were sent to all neuro\u2010oncology fellowship program directors. The first survey contained open\u2010ended questions asking about competencies (knowledge, skill, and attitude) that are important to the practice of neuro\u2010oncology.

The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life (QoL), body function, and symptoms in breast cancer patients and to evaluate the association between PORT and QoL after CT. Methods: A total of 172 patients were divided into 2 groups: CT \u2010 RT group (n = 79), and CT + RT group (n = 93). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. Psychometric instruments were used to evaluate QoL (EORTC QLQ\u2010C30 global health status and functional scales) and symptoms (FACT\u2010B). The correlation between the change in the QLQ\u2010C30 total score and the sum of FACT\u2010B symptom scores (TOTS) for the different domains was analyzed to identify domains more severely affected by treatment. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In our sample, we identified a statistically significant negative correlation between breast cancer\u2010related QoL (global health status and functional scales) and the severity of the symptoms of breast cancer\u2010related symptoms. Analyzing the results from the CT + RT group, the QLQ\u2010C30 total score and TOTS decreased from baseline to 6 months in all of the domains. The baseline CT + RT group exhibited a clinically significant improvement in the quality of life and body functions. The FACT\u2010B symptoms decreased in most domains, with some improvement observed in physical well\u2010being and emotional well\u2010being.

While the number of people living with HIV worldwide has decreased, many people still lack access to HIV testing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Community-based testing, which can be provided by non-clinical community members, has shown great potential in increasing the coverage of HIV testing in resource-limited settings. The effectiveness of community-based testing in Kazakhstan needs further research. This study aims to explore the perspectives of individuals who received a community-based HIV testing service (CBHTS) in Mangystau region of Kazakhstan.\u00a0\n\nA community-based testing service (CBHTS) was implemented in five of its districts, namely Kyzylorda, Shieli, Aktau, Mangystau, and Beyneu. Kazakhstan has a predominantly Muslim population, and a high rate of alcohol and drug use among the population. Alcohol use is considered a high-risk behavior for HIV infection in the country. \u00a0Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with risky sexual behavior and increased HIV transmission.\n\nKazakhstan\u00a0has a population of 18.7 million people, with over 50% living in rural areas. The Mangystau region\u00a0is considered\u00a0one of the most vulnerable regions in Kazakhstan due to the prevalence of HIV, AIDS, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\u00a0The prevalence of HIV in the Mangystau region is 0.59% and the prevalence of HIV in the sex worker population is 1.86%.\u00a0\n\nHIV rates reported by the UN in 2020 show that the overall prevalence of HIV in the Mangystau region is higher than in the rest of Kazakhstan, but AIDS prevalence has remained constant in the region since 2010. Furthermore, the HIV inc",

This criterion will help us evaluate the study interventions' effectiveness in individuals with a higher risk of HIV progression.

Patients and Methods: This study included 30 healthy postmenopausal women having a hysteroscopy for IUA removal. The expression patterns and intensity of ERs and ARs were observed in the endometrium, myometrium and vaginal walls using the immunohistochemical staining method and evaluated. Results: The mean age of patients was 52.5 \u00b1 5.7 years. The positive rate of ARs in the cervical mucosa, endometrium and myometrium was 80%, 0.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The expressions of ARs in the endometrium and myometrium were statistically less than those in the cervical mucosa (P=0.012, P=0.031). The positive rate of ERs in the cervical mucosa, endometrium and myometrium was 93.3%, 86.7% and 60%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the expression of ERs between the cervical and endometrial tissues (P=0.380), and there was a statistical difference between the endometrium and myometrium (P=0.012).

Can you describe what this means in detail? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Atelectasis due to bronchial asthma is a common postoperative complication during cardiac surgery. This study investigated the frequency and potential mechanism of atelectasis. Patients and methods: Seventy\u2010five patients were recruited during general anesthesia cardiac surgery with bronchial asthma, and 100 matched patients with general anesthesia cardiac surgery without bronchial asthma were selected as the control group. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, group A and B. The preoperative spirometry and pulmonary function were measured in all patients. At the end of the operation, arterial blood gas, lung ultrasound and chest radiography were observed and recorded. Results: There were no significant differences in sex, BMI, age and pulmonary function between groups A and B. Anesthesia induction time, intubation time, operation time and operation time did not show a statistical difference. The number of patients with PO4 < 1.4 mmol/L after tracheal intubation and operation in the Atelectasis group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The number of patients with arterial PCO2 (pHPA) \u2264 35 mmHg in the atelectasis group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). An increase in PO4 and pHPA in the atelectasis group, which can effectively predict atelectasis, was also observed. Conclusion: Bronchial asthma is a risk factor for postoperative atelectasis, and a decrease in pHPA and an increase in pCO2 are risk factors for atelectasis. We hope that these results can provide a basis for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of atelectasis in bronchial asthma patients.",

Objectives: We aimed to clarify the effect of a nurse\u2010based telephone coaching on patients with COPD. Methods: The randomized, open\u2010labelled controlled trial was conducted at Kobe University Hospital from March 2013 to March 2015. Of participants with COPD, 47 were assigned to test and 53 to control group. The test group was given individualised telephone coaching, while the control group did not receive any phone calls. The mean of intervention duration was 4.9 months (range 1.0 month \u2010 12.5 months). Results: The total number of hospitalizations due to COPD and the average number of acute exacerbations per patient year were significantly reduced in the test group, however.

It remains unclear whether fluoroscopic navigation catheters actually improve procedural outcomes, and many questions remain regarding their use. This study aimed to provide an overview of the evidence on the safety and efficacy of fluoroscopic navigation catheters during PCI. METHODS: Comprehensive systematic literature searches were performed on the efficacy of fluoroscopic navigation catheter\u2010assisted PCI compared with conventional PCI. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of fluoroscopic navigation catheters. The main outcome measures were procedural success, major complication rates, procedural duration, radiation dose and cardiac enzyme levels. Data were extracted from each article and outcomes were analyzed and tabulated. RESULTS: A total of six studies, including 646 (n=318; fluoroscopy group, n=328) patients, were included. Fluoroscopy\u2010guided PCI was associated with higher procedural success (six of six studies; relative risk [RR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.11\u20101.53, P=0.001) than conventional PCI. Major complication rates and radiation exposure between the two groups were similar. There were no significant differences in periprocedural myocardial infarction and mortality. CONCLUSION: The preliminary evidence shows improved procedural success when a fluoroscopic navigation catheter is used. Further research is needed to ascertain its impact on long\u2010term outcomes and to determine other clinical benefits of this technology.",

In patients with obesity, bariatric surgery may provide weight loss with beneficial metabolic effects. Bariatric surgery is usually preceded by a 6\u2010month preparation period of diet counseling and weight loss. Despite the efficacy of behavioral treatment options for obesity, most of these patients will need pharmacological intervention to achieve targeted weight loss targets. This multicenter, prospective, randomized, and non\u2010blinded pilot study wants to investigate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of orlistat during the preparation period in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods. 140 subjects were randomized to receive 120 mg orlistat thrice a day (OD) or placebo OD for 6 months prior to bariatric surgery. Exclusion criteria were: diabetes, hyperlipidemia, renal failure, liver failure, active gastrinoma, gastrointestinal conditions or drug taking that increases gastric acid secretion, pregnancy, lactation, chronic pancreatitis and uncontrolled seizure disorder. The primary outcome measures were weight loss, glycometabolic profile, blood pressure, liver function and adverse effects of orlistat. Results. 135 subjects completed the trial (76 subjects in the OD 120 mg group and 59 subjects in the OD placebo group). Baseline characteristics were not different between the groups. Subjects in both groups showed a significant reduction in weight (P < 0.0001, paired t tests).

The most common condition is ankylosing spondylitis, but there are several other conditions in the group.  It is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation and damage to the joints, spinal discs, ligaments, and tendons. It can cause pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is the subgroup of spondyloarthritis that predominantly affects the spine (especially the sacroiliac joints and the lower spine), causing stiffness and pain. AxSpA has a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life, including physical abilities",

After obtaining written informed consent, all patients were submitted to coronary angiography. The study was approved by our local ethics committee and all patients had written informed consent prior to any procedure. Patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), previous revascularization, diabetes or uncontrolled systemic arterial hypertension were excluded from the study. All patients were submitted to standard angiography followed by a final kissing balloon dilatation of the stenosis. The mean age was 53.74+12.18 years and 45.14+10.4years in the FDR and control group, respectively. Patients were randomized in 2 groups according to the use of the intracoronary nitrate (NTG) or not (C group). A comparison of the coronary flow reserve (CFR) in the C group showed that the FDR had significantly reduced CFR after nitrate administration with a mean value of 1.28 +0.44 vs 2.05+0.76 in controls (p<0.001). All controls presented mean CFRs greater than 2, whereas 10 of 13 FDR had values less than 2. No differences in the CAD lesion characteristics were found between control and FDR. Thus, in comparison to control, the FDR showed a greater reduction of CFR, which has clinical relevance as the CFR represents the myocardial oxygen supply reserve and could contribute to reduced symptoms at exercise, which are more",

We performed a cross\u2010sectional study that comprised 100 adults with hypertension taking various antihypertensive medications. Methods: Patients were divided into a case group (oral administration of curcumin\u2010piperine for more than two months, n = 59) and a control group using the antihypertensive regimen without curcumin\u2010piperine (n = 41). Both groups were treated for six months, and the frequency of treatment was adjusted as necessary during the study period. The main outcome criteria were the prevalence of SAS in the two groups before and after treatment. Secondary outcome criteria included the changes in blood pressure and medication dosage before and after treatment. The SAS diagnostic criteria included (1) the number of times snoring occurred was >50/h and (2) the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) was > 5/h. A statistical analysis of the data was performed using the t\u2010test, chi\u2010square test, Mann\u2010Whitney U test, or Fisher's exact probability test as appropriate. Results: The prevalence of SAS before treatment in case and control groups was 23.7% and 36.6%, respectively, with no statistical difference. However, the prevalence of SAS after treatment was significantly lower in the case group than the control group (25.4% vs. 34.1%, p = 0.008). In addition, the number of snoring events in the case group was significantly reduced compared to the control group (30.0 \u00b1 25.2 vs. 42.2 \u00b1 21.4, p = 0.018).

The spinal pump used in this study employs a pneumatic pump to discharge pressurized air into the subarachnoid space via a lumbar subarachnoid catheter and is usually managed in the outpatient clinic. It is a minimally invasive intervention and is often used for patients with complex and refractory LBP that has not responded to other forms of therapy. Home use of a 3L hand-held spinal pump is a new approach that involves educating the patient and caregiver to safely operate the pump at home. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this approach. The study will also evaluate patient outcomes, including pain reduction, functional improvement, and quality of life improvement. This study will enroll 30 subjects into the 3L hand-held spinal pump group and 30 subjects into the standard care control group. The follow-up duration for each subject will be 24 weeks. The study will be conducted in a university medical center in Thailand.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEfficacy and Safety of the 3L Hand-held Spinal Pump for Management of Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nLow Back Pain\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Three-liter hand-held spinal pump\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients aged 18-65 years Clinical diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis or sciatic nerve pain Radiological evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis or sciatic nerve",

Are there any other ideas for exclusion criteria? \nIntroduction:\nMotor control is essential for human movement. One factor that affects the ability to move is the strength of muscle contractions. It has been shown that muscle strength is reduced during prolonged contraction, which is a concern for individuals who need to generate a large amount of force for extended periods to perform daily activities. Fatigue has been shown to have negative effects on performance, motivation, and cognitive function in young, healthy males. This is particularly important for athletes and individuals with neurological disorders who rely on muscle strength to perform specific tasks. Fatigue-related muscle weakness can result in injuries and reduced performance, which can lead to decreased quality of life and increased health care expenses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of fatigue on isokinetic muscle strength and explosive strength in healthy young men. The study aims to assess the impact of fatigue on muscle strength and determine whether there is a correlation between muscle strength and performance after fatigue. This study will help us better understand the mechanisms underlying the decrease in muscle strength during fatigue and identify interventions to improve muscle strength and alleviate fatigue.\nObjective:\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of fatigue on isokinetic muscle strength and explosive strength in healthy young men.\nInclusion Criteria:\nThe study will enroll 20 healthy young men between the ages of 18 and 35.

Material and Methods: We conducted a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial in 90 patients to compare the efficacy of 20 mg of compounded papaverine, 10 mg of Caverject\u00ae and 0.5 mg of Regitine\u00ae injection, with placebo injection in ED patients, and to evaluate the safety of these treatments. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a satisfactory erection, defined as a score of 7 or better on the Erectile Function Domain scale (EF\u2010ED) score  of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Results: All participants received a total of four \u2010 injections during each of eight weeks of the double\u2010blind trial period. The incidence of treatment\u2010related serious adverse events was similar across the three treatment groups (pneumonia, 1 in the papaverine group; angina and myocardial infarction, 1 with Caverject and placebo).

The control group received 2 conventional 13\u2010mm diameter implants, and the study group received 1 wedge implant. The conventional 13\u2010mm diameter implants were inserted 10 mm apart, while the wedge implant was placed 2 mm closer to the midline. The primary outcome was the marginal bone level after 24 months. Secondary outcomes included implant stability indices, quality of life measurements, and clinical scores.RESULTS: After 24 months, no statistically significant differences in marginal bone loss (\u20100.09 + 0.17 mm and \u20100.09 + 0.21 mm; p = 0.99) and plaque index score (0.09 + 0.13 versus 0.09 + 0.17; p = 0.84) were observed between the 2 groups.

The study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. \nMethods:\n48 patients(35 men, 13 women) with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction from August 2017 to August 2020 in Wonju Severance Christian Hospital were studied. All patients visited a medical center at least once a year for routine follow-up after initial diagnosis. Patients without hospital admission related to heart failure, who participated in cardiac rehabilitation on at least one occasion during a follow-up period due to heart failure related symptoms such as dyspnea or fatigue, were considered as the CR group(n=25, 52.0%), whereas those who failed to participate in any CR program (did not receive any rehabilitation exercise) (n=23, 48.0%) were considered as the non-CR group.\nThe primary outcome measurement was the changes in 6-minute walking distance(6MWD) between the baseline and the end of the study. The 6MWT assessed symptomatic differences from dyspnea and fatigue, an objective measurement of exercise capacity, and clinical prognostication in patients with heart failure. Demographic and clinical characteristics such as age, gender, medical history of diabetes mellitus(DM) and hypertension(HTN), NYHA functional class, LVEF, E/e' ratio, echocardiographic data, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), treatment modality, initial and final 6MWD were collected from medical records. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the independent impact of cardiac rehabilitation(CR) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Statistical significance was determined at a P-value of less than 0.05. The analysis was",

Aim of the study The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of UI in our clinic and to assess the impact of intracavernosal injection on UI symptoms. Patients and methods This a randomized double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, multicenter trial was conducted in male patients with ED in the urology clinics of the faculty of medicine of the Palestinian Arab University. Between January 2015 and March 2016, 200 patients suffering from ED were included in the study. The patients were randomized equally into three groups: Group A received intracavernosal therapy for 6 consecutive weeks, Group B was given placebo, and no treatment was given to Group C. Patients were assessed at baseline, and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was the development of UI symptoms. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction, quality of life (QoL), and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire. Results There were no significant differences between the 3 groups in age, duration of ED, prior ED treatment, and baseline IIEF score. Overall, there was a statistically significant decrease in baseline IIEF scores after treatment. Only 33 patients developed urinary leakage while using the active therapy. Two patients (33.3%) in Group A developed UI symptoms, and one of the patients in Group A underwent urethroplasty. The mean UI symptom score was lower than baseline in the control and place",

Minimal invasive access techniques using a percutaneous approach may represent an attractive alternative to the open thigh technique. However, a number of issues remain to be addressed, including: 1/ the lack of long term data regarding the durability of this type of access technique 2/ in many cases a femoral artery anatomy unsuitable for such an approach still exists; 3/ the ability to use a femoral artery with anatomical features of less than 2mm (anatomy of the distal portion of the femoral artery) or 5mm (anatomy of the proximal portion of the femoral artery) 4/ difficult entry and progression of femoral endografts 5/ the use of a distal anastomosis in cases of severe tortuosity of the popliteal artery. The objective of this study is to assess the early and late performance of the percutaneous approach for access using TransVascular EndoAortic Technique (TEVAR) technology compared to the traditional surgical approach in patients undergoing elective surgery for aortoiliac or bifurcation aortic disease. PRESENT PROBLEMS: Currently, the preferred conduit for femorotibial graft harvesting is via an open thigh approach. However, this technique is known to be associated with: poorer patient quality of life (QoL) following surgery, high postoperative morbidity including the need for blood transfusions and the requirement for general ana",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical utility of fibrotest\u00ae and hyaluronic acid levels (HA) as biomarkers for hepatotoxicity induced by OIMs in patients with IBD. Methods: This was a nationwide multicenter registry including 264 biological\u2010na\u00efve anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (antiTNF)\u2010treated adult patients scheduled for first\u2010line adalimumab or infliximab treatment without OIMs. Fibrotest results and HA levels were available for 221 patients.

The group assigned to the intervention arm will receive telephone\u2010based education on the prevention of pain recurrence, functional capacity, medication recommendations, and self\u2010awareness. The data collection will be carried out at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months, using self\u2010administered questionnaires for the collection of sociodemographic and clinical data, the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF\u201036), the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index, the Brief Pain Inventory, and the Impact of Deteriorating Health Status, among others.DISCUSSION: Low Back Pain is one of the most widespread musculoskeletal conditions worldwide, which results in high healthcare costs. There is no evidence about the effectiveness of educational programmes in improving patients' wellbeing and quality of life. These measures, combined with the functional status of LBP, will give us a more complete health profile and will allow us to compare their impact over time. If the results of this research are positive, an education programme could serve as a model and resource for primary care facilities, and it could be used to improve primary care management.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT04638634.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nTo this day, it has become evident that low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent condition that represents a public health issue worldwide",

In this study, 3585 subjects from the Epidemiological Survey of Periodontal Diseases in Nara Prefecture, Japan were selected using the randomized method. OHRQoL was measured using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). Oral hygiene behavior was classified into \"good\" and \"inadequate\" when the score was \u226560 and <60, respectively, according to Japanese criteria. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the variables associated with the presence or absence of edentulism in addition to gender, age and the absence of dentures, among other confounding factors. Of the 3585 subjects, 2220 were \"good\" in oral hygiene. In the logistic regression model, a GOHAI score of \u226560 was associated with the absence of dentures, education level of \u2265junior high school, absence of hypertension and higher socioeconomic class. We concluded that an improved GOHAI score was associated with regular dental hygiene and the absence of dentures.",

However, the optimum volume of the drug or sterile fluid is still unknown. Using the lateral patellofemoral (LF) compartment as the index of pressure, we sought out to determine, in subjects presenting for diagnostic knee arthroscopy, the effect of injecting variable volumes of bupivacaine or saline on intracompartmental pressure and the relationship of pressure to the volume injected. This prospective, randomized controlled trial included 36 volunteers aged 18\u201080 years old with oligo/symptomatic LF arthritis undergoing knee arthroscopy without portal placement or any other surgical intervention. The LF space was accessed with a spinal needle inserted under fluoroscopic guidance. Randomization of either 20 mL saline (group 1) or 20 mL bupivacaine (group 2) was carried out after baseline arthroscopy of the LF compartment. For this preliminary study, a larger volume (40 mL) was tested after arthroscopic debridement, but without subsequent portal placement or intraarticular injection. In group 1 subjects, arthroscopy of LF compartment was performed before injection of the solution and the average pressure of the LF space was recorded, with maximum pressure measurements of the lateral knee recorded before and after injection. After injection of 20 mL fluid, the arthroscopic joint space was re\u2010evaluated and intracameral LF pressures were recorded. This was also performed after injection of 40 mL fluid. At the conclusion of the case, an unblinded arthroscopist assessed the visual clarity of the lateral joint space. Mean intracameral pressure in the LF compartment (mm Hg) before the saline injection was similar to pre\u2010injection measurements (28.0% vs. 26.2%). After injection of 20 mL saline, the post\u2010injection pressure was similar to pre\u2010injection",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost\u2010effectiveness of an occupational health screening program for cocaine use compared to the current approach using standard urinalysis. METHODS: We conducted a decision\u2010analytic cost\u2010effectiveness model based on retrospectively collected employee drug\u2010testing data from December 2008 to September 2009 in a large Midwestern health system. Cases were randomly assigned to cohort C (n = 66) screened with standard urinalysis only and cohort OH (n = 44) screened with additional oral fluid cocaine testing for patients receiving standard urinalysis. Patients were excluded if they refused drug testing, were not working at that time, or were employed at another site not covered by the insurance. In the model, each cohort underwent testing every quarter (every 90 days), depending on job category. Modeling was conducted from a payer's perspective and was divided into 2 primary scenarios. In addition to annual medical expenses, potential productivity losses due to absenteeism and presenteeism were considered. RESULTS: Cocaine users with positive test results for urinalysis and oral fluid testing incurred similar annual medical costs in cohort OH compared to cohort C ($3,876.43 and $3,872.95, respectively). The incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to compare the cost of cocaine detection in cohorts C and OH. As compared to cohort C, the ICER for cohort OH was $101,070.05 per annual medical cost. The overall effectiveness of screening with oral fluid cocaine testing was a relative risk reduction of 63.6%, with an average of 1.91 fewer days missed from work by patients in cohort OH. CONCLUSION: Cocaine use poses a significant public health concern and presents challenges in the workplace. Oral fluid cocaine testing is a potential alternative to current standard of urine drug testing. Although the initial cost of adding",

Our hypothesis is that higher baseline serum galectin\u20103 levels are associated with shorter overall survival (OS), progression\u2010free survival (PFS), and time to treatment failure (TTF). We present a pilot study conducted at Aichi Cancer Institute to test this hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2019 and September 2020, 45 patients were enrolled. All patients had newly diagnosed advanced mRCC treated with first\u2010line TKIs. This study was not originally registered in a public trial registry; only registration is planned and underway. Baseline blood sampling was required before the start of treatment. Immunohistochemical staining for galectin\u20103 was performed using the tissue microarray of primary mRCC tissue. OS, PFS, TTF, and the time from TKI treatment for each patient were recorded. Associations between baseline serum galectin\u20103 level and clinical outcomes was assessed by Kaplan\u2010Meier and log\u2010rank tests. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were eligible for data analysis (34 men, median age 69 years; range, 42\u201085 years). All patients received sunitinib or pazopanib. In the first half of the series (n = 20) there were 7 deaths, 1 complete response, 7 progressive disease (PD), and 3 PR. In the second half of the series (n = 20) there were 8 deaths, 5 PD, and 5 PR.

What are your thoughts on excluding patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise testing? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nAlthough anecdotal, it has been previously observed that patients with a history of adverse reactions to previous exercise tests may experience severe adverse reactions to subsequent exercises. Therefore, patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise testing were classified in an Exclusion group. Among patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise tests, the study population will consist of patients who had previously undergone exercise testing using ECG, in addition to those who have not received previous exercise tests. As there is no previous work reporting the prognosis of patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise tests, these patients will be compared with patients who have not previously undergone exercise tests to confirm that they do not have a poor prognosis. Therefore, in the future, it will be possible to expand the indication for exercise testing to patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise tests.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nExercise stress test (SST) is a standard method for detecting ischemia by applying treadmill or bike exercise or coronary catheter injection exercise in addition to the imaging study. Therefore, in patients without an indication for coronary angiography, it is a relatively easy and safe study method to determine whether SST or coronary CT angiography is appropriate. In the case of patients without an indication for coronary angiography, if patients without heart disease have a positive test result during stress exercise (positive cardiac stress test), they are referred to a cardiologist, and if heart disease is determined, there is a high possibility of ischemia or acute heart failure leading to myocardial infarction or arrhythmia. If patients with a history of adverse reactions to SST wish to undergo SST, they may undergo SST using a catheter or coronary intravascular injection, but the test result is generally positive. Therefore, we assume a high risk of cardiac events in patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise test.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nComparison of Mortality and Card",

Primary endpoints were freedom from stent thrombosis at 30 days and angiographic success. Results: Mean age of the study patients was 62.4 \u00b1 5.2 years. Most were men (76.5%) with single\u2010vessel disease (52.9%). Both groups contained patients with a complex stenotic lesion (Bentall class C type 1: 5 with CADSI and 4 with standard of care). There were no significant differences between the two groups in demographic characteristics, lesion complexity or primary outcomes. All patients in both groups had successful stent placement and did not experience any major adverse events (MAEs) at 30 days. Overall, there was significantly higher angiographic success in the CADSI group compared to conventional stenting (93.8% vs 77.8%). Conclusions: CADSI\u2010guided stent placement is safe and effective in the setting of elective percutaneous coronary interventions. While larger randomized controlled trials are needed to determine efficacy and cost efficacy of this technique, CADSI\u2010guided stent placement appears to improve angiographic outcomes and should be considered as a promising alternative to conventional techniques.",

To date, no studies have explored the relationship between iron and fractures in elderly Chinese women.METHODS: This study aimed to prospectively investigate the link between serum ferritin and the risk of major fractures among elderly women in southern China. Participants in this prospective study were recruited from the Sun Yat\u2010sen University Cancer Center. Participants completed a questionnaire addressing sociodemographic characteristics and other lifestyle factors, and were followed up until December 4, 2019. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of fractures according to the serum ferritin.RESULTS: Of the 1027 women, 694 (67.6%) had a blood test, and 116 (16.1%) women developed at least one major fracture during the follow\u2010up. Of those with fractures, 79 (68.0%) had osteoporotic fractures, including 29 (25.0%) hip fractures and 7 (6.0%) non\u2010vertebral and vertebral fractures. The multivariate\u2010adjusted HR of major and any fracture was significantly increasing with the increase of serum ferritin (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.08, P\u2010trend = 0.003; HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.04, P\u2010trend = 0.002, respectively).

This project, funded by the US Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, developed a measure of pain\u2010related outcomes in subjects with neck pain who do not have other neurological or musculoskeletal conditions. Two hundred and fifty\u2010nine subjects meeting the inclusion criteria completed this project. The resulting PNSNS Pain\u2010Related Functional Disability (PRFD) index includes 5 subscales (physical, emotional, cognitive, sleep, self\u2010rated health), each comprising 3\u20104 items. Each item is rated using a 6\u2010point scale indicating the degree of problem experienced over the past week (1 = not at all; 6 = very much). The overall PRFD score is derived by summing the subscale item scores (range 0\u201051). The measure has a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85). The measure also has good construct validity, showing significant correlations with other relevant measures of disability (e.g., Neck Disability Index; r = 0.82, P < 0.001) and measures of depression, pain intensity, and pain interference (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory\u2010II; r = 0.53, P < 0.001; visual analog scale; r = 0.57, P < 0.001, and Pain and Disability Scale; r = 0.57, P < 0.001). The PRFD score demonstrates an association with pain intensity and interference with ADL (beta = 0.57; P < 0.001 and beta = 0.56; P < 0.001, respectively) even after adjustment for potential confounding variables (e.g., age, education, and depression).

We evaluated the effect of TMP\u2010SMX on mucosal transmission of HIV in a nonrandomized, open\u2010label, placebo\u2010controlled double\u2010blind HIV\u2010risk reduction study conducted in serodiscordant mixed sexual partnerships. Seventy\u2010five sexually active, HIV\u2010infected males were randomly assigned to either a placebo or TMP\u2010SMX group; all had a matched seronegative partner. In the double\u2010blind step, participants were followed for 12 months at 3\u2010monthly intervals when they received either TMP\u2010SMX or placebo without partner notification. In the open\u2010label step, sexually active participants received long\u2010term TMP\u2010SMX prophylaxis for the next 18 months, while participants with unidentified partners were referred for partner notification. Seronegative female partners were followed at 1\u2010monthly intervals to document HIV transmission. Eight cases of HIV transmission were observed (7/20 (35%) in the placebo arm versus 1/15 (6.7%) in the TMP\u2010SMX arm), translating to an estimated protection rate of 80.7% (95% CI, \u201022% to 95%). We estimate that this corresponded to an impact on risk of HIV transmission of 23.7% (95% CI, \u201053.9% to 56.7%), although wider confidence intervals are likely given that the primary analysis was not a randomized comparison. TMP\u2010SMX\u2010based HIV interventions for male discordant couples could be a valuable tool in the prevention of HIV transmission and disease in communities where antiretroviral therapy is not widely available. We believe that large trials, including studies of nonmale\u2010male couple relationships, are justified and could have a major impact on the HIV/AIDS",

Background: Cases of gastro esophageal reflux (GERD) due to eosinophil esophagitis (EoE) are not uncommon and the condition is difficult to diagnose, as standard laboratory and diagnostic approaches may not be sufficient, particularly in cases of mild disease or those with atypical symptoms. Endoscopic evaluation has a moderate yield. In cases without endoscopic or histologic features of EoE, patients with unexplained GERD symptoms or atypical symptoms should be considered for high\u2010resolution esophageal manometry (HREM). 2. Objectives: To demonstrate the usefulness of HREM in identifying cases of subclinical EoE in patients that otherwise appear to have a diagnosis of GERD, either based on symptom or endoscopic appearance alone. 3. Methods: A retrospective chart review at a tertiary care medical center between April 2012 and June 2015 was performed for patients that had undergone HREM, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and biopsy for dyspeptic symptoms for which they were otherwise felt to have reflux disease. EoE was diagnosed and classified based on criteria set by the 2011 clinical guideline established by the Physician\u2010Based Association of Gastroesophageal Diseases (PAGI). The diagnosis of esophageal eosinophilia associated with reflux (EER) was made if the esophageal mucosa demonstrated >70 eosinophils/500 power field, but less than 15 eosinophils/500 power field, based on the modified Cincinnati consensus on EoE. The diagnosis of non\u2010eosinophilic EER (NEEER) was made if 0 to 65 eosinophils were found in the epithelium and histologic features of GERD were found, such as reflux esophagitis, gastric fund",

We recorded 2 to 4 hours of audio and conducted individual interviews with patients on care and the characteristics of their diseases. The data were interpreted through constant comparative analysis. We identified 5 main categories: 1) information about a better death; 2) anxiety about the time of death; 3) the need for comfort during death; 4) the importance of the communication between the patient and the team; and 5) the need for autonomy and the ability to choose for the end stage. There is a positive relationship between the death trajectory and the need to communicate with the team.

Twenty\u2010six patients were allocated to receive treatment with either sodium fluoride slurry or an artificial sodium fluoride foam in the clinical study. This was a multicentre clinical trial that followed up with the patients for 15 months after therapy began. The debit of 10% sodium fluoride was started immediately in the treatment side at the baseline. After drying the surface, the 10% foam was applied to the treatment side and held in place for 90 s for 6 days a week for three months. The 31 patients (Group I) had an initial 50% sodium fluoride slurry rinse for 30 s and then used the rinse for 4 weeks. After drying the surface, the 10% foam application was then applied for 90 s for 6 days a week for three additional months (Group II). After three months, the percentage of root surface loss was lower for the 50% slurry compared to the 10% foam (p = 0.308). At the end of the study, a reduction of approximately 20% was found in the root coverage at sites between 1.5 and 5.0 mm. A tendency to relapse (10 mm) was found during the third month of follow\u2010up in the 10% foam group when the mean scores of the two sub\u2010groups were compared. However, no difference in relapse rate was observed between the 50% slurry and the 10% foam groups.",

The primary outcome measure was complete resolution of symptoms and signs of blepharoconjunctivitis within 48 hours. Additional endpoints included timepoint of complete resolution and resolution of predefined symptoms, signs, and associated findings.RESULTS: Sequential 2\u2010day treatment resulted in high efficacy (97.2%) in treating adult subjects with signs and symptoms of staphylococcul blepharoconjunctivitis and, for pediatric patients, was nearly identical to that achieved with 4\u2010day therapy (98.5%). Among eyes meeting all primary criteria for the diagnosis of staphylococcal blepharoconjunctivitis, efficacy was again similar (97.0% and 97.2%, respectively). Timepoints of resolution of signs and symptoms were similar in both groups: 10 hours and day 2, respectively, with all resolutions being by day 14 (87.9% to 98.4%).

Furthermore, increasing concentrations of cTnI are associated with a higher number of myocardial ischemic events. However, it is unclear whether cTnI predicts major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) irrespective of known CAD. Aims: To evaluate whether cTnI predicts 6\u2010month MACE independent of CAD in stable patients referred to nuclear pharmacological stress test. Methods: Patients were referred to adenosine stress echocardiography. All patients had a normal or aborted exercise electrocardiogram on a maximal tolerance test and with no clinical evidence of acute coronary syndrome. Adenosine stress echocardiography and pharmacological blood sample were obtained within 30 minutes after stopping adenosine infusion. Patients with known CAD were excluded. MACE included death, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina within approximately 6 months of the study. Results: A total of 244 patients were included for analysis. Of these, 81 patients developed MACE during the 6\u2010month follow\u2010up period. Patients with increased cTnI (>0.03 ng/mL) had a significantly higher odds of experiencing MACE compared to patients with normal cTnI (0.03\u20100.14 ng/mL: adjusted OR 2,11; 95%CI 1.13\u20103.93). A cTnI cut\u2010off value >0.04 ng/mL had the highest sensitivity (0.66) and specificity (0.79) to predict MACE. However, there were no differences between the 3 groups in the rate of hospitalization for chest pain (0.03\u20100.04 ng/mL vs 0.04\u20100.14 ng/mL vs >0.14 ng/mL: adjusted OR 0.7",

However, adherence to recommended activities is challenging, and knee pain and fatigue may impede participation. This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a goal\u2010paced activity program improved adherence to a home\u2010based exercise program for OA of the hip/knee. A post hoc secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial was performed in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group (combination of behavioral goal setting and tailored feedback and home\u2010based exercise) or a control group (home\u2010based exercise only). Participants were assessed at baseline, after 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The study's primary goal was to determine the extent to which an intervention focused on goal\u2010paced activities (GPA) affected adherence to a 4\u2010week home\u2010based exercise intervention. Three hundred and twenty patients were included for the primary analysis. The primary outcome was adherence (number of completed sessions) after 4 week, measured by GPA. Adherence to GPA was compared before and after the intervention, and between the intervention and control groups using t\u2010tests for paired samples. Thirty\u2010four (34) participants dropped out during the study.

In addition to the growing demand for clinical services, there are more difficulties in managing the elderly, such as the occurrence of delirium. There is a need to establish a new geriatric emergency management system. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of geriatric triage in emergency departments among different age groups with different types of care in elderly patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was designed to enroll participants from March 2017 to February 2019 using a random number generator. An electronic emergency triage system based on the emergency severity index was developed. The emergency severity index points of age\u2010stratified patients and scores, vital signs, and laboratory examinations were obtained. We assessed the age and gender distributions of patients. We also explored the correlations of age and gender with emergency severity index points, vital signs, and laboratory examinations in order to evaluate the differences in the types of care needed among age groups. Results: The results of the study included 47,050 patients divided by the emergency severity index into the following age groups: 5\u201059 years (Group 1; n=17,817 patients), 60\u201069 years (Group 2; n=13,866 patients), 70\u201079 years (Group 3; n=8715 patients), and 80 years and older (Group 4; n=6752 patients). Conclusion: Older age was linked with an increase in emergency severity index scores, vital signs, and laboratory examinations. Furthermore, there were substantial distinctions in the type of care needed in each age group. These findings have important implications for emergency care for elderly patients.",

It can be a painful and disabling condition and is treated quite successfully in most cases by one or more of four treatments: exercise, acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol), topical oral medications, or NSAIDs (e.g. Ibuprofen, Naproxen, etc). Exercise therapy has been demonstrated to be as effective as other therapies but most patients are not willing to engage in a dedicated exercise program. Acetaminophen is less effective than NSAIDs and has been shown to be no more effective than a placebo. Topical oral medications are somewhat less effective than NSAIDs given orally but still more effective than placebo and do not have the side effects that NSAIDs may cause. However, the vast majority of physicians in North America, Australia, and Europe prescribe NSAIDs for patients with OAK. It is not clear if NSAIDs are more efficacious than topical oral medications and/or acetaminophen so this study aims to answer that question. Patients with moderate to severe OAK will be randomized (like flipping a coin) 1:1 ratio to topical oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or placebo. Patients will have an injection into the back of their knee to cause inflammation and to see if NSAIDs or the placebo have an effect on inflammation (with MRI scans) to determine which is better. Patients will also complete questionnaires",

With the correct methodology and follow-up, patients recover quickly and can return to their usual activities. Therefore, mOAT is a frequent diagnosis among physiotherapists.1 This clinical picture is most frequently due to external trauma,2 and usually, there is bone and cartilage (chondral) damage, which is why it is often defined as osteochondral fracture of the talus (OCF). Nevertheless, this injury is not exclusive to external trauma and causes of mOAT that are linked to overuse may be due to previous injuries in the ankle joint, inadequate posture and excessive loading, especially in sport such as gymnastics, basketball, or dance.3 In order to assess the effectiveness of treatment in patients with mOAT, a review of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Pubmed, and The Cochrane Library. The search was conducted between January 2017 and December 2021, including only papers in medical English. The key words used were osteochondral, mOAT, and lateral ankle sprain. A total of 347 papers were found, of which nine were studies with patients under 35 years of age with a mOAT diagnosis. A recent Cochrane Review on the management of ankle joint trauma highlighted the effectiveness of physiotherapy programs and highlighted the importance of strengthening the lower limb during the rehabilitation process.4 The authors of this review found 22 randomized controlled trials and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of different physiotherapy techniques due to the heterogeneity of the interventions that were evaluated as well as their limited",

However, there is limited knowledge regarding their efficacy in school settings. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the Fast ForWord training program for reading in children with ASD in the school setting. METHODS: A group of 14 children with ASD aged 5\u201010 years was recruited from five randomly selected school centers and randomly assigned to an intervention group or a waiting control group. The intervention group received 36 hours of the Fast ForWord training program. The waiting control group received standard academic intervention. All participants underwent pre\u2010 and post\u2010treatment testing on a one\u2010to\u2010one basis and were administered a standardized reading test and a parent questionnaire. RESULTS: A significant improvement in word attack and reading comprehension was observed in the trained group compared to the waiting control group. No significant improvement in reading fluency, spelling, reading speed, or letter knowledge was observed in the trained group compared to the waiting control group. CONCLUSIONS: The Fast ForWord training program effectively improved word attack and reading comprehension skills in children with ASD. The improvements in reading skills may benefit children with ASD.",

Patients with OSA may experience various symptoms, such as snoring, daytime sleepiness, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The most effective treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. However, some patients may find it challenging to tolerate CPAP therapy due to discomfort or disrupted sleep. Oral appliance therapy (OAT) is an alternative treatment for mild to moderate OSA that uses a custom-fit oral device to keep the airway open during sleep. The O2Vent Optima oral appliance is a popular device that has been shown to be effective in reducing OSA symptoms. The ExVent accessory is a new accessory that can be used in combination with the O2Vent Optima oral appliance to provide additional stability and support to the tongue and soft palate during sleep. The ExVent accessory is made of a soft-textured silicone material and is designed to fit comfortably over the upper and lower teeth. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the ExVent accessory when used in combination with the O2Vent Optima oral appliance in participants with mild to moderate OSA.

What are your thoughts on this criterion? \nAbstract:\nPurpose: To evaluate the efficacy of the ExVent accessory in reducing daytime sleepiness for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treated with the O2Vent Optima device. Methods: This is a randomized, single\u2010centre, single\u2010blinded, crossover, multi\u2010arm clinical trial at a US sleep disorders centre in patients with OSA. The ExVent accessory is a disposable disposable accessory that can be inserted into the O2Vent Optima device to reduce the pressure needed to treat apneas. In this study, the participants used the O2Vent Optima device without and with the ExVent accessory, in random order, at home for two nights each. Participants also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale before and after each night of study participation. The statistical significance of the difference in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score between the two nights was evaluated. A significant reduction in the overall Epworth Sleepiness Scale score indicates a better outcome. Results: The participants in this study include 10 males and 5 females. The average age of the participants is 55. The average apnea hypopnea index is 29 before treatment with O2Vent Optima device without ExVent accessory, and 23 after treatment with O2Vent Optima device without ExVent accessory or vice versa. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores are 7.1\u00b14.7 and 6.41\u00b14.8 during the baseline condition and ExVent condition without statistical significance. The overall Epworth Sleepiness Scale score had a tendency to decrease with treatment of O2Vent Optima with ExVent accessory. Conclusion: The ExVent accessory had no statistical significance of improvement of daytime sleepiness in this study. We believe that the ExVent accessory may be useful in patients who have a high level of daytime sleepiness, as well as with the",

Anal dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition, causing considerable patient discomfort. It might even affect patient's quality of life. Clinicians frequently use topical corticosteroids, which play an important role in its treatment. However, these medications are usually associated with side effects, including irritancy and bleeding after toilet use. There is also a risk of dependency, and inadequate control of disease can result in relapse. Occlusives can provide a physical barrier to protect the damaged epithelium from incontinence, as well as help to reduce inflammation and itching. Therefore, the ointment based on beeswax would provide a better protection to skin barrier in the treatment of anal dermatitis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSkin at the perianal region is the most susceptible to dermatitis at any age. Anal dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition, which might be acute or chronic. It may manifest as simple pruritus, or more seriously as fissures. Anal dermatitis might even affect patient quality of life. Clinicians frequently use topical corticosteroids, which play an important role in its treatment. However, these medications are usually associated with side effects, including irritancy and bleeding after toilet use. There is also a risk of dependency, and inadequate control of disease can result in relapse. Besides, some patients may have adverse drug reactions, such as systemic absorption of corticosteroids, or development of local steroid acne. Occlusive therapy combined with topical steroid treatment can help patients avoid repeated inflammation and scarring after healing. The present prospective, open-label, randomized, single center, controlled study was designed to test a new skin-protectant ointment containing a combination of glycerin, dexpanthenol, and beeswax formulated to promote wound healing",

However, its application can lead to severe tissue trauma, leaving unpredictable and lasting marks. There is paucity of literature documenting outcomes of the treatment, especially from low\u2010 and medium\u2010income regions of India. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of dermabrasion in treating moderate to severe nodules or cysts as well as post\u2010inflammatory hyperpigmentation and atrophic acne scars. Methods: Fifty\u2010five patients of both genders, aged between 13 and 55 years, were included in the study at a private dermatology clinic. Subjects were recruited after meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An informed consent was obtained and demographic data were collected. Subjects were divided based on the anatomical site of lesion to be treated, gender, and the type of lesion being treated. Dermabrasion was performed on nodular, cystic, and scarred skin lesions using aluminium oxide particles at three grades of abrasion using 60, 100, and 150 microns. Each treatment was provided once weekly. The lesions were assessed based on their response to treatment using the physician and patient global assessment scale (PGAS) on a monthly basis for 3 months. Results: After three months, the post\u2010procedural skin was found to be of an even colour with the majority of patients responding positively in terms of improved colour and texture of the skin. There was a significant decrease in the number of lesions with an improvement in the grade as compared to baseline. Conclusion: Based on the improvement in the number of lesions and overall improvement after 3 months of treatment, it can be concluded that dermabrasion is quite effective in treating moderate to severe nodules or cysts and post\u2010inflammatory hyperpigmentation and can be performed regularly at a fraction of the cost of",

Methods: We screened hospitalized patients with IgM deposits from 2016 to 2019, and clinical data were collected. A total of 800 patients with IgM deposits met our inclusion criteria. We divided the patients into three regions: 1) central region; 2) eastern region; and 3) western region. We compared the proportion of clinical manifestations, histopathological changes, treatment methods, and remission rates (primary remission, complete response, and partial response) in these regions. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to explore the factors related to renal prognosis. Results: There was no significant difference in the baseline data of patients in the three regions (P > 0.05). The overall primary remission and complete response rates were 27.5% and 9.14%, respectively. The primary remission and complete response rates between the regional populations were significantly different (P < 0.001). The 5\u2010year survival rate of the eastern region was significantly higher than that of the western region (P < 0.05). A total of 263 risk factors (57%) were identified by univariate analysis.

In general, for 70% of STS patients surgery is the initial treatment of choice, but for a substantial number adjuvant radiotherapy is applied due to high local recurrence rates that have been observed after purely surgical management. It is not possible for the treating physician to assess the radiotherapy benefit of different soft tissue tumor patients, because the response rate is low (< 15%) and no molecular classifiers are available.\nIt therefore is our objective to use NGS and an integrated bioinformatic pipeline to analyze molecular biomark",

Eligible patients will be assigned at random, to a R-PFS group (radiation dose > 54 Gy) or to a PFS group (radiation dose <= 54 Gy). Patients will be assessed for prognostic and predictive relevance of immune checkpoints and TCR signatures in resectable soft tissue sarcomas by gene expression analysis of primary and metastatic biopsies at diagnosis, on post-surgical resection specimen and on locally progressing tumor. In addition, the presence of clonal T cells will be analyzed with multimarker immunohistochemistry of primary and metastatic tumors, also evaluating intratumoral CD8 T cell activity through multiplex in situ hybridization immunoanalysis of CD8, MSH1, MSH2, PARP1.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvaluation of Immunogenic Signatures for Prediction of Radiation Sensitivity in Soft Tissue Sarcomas\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nSoft Tissue Sarcoma, Sarcoma, Connective Tissue, Leiomyosarcoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure: Biopsy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients eligible for R-PFS or PFS surgical resection, based on the ASTRO/ESSO/ENTSO-E guidelines for non-operable patients, with planned chemotherapy for non-r-PFS patients Patients willing and able to sign written informed consent Exclusion Criteria: Pregnant patient Patient who are breastfeeding Patient unable to provide informed consent",

In the international phase II study SHARP (sorafenib vs. sorafenib and rapamycin - SHARP), the combination of TRAIL and sorafenib resulted in a greater benefit on survival for patients than sorafenib alone in a population of cirrhotic patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. A confirmatory Phase III clinical trial (SHARP) is in progress to assess TRAIL added to SOF (sorafenib) and assess its safety and efficacy compared to SOF alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis. The PREVIER trial, therefore, is an exploratory, prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, observational study, intended to investigate the use of TRAIL combined with SOF for the first time in the routine clinical setting in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to estimate the safety of the addition of TRAIL to SOF (sorafenib) according to the frequency and intensity of adverse events. The secondary objectives are to document its efficacy as well as its effect on quality of life. Study objectives: To describe the frequency and severity of adverse events. To describe the overall survival of patients. To measure the changes in the quality of life of patients (Quality-of-Life and SF-36 questionnaires). To describe the evolution of biomarkers (liver function parameters, blood counts) Design: Prospective non-comparative study of an observational nature: no control group. Recruitment: Patients with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis who have received TRAIL as part of the SHARP clinical trial as well as Sorafenib will be included. Follow-up: the study will have a minimum follow-up duration of 24 months. The date of inclusion and the date of death or last visit will be collected.

This will be measured by the rate of recurrence of H. pylori infection in both groups at 12 months from baseline. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of both probiotics over the same period of time based on the rates of adverse events and to also evaluate the acceptability of the treatment and quality of life in both groups of patients. This study will be conducted in Australia.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy of two formulations of probiotics against a placebo for the prevention of Helicobacter pylori infection recurrence after standard treatment eradication. The probiotics for the study are two enteric-coated products (strain of L-carnitine, H-pylori antagonists, DGL-acid) called Eraviv and Probioviv, manufactured by Probiotix Ltd (South Australia). The placebo formulation will contain the same excipients as the probiotics. Patients will be randomized into three groups: probiotic A (Eraviv), probiotic B (Probioviv) or placebo. Randomization will be done using randomization software such as Stata (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA).

Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed? \nAlzheimer's Detection\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all cases. A large proportion of the cost in treatment of Alzheimer's disease relates to costs for long-term care as the disease progresses. For this reason, early detection of the disease has a significant impact on the patient outcomes, in particular preventing permanent placement in long-term facilities. Additionally, early detection enables early diagnosis through intervention, better treatment options, and better education for families with a loved one with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2008, a clinical practice guideline on how-to diagnose patients for early Alzheimer's disease was published (QI, 2008). However, primary care physicians (PCP's) seldom use these recommendations or order cognitive testing of their patients. Most cognitive testing is done exclusively by neurologists due to a lack of training on how to determine who should be tested and how to interpret the test results. This practice needs to be changed by educating primary care nurses on basic memory assessment skills and how to conduct cognitive screening in office. If the primary care setting could perform cognitive testing for Alzheimer's disease, it could impact the outcome of patients immensely. A study was done in 2011 by Alzheimer's Disease Association to determine how many patients with memory complaints were not referred to a neurologist for assessment or were sent to neurology with no diagnostic assessment done (Pearce et al., 2011). It was found that 47% of patients with memory complaints were not referred to a specialist, with follow up only to determine if the patient was on any psychotropic medications. Another study was done at Yale New Haven Hospital (Giannini et al., 2013) in 2013 and found that only 7% of patients referred to PCP's for cognitive concerns received any evaluation, with 74% of those tests ordered by the PCP being of the neuropsychological type.

The study is designed as an open-labelled, single-center, two-arm, prospective, parallel and randomized controlled study.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nIn the present study, the investigators want to investigate the lung ventilation perfusion (V/Q) difference to study early proning effect in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients undergoing PPV. According to the mechanical ventilation setting of patients, the investigators will divide the patients into V/Q mismatch group and V/Q matching group. Then, the investigators will conduct the early supine-prone-supine switch on 20 ARDS patients in each group. The investigators will measure the V/Q values, arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2), Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the three positions, and the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) changes. Then, the investigators will estimate the changes of ventilation-perfusion match before and after proning in ARDS patients, and explore the possibility of early proning in patients with V/Q mismatch-\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nTo Use Electrical Impedance Tomography to Explore the Possibility of Prone Positioning in Patients With Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) Mismatch in Early Stage\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: prone position ventilation\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: age>=18 years; patients with ARDS within 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation admission A history of COVID",

ACC is characterized by mutations within the kinase domain of KIT, which provides the rationale to study KIT inhibitors in ACC. Unfortunately, KIT inhibitors have shown limited single-agent activity in ACC patients. To date, the only approved and therapeutically effective drug combination for the treatment of ACC is ara-C based combination chemotherapy. However, there is no clear evidence that dual inhibition of the signaling pathway containing KIT and VEGFR2 has synergistic activity with standard ara-C chemotherapy. In this open label, non-randomized, phase I trial, combination therapy of dual target small molecule inhibitors (Sunitinib and Sorafenib) plus Ara-C with Mitomycin C will be investigated at 4 centers in Belgium. The first 6 patients included in the study will explore the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the regimen in patients with advanced metastatic/recurrent ACC. After identification of the RP2D, it will be tested in a cohort of at least 17 patients. The primary purpose of the trial is to assess the safety of dual KIT/VEGFR inhibition using Sunitinib and Sorafenib in combination with ara-C based combination chemotherapy in metastatic/recurrent ACC, and to assess the anti-tumor activity of this combination treatment. Furthermore, exploratory research will evaluate the pharmacogenomics of the KIT-mutation in the tumor to evaluate whether certain genomic profiles may predict either response or resistance in advanced metastatic/recurrent ACC.\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAlveolar Soft Part Sarcoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Sorafenib tosylate\n* Drug: Sunitinib malate\n* Drug:",

This criterion ensures that the study includes advanced patients who have received prior systemic therapies, representing a more difficult-to-treat population. By including such patients, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment in a real-world setting. \n\nAbstract:\nPURPOSE: This is a retrospective study to evaluate the effects and safety of pazopanib in the adjuvant treatment of resected stage II and IIIa melanoma without sentinel lymph node metastasis or in the neoadjuvant therapy. Materials and methods: We studied 55 patients with completely removed primary cutaneous melanomas from a dermatologic cancer center. A total of 36 patients had undergone neoadjuvant treatment with pazopanib to decrease the risk of lymph node metastasis. A total of 19 patients underwent adjuvant therapy due to histological characteristics such as high mitotic counts, lymphovascular invasion, and ulceration of the primary lesion to prevent the occurrence of distant metastasis. All study subjects received 800 mg/day of pazopanib for 2 year as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. RESULTS: In neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, no serious adverse events (grade \u2265 3) were observed. Lymph node downstaging occurred in one\u2010third of the neoadjuvant group. None of the patients showed a positive regional lymph node, and no distant metastasis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: 800 mg of pazopanib was well tolerated when used before and after radical surgery for primary cutaneous melanoma. The antimetastatic effect of 800 mg of pazopanib was clearly demonstrated in this study, although the number of enrolled patients was small and the follow\u2010up periods were short. Based on the results of the ongoing randomized clinical trials, neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy using MEK and CD137 inhibitors has been reported to be effective in preventing recurrence and metastasis.",

            "That makes sense. Now let's proceed to the next inclusion criterion. How about including patients with adequate organ function? Maintaining adequate organ function is crucial to ensure the safety of patients and to allow them to tolerate the treatment effectively. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: There is a growing recognition that patients with cancer may present with symptoms and/or impairments that influence their ability to participate in rehabilitation and physical health. However, these factors are not consistently reported in the context of rehabilitation and physical health assessment.OBJECTIVES: The objective was to explore the extent to which self\u2010reported symptoms and impairments are concurrently reported with the physical function of patients with cancer.METHODS: This study used data from an RCT (n = 246) in which cancer survivors underwent pre/post and 10\u2010week follow\u2010up assessments of symptoms and impairments using five validated questionnaires. Logistic regression models were used to determine the relative contributions of symptoms and impairments to the physical function of survivors.RESULTS: Acute symptoms and impairments were reported by 48% of the survivors while impairments were consistently correlated with physical function at every assessment. Physical symptoms were correlated with physical function within assessment. However, in the final model, the only significant predictors of self\u2010reported physical function were physical and cognitive impairments.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the impact of impairments on the self\u2010reported physical function of survivors suggesting that the assessment of impairments should be given greater consideration during rehabilitation and physical health assessments. Future studies would benefit from the use of structured interviews in order to more effectively identify and record physical and cognitive impairments for each patient.",

Objective: This study investigated whether DBT differentially impacts the onset and course of substance use disorders (SUDs) and general psychopathology. METHOD: The authors conducted a secondary examination of the 12 clinical sites participating in the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Research Clinical Data Collection Project and compared the course of participants who received DBT with those who received treatment as usual (TAU). Results: Although no significant differences were found between DBT and TAU at pre\u2010treatment, the DBT and TAU groups significantly differed at post\u2010treatment and follow\u2010up on DSM\u2010IV substance use disorder criteria and on the Brief Symptom Inventory total score, as well as on many of the individual symptom items.

It is now known that an esophagus with structural changes related to reflux has more severe symptoms and that in a high proportion of subjects who are not symptomatic, pH is in the normal range. As a consequence, esophageal high\u2010resolution manometry (HRM) is often performed for subjects who are suspected of having GERD. Although several studies have investigated the relationship between abnormalities detected by HRM and pH\u2010impaired acid clearance, they have not reached any firm conclusions. The hypothesis of the present study is that pHi < 3.4 on acid exposure testing (AET) is a strong predictor of abnormalities at HRM. To test this hypothesis, five groups of subjects were constituted from a group of 254 subjects with gastroesophageal reflux recorded by pH\u2010impaired clearance (Dor et al. 2011, Endoscopy 43: 1092\u20101097). Group I (n = 48) had normal pHi and pH monitoring (normal group); group II (n = 54) had normal pHi and pH monitoring (impaired acid clearance group); group III (n = 68) with both abnormal pHi ( < 3.4) and AET (impaired acid clearance group); group IV (n = 46) abnormal pHi and no pH monitoring (impaired pHi group); and group V (n = 42) had abnormal pHi but normal AET (abnormal pHi, normal AET group). The HRM parameters of each of these groups were compared. Group III (impaired acid clearance group) had significantly higher bolus distensibility (P < .001) (72.7 +/\u2010 7.3 mm3 vs 42.9 +/\u2010 7.1 mm3) and basal pressure (8.",

Although most cSDHs can be treated with conservative treatment, up to 30% cannot be successfully treated with conservative treatment, and these patients are considered for surgical or interventional treatment. Interventional treatment of cSDH with endovascular techniques has emerged as a non\u2010invasive and safe modality for cSDH evacuation since the 1990s. Materials and Methods: A total of 61 patients \u2265 60 years old admitted to our center with symptoms suspected of cSDH were evaluated, of whom 44 cases were found to have chronic subdural hygromma and 17 cases were found to have cSDH. In the CT group, 16 patients underwent conservative treatment, including 10 patients who were treated conservatively with drug infusion, 2 with puncture, and 5 with surgery. In the endoscopic group, 3 cases were treated under endoscopic guidance, and the recurrence rate was 0 %, there were 17 cases of endovascular treatment, including 11 cases in the microcatheter balloon dilation group and 6 cases in the coil embolization group; there were 3 cases of recurrence, all of which were embolized in the 2nd endovascular intervention.

The number of drinks and tablets used, and the number of drinks per drinking day were recorded in self\u2010reports on a daily basis for 28 days.RESULTS: The total number of drinks used by the MI group decreased from 63 to 52 and from 85 to 77 in the control groups for alcohol and benzodiazepine\u2010like drugs, respectively. A significant intergroup difference (P < .05) was found in the number of tablets and drinks used for benzodiazepine (P = .035) or alcohol (P = .037).

The trial team hypothesized that older adults receiving the behavioral activation intervention will show improvement in cognitive functioning and depression symptoms in comparison to those receiving the control condition of a psychoeducation intervention. The team will recruit 56 elderly participants with a diagnosis of mild-cognitive impairment or depressive symptoms. Half the participants will receive a three-session intervention targeting behavioral activation (BA) and the other half will receive a psychoeducational (PE) intervention. All participants will be assessed at baseline and three times, immediately after completing their respective interventions. The primary outcome measure will be change in cognitive functioning, depression symptoms, and functional capacity as measured by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III, Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Lawton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale. The team will also collect demographic and medical information, sleep quality, self and informant perceptions of depression, perceived stress, and social support. In addition, the secondary outcome measures will include a qualitative analysis of each group of participants' experiences receiving their respective intervention to assess what elements of the intervention worked well and potential unintended consequences. The study will allow the team to establish preliminary evidence for a follow-up, randomized controlled trial of a behavioral activation intervention in a larger sample size, as well as providing an opportunity to develop and pilot protocols for future research studies.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Feasibility and Acceptability Trial of a Behavioral Activation Intervention in Community-Dwelling Older Adults"

However, the role of CMR in detecting myocardial changes associated with long\u2010term COVID\u201019 symptoms, such as fatigue, is not fully understood. The prognosis of patients with long\u2010term COVID\u201019 symptoms remains unclear. Methods: A prospective observational study of patients with fatigue (n = 24) over 12 months was conducted to describe the longitudinal changes of myocardial contrast (MC) and myocardial strain ratio (SR) after COVID\u201019. CMR images were obtained from 24 patients (median age, 60.2 \u00b1 3.8 years; 66.67% female) who were admitted due to abnormalities in electrocardiography. Patients underwent CMR examinations undergoing gadolinium. We evaluated M\u2010S using a myocardial contrast medium and analyzed longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain (SR) by circumferential short\u2010axis (CSA), radial short\u2010axis (RSA), and four\u2010chamber views (4CV). D\u2010Carmen strain analysis (DCA) was performed at peak systole and at peak contraction. Results: The baseline CSA\u2010SR (median 31.3 \u00b1 12.2%; interquartile range 25.2% to 46.9%) and RSA\u2010SR (median 27.6 \u00b1 12.7%; interquartile range 19.7% to 40.5%) values were significantly lower in CSA and RSA than in 4CV (63.1 \u00b1 7.7%; interquartile range 54.6% to 62.5%, P < 0.001 for both comparisons).

            "Super! Let's move on to the second criterion, voluntarily participating in the study. This is also common to both groups. Any concerns about including this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Few studies provide prospective data on the efficacy of second\u2010line therapy with the combination of chemotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) in malignant glioma after initial radiotherapy. Furthermore, the optimal dose of TMZ remains controversial with current doses ranging from 150 to 250 mg/m2/day. In this analysis, we analyzed the results of our previously presented randomized trial comparing chemoradiation to chemoradiation plus concomitant and adjuvant TMZ in patients with malignant glioma. Methods: Eligible patients received external beam irradiation 5 Gy a day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks in addition to intravenous PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, and vincris\u2010teine) for 18 weeks and temozolomide (75 mg daily during the first 2 weeks if no previous treatment and 100\u2013125 mg daily if previous treatment) for 4 to 6 weeks following radiotherapy. The primary end points were time to progression and overall survival. Results: The results include 138 patients. In the experimental arm, the median overall survival of those patients who received adjuvant and concomitant treatment with temozolomide (n = 60) was 43 months compared with 24 months for those patients in whom the temozolomide was given for an adjuvant treatment only (n = 78) (P = .006). However, in patients who received concomitant treatment, the median progression\u2010free survival was similar to the median that would be expected with chemoradiation alone, that is, 8 to 10 months for the median. Multivariate survival analysis identified poor performance status and extent of resection as factors adversely affecting survival. Conclusion: In a homogeneous group of patients, the addition of concomitant temozolomide to chemoradiation improved overall survival. In such patients, the addition of adjuvant temozolomide to postoperative radiotherapy may be an alternative treatment choice.",

So based on these criteria, we would be comparing the physical evaluations of post-COVID-19 individuals with idiopathic scoliosis to non-post-COVID-19 individuals with idiopathic scoliosis.

It was hypothesized that COVID\u201019 would influence the physical function of patients with idiopathic scoliosis, regardless of spinal curve angles. Method Between June 2019 and June 2021, a retrospective analysis of patients with idiopathic scoliosis was performed. We evaluated the medical charts of 46 patients who were previously diagnosed with post\u2010COVID\u201019 syndrome. All patients were divided into two groups: group A (n = 46) included post\u2010COVID\u201019 syndrome patients who received a new MRI at least 3 months after their last COVID\u201019 diagnosis, while group B (n = 503) included patients diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis prior to the COVID\u201019 pandemic. The parameters analyzed were age, gender, scoliosis angle, presence of respiratory symptoms prior to COVID\u201019 diagnosis, Cobb Angle increase in scoliosis patients who had undergone a pre\u2010 and post\u2010COVID\u201019 MRI, and the Modified Scoliosis Research Society\u201035 (mSRS\u201035) and Lumbopelvic Pain and Disability Questionnaire (LPQD) scores. Results The female sex was found to be more frequent in group A. The median age in group A was 13.5 years, and 58.7% received a diagnosis of subacute or acute COVID\u201019 syndrome. No significant difference was found in terms of scoliosis curve progression between the pre\u2010 and post\u2010pandemic periods (p = 0.822).

Patients and disease characteristics as well as the safety profile of each drug were also considered. The final analysis was performed on 14 February 2017. Patient demographics and cancer characteristics were summarized by treatment arm, with comparisons between treatment arms conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Fisher\u2019s exact tests where appropriate. Time to next treatment and survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan--Meier methods; hazard ratio (HR) and log-rank tests of difference between treatment arms for both measures were computed. Objective response rate was determined by the proportion of patients who achieved a partial or complete response to treatment. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the methods of Lin et al, as appropriate. The analysis was based on the intent-to-treat principle. All calculations were performed with STATA version 14. P values <0.05 were considered significant. \n\nAdjudication and analysis of study outcomes: The primary objective of this analysis was not to establish the effectiveness of CPI-613 versus standard chemotherapy regimens but to determine which study outcome to prioritize in future clinical trials. We chose the following as high-priority outcomes: time to next treatment, 1-year OS, and overall response rate (ORR) based upon recommendations from clinical trialists and patient advocates. Time to next treatment, 1-year OS, and ORR were determined by an expert oncology adjudication panel composed of nine members, including two hematologists, two medical oncologists, two radiation oncologists, two surgeons, and three advanced practice nurses (one nurse practitioner and two clinical nurse specialists), who were not involved in conducting the literature review or data analysis for this study. The criteria used in adjudication were: 1) confirmed documentation of disease progression; 2) death from any cause; 3) an improvement in measurable disease, as indicated by the investigator when evaluating an objective response to CPI-613; 4) unconfirmed assessment of either measure of interest, per local practice"

PATIENTS AND METHODS/STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind, and double\u2010dummy study in subjects with a chronic diabetic plantar foot ulcer. After screening and treatment of infections, approximately 200 patients with target foot ulcers will be randomized to receive twice daily DPN\u2010100 therapy or matching placebo. The primary endpoint is time to complete wound closure. Secondary endpoints include assessment of wound area, pain, and wound\u2010related quality of life. Safety and tolerability will also be evaluated. Aims include establishing the safety profile, wound\u2010healing efficacy, and improvement of pain. Frequency of dose modifications, incidence of treatment\u2010limiting adverse events, and discontinuations secondary to adverse events will be evaluated. CONCLUSION: DOPSIDE\u20101 is a large\u2010scale, multicenter clinical trial. The results of the primary endpoint will be available in 2023.\n\nIntroduction\nChronic wounds affect around 2% of the adult population in developed countries  and result in significant physical, psychological, and economic burdens. The lifetime probability of an uninjured individual developing a chronic wound is estimated to be 11% , and it has been estimated that around 3\u20135% of patients with insulin\u2010dependent diabetes mellitus will develop foot ulcers .",

What are your thoughts on this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nTo determine whether single vs. multiple in\u2010session cognitive behavior therapy sessions would produce better cognitive restructuring for social anxiety disorder. METHOD: The authors assigned 53 participants to a single session or multiple session condition. Pre and posttherapy data included cognitive restructuring frequency, severity of social anxiety disorder, and self\u2010disclosure behavior. Social Anxiety Inventory scores significantly decreased after both single and multiple sessions (p<.001). The 2 interventions were not significantly different in terms of social anxiety reduction (p =.814). Subjective levels of change in social anxiety and self\u2010disclosure behavior were not significantly different between groups. Both groups improved significantly in self\u2010disclosure on the Therapeutic Change Form (p < .001). Single session and multiple session conditions showed cognitive restructuring gains that significantly improved social anxiety. Change scores were not significantly different between groups in terms of frequency (Cramer's V =.02; n = 24) or severity (Cramer's V =.07; n = 21); posttherapy scores in both groups were significantly different from no change scores (Cramer's V = .53 and .76, respectively; n = 21 and 23; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Results of a pilot study on 53 social anxiety disorder patients suggest that single and multiple sessions of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) result in significant decreases in social anxiety. Preliminary results did not support the hypothesis that multiple sessions would produce better therapeutic benefit on measures of self\u2010disclosure or cognitive restructuring. Single session therapy may be a more efficient and cost\u2010effective treatment modality.",

Published Online First: 16 Dec 2021. https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052641)\n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction Vitamin A is a well\u2010known antioxidant and has protective effects against severe respiratory infections, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an inflammatory respiratory manifestation of COVID\u201019. Animal studies have shown promise for vitamin A in providing protective effects against the clinical manifestations of coronavirus infections. Several clinical trials in patients with vitamin A deficiency have demonstrated favourable effects of vitamin A at preventing mortality from pneumonia and sepsis, and a recent study showed a reduced need for mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients with vitamin A deficiency. This exploratory trial aims to assess the effect of vitamin A on patient survival and the incidence of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID\u201019.Methods and analysis This randomised, blinded, controlled clinical trial will recruit hospitalised patients who are confirmed to have COVID\u201019. Patients who are aged over 18 years and have had COVID\u201019 for at least two days will be randomised (1:1) to receive an intramuscular injection of 600 mg of vitamin A, 50 000 IU, or placebo once daily for up to two weeks or until discharge, if sooner. The primary endpoint will be a time\u2010to\u2010event analysis of mortality and a binary composite outcome of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or death. The two groups (vitamin A vs placebo) will be compared for differences in the primary endpoint (log\u2010rank test). Other exploratory endpoints include secondary endpoints, including other time\u2010to\u2010event analyses, binary analyses for the primary endpoint and ICU admissions, clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcomes,",

The consensus statement suggests that a subset of five \"core\" domains be used to facilitate comparisons between different interventions and settings. However, it has been suggested that, as with other measures such as health\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL), the degree to which 'core' domains are applicable across patient populations and settings is questionable. Methods: To investigate the breadth of applicability of the MRC SOF in musculoskeletal trials, and particularly in early arthritis (RA), a review of recent RA trials was performed retrospectively to highlight whether trials were using MRC SOF items or alternative social outcomes measures. The MRC SOF domains that comprise the five\u2010item core domain set were identified, and whether existing trials were measuring each domain was recorded. Furthermore, whether these trials were measuring the core domains exclusively or supplementing them with additional domains that a patient would consider of greater importance in the context of RA was recorded. Results: The review of all RA trials published between 2008 and 2019 identified nine trials that measured MRC SOF domains in early RA. Of these, eight were found to be measuring the core domain set exclusively, and one was found to be measuring the core domain set in conjunction with a broader set of domains. Conclusions: This study highlights the need for further consensus about the applicability and relevance of the MRC SOF in musculoskeletal trials. The use of a standardised set of core domains (for example, the five core domains of the MRC SOF) is encouraged as it will facilitate direct comparisons of studies. Indeed, this study shows that even",

We have \"Patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis who are planning to undergo bronchoscopy and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).\" Do you have any suggestions for this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) administration on blood pressure (BP) reduction and heart rate (HR) decrease in patients with hypertension or tachycardia under anesthesia. Methods: In this randomized double\u2010blind clinical trial study; 65 patients were evaluated during elective lower abdominal surgery. The patients were randomly divided into two groups : TUDCA group and control group. Hemodynamic data (HR, non\u2010invasive BP) were recorded before and after induction, after incision and at the end of surgery. Results: There was a significant rise in the HR immediately after incision in patients under general anesthesia (P<0.001). TUDCA given in a dose of 8mg / kg had a significantly greater effect on HR reduction at this point in comparison with the control group (P<0.001). In terms of non\u2010invasive BP immediately after incision, the effect of TUDCA in comparison with the control group was less pronounced but significantly different (P=0.049). On the other hand, TUDCA reduced the HR at every post\u2010incision data collection point relative to the control group and was significantly different at the end of anesthesia (P<0.001). Conclusions: TUDCA could affect anesthesia\u2010induced hypertension through BP regulation as well as it can reduce anesthesia\u2010related tachycardia.",

A structured interview was used to elicit detailed psychiatric information including menstrual cycle history. A blood sample was collected at days 21\u201028 to measure the serum concentration of sex hormones before and during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.RESULTS: Of the 169 women in the suicide attempt cohort, 84% had experienced a suicide attempt during menstruation. During their last suicide attempt, women in the suicide attempt group had increased anxiety (P=0.049), cognitive impairment (P=0.008) and dysphoria (P=0.002), when compared to women in the control group. In addition, serum estradiol concentration was positively correlated with negative symptoms (P=0.014) among women who had experienced a suicide attempt in the last menstrual cycle.CONCLUSION: The present study lends support to the hypothesis that hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle may contribute to the risk of suicide attempts, especially among adolescent girls with borderline personality or mood disorders.",

            "Great. It's crucial to address safety factors. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a common disease found in developing countries, including Malaysia. The diagnosis of PTB often relies on microbiological confirmation with the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in sputum. Urine examination has been recommended in those with high pretest probabilities for PTB, but the accuracy of the urinary M.tb antigen (UMA) test has not been assessed in settings where the prevalence of PTB is high. In Malaysia, the prevalence of PTB is high (0.2\u201014.2 %) in adult patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of the UMA test in a hospital setting in a high\u2010TB prevalence country. Methods: 246 patients suspected of smear\u2010positive PTB were enrolled over a four month period. The UMA test was performed on 239 urine samples, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated with mycobacteriology culture and smear microscopy as the reference standards. Results: The UMA test had a sensitivity of 71 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 52\u201085) for M.tb detection in adults and children with sputum smear positivity. The specificity of the UMA test was 100 %, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 16.2 and 0.3, respectively. However, the sensitivity of the UMA test in smear\u2010negative adults was only 47 % (95 % CI: 29\u201067). Conclusion: The UMA test has low sensitivity in high\u2010prevalence settings. However, in a hospital setting where a high proportion of smear\u2010positive sputum is available, the specificity of the UMA test is high, and it may be useful for distinguishing true\u2010positive from negative urinary samples.

The most affected age-group appears to be the elderly. With the elderly already burdened with health issues such as hypertension, heart failure and diabetes, not only are they more at risk of acquiring the disease, but also facing more physical and mental complications. The quarantine imposed to contain the spread of the disease has created an adverse impact on mental health in this age group, with the fear of COVID-19 leading to increased anxiety and reduced quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the reduction in quality of life in the elderly (60 years and older) during pre and post pandemic periods. The study will also evaluate the change in their quality of life as their understanding and awareness about the virus increases. The objectives of the present study are (1) to find out the percentage prevalence of the coronavirus before and during the pandemic among the elderly, (2) to determine the quality of life of the elderly before and during the coronavirus pandemic, and (3)to study the effect of awareness regarding COVID-19 on the quality of life of the elderly. The research will be carried out by employing an explanatory cross-sectional design with a mixed methods approach. Convenience sampling will be used to sample the elderly in nursing homes in Bengaluru. The study will be conducted in various nursing homes in various parts of Bengaluru. These nursing homes will be selected using a purposive sampling technique. For the quantitative part of the study, the data will be collected by filling out questionnaires. The questionnaires will include two parts-",

Excluding patients who suffer from chronic pain syndrome or chronic opioid use will help ensure that their outcomes are not influenced by pain perception and response issues. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. What do you think? \nAbstract:\nThe pathology and pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) are poorly undertood. Frequently, the patient undergoes multiple surgical interventons with an unclear benefit, and the clinical results vary significantly. To this day, no biomarker can define the chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The treatment of CPP includes multidisciplinary treatment and surgical intervention. The most common surgical indications include uterro\u2010vaginal adhesions, uteroidenomas, pelvic endometriosis, adnexal pathologies. In a systematic literature review, we wanted to assess the effectiveness of surgical treatment on the subjective (pain) and objective (return to normal activity) outcomes of patients affected with CPP. A systematic review of the literature was performed on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database with an initial search query of surgical management and CPP. The literature was reviewed independently by two authors, two additional articles were obtained from references within the articles selected. Two reviews published in 2008 assessed the impact of uterus\u2010vaginal adhesiolysis, uteroidenoma removal, and hysterectomy in CPP. These reviews found that in 16% of women, pelvic pain improved after surgery. According to a recent prospective randomized controlled study (2019), the only significant finding was that the quality of sex life was improved more by hysterectomy than by adhesiolysis. A randomised control trial (2019) of laparoscopic salpingectomy resulted in significant improvement of pain. All the studies reviewed have limitations due to the lack of control intervention and the lack of objective parameters for assessing pain and quality of life. There are few studies assessing the effects of surgical treatment in women with CPP. More well\u2010controlled clinical trials are needed to accurately assess the clinical benefits of this treatment.",

A total of 439 treatment\u2010na\u00efve adult patients enrolled at baseline in a randomized controlled trial of zidovudine (ZDV) and stavudine (D4T) versus ZDV alone (PRO1457) were studied. Methods: The study was conducted at 12 clinics globally. Patient drug resistance was monitored at 48 weeks using the reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction and genotype assays and categorized as treatment regimen failure. Results: Of 439 patients, 365 were CMV negative and 74 were CMV\u2010positive at baseline, 33 were male and 41 were female (59%/41%). Sixteen CMV\u2010positive patients (8 women, 8 men, mean baseline CD4+ cell count of 148 cells x 10<sup>6</sup>/L) had CMV resistance at baseline. There were no significant differences between the CMV\u2010positive and CMV\u2010negative groups regarding age, sex, ethnicity, median CD4+ cell count, or median HIV\u20101 RNA levels at baseline. After a median treatment time of 20 weeks (IQR 7\u201037), 6 CMV\u2010positive patients (median nadir CD4+ cell count of 56 cells x 10<sup>6</sup>/L) developed virologic failure, compared with 15 CMV\u2010negative patients (median nadir CD4+ cell count of 38 cells x 10<sup>6</sup>/L).

However, a good survival outcome is possible for patients having an entirely and well\u2010performed histological sampling (p < 0.001), and the number of sections is more directly correlated with the probability of making a specific histological diagnosis than the number of blocks.

The sample comprised participants with MS aged over 18 who are currently experiencing moderate fatigue and live in the Vancouver area (Canada). We will use a randomized, between\u2010subjects design to compare the effects of four acupuncture delivery systems: real acupuncture, sham acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, and electroacupuncture applied for 20 minutes each, over the course of five consecutive treatment sessions (total treatment time = 2.5 hours). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four groups using block randomization, and be assessed at four time points: immediately postintervention, 24 hours postintervention, 2 weeks post interventions, and 6 weeks postinterventions. The primary outcome is patient\u2010rated fatigue according to a fatigue impact scale and a pain impact scale. Data will be analyzed using ANOVA with repeated measures and Bonferroni's post\u2010hoc test to determine which group had the minimal significant change at the four time points. Results from this study will identify the most acceptable delivery system of acupuncture for MS patients in terms of fatigue and determine whether acupuncture reduces fatigue and pain in patients with MS. This finding will be used to develop a more effective acupuncture intervention to treat MS\u2010related fatigue. Furthermore, it will also inform future researchers on how to design acupuncture interventions to reduce fatigue.",

What is the fifth exclusion criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nPURPOSE: Although several trials have described the role of postoperative early oral feeding on surgical outcomes in patients undergoing major abdominal and urologic surgery, there are little data available for patients undergoing gynecological surgery. We investigated the clinical role of early oral feeding in gynecological laparotomy cases.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was done between April 2010 and April 2011, in 90 patients scheduled for gynecological laparotomy. The patients were randomly distributed to one of two groups: early (on the first postoperative day) (45 patients), or delayed (on the third postoperative day) (45 patients) oral feeding groups.RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with respect to mean age, obesity group, disease grade, operation time, postoperative stay in the UICU and ICU; postoperative days and length of stay in the hospital. Complications occurred in three patients (2%) who were in the delayed oral group, and in five patients (11%) in the early oral group. The mean daily calorie intake and weight loss within 24 h in patients in the early and delayed oral group were, respectively, 1006.99 \u00b1 212.57 kcal and 214.11 \u00b1 322.68 g, and 954.44 \u00b1 166.98 kcal and 244.07 \u00b1 281.37 g. During our survey, the early oral feeding group consumed considerably more calories after 24 h of oral feeding (P,0.001); the total calorie consumption was 15.4 \u00b1 2.82 vs. 13,33 \u00b1 2.8 kcal for the early and the delayed oral feeding groups.

Any other exclusion criteria you can think of? \n\nStudy hypothesis\n=================\nRationale and aims: Acute postoperative pain is one of the most unpleasant sequelae of breast biopsies, although it may not be completely avoided. Various studies have suggested that the use of regional anesthetic techniques (e.g., local infusion anesthesia (ILA), pectoral nerve block (PNSB), and paravertebral thoracic anesthesia (PVTA) ) can effectively reduce postoperative pain in patients undergoing breast biopsies. However, the analgesic effect of these techniques remains unknown in patients undergoing biopsy under ultrasound-guided local anesthesia (USGIA). This study aims to explore the analgesic effect of these techniques in patients undergoing biopsy under USGIA. Further, this study aims to determine the best technique for relieving pain post-USGIA. Methods: This study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized, assessor-blinded, comparative study. A total of 60 adult patients aged 20-60 years, each scheduled for USGIA breast biopsy, will be allocated into one of the four study groups using the block randomization method: USGIA local anesthesia group (group A), USGIA ILA group (group B), USGIA PNSB group (group C), and USGIA PVTA group (group D). Each group undergoes a different analgesic technique. The primary outcome is the numerical rating scale (NRS) score for pain at rest one day after surgery, while the key secondary outcome is the postoperative NRS score. Moreover, pain at rest and during movement, the opioid analgesic consumption, the incidence of nausea and vomiting, and other adverse events will also be evaluated. Results: The results will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses, and the significance level will be set at p<0.05. Discussion: This study will be the first to explore the effectiveness of various analgesic techniques in patients undergoing breast biops",

We will calculate the time between referral and the first needle in the groin and define a binary outcome variable (treatment delay < 30 minutes / t.d. >= 30 minutes). We will investigate the difference between the proportion of patients with treatment delay > 30 minutes in the group with standardized alarming system (n =104) compared with the group with regular process of alarming (n =104).\n- Secondary outcome: secondary outcomes are the treatment delay between the time of referral and the time that the patient enters the CT scanner at the referral center (binary variable) and door-to-needle time (in minutes) will be calculated. We will assess whether the implementation of the standardized alarming system reduces the proportion of the patients with a treatment delay > 30 minutes between arrival with the ambulance/ helicopter and start of treatment. The proportion of patients with a door to needle time of at least 60 minutes will be compared between the two groups using the above mentioned ternary logistic regression model.\n- Secondary outcome: secondary outcomes are the time between admission of the patient to the primary stroke centre",

Several CAR\u2010T\u2010cells targeting BCMA have been developed over the past decade, but they all suffer from a limited clinical success due to resistance mechanisms triggered by the BCMA antigen. Our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BCMA\u2010based CAR\u2010T\u2010cells in newly diagnosed, relapsed refractory, and high risk MM. Methods & Design All patients who had progressed after at least three lines of therapy, received autologous transplant or not, or achieved only a partial response to their last line of therapy were eligible. Study procedure: 1) Patients are assessed and staged according to standard guidelines and procedures to determine eligibility; 2) Once the criteria are met, informed consent is obtained  and all patients are evaluated for clinical inclusion in the trial; 3) Eligible patients may be enrolled in the study and their data will be collected after their inclusion in the study; 4) Data will be collected on patients for a maximum of 10 years, including follow\u2010up visits and tests, as well as clinical data and adverse events.

Methods: This prospective, open\u2010label, multicenter, randomized phase I study enrolled patients with relapsed and progressive CLL after at least 1 line of treatment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups, group A received the CD47 bispecific antibody, SGN\u2010403, and group B received SGN\u2010403 in combination with nivolumab. Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment\u2010related adverse events (TRAEs). Effectiveness was assessed using standard clinical criteria for response to therapy, such as the European CLL Criteria (EUCLL) 2018. Results: A total of 18 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to group A (n = 10) or group B (n = 8). Median follow\u2010up was 9.5 months. Median time to treatment failure was 4.8 months in group A and 1.1 months in group B. The overall response rate was 70% in group A and 75% in group B.

To expand on the effectiveness of CBCT, which has been assessed in a heteronormative model, it is crucial to adapt the treatment protocol to address the unique concerns of same\u2010sex couples. Method: The primary aim is to examine the effectiveness of the new protocol, designed to be gender neutral, among same\u2010sex couples compared to traditional CBCT. Twenty same\u2010sex couples will be randomly allocated to either a CBCT group or a CBCT+ mindfulness and acceptance (CBCT+MA) group. All participants will complete baseline measures of psychosocial variables, and then will participate in six 105\u2010minutes weekly sessions of CBCT or CBCT+MA. The primary outcome measures will be psychosocial outcomes: the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) and the Mindfulness\u2010Acceptance Scale (MAS). We will also explore possible mediating effect of attachment style (Attach Scale for Adult Romantic Relationships) through structural equation modeling (SEM). Hypotheses: We expect the new treatment protocol to be more effective against traditional CBCT among same\u2010sex couples, with higher attachment style predicting more positive psychosocial adjustment. Results: If recruitment proves challenging, a larger sample may be necessary or we may need to revise our recruitment strategy. However, we expect our protocol to be effective in improving psychosocial adjustment and reducing sexual difficulties. Discussion: The study has the potential to develop an evidence\u2010based CBT protocol, which could be used in future studies with larger sample sizes.",

Method: We retrospectively analyzed 501 consecutive patients with ATBAD from Jan 1990 to Sep 2017 in a high\u2010volume tertiary referral center. We classified ATBAD cases based on a standardized definition and classified type I into the true and false forms based on the anatomical location of the entry tear. The true type I was defined as involving the intima of the descending aorta and false type I was defined as a non\u2010true one. Results: Among the 501 patients, 158 patients (31.5%) died before or at discharge. The overall incidence of in\u2010hospital mortality was 31.5% (158/501). The incidence of in\u2010hospital mortality of the true type I and false type I was 25.4% (37/146) and 27.1% (54/200) (P = 0.649).

Childhood obesity has been increasing worldwide in recent years. One of the main factors associated with hepatic steatosis is obesity, which is due to a change in eating habits. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can also be associated with other diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia. In addition, hepatic steatosis may precede the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or arterial hypertension. Current treatments include maintaining a healthy lifestyle, exercise and nutrition. However, due to the growing prevalence of hepatic steatosis and obesity, prevention programs with nutritional education are required. In Mexico, hepatic steatosis is estimated at 11% of the population, obesity at 34% and diabetes at 13.7% in children and adolescents. It has recently been published that the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in adolescents is 15% and the prevalence of obesity is 26.4%. Although children who receive nutritional education have a decreased incidence of obesity, diabetes and hepatic steatosis, there are no published studies, specifically on nutritional education with low-calorie sugars (D-allulose) and low glycemic index. Previously, our research group observed that nutritional education including low-calorie D-allulose can impact the glycemic profile and anthropometric markers in adult obese individuals. Objective: To investigate the effect of nutritional education on the anthropometric, lipid and glycemic profile in obese adolescents with hepatic steatosis using low-calorie D-allulose. Methodology: Participants will be randomized into two groups.",

Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of D\u2010allulose in children born to women who were not pregnant when the drugs were taken. Methods: A single\u2010center, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, randomized, parallel, dose\u2010escalation trial in a total of 12 children was performed. Children were randomly allocated to receive one of four dose levels (15, 30, 60, or 90 mg per kg per day) of D\u2010allulose or placebo. A 14\u2010day washout period was followed by a second 14\u2010day active\u2010drug period or continued dosing during the intervention phase. The primary outcome was the change in serum amylase levels from baseline to week 12 and the secondary outcomes included changes in serum lipids, liver function, hormonal levels, and urinary microalbumin/creatinine ratio. Results: No serious adverse events were observed during the intervention period, and the number of adverse events showed no consistent trend. Significant differences in changes in the serum lipids and glucose levels between D\u2010allulose groups and the placebo group were observed. The serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride in the 30mg/kg/day group significantly decreased after the intervention compared to baseline. Conclusion: D\u2010allulose is a safe and well\u2010tolerated drug with potential efficacy in children. Large, long\u2010term, and multi\u2010center trials are needed to fully evaluate the safety and efficacy of D\u2010allulose in children born to women who were not pregnant when the drugs were taken.",

The investigators hypothesize that D-allulose does not affect the rate at which FFAs or glucose are absorbed from a postprandial high fat meal.

            "That's a great suggestion! Ensuring that parents maintain their child's usual routine will help us isolate the effects of D-allulose on gastrointestinal tolerance. Finally, we should include children whose parents are willing and able to attend all 7 visits. This will ensure participant compliance and data collection throughout the study.",

            "Excellent suggestion! Excluding participants who have used prescription medication will help us isolate the effects of D-allulose more accurately. Now, let's discuss the criterion related to regular GI complaints. Any thoughts on this?",
            "That's a smart consideration! By excluding children with regular GI complaints, we can minimize the potential influence of these complaints on the study results. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. How do you think we should handle known intolerance or sensitivity to the study products?",
            "That's a valid point! Ensuring participant safety is of utmost importance, and excluding those with known intolerances or sensitivities is necessary to achieve that. Now, let's discuss the criterion related to psychiatric disorders. Any ideas on this?",

Excluding children with psychiatric disorders will help us focus on the impact of D-allulose on gastrointestinal tolerance without potential psychological influences. Finally, we should also exclude children with lactose intolerance, as well as those who have used supplements that may have affected the GI system. Any thoughts on these criteria?",

            "OK. And how has this been measured? \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVES: To define the evolution of symptoms following bulking agent injections (BI) in patients with urinary incontinence (UI).BACKGROUND: BI has been shown to be an effective treatment for mild\u2010to\u2010moderate UI due to urodynamic or non\u2010urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (SUI), but there is little data concerning its long term follow up and the time course of its effect, in women with SUI only.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data in this retrospective study comes from a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing BI for stress SUI. A total of 131 consecutive patients underwent BI at a tertiary referral center. Demographic data and results of urodynamic studies pre\u2010 and post BI were recorded. At the same time, the patients were asked to complete the validated Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI\u20106) and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire\u2010Urinary (ICIQ\u2010UI).RESULTS: Only 102 eligible patients completed both pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative UDIs and ICIQ\u2010UI questionnaires. Mean follow up was 24 months. No difference was noted between the UDIs and the ICIQ\u2010UI pre\u2010 and post\u2010injection. Median number of injections received was 1. There appeared to be an initial improvement in the majority of patients with a decline in the benefits at 18 months. The degree of improvement in patients with no symptoms pre\u2010treatment was greater than those with mild or moderate symptoms pre\u2010treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of BI were greatest in patients with mild or no stress symptoms. The improvement was not maintained over 18 months of follow up, but the number of patients with symptoms were low. It is concluded that BI is still a good treatment option, with the majority of women feeling a benefit and no complications incurred.",

Exclusion criteria include known cases of diabetes, pre existing renal failure, immunosuppressive medication, and other pre-existing co-morbidities. Consecutive patients attending OPD surgical clinic at UGMC on weekly basis were reviewed. Their demographic details  are documented alongside all the laboratory investigations. Those patients scheduled for elective cholecystectomy are recruited into the study and  enrolled on the day of admission. Before surgery in the operating room, 1.0 mL of venous blood was drawn for PCT measurement from each study participant. Serum samples were centrifuged and the serum stored at -70\u00b0C until use. Serum PCT levels were taken into account in addition to clinical parameters known to be associated with surgical site infections, such as age, sex, BMI, type of surgery, length of surgery, history of antibiotic use, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and perioperative risk of wound infection. For post-operative monitoring, clinical data as well as lab parameters (PCT, blood glucose, blood urea, creatinine, and hemoglobin), were recorded on the day of surgery, the first post-operative day, the second post-operative day, and at the time of discharge (range 4-5 days) after the operation.  Blood samples were collected from each patient immediately before surgery, on the first post-operative day, and at discharge on the fourth or fifth day.

The perioperative data and parameters were investigated. We compared the clinical and radiological data between the PSF group, the POBF group, and the DS\u2010PLIF group.RESULTS: A total of 141 patients with ALDS were enrolled in the study, with an average follow\u2010up time of 24 months. The PSF fusion rate was 92.9% (36/39), and the POBF fusion rate was 92.6% (26/28). The interbody fusion rate of the POBF group was higher than that of the PSF group [92.9% vs. 90.5%, (PSF + POBF) = 90.5%, both P > 0.050].

We diagnosed a confirmed case by reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction testing for Rift Valley fever virus. The severity of the disease was assessed using case fatalities (CF) and survival rates (SR%). Results: We diagnosed 79 patients, with a case fatality rate of 29%. The mean age was 30.65 years (range 10 months\u201069 years). Most cases had at least one bleeding episode, including gastrointestinal bleeding in 29.1% and menorrhagia in 7.6% of females. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (98.7%), headache (86.1%), jaundice (84.8%), and vomiting (81.0%).

Primary and secondary outcome measures were assessed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that determined changes at the end of treatment (EOT), or the difference between baseline and EOT, or changes at each measurement of two or more time points after randomization using meta\u2010analysis techniques. A standardized mean difference (SMD) was defined when comparing continuous variables, and risk ratio (RR) was utilized for dichotomous variables at a threshold of P < 0.05. Results: Six RCTs (total 519 subjects) were identified. Most of the studies included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or DFUs. The mean age was close to 65\u00a0years, and over two\u2010thirds (69.4%) were female. Participants with a short duration of the DFU showed a 58% reduction in the EOT relative risk of complete wound healing (RR\u00a0= 0.42, CI 95% 0.20\u20100.89) in comparison with the nonvitamin D group, but there was no significant difference, with a RR of 1.30 (CI 95% 0.92\u20101.85) in the vitamin D group compared with the control group (RR\u00a0= 0.68, CI 95% 0.44\u20101.05).

The clinical symptoms vary according to the location of the damage and the degree of the damage. 2% of all ischemic stroke cases have lower extremity deficits, and spasticity, muscle atrophy, and other related symptoms affect the patient's activities of daily living and activities of daily living quality, which are the main problems that patients suffer from. Among them, spasticity that occurs in the lower limbs is a disease in which the hyperreflexic state of the skeletal muscle is observed due to the disorder of the nervous system. It is one of the factors that hinder the restoration of mobility in patients with lower limb disorders. In cases of focal motor paralysis, the muscles of the lower extremities, including the gastrocnemius muscle, quadriceps muscle, and hamstring muscle, are paralyzed in a flaccid manner. In addition, spasticity increases as the tone of the muscle is restored due to muscle spasm. Joints are fixed in a flexion posture to increase the pressure on the joint and limit its mobility. An increase in the pressure on the joints and the limited mobility of the joints due to spastic",

The rapid spread of the disease and the limited treatment options have led to a high mortality rate. This study aimed to assess the mortality rate and risk factors associated with Covid19 pneumonia in Khorasan Razavi and the effect of early invasive ventilation on mortality in Covid19\u2010intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: According to the available records of Covid19\u2010inpatients from 7 hospitals belonging to the Khorasan Razavi Medical Sciences University in Iran, 305 patients were randomly selected and then randomly assigned to two groups of intervention and control. In the intervention group, invasive ventilation was performed immediately when patients presented with hypoxia, whereas patients in the control group were given high\u2010flow nasal catheter (HFNC) during the initial 72 h. The outcome measure chosen for evaluation in terms of statistical significance was between\u2010group mortality rates. Results: The mortality rate among patients who underwent invasive ventilation was 14.86%, whereas the mortality rate among those who underwent HFNC was 29.22%. The 72\u2010hour mortality rate was significantly lower in patients receiving invasive ventilation than in the HFNC group (P<0.001). The risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity, were similar in the intervention and the control groups. Conclusions: The mortality rate in critically ill Covid19 patients is high. Early and effective ventilation has been associated with a lower mortality rate and may result in fewer ICU deaths.",

The tumor thrombus of HCC has the characteristics of strong invasiveness, rapid spread and fast growing. Therefore, to find a novel, effective and reliable treatment for HCC would be meaningful. Currently, radiofrequency thermal therapy has been used with good efficacy in the treatment of small-sized hepatocellular carcinomas and has been widely used in clinical, but this method has some shortcomings, such as being difficult to get the expected curative effect in huge-sized hepatocellular carcinomas, and so on. The new idea of using PVA nano-bubble (PNB) in combination with cryosurgery has been tried in animal experiments. In comparison of other targeted anti-tumor therapies, PVA nano-bubble (PNB) plays its own role in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a new idea and method that has not been widely used in the clinical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. PVA nanobubble has the unique advantage of being harmless to normal tissue without hemorrhagic transformation and its safety and feasibility have no safety concerns, as well as minimal adverse reaction in patients with high recurrence rate. In conclusion, PVA nano-bubble (PNB) + cryosurgery can provide an approach for preventing the recurrence of HCC after liver resection, which has important clinical significance in improving the prognosis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer related death throughout the world.

Background and rationale: Over one third of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) progress to develop biliary cancer (BC) with only an estimated 3 years survival. PBC is a chronic autoimmune disease leading to progressive fibrosis and destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. Over 90% of BC in PBC are of an intrahepatic type with a high cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) component. Elevated risk of BC in PBC is associated with several clinical, serological, radiological, and histological characteristics. Previous GWAS identified single nucleotide variants associated with risk of BC in PBC as well as liver fibrosis. However, these risk factors only captured a small proportion of the genetic contribution of BC risk in PBC, suggesting that additional genetic factors remain to be discovered. To this end, we assembled a large consortium of 10 UK referral centres and several centres in Europe.

Both SUPREMAT1 (NCT02116377) and SUPREMAT2 (NCT02609268), randomized, double\u2010blind, multicenter studies, are currently underway to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of Durellis\u00ae (Durosant\u00ae), after implantation in the medial and/or lateral carpal tunnel, in order to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Durosant\u00ae for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In SUPREMAT1, Durosant\u00ae is implanted as a single intra\u2010operative dose and the patient is assessed up to 6months, while in SUPREMAT2, the implant is administered as half dose implants per each side with a second re\u2010injection. The primary outcome measures of the SUPREMAT1 and 2 studies are the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), symptom bother rating, and CTS\u2010Related Localized Symptom Score (CTS\u2010RLSS) at treatment Day (T0) and up to 6months.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of and associated factors with pregabalin consumption in a population receiving treatment for substance use disorder. Methods: We conducted an observational study on 150 patients admitted for the treatment of substance use disorder. All patients were screened for pregabalin consumption at admission. Clinical and demographic data were collected and analyzed to identify associated factors. Results: The overall proportion of pregabalin use was 43.3% (65 of 150 individuals). In Multivariate analysis; having a diagnosis of depression (OR 4.08, CI [1.62\u20109.76], p 0.003) and using other benzodiazepines (Odds ratio: 3.68, CI [1.30\u201010.46], p 0.01) were identified as the predictors of pregabalin use. Having a prescription for pregabalin was strongly and positively associated with pregabalin use (OR 47.3, CI [22.84\u201098.33], p < 0.001). Conclusion: Among patients treated for drug addiction, a significant proportion of patients used pregabalin at the time of admission. These cases are an indication of increasing pregabalin misuse which demands closer monitoring and regulation of use. Furthermore, depressive symptoms and other benzodiazepine use were correlated with pregabalin use and should be closely evaluated. 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

What do you think? \n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nOne type of toothpaste widely utilized in dentistry to date, known as the CPP-ACP (Casein Phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate) system, can strengthen the enamel with help from fluoride. CPP-ACP technology has been developed in the 1980s and is used in many commercial toothpastes. The most commonly used CPP-ACP material is called Recaldent\u2122. CPP-ACP is a biologically active protein-based compound derived from milk. CPP-ACP releases Ca, P and phosphoproteins from the protein. CPP-ACP has the ability to incorporate saliva calcium into the outer surface of the demineralized enamel crystal and bind this calcium ion in the crystal. CPP-ACP and fluoride is often used in dentistry for remineralization therapy. However, this approach has limitations. For example, some of the CPP-ACP molecules penetrate the teeth, and others do not. Moreover, they may be less effective when a toothbrush is not available or when a person does not know exactly where the demineralized tooth is. The authors propose to develop a new, non-invasive tooth remineralization therapy. The authors believe that this therapy is better because instead of coating the tooth surface, we can deliver the active agent directly to the demineralized areas using toothbrush and/or chewing gum delivery methods. The aim of the present study is to investigate a new material, chitosan-coated gold nanoshells (CNGS) for tooth remineralization therapy. Nanoshells show promising oral care benefits when combined with other treatments. It has been shown that CPP-ACP and chitosan work synergistically to promote the remineralization of enamel.

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2018, with \"patellofemoral pain syndrome,\" \"low energy shock wave therapy,\" \"exercise therapy,\" and \"randomized controlled trial\" as key search words. Seven randomized controlled trials involving 274 patients were included in the final meta\u2010analysis. The data from individual studies showed that SWT combined with exercise therapy significantly decreased the pain numeric rating scale (p<0.01) and improved WOMAC physical function (p<0.05) and Lysholm knee score (p<0.05) in patients. In addition, the combined treatment significantly improved the KOOS function subscale score (p<0.05), Patellar Pain (p<0.05), and VAS\u2010knee (p<0.05) in patients. This meta\u2010analysis suggested that the combined use of SWT and exercise therapy may be more effective than exercise therapy alone in reducing pain and improving functional outcomes in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. However, the therapeutic effects may vary by intervention duration. Hence, a larger sample size is required to further validate the results.\n\nIntroduction\nPatellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a chronic disease with the main clinical manifestation of anterior knee pain, which is accompanied by a series of symptoms such as pain, effusion, and muscle weakness. It is mainly caused by a variety of risk factors, including anatomical abnormalities, muscle strength, gait and movement pattern, and knee cartilage degeneration . Most cases of PFPS are conservative, and the main treatment method is non-pharmacological intervention. Exercise therapy",

We set out to examine the characteristics and outcomes during 2 years of psychosocial therapy treatment among children and adolescents diagnosed with MDD, their parents, and teachers. Methods: We recruited participants aged 7\u201317, with parent and teacher evaluation of a depressive episode according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM\u20105). Participants received weekly group therapy treatment for 2 years. Patients rated depression severity using the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). Results: Three hundred forty\u2010three participants completed the study and were included in this analysis. The mean age was 12.5 years and 60% were girls. Their mean CDI score was 44.0. Of the 343 participants, 14.9% met criteria for persistent severe depression after 2 years of treatment, and 65.2% met criteria for a depression\u2010free state. Teachers rated the average CDI score the highest, followed by children and parents (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The severity of depression was consistently lower in patients than caregivers. Children with persistent severe MDD over 2 years of treatment should be considered at higher risk for a cascade of psychiatric disorders.",

It is an antibody that blocks programmed\u2010death\u20101 (PD\u20101), which helps tumor cells evade immune system detection and destruction. In this study, we explored the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in patients with mNSCLC and adenocarcinoma histology who had progressed after receiving other treatments. Methods: A total of 31 mNSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma histology and disease progression following chemoradiotherapy or as first\u2010line platinum\u2010based doublet therapy for advanced disease were enrolled in this study between November 2014 and October 2015. Patients received nivolumab every 3 weeks until disease recurrence or progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. After the first cycle of nivolumab, restaging was done 4 \u2010 6 weeks after the initial response. Efficacy was assessed 9 \u2010 12 weeks after the first infusion. The primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and progression\u2010free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: The median age of the 31 patients was 70 years (interquartile range: 63, 76). 12 patients (39%) had squamous subtype and 19 patients (61%) had nonsmoking\u2010related disease. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were found in nine patients (29%). 22 patients (71%) had stage IV disease, whereas 9 (29%) had stages IIIB or IV. 12 patients (39%) received one line of chemotherapy prior to enrollment, 13 (42%) received two lines of chemotherapy and 6 (19%) received only chemoradiotherapy, which did not include a first\u2010line platinum\u2010based doublet.

Our novel molecule, MM-140, is under investigation for its potential to treat relapsed or refractory MM. This is a phase 1 trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MM-140 given as a single agent intravenously (IV) over 4 and 22 weeks. This study will also evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity and evaluate MM-140's drug-drug interaction with daratumumab.\nDESIGN: This is a phase 1, single-arm, open-label, two-staged dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial. The primary objective is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MM-140 and evaluate the safety and tolerability of MM-140 in participants with relapsed or refractory MM. The RP2D will be determined based on 1) the proportion of participants with adverse events consistent with grade 2 (CTCAE v5.0), 2) dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and 3) clinically significant deviation of pharmacokinetic parameters. In addition, the study will evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity at the RP2D. In the dose-expansion, participants will receive MM-140 and daratumumab concomitantly.\nPARTICIPANTS: Adult participants (18 years or older) with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have failed 1-3 prior lines of therapy are eligible. No prior treatment with daratumumab or proteasome inhibitors is required.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants will receive MM-140 IV for 6 cycles.

What else would you like to add to the inclusion criteria? \n\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Radiation therapy (RT) has been used to control symptoms of locally advanced or metastatic bone metastases (BM) since the late 19th century.1 The advent of modern radiotherapy techniques, namely intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), has led to better local control rates than conventional radiotherapy. Moreover, the rapid introduction of IMRT and SBRT has resulted in limited data available to compare these newer techniques with each other. Material and Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed. The search strategy was comprehensive and focused on randomized trials (RCT) and high\u2010level observational studies only. Results: Overall, 17 articles were reviewed, and 5 RCTs met our criteria for inclusion. This review demonstrates the superior local control rates of IMRT compared to conventional RT as well as the benefit of SBRT over IMRT. Furthermore, it shows that IMRT delivers a better overall survival than conventional RT despite the use of higher doses. However, there is currently no evidence showing significant improvement in OS with the use of SBRT in the setting of palliative RT. Conclusion: This is a robust systematic review of high\u2010level literature in the use of IMRT and SBRT showing that, regardless of technique, IMRT and SBRT have similar efficacy in the treatment of painful BM. Moreover, the use of IMRT delivers a better rate of local control while maintaining local toxicity, especially with the addition of gaiters. However, there is a lack of high\u2010level evidence showing a clear survival benefit of both techniques over one another. Randomized trials with appropriate study designs and adequate statistical powering should be conducted to better characterize the benefits of these local treatment methods.

Methods: A nationwide random population survey was conducted among 23,291 community\u2010dwelling adults of \u2265 18 years of age. Mental disorders were measured using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Depression was ascertained by the 12\u2010item short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (short\u2010GDS\u201012), and suicide ideation was ascertained by the suicide\u2010related item (SQ5) derived from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Sleep disturbance was assessed using the Sleep Subscale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS\u201021). Multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between sleep disturbance and depression/suicide ideation. Results: Depression was present in 814 (3.5%) participants, and suicide ideation was present in 482 (2.1%) participants. The multinomial logistic regression showed that poor sleep quality was independently associated with depression and suicide ideation [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10\u20101.48; adjusted OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.11\u20101.55, respectively]. The ordinal regression analysis further showed that participants with greater severity of sleep disturbance had higher odds of having severe/very severe depression compared with those without sleep disturbance (adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.45\u20102.00), even after adjusting for all potential confounders. Significant interactions were also detected between sleep disturbance and depression/suicidal ideation, showing that the risk of depression was most pronounced among those with severe sleep disturbance (adjusted OR = 2.",

Patients and Methods: A retrospective cohort study used data from the National Cancer Database for 89,099 patients (41,949 TA and 47,150 SR) who presented with non\u2010metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma between 2012 and 2017. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) with secondary outcomes of mortality, morbidity, and cost\u2010effectiveness. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves were used to estimate overall survival and time to next treatment. A cost\u2010effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted from the perspective of US healthcare payers. Results: The median age was 68 (range 32\u201389). TA and SR were similar in terms of sex (62.8% vs 60.6%, p=0.004). Compared to women (HR: 7.5, p<0.001), TA was performed on more White patients (87.2% vs 85.2%, p<0.001). For White patients, TA was associated with OS compared to SR (HR: 0.75, p<0.001) while for non\u2010White patients, there was no difference in OS. Overall, treatment was associated with OS regardless of patient race. Conclusion: Although there was no statistically significant difference in mortality rates between patients who underwent TA and those who underwent SR, these 2 strategies were associated with significant differences in OS and morbidity rates among White vs non\u2010White patients.

We sought to determine whether the surgical technique, whether conventional or coblation tonsillectomy with either bipolar or monopolar energy, was associated with a difference in bleeding risk in 2 large studies. Methods: Our retrospective study included patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy using our coblation protocol. We used our institutional database to identify patients undergoing any tonsillectomy technique between 2005 and 2015 followed by at least 30 days of observation. Descriptive statistics were calculated for perioperative parameters. Univariable analysis identified risk factors associated with post\u2010tonsillectomy hemorrhage (PTH). Multivariable analysis was conducted to identify independent risk factors of PTH. Results: This study consists of 1,526 patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomies between 2005 and 2015. In 94% of cases, bipolar energy was used and 46% used monopolar energy. Of the 1,526 patients, the cohort had a 3.15% overall rate of post\u2010operative bleeding (141 bleeding events, 92 bipolar 55 monopolar cohort), whereas 3 patients experienced a more severe complication (6.58% re\u2010operation patients):2 required blood transfusions, 1 developed pneumonia, and 2 patients presented for hematoma evacuation after spontaneous spontaneous reabsorption of the hemorrhage (13\u2010day post\u2010op).

The cells used for this study are immune cells known as dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are found in the immune system and help the body to fight infection. They are one of the body's defences against cancer. \n\nDendritic cells can be made from a patient's own immune cells. They can then be activated to make them better at fighting cancer.

Thank you! This was an excellent discussion on inclusion and exclusion criteria. I appreciate your input and look forward to finalizing the criteria for the study. \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: Although endoscopic ultrasound\u2010 guided transgastric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (EUS\u2010Guided ERC) has been widely used for many years, there are few reports on EUS\u2010Guided ERC with large duodenal diverticulum (DD) cases. Herein, we first review 5 cases of EUS\u2010Guided ERC with large DDs. Case Presentation: For five patients, 26\u201338 year old (mean age, 30.3 years old) with DD and cholangitis, Ercp was performed by the EUS\u2010Guided method with DDs ranging in size between 5.8cm to 6.7cm. There was no intraoperative complication, such as bleeding and perforation. No patient developed pancreatitis after treatment, and no patient had DD or cholangitis recurrence during follow\u2010up. Discussion: The present study demonstrated that EUS\u2010Guided ERC had high safety and efficacy when performed for patients with large DDs. The procedure was well tolerated; however, it was still associated with a learning curve. Therefore, well training and understanding of relevant anatomy and technical skills (including fluoroscopy and pancreatic duct cannulation) are important for a safe and effective technique. Conclusions: For patients with DDs, careful preprocedural imaging and accurate diagnosis of the anatomy are necessary. EUS\u2010Guided ERC and pancreatic sphincterotomy can effectively deal with cholangitis, which offers a new method of treating refractory cholangitis, improving the prognosis of patients, and reducing the incidence of cholangitis recurrence.",

Recent literature has shown that a subset of patients with HER2\u2010positive breast cancer and germline\u00a0BRCA mutation may be candidates for systemic therapy in addition to neo\u2010adjuvant chemotherapy and/or HER2 therapy. In this study, the authors assessed outcomes of patients with HER\u2010positive breast cancer who were not candidates for PARP inhibitors but had germline\u00a0BRCA mutations. The authors identified 88 patients who received sequential dual checkpoint inhibitors (n=21) and then an anti\u2010HER2 agent (n=55), or who received either dual or single checkpoint inhibitors (n=12) with HER2\u2010targeted therapy (n=9 and n=3, respectively). With a median follow\u2010up of 32.2 months, 7\u2010year outcomes included an invasive disease\u2010free survival (IDFS) rate of 67.9%, recurrence\u2010free survival rate of 69.8%, and distant recurrence\u2010free survival rate of 66.5%. Compared with previous studies, the authors observed a higher proportion of lymph node\u2010negative patients and lower proportion of those with visceral disease. The authors found that pathological complete response (pCR) rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients receiving sequential dual checkpoint inhibitors and anti\u2010HER2 therapy were 80% for the breast and 97% for the axilla. Overall, the authors found that high rates of pCR were observed with this regimen, but this remains to be seen in randomized studies. The authors also noted that patients who received dual checkpoint inhibitors with anti\u2010HER2 therapy had significantly higher IDFS and distant recurrence\u2010free survival rates compared with those who received both types of therapy sequentially or who received only a single type of therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.50; p",

I think this criterion is necessary. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis is a phase III open-label, multicenter, three-arm design, randomized controlled study. This study aims to compare the efficacy, safety, and quality of life of lenalidomide combined with bortezomib or dexamethasone alone as first-line treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have participated in the 3-weekly bortezomib and dexamethasone maintenance therapy for the previous 3-6 cycles after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe overall survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is around 5 years, and relapse or refractory is the main cause of death after 3-6 3-month cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone maintenance therapy (MT) after ASCT. In addition to MT after ASCT, there is still no established treatment regimen for patients with relapse or refractory. Lenalidomide is a new drug developed for the treatment of patients with MM who have relapsed or refractory or are refractory to therapy. Lenalidomide plus bortezomib and dexamethasone (LBd) has received orphan designation in the United States and the European Union (EU) for the treatment of MM. The study is a prospective, randomized controlled, multicenter, three-arm design, phase III study, in which patients with refractory and recurrent MM after 3-6 cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone maintenance therapy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are recruited and randomized to receive lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone or bortezomib and dexamethasone as first-line treatment for patients with refractory and recurrent multiple myeloma.

A total of 419 patients were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin 80 mg/m2 with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) concurrently with BEV (10 mg/kg) or without BEV for six 21\u2010day cycles. The primary end point was progression\u2010free survival (PFS), and an independent review committee (IRC) assessed responses according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. At data cutoff, the median PFS was 5.5 months and 4.2 months in the BEV and non\u2010BEV groups (hazard ratio 0.75; 95% confidence interval 0.56\u20101.01; P=0.060). Overall survival (OS) and incidence of adverse events were comparable for both groups. The median IRC\u2010assessed PFS was 5.0 months and 4.2 months in the BEV and non\u2010BEV groups (hazard ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval 0.56\u20101.04; P=0.100), and the median IRC\u2010assessed OS was 14.8 months and 13.3 months in the BEV and non\u2010BEV groups (hazard ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 0.78\u20101.55; P=0.604). Adverse events were consistent with chemotherapy reported previously. In conclusion, the addition of BEV to platinum\u2010based combination chemotherapy did not significantly prolong PFS based on results of both IRC and investigators in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC.",

The study involves 20+ patients with diabetic macular oedema participating in the study with no intervention. Participants will be treated with ranibizumab or bevacizumab as per the medical standard. In the first year, blood samples will be collected from patients and analysed using ELISA-based multiplex assay to assess the level of inflammatory biomarkers. These samples will be collected at baseline (before commencing the standard of care treatment) and at 24 +/-2 weeks  and 52 +/-2 weeks. The aim of the study is to assess the level of inflammatory biomarkers in patients with diabetic macular oedema during the first two years of standard of care treatment (anti-VEGF) to see if there is a correlation with treatment response.\n\nExclusion criteria\n=================\nParticipants will be excluded if they have another underlying retinal condition such as AMD, retinal vein occlusion, angioid streaks or pathologic myopia. Participants will be excluded if they have uncontrolled diabetes  with an HgbA1c greater than 10%. Participants will be excluded if they are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Methods: Participants from five US studies (two on prostate cancer, two on breast cancer, and one on infertility) were randomized to receive ADT with goserelin or leuprolide acetate. Men had had castrating doses of goserelin (3.6 mg/month) or leuprolide (7.5\u201011.25 mg/month) during an open\u2010label phase of their respective trials. Women had had high or moderate doses of leuprolide for an average of 5 years. Data were collected by phone interviews (n=268). Data collected included demographics, history of chemotherapy, depression and sleep disorders, sexual function, psychosocial characteristics, and physical functioning. RESULTS: Patient experience with ADT differed by both cancer type and gender. Men receiving ADT reported feeling less sexually attractive, but less depressed and fatigued, than women receiving ADT. Men and women reported comparable impacts of treatment on libido but more men than women reported erectile dysfunction. Men reporting erectile dysfunction also were more likely to report a history of concurrent chemotherapy than men overall. Men were more likely than women to report that they had reduced or ceased their social activities and to report fatigue. Depression was identified as a common side effect of ADT, and it appeared to affect sexual functioning for men but not for women. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of behavioral and pharmacological interventions may address the problems faced by patients receiving ADT.",

Methods: The MATP (Minimum\u2010dose Aspirin in the Transdermal Patch) study was a prospective, randomized, open\u2010label study. The participants were assigned to three groups. Group I was given the Myleop patch as usual for 7 days. Group II was given an aspirin tablet of 75 mg/day. Group III (the trial group) was given both the Myleop patch (POP) and aspirin (AP) (75 mg/day) for 35 days. The end\u2010points were the incidence of pregnancy, the incidence of bleeding, the duration of bleeding, discontinuation of contraception and adhesive failure. Results: There were 42 participants who received the Myleop patch alone, 44 who used a combination of AP with the patch and 42 who used AP and the contraceptive coil. Women using the POP achieved an acceptable failure rate (AFR) of 6% (CI95%: 1.3\u201310.7) after 12 months of use. There were three pregnancies.

The incidence and mortality of lung cancer are increasing every year. Cisplatin-based comprehensive treatment has been the most widely used method for the treatment of lung cancer, but with the continuous development of immunotherapy in recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as a new anti-tumor therapy, and some clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy and safety. Based on the above literature, immunotherapy combined with conventional chemotherapy as a frontline treatment is an increasingly important research direction in the field of non-small cell lung cancer. However, for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who need comprehensive treatment of lung cancer, chemotherapy-related adverse reactions such as nausea and vomiting are very common, which can bring great pain and suffering to patients. Therefore, this study attempts to use a new 5HT3 receptor antagonist drug, NK-104, to optimize the side effects of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting in these patients. The investigator will use NK-104 to pre-treat antiemetic chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that begins or extends to 30 minutes before chemotherapy, and will also evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of NK-104.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Multi-center, Phase IIa, Open-label, Parallel-group, Single-dose, Sequentially In-patient Study of NK-104 in Patients With Lung Cancer\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nNausea and Vomiting by Chemotherapy\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: NK-104\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nStudy participants with the following inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in this study: All subjects volunteered to participate and",

Are there any specific caregiver or patient characteristics that would exclude participants from the study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThere is a need for psychotherapeutic interventions in family caregivers in palliative care due to the mental consequences of the disease trajectory. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) can be considered as a low-cost and time-effective intervention for improving sleep, thus managing insomnia in family caregivers. This study will investigate the effectiveness of two different cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) approaches in family caregivers. The study will also examine the impact of CBTi on patient symptoms, the caregiver-patient relationship, and the quality of life of both family caregivers and their care recipients.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nFamily caregiving in patients with advanced cancer is an increasingly important and cost-effective strategy to promote comfort, independence, and quality of life at home. Compared with oncologists, family caregivers have more frequent and continuous nursing interactions and closer relationships with patients. At the same time, cancer diagnosis and progression not only cause physical complications for patients but also bring about mental stress and family conflicts. These stressors, in turn, can lead to caregiver burden, depressive symptoms, and stressful caregiving conditions, affecting the health of family caregivers. Caregiver burden is associated with higher costs, prolonged hospitalization, poor treatment compliance, and increased mortality of cancer patients. As studies involving older adults show that insomnia is prevalent in cancer patients, there is an increasing recognition that sleep problems and their sequelae can impair cognition, worsen pain and fatigue, and lead to poor cancer-related quality of life. Caregivers who provide care for older cancer patients are at a higher risk of insomnia than other caregivers because they have more frequent nursing interactions; high levels of stress are often associated with insomnia symptoms in caregivers. The caregiver-patient relationship is mutually influential for both parties, and both may experience insomnia during caregiver-patient communication. Therefore, it is possible that interventions in family caregivers may improve both the sleep",

The control group did not receive rehabilitation training. The mini mental state examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function in the two groups before the operation and after 4\u00a0weeks of rehabilitation training. The data were analyzed by SPSS 24.0 software. Results: There was a statistical difference in cognitive function scores between the preoperative and postoperative control group. (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000). The MMSE scores in CCI patients decreased after the operation, and the decline in cognitive function was statistically significant.

Methods: This double\u2010blind, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled study evaluated 31 subjects with a history of headaches during prior IVIG treatments. Subjects were randomized to a treatment group or a control group, which included one 6\u2010g/kg IVIG treatment. The treatment group received TPM 100 mg orally 3 times per day as a pretreatment for the headache the day prior to infusions until 7 days post\u2010infusion. The control group received a matching placebo. Headache and migraine were evaluated immediately prior to each infusion and the first 3 days post\u2010infusion using a visual analog scale. Results: A total of 27 subjects (Treatment Group: N = 14 (7 males, avg. age 38.8 years; Control Group: N = 13 (9 males, avg. age 41.2 years)), completed the study. Headache severity was significantly lower within both groups following baseline IVIG infusion (P < 0.001). No significant difference in headache scores was found among groups during the first day of treatment (P = 0.733). On Day 2 through 7, the treatment group had a significantly lower average headache score when compared to baseline, while the control group reported a significant decrease on Days 1 through 3 of IVIG infusion.

We hypothesize that the time to recovery of at least 2 new lymphocytes per microliter in those with PCP with negative cultures will be shorter in the combination group than in the group receiving only intravenous zidovudine (for 4 weeks). In addition, we hypothesize that the frequency of the occurrence of treatment failure and the time to treatment failure will be lower in the combination group than in those receiving only intravenous",

Any thoughts or questions on this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nSeveral previous pharmacological investigations have identified a dose\u2010 and sex\u2010dependent effect of the opioid peptide substance P on the respiratory system. In order to characterize the neuronal projection of central substance P receptors in the ventral medulla and to investigate the differential role of the 5 N and 5 T subtypes on respiration, we studied substance P microinjection effects into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), an integral part of the cardiorespiratory control network, in three groups of anesthetized rats: (1) sham, (2) 5 N antagonist, (3) 5 T antagonist. Substance P microinjection into NTS abolished the anesthetic/hypoxic ventilatory response in sham group. Respiratory rate, tidal volume, and mean arterial pressure remained unchanged, indicating a generalized CNS inhibition by substance P in sham rats. Substance P injection in the 5 N antagonist group blocked the hypoxic response, while respiratory drive returned in the 5 T antagonist group. In conclusion, we suggest that substance P selectively modulates the respiratory drive through NTS. This effect is mediated by the 5 T substance P receptor subtype.",

The addition of immunotherapy for this indication has the potential to further improve outcomes. Methods: The study will compare the efficacy and safety of nab\u2010paclitaxel (70 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), gemcitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) with or without pembrolizumab (200 mg) as first\u2010line therapy in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. The primary objective is to evaluate the progression\u2010free survival (PFS) of the experimental arm, compared with the control arm. Secondary objectives include to evaluate other efficacy endpoints. Safety and tolerability measures will be assessed from treatment\u2010related adverse events (AEs). Results: The study will enroll up to 100 participants (50 in each arm). An interim futility analysis will be conducted when 50% of the primary endpoint was completed, approximately after 40 participants completed 6 months. Conclusion: The study will fill a research gap by exploring the potential role of immunotherapy in improving the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine\u2010based chemotherapy in untreated advanced pancreatic cancer patients.",

            "That's a valid point. Including patients with early-stage solid tumors could expand the patient population and potentially provide valuable insights. However, for this particular trial, the focus is on advanced solid tumors to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SNS-101 in patients who have exhausted standard treatment options. Including early-stage tumors might dilute the outcomes and make it challenging to assess the specific benefits of the investigational therapy. Does that clarify the rationale behind this criterion?",
            "Great. The next criterion is: \"Having received and failed or was intolerant to standard of care for advanced disease or not eligible for standard of care therapy.\" This criterion ensures that the patients included in the trial have exhausted all standard treatment options available to them. This helps in evaluating the potential benefit of the investigational treatment in patients who have limited or no other treatment options. Any thoughts or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "That's a valid consideration. Including patients who are not eligible for standard care therapy could provide valuable insights into the potential benefit of the investigational treatment in a broader patient population. We can certainly include them as a separate subgroup or cohort in the trial, to further explore the efficacy of SNS-101 in patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria for standard care. Does that sound reasonable to you?",

Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\" This criterion ensures that the patients included in the trial have good performance status, indicating that they are able to carry out daily activities without any significant limitations. This helps in ensuring that the patients are fit enough to participate in the trial and potentially benefit from the treatment. Do you have any suggestions or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "Understood. Moving on, the next criterion is: \"Adequate organ function.\" This criterion is necessary to ensure that the patients included in the trial have adequate organ function to tolerate the investigational treatment and undergo the necessary assessments required during the study. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Adequate organ function is essential for patient safety and reliable evaluation of treatment outcomes. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\" This criterion is important as it allows for the collection of tumor samples for biomarker analysis and assessment of treatment response. It helps in understanding the mechanism of action of the investigational therapy and identifying potential predictive biomarkers. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",

Recent findings, including work from our laboratory, suggest that the benefits of this medication may extend beyond bone, to improving muscle function. This may be through a variety of mechanisms including effects on estrogen receptors (ERs), particularly the membrane ER (mER), which are expressed in muscle. Recent findings from our laboratory and others have revealed that mER signaling has an important role in the innervation, vascularization and metabolism of muscle, with deficiencies in this pathway leading to muscle wasting in aging as well as in neurodegenerative and neuro-metabolic diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In this study, we will assess the impact of combination therapy with low-dose estrogen and vitamin D on markers of bone and muscle health in 30-59 year-old peri- and postmenopausal women. Objectives: Primary aim: To determine the effect of the combination of low-doses of estrogen and vitamin D, in combination with a multifactorial exercise and nutrition intervention (as a composite measure), compared to the multifactorial exercise and nutrition intervention, on total muscle strength, muscle mass and physical function in peri- and postmenopausal women.

            "Alright. The first inclusion criterion is that the participant must be a male or female aged 18 years or older by the time of study entry. This is to ensure that the participants are adults who can provide informed consent and have a stable medical history. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Moving on to the second inclusion criterion, the participant needs to be visiting a participating center for a routine clinical appointment. This ensures that we capture data from patients actively managing their severe asthma. What do you think about this criterion?",

The third inclusion criterion states that the participant must be willing and able to provide a blood sample for IgE and eosinophil levels determination as part of their routine clinical visit. This is necessary to assess eosinophil levels, which is crucial for severe asthma management. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Forty\u2010two healthy men between 30 and 60 years voluntarily entered the study. Subjects with the body mass index (BMI) over 24 kg/m(2) (n = 25, overweight/obese group) and those with less than 24 kg/m(2) (n = 17, normal weight group) underwent baseline measurements and were then randomly allocated into groups who exercised 4 h/week on a treadmill or on a stationary bicycle, at 40\u201060% of the maximal heart rate 3 times per week for 12 weeks. BMI, waist circumference, muscle strength, arterial stiffness, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the coronary endothelial function were measured before and after the intervention. In 10 days, the effects of single bouts of heavy intensity exercise (80\u2010100% of the maximal heart rate) were examined. In overweight/obese group, treadmill or cycling exercise significantly improved the coronary endothelial function, arterial stiffness and SBP only without significant changes in muscle strength and body weight. In normal weight group, exercise improved all the parameters studied, although changes in the coronary endothelial function and arterial stiffness were not significant. Acute exercise at above 80% of the maximal heart rate significantly improved the coronary endothelial function and SBP in both groups. These results suggest that long\u2010term light to moderate intensity exercise can improve arterial stiffness and SBP of overweight/obese people, and that the coronary endothelial dysfunction may not be reversed even by the improvements in arterial stiffness and SBP.",

Although there are many methods for gait assessment, some assessments focus on the subjective experience of walking, which may be subject to a variety of factors. This study investigated the reliability and validity of the Gait Sub\u2010Scale of the Functional Ambulance Category (FAC) scale, developed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), and its correlations with clinical evaluation and other gait measurement systems. METHOD: One hundred and seventeen stroke patients were recruited, with no significant difference between patient characteristics. Inter\u2010rater reliability and test\u2010retest reliability were evaluated. FAC scale scores were compared with timed two minimum (TM2M), six minimum (SM6M), and ten minimum (TM10M) walking tests, Fugl\u2010Meyer assessment (FMA), lower limb motor function impairment (LMFI) test, and motor score. RESULTS: FAC scale scores showed good inter\u2010rater and test\u2010retest reliability. The FAC scale scores were closely correlated with TM2M (r = 0.844; p < 0.001), r = 0.865; p < 0.001), and r = 0.854; p < 0.001; SM6M (r = 0.715; p < 0.001), FMA (r = 0.806; p < 0.001), r = 0.792; p < 0.001) and LMFI test (r = 0.742; p < 0.001), r = 0.871; p < 0.001), and motor score (r = 0.686; p < 0.001), respectively. The results indicate that the FAC scale is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing gait impairment in stroke",

Now that we have established that adults aged 70 and above with ovarian cancer are eligible for the study, the next criterion is that they have received no prior chemotherapy treatment for ovarian cancer. This ensures that the study population is representative of patients who may be undergoing trabectedin and PLD therapy for the first time. What about this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVE: Pre\u2010emptive transfusion (PT) has become established in the care of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with pain, but little is known regarding the clinical efficacy. This prospective randomized clinical trial aimed to study the effect of Pt on analgesia, emergency\u2010department (ED) visits, ED stays, ED resource use and hospitalizations. METHODS: Seventy\u2010four children with acute sickle crisis (ASC) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels below 6 g/dL were randomized to receive either Pt or control arm (no transfusion). The children randomized to transfusion had 3 additional hospital day admissions. RESULTS: Pt group had a decrease in the mean number of vasopressors' hours/day (94.0 \u00b1 235.2 vs. 33.6 \u00b1 283.0 hours/day, p=0.005) but a longer mean duration of hospitalization (13.8 \u00b1 11.3 days vs. 8.1 \u00b1 7.6 days, p=0.017) as compared to control. The difference in time between onset of crisis and study enrollment was greater in the Pt group as compared to the control (63.4 \u00b1 39.0 hours vs. 21.2 \u00b1 13.9 hours, p=0.028). CONCLUSION: This study did not demonstrate a statistically significant advantage for Pt in the treatment of ASC. Pt prolongs the stay but decreases the requirement of inotropes in the management of ASC. Pt should hence be reserved for children presenting in a pre\u2010terminal deteriorating state and may not be of benefit in mild to moderate ASC.\n\nIntroduction\nSickle cell disease (",

The primary objective is to know by experience / observation whether to perform a reverse shoulder prosthesis replacement surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or cuff-tear patients, it gives a 15% improvement in the range of movement if a deltoid release (split deltoid muscle) is performed in combination with a reverse shoulder prosthesis. For this, the movement of the limb to be operated on will be examined and recorded for the same rheumatic disease and operation and 6 and 12 months after the operation. The hypothesis is: that the deltoid section (split) and the reverse shoulder prosthesis replacement surgery allows an increase in the movement of the limb and allows the use of an assistive device less than before surgery (less pain).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nWe will conduct a prospective, controlled intervention study in parallel groups. Recruitment will include 20 patients with shoulder pain and immobile due to Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or massive rotator cuff lesions, who will be operated on with a reverse shoulder prosthesis, with the addition of a deltoid section in the group with deltoid section and another 20 patients with the same pathology but with only reverse Shoulder Prosthesis. Patients will be randomized. Clinical data will be taken one month prior to surgery. The outcome measures will be the pain scale (0-10) and movement in the operated shoulder which will be measured just before surgery, 2 months and 6 months after the surgical procedure.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nDeltoid Release for Reverse Shoulder Prosthesis Replacement: Does It Make a Difference?\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nShoulder Pain; Rotator Cuff Rupture\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure",

There is an inverse relationship between the dose of a drug used and the efficacy of that drug. Anesthesiologists may believe that lower dose of anesthetic or analgesic agents will help reduce the complications that may be associated with high doses. This has been extensively studied in sedation cases, in which administration of a 0.5 mcg/kg dose of Ketamine has shown to reduce intraoperative blood loss and provide analgesia and sedation equivalent to that of propofol. There are no studies that have compared intraoperative blood loss, sedation, pain relief during the intraoperative period, and intraoperative fentanyl requirement between a 0.5 mac/kg dose of Ketamine and 0.5 mg/kg of propofol administered in both the induction and infusion of anesthesia. This study will prospectively compare the combination of 0.5 mg/kg propofol with 0.5 mcg/kg ketamine as a bolus, compared to a propofol induction and infusion of the same rate throughout the operation, for the control. We hypothesize that the combination of 0.5 mg/kg propofol along with 0.5 mcg/kg ketamine has an advantage over propofol alone for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia, sedation, and anesthesia, and also decreases the amount of fentanyl used, and therefore lowers the intraoperative blood loss, without affecting the hemodynamic values.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nComparison of Propofol Plus Low Dose Ketamine Vs Propofol Alone for Anaesthesia and Pain Relief\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nChronic Pain, General An",

Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nWe planned this study to prove that it is not only appropriate but necessary to perform thrombectomy for patients with acute occlusion of the intracranial vertebrobasilar artery. And, we need to clarify what types of patients will benefit from this treatment by prospectively measuring the severities of ischemic lesions before and after treatment. (1) To assess the efficacy of thrombectomy for thrombosis of the vertebrobasilar artery by the functional outcome, and if there were no effect, to set our goal for the therapy from now on. (2) To assess the severity of brain infarction before and after thrombectomy by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI.) In addition, we would like to assess the severity of brain infarction in relation to the severity of neurological abnormalities, such as NIHSS and mRS. To perform this study, clinical data and images are collected and analyzed in a real-world setting. This study is planned as a retrospective study to prove the necessity of thrombectomy for thrombosis of the vertebrobasilar artery.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAt the time of admission to our hospital with vertebrobasilar artery thrombosis in patients with poor prognosis in the past, the doctor was reluctant to perform an operation due to concerns about the poor outcome after the operation and complications of the procedure such as brain hemorrhage etc. As a result, there was not enough data to judge whether the surgery was successful or not. However, we found that even large cerebral thrombosis could be treated successfully by thrombectomy, including the operation for acute cerebellar infarction, in recent years. Furthermore, we have the expectation that even the vertebral artery thrombosis can be removed because the vertebral artery is adjacent to the external carotid artery. It is thought that by accumulating clinical data and analyzing it, we will be able to determine whether thrombectomy for the vertebral artery is possible and establish a treatment strategy."

What do you think about this inclusion criterion? \n\nstudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nNorthwestern Memorial Pritzker Trauma Center (NPMTC) is a regional center for 34 counties in northern and central Illinois. It is a busy Level I trauma center. The trauma center receives 4,000 patients per year and has an annual average bed capacity of 75% full. Despite best evidence based therapies, trauma patients are at risk for secondary injuries that can potentially influence their recovery such as infection or sepsis, urinary tract infections, catheter associated infection, pneumonia and pressure injuries. Preventive strategies that are evidence based, yet easy to apply to daily clinical protocol for nurses and physicians, are lacking. The investigators' hypothesis is that implementation of hand washing using a portable alcohol based disinfectant that is carried by the patient and applied every hour from morning until evening will reduce overall healthcare associated infections (HAIs). Secondary goals are to assess whether there is reduced rates of central line associated blood stream infection (CLABSIs) and decreased length of stay. To further improve infection prevention and control, the investigators will implement another intervention; the investigators will incorporate a daily, electronic survey where nurses and physicians will be able to report their compliance of the hand-carrying protocol. A third study site (LPCH) with the same objective will be included. This will serve to assess generalizability to different units, such as the trauma center and general medical units.

What do you think? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground and Rationale: The most frequent and important complications in ICU patients are bloodstream infections or centralline\u2010associated bloodstream infections, which are known as central\u2010line associated blood stream infections. These complications are associated with high mortality rates and increase the ICU burden. In the ICU, the average nursing workload is considered to be between 3\u20135 care events per hour, and this number is expected to increase due to the growing severity of illness and the increasing need for intravenous therapies. ICU nurses often care for multiple patients, which has led to overcrowding and the use of multitasking, but this has not necessarily improved patient outcomes. In our case study, we observed that central\u2010line care bundle implementation had a significant effect on patients, and it led to greater safety in the ICU. Despite these findings, central\u2010line care bundle implementation needs to be more standardized to ensure consistent results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of central\u2010line care bundle implementation in the ICU on the quality and safety of care. Methods: The study was a before and after comparative study. In the first place, 100 randomly selected patients who stayed in the ICU for less than 24 hours were enrolled as a control group. In the next stage, 100 more patients were selected, and they received the care bundle intervention. Then, both control and intervention groups were assessed in a before and after study. The primary outcome was the rate of central\u2010line associated bloodstream infections, and the secondary outcomes included the ICU length of stay, ICU mortality rate, and 30\u2010day mortality rate. Results: Among the 200 patients included in the study, there was no significant difference in mortality (p = 0.354). The central\u2010line associated bloodstream infection rate was found to be lower in the intervention",

In early-stage Colorectal cancer, surgery is the preferred treatment. The proximal colostomy is a common procedure to relieve the symptoms of disease.After operation, the postoperative management of the digestive tract is very important, while the current postoperative management methods are controversial, and the blood gas indexes of patients may appear hypoxia and acidosis during this periodIt was previously proven that acute hypercapnia could prevent hypoxia and acidosis in the body. The aim of this experiment is to study the effects of acute hypercapnia on the blood gas indexes of patients' post-operative digestive tract management.Who can participate?Adult patients who undergo surgery for Colorectal cancer with proximal colostomyWhat does the study involve?Patients will be randomly assigned to the two groups. The control group will receive routine post-operative management, while the intervention group will undergo acute hypercapnia after operation.Blood samples will be collected and analyzed to measure the blood gas indexes of patients.What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?There may be no immediate direct benefits for participants. However, the results of the study could contribute to improving the post-operative management of patients. The possible risks include discomfort during blood collection, but they are minimal and reversible.Where is the study run from?Fuzhou General Hospital (China)When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?July 2021 to July 2023Who is funding the study?Fujian Medical University (China)Who is the main contact?Li Luying, llly",
            "Agreed. Including patients with ASA classification II-III ensures that the patients are relatively healthy and allows for a controlled study. We can now discuss the last inclusion criterion. \n\n2022-12-21\n2022-12-21\n\nResults and Problems Encountered\n-----------------\nStudy Completion: 2022\n\nStudy Compliance: Unknown\n\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPatients who have a history or presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and will undergo lobectomy are candidates for this trial. The purpose is to determine oxygen saturation (SPO2) with different concentrations of oxygen during and after the operation.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nIn this prospective comparative observational cohort study, 51 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] 1-3 and with American Lung Association [ALA] grade of COPD as C or above) scheduled for lung resection are included. Patients are divided into two groups: a control group and a study group. The control group receives supplemental oxygen at 5 L/min; the study group receives supplemental oxygen at a rate determined by the oxygen saturation (SPO2) during and after the operation to maintain SPO2 at 92%, at 88%, lower than 88%, and at 90% during inspiration. The primary outcome is the rate of decline in oxygen saturation (SPO2) during and after the operation. For patients in the control group, the SPO2 decreases as the FIO2 increases; however, in the study group, the SPO2 decreases as the FIO2 increases but not to a significant degree. In this study, we found that compared with supplemental oxygen at a fixed flow rate of 5 L/min, oxygen supplementation at a rate determined by the SPO2 during and after the operation to keep the SPO2 at a certain level during inspiration can maintain a stable SPO2. Compared with supplemental oxygen at a fixed flow rate of 5 L/min, oxygen supplementation at a rate that adapts to the SPO2 during and after the operation to maintain SPO2 at a certain level during inspiration can more effectively maintain adequate oxygenation in patients with COPD.",
            "That's a good suggestion. Including patients with a BMI between 18.0 and 30.0 ensures consistency in the size and weight of the people involved, which can help in comparing the effectiveness of the treatment.

Adherence to postoperative guidelines can be challenging for patients due to a number of factors, including pain, mobility limitations, and psychological issues such as anxiety and depression. A recent study found that 27% of patients fail to adhere to postoperative physical activity guidelines after total hip arthroplasty (THA), which can lead to poorer outcomes such as pain, decreased mobility, and increased risk of complications. The literature also suggests that adherence to postoperative physical activity guidelines is associated with a range of patient-reported outcomes, including pain, functional status, and quality of life. In addition, recent research has shown that patients who are able to adhere to postoperative physical activity guidelines may experience more significant improvement in their functional status than those who do not. These findings highlight the importance of developing interventions that promote adherence to postoperative physical activity guidelines and support patients in their recovery after surgery.\n\n\nMethods\n\nThe objective of this research is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effect of a virtual reality (VR) based postoperative physical activity intervention on outcomes in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). The study will involve a randomized controlled trial with participants randomized to either the intervention group or the control group. For the intervention group, the VR intervention will consist of an app-based virtual reality (VR) program that includes interactive activities and games tailored to promote adherence to postoperative physical activity guidelines. Participants will be asked to engage in the intervention daily for two weeks after their surgery. For the control group, the participants will receive standard postoperative instructions and follow-up. In both groups, patients will be evaluated at baseline, two weeks, and six months post-surgery to assess their physical activity levels, pain, functional",

Excluding patients with diagnosed mental illness or cognitive impairment, and those taking certain medications, ensures that the study results are accurately reflective of the effects of Dexmedetomidine on anxiety and depression in patients with colorectal tumors. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. What are your ideas on excluding patients with a history of alcohol or drug dependence or abuse? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground Dexmedetomidine, an alpha\u20102 adrenergic agonist, has been shown to have sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic properties [1\u20103], but its effects on perioperative anxiety and depression in patients with colorectal tumors remain unknown. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in relieving perioperative anxiety and depression in patients with colorectal tumors. Methods This was a double\u2010blind, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, clinical trial conducted at a tertiary referral academic hospital between February 2014 and July 2015. The study included patients aged 18 years and older undergoing elective colorectal tumor resection, with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification I or II. Patients were randomized into two groups: the dexmedetomidine group and the control group. The dexmedetomidine group received 0.5 \u03bcg/kg dexmedetomidine and the control group received saline as an intravenous bolus 15 minutes before administration of anesthesia. The primary outcome was the changes in the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for anxiety and depression from baseline to 15 minutes after operation. Results A total of 60 patients were included in the study, with 30 patients in each group. Demographic variables were comparable between the two groups. There was a significant decrease in VAS scores for anxiety and depression in both groups from baseline to 15 minutes after operation, but there was no significant difference between the groups. Conclusions Dexmedetomidine did not significantly reduce perioperative anxiety and depression in patients with colorectal tumors. Therefore, the use of dexmedetomidine",

Subjects with a spinal cord injury with neurogenic detrusor overactivity and neurogenic detrusor underactivity were enrolled. LT03 4 mg weekly, 8 mg weekly, 4 mg monthly and 8 mg monthly were explored. Safety and tolerability were evaluated by monitoring AEs, vital signs, and ECG parameters, whereas the primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in average voided volume at week 8. Secondary variables were safety and tolerability. Twenty\u2010one patients were enrolled: 68.5% were male (15); mean age 39.1 \u00b1 15.4 yr; 23.8% wheelchair dependent (5). Eighty percent of subjects were on concomitant catheterization. In total, 15 subjects achieved 907 adverse events, of which 61.6% were of mild intensity, the rest were moderate. Seventy\u2010eight percent were considered to be treatment\u2010related adverse events, and 11.9% resulted in withdrawal. None of the adverse events was life\u2010threatening or resulted in hospitalization. Two events of peripheral edema (1.9%) and one event of cardiac arrhythmia (0.5%) resulted in treatment interruption. There were no significant changes in vital signs and ECG parameters. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or pulse rate. No laboratory abnormalities occurred. A total of three deaths occurred, two sudden deaths with no known cause and one due to sepsis, after the first injection. Overall, there was no significant change in average voided volume with all treatments (all, \u201024.1 ml; p",

Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the effects of a 12\u2010week moderate\u2010 to high\u2010intensity (MHI) resistance training program on fat\u2010free mass (FFM), metabolic status (e.g., blood glucose level, lipid profile, inflammation factors, and resting metabolic rate), and body composition on older adults in an outpatient clinical setting. Methods: Over a 36\u2010week period in 2 phases, a 12\u2010week double\u2010blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted of MHI progressive resistance training in community\u2010dwelling older adults (65\u00a0years or older) with a wide range of physical abilities. The exercise program consisted of 3 sessions per week, with 10\u201315 repetitions of 6\u20138 exercises. The exercise program was designed over a 12\u2010week period to increase physical activity. The intervention was controlled using a randomized controlled trial protocol. This study was divided into three phases. Phase 1A (Baseline)\u2010phase 2B (52 weeks of resistance training)\u2010phase 3A (12\u2010week observation period) included 105 participants; phase 1B (16 weeks observation period)\u2010phase 2C (36 weeks of resistance training)\u2010phase 3B (12\u2010week observation period) included 15 participants, and phase 1C (24 weeks observation period) only included 1 participant. Conclusion: Overall, the present study provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of progressive resistance training in clinical practice. The results demonstrated that a 12\u2010week MHI program enhanced the FFM of the legs, lower insulin, and improved muscle tone, particularly in the legs and shoulders, among community\u2010dwelling older adults (65\u00a0years or older). In addition, it highlighted the importance of providing MHI resistance training at all intensities",

Many measures are used to relieve patients' psychological stress, but the effect is not stable and satisfactory. It is suggested to develop a good non-drug treatment method to control and alleviate the anxiety and depression of patients to improve the quality of perioperative treatment, thus reducing the occurrence of related complications. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of various preoperative treatments on postoperative depression and anxiety level of patients and to further explore the specific factors affecting the postoperative anxiety and depression level of patients.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPerioperative anxiety and depression is a common experience in patients, and postoperative anxiety and depression may become an important complication. It affects about 40% of patients undergoing major or invasive treatment and surgery, and seriously affect the postoperative recovery of patients, increase the physical and mental stress of patients, prolong the recovery time after operation, and even affect the prognosis and quality of life of patients. It has been shown that anxiety and depression in postoperative patients have a strong association with the operation itself, the condition of the patient, the anesthetic drug used and whether the operation is elective or emergent. Various factors such as gender, age, and education level may affect the level of postoperative anxiety and depression. Anesthesia type and its method of administration may also be affecting factors for some operations. But the results are still unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of various preoperative treatments on postoperative depression and anxiety level of patients and to further explore the specific factors affecting the postoperative anxiety and depression level of patients. We will conduct a prospective cohort study based on prospective randomized controlled trials.

Can you explain this criterion briefly? What is the intent of adding the history of ILD associated with immunotherapy to the inclusion criteria? \n\nAnswer: In the first part of the criterion, we're looking for patients who have already received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, and are likely to receive it again in the future. The history of ILD associated with immunotherapy is added to exclude patients who have previously experienced adverse effects from immunotherapy, which may lead to an increased risk of severe complications with subsequent treatment. Can you provide examples of some of the previous adverse effects that the patients may have experienced? \nAnswer: Previous adverse effects could include pneumonitis, dyspnea, cough, and other respiratory symptoms.

It is an anti-tumor agent that triggers a person's natural immune system. It works by binding to a group of proteins called CXCR4, which are found on different types of blood cells, including immune cells. The study will test whether the drug can help to reduce the growth and spread of cancer in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. The study will evaluate both the safety and effectiveness of the drug at various doses, as well as the optimal dose to be used in future studies. The study will be conducted in about 150 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have not responded to standard treatment or have progressed after treatment. The study is divided into three stages: a dose selection phase, an efficacy and safety evaluation phase, and an extension phase. In the dose selection phase, patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of four different doses of CXNTRAX (300 mg, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg), or a placebo (an inactive substance that looks the same as the actual drug). \nDuring the efficacy and safety evaluation phase, patients who respond well to treatment or show no signs of disease progression will receive CXNTRAX at the previously determined optimal dose, while patients who do not respond well to treatment or show signs of disease progression will continue to receive their assigned dose of CXNTRAX or placebo until their condition worsens or they experience unacceptable side effects. In the extension phase, all patients who have completed the effic",

This study was conducted to determine risk factors for local recurrence following surgery. Patients with primary cutaneous melanoma treated with complete excision of the primary lesion were included in a prospective randomized, controlled trial of adjuvant therapy with isotretinoin. After randomization, patients were treated for 8 months with oral isotretinoin. All clinical and laboratory data after surgery, including histopathologic evaluation of the original specimen, were collected and analyzed to identify risk factors for recurrence. During the 6\u2010month follow\u2010up, 72 (18%) patients had 73 local recurrences, while 751 (17%) recurred at a later time. The frequency of local recurrence was higher in the lymph node\u2010negative patients (20%) than in those with lymph node involvement (4%) (P < .001). An ulcerated primary melanoma was a significant risk factor for local recurrence (P < .001). Patients who had a recurrence before the end of follow\u2010up (< 6 months) had a greater than 2\u2010fold increase in risk for recurrence at a later time (hazard ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.2\u20104.3; P < .001). Patients with local recurrence had a significantly greater tumor thickness (4.8 mm vs 3.8 mm; P = .006) compared with those with no recurrence.

Aims and Objectives: A study was carried out to diagnose, review and study GST presenting to us in a tertiary care hospital. Our objective was to make a retrospective study of all the giant cell tumours we have come across from the year 2018 and till date and study their clinical presentation and outcome when treated with surgical excision. The study is a descriptive study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were subjected to clinical examination, CT\u2010KUB (Computed Tomography scan of kidneys, ureters and bladder) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) for pre\u2010operative work up and diagnosis. A detailed history was taken from each patient and detailed physical examination was carried out. Clinical and radiological finding were correlated with definitive histopathology. The results were analysed statistically and were calculated as percentages. RESULT: GST occurred in females (79.2%) more often than in males (20.8%): median age 50 years. The commonest site of presentation was the ileocecal region of the large intestine in the right iliac fossa. The abdominal wall was involved in the 1st case. Presenting duration of symptoms was around 8 months. The tumours were giant size raging from 4 to 12 cm in diameter, and appeared to be well\u2010defined with a smooth contour on CT scan. The imaging features of CT and MRI scans and the histological pictures of the resected specimen were compared, and there was a good correlation of the clinical features with the imaging.

This study was conducted to evaluate the 3\u2010year survival ratio for patients with localized nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal carcinoma who underwent surgery, postoperative radiotherapy, and adjuvant therapy.METHODS: The subjects of the present study were 190 patients with localized nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal carcinoma who underwent surgery, postoperative radiotherapy, and adjuvant therapy from January 2000 to December 2009 at our hospital. The patients were divided into two groups: group A (<60 years of age, 60 patients), and group B (>60 years of age, 130 patients). Survival rates and prognostic factors for 3\u2010year survival were assessed for both groups.RESULTS: In group A, 31 (51.7%) patients developed distant metastases after initial treatment. The 3\u2010year survival rate was 83.9%, with a 5\u2010year survival rate of 75.6%. In group B, 84 (64.6%) patients developed distant metastases after initial treatment. The 3\u2010year survival rate was 78.5%, with a 5\u2010year survival rate of 73.9%. The 3\u2010year survival rates were significantly lower in the group older than 60 years of age compared to the control group. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the following variables were significant prognostic factors for 3\u2010year survival: tumor size, extracapsular extension, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, tumor stage, and treatment modality.CONCLUSIONS: The 3\u2010year survival rate in patients younger than 60 years of age was higher than that in patients older than 60 years of age with nasophary",

This is to ensure that the physiotherapy intervention is tested in a population that is not likely to experience a recurrence of these conditions. I also think it makes sense to exclude patients who are currently pregnant. This is to avoid any potential risks to the mother and the fetus. What are your thoughts? \n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nA single\u2010visit physiotherapy intervention (PTI) immediately following catheter removal reduced the median time to ambulation compared with control. While a substantial majority of participants with the most minor of venous thromboembolism (VTE), who were at the lowest risk of recurrent VTE, had similar rates of early ambulation as the control group, those in the PTI group were more likely than the control group to be classified as having clinically significant thrombosis and those in the PTI group were more likely to have more distal DVT. Therefore, it is possible that there may be both greater benefit and harm with the PTI for patients with the most minor VTE. Aspects of the initial PTI\u2010such as timing and dose\u2010may require further exploration.",

Patients will be randomized after the first screening day in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 90 days of daily home-based treadmill exercise plus dietary counseling or usual care alone. Patients will be allocated in random blocks of four.\nThe process of randomisation will be performed by opening the opaque, sealed envelope once the patient has been deemed eligible for inclusion and provided written informed consent.\nThis is a single-center study with one therapist assigned to enrollment (i.e., physician or physician assistant), data collection (outcome measures), and randomization.\nRationale: A randomized controlled trial design is the most reliable form of evidence for testing cause and effect, as it helps minimize bias. In this study, randomization helps reduce bias by ensuring that participants in both groups will be equally likely to receive the study intervention or placebo.\nRandomization is important for the study to determine any effect of the intervention being tested on the outcome measures and to ensure that any effects observed are due to the intervention and not due to other factors (such as individual differences).\n\nIntervention\n=================\nIntervention 1: No Intervention. The group will receive no further intervention after being contacted by an investigator for recruitment and the collection of informed consent.

The study subjects are recruited from gastrointestinal surgeons at two hospitals. They will be patients undergoing elective major bowel resection, colonic resection, small and large. Exclusion criteria are: Body-mass index (BMI) greater than 50 kg/m2. Terminal disease. Known impairment of the gastro-intestinal tract (e.g. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, Malabsorption syndrome or Celiac disease). History of a mental disorder, active abuse of drugs or alcohol. Hepatic failure. Chronic infection of the urinary tract, kidneys, lungs or spleen. The gastro-intestinal surgery, small or large, is done without an ileostomy. The length of the surgery is more than 6 hours. The type of bowel resection is extended colectomy or extended enterectomy. Patients undergoing colo-anal anastomosis or trans-anal rectosigmoidal resection can be excluded from this study from the beginning. No patient can participate more than once as a subject. The study participants will be registered on the day of scheduled surgery together with baseline data such as BMI, body weight, operation, expected blood loss, and the like.

Current guidelines recommend the use of anticoagulants for patients with AF and increased risk of stroke. However, recent studies have suggested that aspirin monotherapy may be a suitable alternative to anticoagulants in patients with stroke risk scores between 0 and 2. A recent study found that in elderly patients with AF and recent history of minor stroke or transient ischemic attack, aspirin monotherapy resulted in a significant reduction in intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) compared to warfarin monotherapy. However, no studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of aspirin monotherapy in Korean AF patients. In particular, there are limited data available on the use of aspirin monotherapy in combination with antiplatelet agents in these patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin monotherapy in Korean AF patients with low stroke risk. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective, open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial will randomly assign 603 patients with AF aged 75 years or older who were not candidates for oral anticoagulant therapy to the aspirin monotherapy group (n=301) or the aspirin + clopidogrel group (n=302). The primary outcome of the study will be the combined rate of composite outcomes of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) during a 1-year follow-up period. The study will also assess the risk of ICH, major bleeding, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in both groups. The results of this study will help determine the optimal therapeutic strategy for stroke prevention in Korean AF patients with low stroke risk.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nStudy Design This is a randomized, prospective, open-label, single-center study investigating the efficacy and safety of aspirin monotherapy versus aspirin and clopid",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of multimodal analgesia in combination with ultrasound\u2010guided transversus abdominis plane (U\u2010TAP) block for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing TTE.DESIGN AND METHODS: 60 patients were randomly allocated to either the multimodal analgesia group, or the analgesic pump group. The patients in the multimodal analgesia group received TAP block with 10 ml 0.5% ropivacaine as well as celecoxib 400 mg, pregabalin 300 mg, acetaminophen 1.5 g administered two times a day and tramadol 100 mg twice a day as a multimodal analgesic regimen from postoperative day 0 to postoperative day 3. The patients in the analgesic pump group had a ropivacaine pump with morphine as well as an intravenous PCA pump for postoperative analgesia. The primary outcome was visual analog scale (VAS) score. Secondary outcomes included dosage of the opioid, sedative drugs, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), sleep quality, patient\u2010controlled sedation (PCS) score, and the length of hospital stay.RESULTS: Compared with the analgesic pump group, the VAS pain scores were significantly lower in the multimodal analgesia group on postoperative day 3 (P = 0.022).The total morphine consumption in the multimodal analgesia group was higher than that in the analgesic pump group on postoperative day 3 (P = 0.014).

In the planning of FSABR, dose constraints for organs\u2010at\u2010risk and rectal dose reduction were imposed. The plan quality and dosimetric outcomes of prostate and rectum for all techniques were compared. For all three techniques, the V95 of the prostate gland was 100% (100%). The V92 of the rectum 4 mm from the prostate\u2010rectum interface was 39%, 40%, and 39% for 3DCRT, IMRT, and FSABR, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in mean rectal dose for different treatment plans which ranged from 36 Gy with 3DCRT to 42 Gy with IMRT. The equivalent uniform dose (EUD) parameters were similar between 3DCRT and IMRT. The mean EUD D98 (D98) of prostate ranged from 104.0 (104.0) Gy with 3DCRT to 94.2 Gy (104.7 Gy) with IMRT; the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) parameters were similar between 3DCRT and IMRT. 3DCRT is a feasible technique for delivering 3DCRT in the planning of FSABR \u2010 IMRT\u2010based treatment plans in adverse intermediate to intermediate risk prostate cancer. Dose constraints for V92 were similar for all techniques. Rectal dose reduction was achieved by employing IMRT and FSABR planning algorithms",

Does this sound reasonable? \nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nTo improve the efficiency of wound healing, a new and more precise imaging technology, microvessel ultrasound imaging, has been developed. This technology is used to track the flow of blood to the wound site, enabling a more detailed understanding of the healing process and the factors that influence it. The main purpose of this study is to compare the healing process of chronic leg ulcers with and without microvessel ultrasound imaging. Chronic leg ulcers are wounds that do not heal, or if they do, they heal very slowly. They are a challenge for healthcare professionals because the rate of recurrence is high. These ulcers affect patients' quality of life. This study compares the wound healing process with microvessel ultrasound imaging compared to the historical control. The main goal is to evaluate whether the use of this new imaging technology significantly improves wound healing. The study will be conducted in two phases: a prospective phase with patients receiving treatment, and a retrospective phase with patients receiving standard treatment. The study will include approximately 220 participants, each with a leg ulcer. In the prospective phase, a group of participants will be randomly selected and will receive treatment with and without microvessel ultrasound imaging. The other group of participants will receive only standard treatment. The microvessel ultrasound imaging will be performed at each visit, and data will be collected on wound healing and other clinical signs. After the end of the prospective phase, the retrospective phase will start. A group of previously treated patients will be selected and will undergo microvessel ultrasound imaging. This group will have previously followed a treatment program, and the results will be compared to those obtained by the prospective group.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe study is aimed at the optimization of wound healing in patients affected by chronic leg ulcers.

We retrospectively analyzed data on 31 patients who had undergone skin grafting between January 2014 to December 2018. Diagnoses were non\u2010melanoma skin cancer, trauma, or infection. We performed a blinded analysis on images taken using the Vessel View\u2122 HD microvessel ultrasound scanner. We compared our microvessel ultrasound measurements with conventional clinical criteria such as wound area, ulcer duration, and clinical presentation.RESULTS: On linear regression univariate analysis, increasing capillary area was associated with improved STSG take rate (P = .003), as was increased perfusion area (P = .005). Increased density (mean: 0.45), capillary area (mean: 0.23 cm), and perfusion area (mean: 0.26 cm) had strong positive correlations with clinical diagnosis at the time of graft. However, microvascular ultrasound metrics had poor correlations with clinical diagnosis after STSG. The AUC for ROC curve analysis indicated that microvascular density (0.629) had modest accuracy in predicting grafting outcome. The microvessel technology had significant discriminatory power when correlated with the grafting technique and anatomic location.CONCLUSIONS: Our microvessel imaging technology offers promising accuracy compared to clinical observations in evaluating wound beds and predicting grafting outcomes. Microvascular density showed modest accuracy in predicting grafting outcomes, with improved accuracy when specific patient groups are considered.",

Analysis of data from the Hypertension Detection and Follow\u2010up Program shows that antihypertensive treatment induced regression of aortic size in patients with initial diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) between 95 and 105 mm Hg. A greater magnitude of regression was seen in patients with lower initial DBPs. The mean (\u00b1 SD) DBP at the beginning of the study was 97.5 \u00b1 5.9 mm Hg; the mean (\u00b1 SD) yearly DBP changes before treatment were 5.0 \u00b1 14.8 mm Hg. Regression did not develop after 5 years of treatment and was only observed in patients with lower initial DBPs. This study shows that aortic size is lower after 21 years of antihypertensive treatment in men with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension who present no evidence of clinical atherosclerosis. The data indicate that there is an inverse relationship between DBP at the time of drug initiation and magnitude of aortic regression and that the magnitude of aortic regression over 5 years of follow\u2010up can be reduced by increasing the initial DBP levels.",

Methods: An observational, hospital records review study was conducted on primary angle\u2010closure glaucoma patients treated with low\u2010dose MPD from January 2014 to December 2017 at one institute hospital department. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of short\u2010term MPD in lowering IOP, preventing visual field loss, and preventing attacks during the preoperative period. Primary angle\u2010closure glaucoma is generally treated by minimizing intraocular pressure (IOP). Steroid preoperative treatment is a common therapeutic option for IOP control. However, the standard MAP\u2010600 method of steroid treatment has a risk and contraindication to the patient's health. As a result, a low\u2010dose MPD was chosen as a substitute for the standard MAP\u2010600 method.

However, animal handlers are often unaware of the welfare of the animals, creating a lack of empathy and attachment and resulting in less humane treatment. A solution to this problem is the application of human\u2010animal interaction training with animals. Interaction training is a process of learning and socialization for novice handlers and has been applied worldwide to help them understand the needs, communication, and behavior of animals. An example of such a program can be found in the European Union. It was developed to encourage handlers to think of animal welfare by providing educational modules on the biology and behavior of lab animals in addition to training to create a relationship with them. This interactive training program enables handlers to observe the animals' behavior to assess whether it is consistent, develop positive interactions with the animals, and develop a better attitude towards animal welfare. The training modules included in the program are based on the principles of social and cognitive learning. The modules address topics such as animal housing, diet and supplements, environmental enrichment, handling, and restraint. They are structured in a step\u2010by\u2010step manner starting with the understanding and definition of animal ethics, continuing with communication strategies with animals, and including tips on the appropriate handling of laboratory animals. The content of the training modules is adapted to the species\u2010specific needs and requirements of the animals, which helps to build a foundation for a positive relationship between the handler and the animals. The training program also emphasizes the importance of providing species\u2010specific enrichment to enhance animal welfare and well\u2010being. Animal handlers should be provided with a positive work environment, be motivated, and receive regular supervision to ensure the success of the program. The effectiveness of the training program is evaluated by monitoring the behavior and health of the animals, the attitude of the handlers towards animal welfare, and the feedback from animal welfare officers.

In addition, there is a lack of study of the interaction between protein, energy, exercise, and physical function in elderly frail women. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of nutrition support (protein and energy) and exercise on physical function in elderly frail women undergoing radical gastrectomy for total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The primary study hypothesis is that nutrition support (protein and energy) and exercise will increase the levels of ghrelin, leptin, GH/IGF-1, and testosterone and improve body composition. The secondary study hypothesis is that the implementation of protein and energy nutrition support with exercise will reduce levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein, and oxidative stress, which are important indicators of frailty, promote immune function and quality of life in elderly frail women, and improve their physical function.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvaluation of the Effect of Exercise and Nutrition Support (Protein and Energy) on Improving Body Composition and Physical Function in Elderly Frail Women Undergoing Gastric Surgery for Total Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nGastric Cancer\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Nutrition Support\n* Other: Exercise\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Age \u226565 years of gender female patients with gastric cancer and body mass index (BMI",

The same 10 patients will furthermore undergo digitization of the dento-gingival arch to evaluate a workflow in which intraoral scans are used to generate a digital model from which only the overdenture base will be CAD/CAM-fabricated; In 10 patients with moderate to advanced PIM, dento-gingival scans will be used to evaluate the outcomes of a fully digital impression and manufacturing workflow. This will be the same as in the first 10 patients but only the overdenture base construction will be CAD/CAM-based. Two different implant abutments will be investigated, the customized abutment (C-AB) and the screw-retained abutment (S-RA), that will be CAD/CAM-fabricated in advance.

Micronutrient deficiencies remain prevalent among children in developing countries and the effect of micronutrient on children has been increasingly recognized. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the effect of multiple micronutrients on linear growth, anthropometric measurements and neuropsychological development, especially among young children in developing countries. The investigators have already performed a small cross-over study showing the effect of taking zinc and Vitamin A on the growth of children. This study aims to investigate the growth effect of a comprehensive vitamin and mineral supplement on the growth of children in developing countries. The investigators hypothesis is that the daily supplementation of children aged between 18 months and two years of age with a special combination of vitamins and micronutrients improves the growth of the entire group.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEfficacy on Growth and Development of Child Following Multivitamin-mineral Supplementation : an Adaptive Open Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nGrowth\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Dietary Supplement: Vitamin C, Vitamin A and Zinc Supplement\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Age: 12-28 Months A child will be eligible if at least one of the following is present (a) Z score of height-for-age (HAZ) less than or equal to minus (\u2212) 2 or (b) low weight-for-age (",

Such implants are considered best suited for the lower jaw where the bone is thinner. 1) This study will determine the effectiveness of using cognitive 3D (3 dimensional) printed framework instead of metal framework. Cognitive 3D systems are designed to respond precisely to touch and adjust to their physical environment. This is called a \u2018soft touch\u2019 implant. 2) The study will also investigate the bone around the implants over a 5-year period to identify long-term changes in bone and implant stability.Who can participate?Adult males or females between the ages of 18 and 70 who need at least two of their lower teeth to be extracted.What does the study involve?Participants will be randomly allocated to implants with either a digital cognitive 3D printed framework or a metal framework. They will be monitored for a period of 5 years. Participants will receive overdentures during the follow-up period to prevent bone resorption.This study is being conducted for ethical reasons. If the control group's dental prosthesis has a relatively low failure rate, it will indicate the success of the new digital cognitive 3D printing technology that was used for the study group.

The study will compare this new type of implant to the currently available overdenture. The new type of implant has a conical connection between the implant and the overdenture bar, which is hypothesized to have better fixation and greater retention of the overdenture. The feasibility of this new implant design will be evaluated by comparing the bone height, the bone width, and stability, of the previously inserted dental implants with the newly inserted dental implants.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe present randomized cross-over study will compare the new type of dental implant to the currently used overdenture. To this end, a computer-generated randomization table will be used to assign the 64 patients to Group 1 and Group 2. The new type of dental implant will be implanted in the mandible of group 1 (test group) and dental implants according to the protocol of the conventional mandibular overdenture will be implanted into the edentulous mandible of Group 2. After implant insertion, the same overdenture will be constructed. In both groups (test and control) overdenture is provided with a standard metal bar and plastic abutment, which is covered with denture resin, and overdenture retention is achieved with five palatal metal clips. The difference between the two groups is that the overdenture is supported by 4 standard dental implants in the conventional group and by the new type of implant in test group (conical implants with a 3.5 mm x 6.0 mm diameter and a 7 mm length as well as conical connection between the implant and the implant bar) (Figures 1-2).

Prostate cancer is a common cancer in men and commonly manifests with elevation in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. A large percentage of these patients present with high nuclear grade histology (i.e., Gleason score \u2265 7) and/or clinically detectable disease as measured by standard-of-care imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unfortunately, standard-of-care imaging commonly misses sites of occult disease and is not always able to identify which patients have low, intermediate or high-risk disease. For example, in biochemical recurrence after definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or radiotherapy) for prostate cancer, approximately 30-60% of patients will experience biochemical recurrence on standard-of-care imaging. However, after treatment, over 90% of men will continue to have a rising PSA and most will go on to have progression of their cancer and metastases.

The current study aimed to understand the effects of a LCHF diet on cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients with dyslipidemia. Methods: Twenty four obese individuals aged between 30 and 50 years with dyslipidemia were randomly placed in the intervention group that followed a LCHF diet (13 males, 11 females) and the control group (11 males, 13 females). Both groups followed the same energy and physical activity regimen while the intervention group followed a LCHF diet (carbohydrate and protein 15\u201020 and 15\u201020%, respectively, of calories) in addition to the energy and physical activity regimen. The energy restriction regimen was conducted for 8 weeks. Results: The LCHF diet led to a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) and weight (8% reduction, P<0.001) with a significant increase in body lean mass and a slight increase in bone mineral density (P<0.001).

However, the current guidelines provide no evidence for determining whether preoperative or postoperative functional training intervention is a cost-effective treatment for chronic low back pain patients. Methodology: This protocol of this randomized controlled trial was developed by referring to the SPIRIT guidelines. We intend to conduct a prospective randomized controlled study with 100 chronic low back pain patients treated by spine surgery. Participants will be randomly divided into two groups: the intervention group and the control group. Both groups will receive a 12-week rehabilitation program. Additionally, the study will explore the relationship between changes in the function of the cervical and lumbar spine and changes in outcomes after rehabilitation. Conclusion: This randomized controlled trial will be the first prospective study to investigate the effect of a preoperative and/or postoperative rehabilitation program on chronic low back pain patients treated by surgery.

What do you think? \n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract:\nCooled radiofrequency (CRF) ablation is a minimally invasive thermal ablation technique used for the treatment of liver cancer. Contrast\u2010enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is used to evaluate the ablation margins, however, it is time\u2010consuming and costly. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used to monitor the CRF ablation process but may not be routinely available. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether diffusion\u2010weighted imaging (DWI) could be a possible alternative method. DWI and contrast enhanced imaging (CEI) were used for the analysis of treatment effects and treatment completion in 60 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who received 106\u2010146 degree Celsius CRF ablation. Liver MRI sequences performed at pre\u2010treatment, 1\u2010month, 3\u2010month, and 6\u2010month follow\u2010ups were evaluated for the presence of lesions, perfusion and metabolism within 10\u2010mm\u2010radius ROIs using DWI and CEI. DWI showed significant changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of ablation regions with treatment duration (P<0.001). CEI showed significant changes in the number of ablated tumors (P<0.001), perfusion parameters (P<0.001), tumor diffusion restriction (P<0.05), and metabolism (P<0.01) of ablation regions with treatment duration. There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of CEI and DWI in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. When compared to CEI, DWI was an easier method to quantify the treatment effect. Our study suggests that both CEI and DWI are valuable tools for CRF ablation tumors, and DWI can be used as an easy\u2010to\u2010use alternative to evaluate tumor ablations.",
            "Fantastic. Shall we discuss the exclusion criteria now? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for approximately 25% of all breast neoplasms, and it is a heterogeneous disease. Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and low\u2010medium grade DCIS are not invasive. ADH could be regarded as a precursor of DCIS and has a higher risk of progression to invasive breast cancer. The appropriate management of ADH in the breast is still unclear. According to current research, most ADH is usually followed up with clinical breast examinations and mammography for 2 years. However, recent research suggests that vacuum\u2010assisted excisional breast biopsy may be a more suitable interventional treatment for ADH to prevent the progression of DCIS. Recently, we conducted a study to assess the efficacy of vacuum\u2010assisted excisional breast biopsy in patients with ADH. Objective: this retrospective study aimed to investigate the diagnostic precision, therapeutic efficacy, and prognosis of vacuum\u2010assisted excisional breast biopsy in the treatment of ADH patients. Methods: Between June 2020 and June 2022, 79 patients diagnosed with ADH were consecutively enrolled at our center and classified into two groups based on the therapeutic methods used, namely, the conservative therapy group and the surgery group. A total of 73 patients' pathological results at 6 months follow up and the 7\u2010year recurrence rate of the ADH lesions were recorded and analyzed. Diagnostic accuracy was measured by the Cohen kappa index. Results: Among the 79 patients, 65 and 14 patients were treated with conservative treatment and surgery, respectively. After 6 months of follow\u2010up, the sensitivity of conservative treatment and surgery were 92.31% and 100%, respectively, while the specificity was 75.00% and 66.67%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy was increased compared to that evaluated at the time of admission. The 7\u2010year cumulative recurrence rates of ADH in the conservative treatment group and the surgery group were 60.38% and 21.43%, respectively. Conclusion: In this study, vacuum",

In this study, we will use pulmonary function tests or spirometry, which involves breathing into a machine using a mouthpiece or a face mask.

In addition to spirometry, we may also consider the use of diffusion capacity testing or blood measurements to examine lung injury.

Secondly, we aim to study the effect of prophylactic strategies on RI occurrence.METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we reviewed all patients with hematological malignancy who received HSCT at a university hospital between 2012 and 2021 to determine the incidence of RI in the first 6 months post\u2010HSCT. We used univariate and multivariable analyses to identify factors associated with RI occurrence.RESULTS: A total of 303 patients with hematological malignancy, who received HSCT, were included in the study. Ninety patients (30.0%) were diagnosed with RI in the first 6 months post\u2010HSCT. Univariate analysis found that the use of the prophylactic agents imatinib, acyclovir, and valgancyclovir, as well as the acquisition of neutrophil engraftment later, were associated with RIF occurrence. The multivariate analysis confirmed these results.CONCLUSION: We found that a relatively high incidence of RIF occurs after HSCT. This study shows that the prophylactic use of imatinib, acyclovir, or valgancyclovir may increase the risk of respiratory infections after HSCT. It suggests that further studies are warranted to determine the effects of prophylactic treatment on RIF occurrence after HSCT.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nHematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an essential treatment for many hematological diseases, including leukem",

Weight loss and weight change were reported as means of changes in weight at 3, 6, and 12 months, depending on the time each intervention took to complete. The mean pre-intervention weight reported for each study was divided by 3, 6, or 12 to compute change over 3, 6, and 12 months.

The treatment of meningococcal septicaemia is less well defined. The decision to treat septicaemic patients with cephalosporins with or without penicillin is based on historical data and the local incidence of meningococcal infection. Many patients receive treatment with cephalosporins with penicillin to cover a possible bacteraemia with either Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae, which are also common in neonates. No clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of this treatment. This prospective, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, open-labelled, active-controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous penicillin in addition to cephalosporin for the treatment of meningococcal septicaemia in neonates. Neonates born in or referred to participating centres from birth to 28 days of age, and who satisfy the inclusion criteria will be eligible for the study. After informed consent has been obtained from parents/guardians, randomisation will be determined using a computer-generated, permuted-block, allocation sequence. Patients with the disease being treated in participating units will be randomised to one of two groups. Group 1 includes patients who will receive ceftriaxone plus amoxicillin (standard of care in the Netherlands) while Group 2",

Methods: Patients at the time of type 1 diabetes diagnosis (n = 8) and 1\u20103 years post\u2010diabetes diagnosis (DAN stages 0\u2010III, 84 patients) were studied. In addition to established methods of autonomic function testing, the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive, objective cardiac biotensors to detect early cardiac dysfunction were assessed.

COPD is characterized by expiratory flow limitation that is not fully reversible. Currently, the use of inhaled LAMA as the sole controller in patients with COPD is controversial and evidence is contradictory. Our initial pilot study in patients with COPD found that inhaled LAMA use without inhaled corticosteroids was associated with better lung function and fewer COPD exacerbations. However, whether LAMA alone without inhaled corticosteroids improves the overall prognosis is unclear. The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of LAMA use as the sole controller in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD without a significant history of corticosteroid treatment.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether inhaled LAMA use results in improved lung function and reduced exacerbation frequency and disease severity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), without the use of inhaled corticosteroids as a controller medication. The primary endpoint is the change in post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) following LAMA administration. The secondary endpoints are the change in exacerbations (any and moderate or severe), the change in post-bronchodilator forced vital capacity (FVC), and the change in disease severity.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nAssessment of Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonist Therapy Alone on the Outcomes of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCOPD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Tiotropium\n* Drug: Fluticasone/Tiotropium\n* Drug: Placeba\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria",

Breath control using a mouthpiece can reduce patients' ventilation and thus is suitable for IA. Our aim was to observe ventilation under IA in patients who wore a mouthpiece or a conventional face mask during ambulatory surgery. Methods: One hundred and seventy\u2010six patients aged between 20 and 55, who were expected to undergo general anesthesia\u2010based anesthesia, were registered and divided into the mouthpiece group (A) using an orodisc and the face mask group (B) using a face mask. In both groups the patients underwent anesthesia and surgery following the same protocol, and blood gases were observed. Postoperative nausea and headache were also evaluated on the morning following surgery. Results: Compared with the face mask group, the mouthpiece group showed slightly lower pH, lower pCO2, and higher bicarbonate. There was no significant difference in PaCO2 between the two groups. Postoperative nausea occurred in one patient and one patient had slight headache. Conclusion: The mouthpiece is more effective than the face mask for ensuring inhaled anesthetic gas is absorbed during anesthesia, with only minimal differences in PaCO2.",

The study will use cognitive training exercises that target processing speed and working memory, both important cognitive abilities in the cognitive reserve theory that supports the ability to compensate for damage to the brain. The study will involve a baseline assessment, randomization into a control group or an intervention group, and follow-up assessments at weeks 4, 8, and 12. The control group will receive no intervention, while the intervention group will participate in cognitive training exercises for 12 weeks. The participants will be asked to complete a series of cognitive tests at each assessment timepoint, which will evaluate their memory, executive functions, and processing speed. The cognitive training program will be delivered entirely online, making it an accessible and attractive option for young adults, in contrast to the limited availability of other methods, such as cognitive rehabilitation sessions conducted in a clinic. The investigators predict that the intervention group will show significant improvements in their cognitive abilities, particularly in terms of working memory and processing speed, compared to the control group. Improvements in cognitive abilities may be especially pronounced among students who lack sleep due to their busy schedules, as better sleep can enhance memory and attention. However, it is important to note that there is a lack of data on the effectiveness of cognitive training in students. The investigators plan to use a two-sample t-test to evaluate the treatment effect and a linear mixed model to examine changes in cognitive abilities over time.

Is there anything else you would like to share regarding the study design? \nAbstract:\nPurpose: Palliative care services are increasingly recognized to play an important role in the care of individuals with acute and chronic conditions, such as cancer. However, the effects of palliative programs on functional outcomes are unclear. We evaluated the effect of palliative care referrals on functional status for older individuals with chronic disease and cancer. Method: Adults with chronic disease or cancer on multidisciplinary clinic lists at three academic centres were randomly assigned to receive either a standard of care or a coordinated palliative care program focusing on quality of life. Change in function was assessed using the Geriatric Dependent Function Index (G\u2010DF) score, a valid and reliable functional outcome score. The trial will allow for assessment of baseline function and changes in function 6 and 12 months post randomization. The primary analysis will compare GDF scores of the two groups over time. A per\u2010protocol analysis will allow for an assessment of the effects of the intervention on a variety of important outcomes. The final study analysis will be conducted when data collection is complete. Conclusion: Our study will provide information regarding whether palliative care can effectively delay the deterioration of function in vulnerable patients with chronic diseases and cancer.",

Patients with retinal detachment or other serious ophthalmic complications, previous treatment with ganciclovir or foscarnet, and patients with CMV retinitis requiring treatment with both intravenous and oral CDV were excluded from analysis. Each patient in this non\u2010randomized study was assigned an oral CDV dose based on the measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) or the body surface area (BSA). The initial oral CDV dose was 100 mg twice daily (bid) until blood levels of ganciclovir and acyclovir reached steady state (4 days) and then either 100 or 200 mg bid. The first 15 patients received a dose of 200 mg bid. The last 15 patients received a dose adjusted to be 0.5 times the creatinine clearance (CrCl). The CDV serum concentration at steady state was measured by a fluorescence polarizing immunoassay (FPIA). The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were measured in 33 patients.RESULTS: The mean oral CDV serum concentration at steady state was approximately 10\u2010fold lower than that reported previously for intravenously administered CDV. The mean clearances (Cl) corrected for a 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) were 48.8 +/\u2010 44.9 L/h (ranging from 12.1 to 128.4 L/h) in patients receiving a 100 mg bid dose",

Methods/Principal Findings: The study was a two\u2010armed parallel\u2010group randomised controlled trial. The intervention group received an educational booklet regarding the pathology of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and access to on\u2010demand, self\u2010care advice. The control group received usual care. 871 patients participated in the study. The intervention led to a large treatment effect for both Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and patient satisfaction. This effect size was larger than for most other interventions for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms. Conclusion: The results suggest that a cost\u2010effective model combining advice on how to live effectively with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and access to on\u2010demand professional self\u2010care advice can be an effective and low\u2010cost way to combat Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.",

What are your thoughts on this criterion? \n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nGastric resection syndrome (GRS) is a frequent complication of gastric cancer surgery and results in a decrease in quality of life and functional capacity of patients. This syndrome is characterized by epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, early satiety, heartburn, anorexia, and weight loss. It is attributed to the removal of the upper stomach, which plays a role in providing both motility and gastric-related hormonal responses for digestion in the stomach. Many gastroenterological researchers are investigating this syndrome, but there is no standardized treatment for it. Enteral nutrition (EN) has been shown to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of GRS and maintaining the nutritional status of patients after surgery. However, intravenous infusion of EN (i.v. EN) has been less studied in terms of its benefits in treating GRS. The main objective of this project is to investigate the effects of i.v. EN in patients with GRS, and our hypothesis is that it may alleviate the symptoms associated with GRS, improve nutritional status, and enhance quality of life after surgery.The secondary objectives are to compare the tolerability and satisfaction of i.v. EN with oral EN in patients with GRS and to assess its impact on postoperative symptoms, nutritional status, weight loss, and quality of life. The results of the study will provide important information on the effect of i.v. EN in patients with GRS, and the findings may lead to a new standard of care for these patients.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground and rationale: Gastrectomy is associated with significant changes in gastric acid and pepsin secretion, which can lead to gastric dysfunction, delayed gastric emptying, and nutritional deficiencies. These effects are exacerbated in patients with gastric cancer, leading to the development of gastric resection syndrome (GRS). GRS is a common postoperative complication characterized by epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, ab",

There are two primary outcomes: proportion of patients without complications 1 month (ACRONIMS, Achilles tendinopathy, osteoarthritis, etc.) and the EuroQol (EQ\u20105D) score. The study is designed as an RCT. There are two primary endpoints: the number of participants with complications and the EQ\u20105D\u20103L score at 1 month.

            "Thank you for your cooperation in defining the inclusion criteria for this research. Now, let's focus on the exercise protocols that participants will follow in this clinical research trial. \n\nThe exercise protocols will involve a combination of resistance training and aerobic exercise using different levels of Blood Flow Restriction (BFR). As mentioned earlier, BFR involves placing a tourniquet around the upper arm during exercise, restricting blood flow to the muscles while allowing a partial flow of oxygenated blood. This method has been proposed to help stimulate muscle growth and strength adaptations with reduced exercise intensity and volume. \n\nPlease note that the exercise protocols may vary based on the individual's fitness level, age, and medical status. \n\nFor resistance training, participants will follow a circuit of six exercises: bench press, triceps extension, leg press, leg curl, assisted pull-up, and assisted push-up. The resistance level will be adjusted according to the individual's fitness level and tolerance to ensure that each participant can properly manage the exercise effort. For the aerobic exercise, participants will perform treadmill walking or running at various speed and intensity levels, adjusted based on the participant's fitness level and tolerance. \n\nPlease note that the research team members and certified fitness professionals will closely monitor and guide the participants throughout the exercise protocols.",

Do you have any questions or concerns about this criterion? \n\nStudy design\n=================\nThis is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, monocentric, controlled study.\n\nDescription\n=================\nThe present study will be conducted in the Department of Neurology of the University Hospital Center of the University of Nantes (TU-Nantes). The latter includes a Neuromuscular Assessment Center (CANM), an ultra-fast muscle conduction center, a neuromuscular electrodiagnostic and imaging platform, and a nerve repair and nerve regeneration laboratory and platform. 50 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and mild diabetic neuropathy, aged between 40-60 years, are included in the study. In this population, the frequency of polyneuropathies varies between 5 and 15%, a prevalence that increases between 40 and 60 years. We have a particular focus on neuropathy, as it is the most frequent long-term complication of diabetes, with a prevalence of about 50% at 20 years of diabetes. In France, this type of polyneuropathy affects 2.6 million patients, with an incidence of 4,000 new cases per year. The etiological basis of this sensory-motor neuropathy is a reduction of nerve nutrients related to poor metabolic control, but also to the presence of non-carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and adiponectin act on nerve fiber survival, regeneration, and function. 50 patients will receive a daily dose of 60g of fish oil containing omega 3. The study of nerve function (thermal sensitivity, vibration threshold, muscle strength, nerve conduction velocity) will be performed before and after fish oil supplementation (at 1 and 3 months). 50 patients will receive a daily dose of 1g of vitamin B1. Our team is one of the few centers in France with a unit of nerve regeneration and an expertise in",

Any concerns or queries about this criterion? \n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an intervention of an intensive exercise program associated with a dietary and nutritional guideline on blood glucose levels in participants. Two different types of blood glucose measurement will be assessed: a single assessment and daily follow-up of each participant using the SENSIVA\u2122 Flash blood glucose monitoring system (NG) and capillary blood glucose meter. The investigators expect that the intervention improves blood glucose levels in participants with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe study seeks to examine the effects of an intensive exercise program and a dietary and nutritional guideline on blood glucose levels in individuals with prediabetes. The intervention will include both physical and nutritional components, as supported by scientific literature. A controlled group is being used as a comparison, and data will be collected in order to verify whether these participants are able to adhere to the dietary and nutritional guidelines without following the exercise program. All participants will receive nutritional, educational and physical training based on a standard assessment of their individual condition and lifestyle. Participants will be allowed to exercise within their personal capabilities, whether that means moderate or vigorous intensity. The dietary and nutritional guidelines, as well as the exercise program, are based on recommendations from international health organizations, which emphasize that everyone has the right to healthy, sustainable and tasty food, which is accessible and affordable, and that physical activity must be accessible and tailored to everyone. Participants will be asked to keep a diary to monitor dietary intake and record the time and duration of each exercise session, as well as any symptoms related to their physical training sessions. Participants will also have their body composition and weight measured, as well as be photographed and record their blood glucose levels with the NG and capillary blood glucose meter. Blood glucose levels will be evaluated over 24 hours as an average value, and additional samples will be taken during peak exercise. Participants will be given the opportunity to",

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nMicroorganisms in the urine of urodynamic catheterized urinary tract obstruction patients are often unclear, and the proportion of these microorganisms is generally related to the blockage progression of urinary tract obstruction and even urinary tract stenosis. We can determine the severity of inflammation in patients with urinary tract obstruction by combining urine flora with urine culture and analysis of differential leukocyte count .However, clinical management of patients is usually based on bacterial cultures, which do not involve specific microbiological analysis. There is increasing evidence that inflammation in UTis is caused not only by the presence of microbes, but also by the immune response to their presence and products. In this study, we will take samples from 87 male and female patients aged 18-70 with lower urinary tract symptoms, enriched with patients with non-bacterial prostatitis, but without a urodynamic diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction or bladder obstruction to find out the pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms that cause prostatitis. The relationship between urinary tract inflammation and the proportion and type of pathogenic bacteria will be discussed, so as to provide a new idea to improve the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract obstruction and refractory non-bacterial prostatitis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe prostate gland is the largest of the male reproductive system, and is the core unit of male genitourinary system. It is surrounded by a glandular layer of fibrous connective tissue, and its structure is similar to that of the male perineal sinus. It is prone to infection and disease, and the inflammatory conditions, if left untreated, will lead to chronic inflammation of the prostate and even proliferative hyperplasia. Prostate cancer has become one of the most common malignant tumors in men. As a result, its symptoms can be similar to those of chronic inflammation. Therefore, accurate diagnosis is the most important prerequisite for the treatment of prostatitis. The clinical diagnostic criteria of urinary tract obstruction in the West are complex, and there is no standard diagnostic method. Commonly used diagnostic methods include urod"

We selected 383 cases with onset of asthmatic bronchitis or the diagnosis of asthma before the age of four years from a cohort of 173 infants who were enrolled for birth cohort study in 1991. The control group was made up of randomly selected 383 infants without childhood asthma, matched and individually paired with cases by sex and gestational age. We performed interviews of the mother via telephone and questioned them about socioeconomic status, prenatal and perinatal factors.

Recent research has shown that personalization of exercise plans may be advantageous over individualized exercise plans. We present a comparison of the effects of individualized exercise plans and different types of personalization of exercise plans at the start and end of a 12\u2010week exercise intervention on fitness level and motivation among individuals who are sedentary or only occasionally exercise. Methods This open\u2010label parallel\u2010group randomized clinical trial recruited sedentary or rarely active men and women through flyers and social media. Three hundred and two (41 women, 231 men) participants were consecutively recruited and screened in the department of clinical sports medical science at Ghent University Hospital, Belgium, where they completed questionnaires and a fitness test including measurement of endurance and muscular strength. They were subsequently randomized to individualized exercise plans (Group 1), exercise plans adjusted to their fitness level (Group 2), or exercise plans adjusted to their genetic profile (Group 3) using genetic tests. Group 1 completed a control test at the 6\u2010 and 12\u2010week appointments only. Groups 2 and 3 received exercise plans adjusted to endurance and muscular strength results and genetic test results performed at the start and end of the exercise intervention, respectively. Results Groups 2 and 3 showed moderate\u2010to\u2010large increases in peak oxygen uptake, with Group 3 showing a larger effect size than Group 2 (+1.42 \u00b1 1.52 mL\u22c5kg(\u20101)\u22c5min(\u20101)) vs. +0.88 \u00b1 1.76 mL\u22c5kg(\u20101)\u22c5min(\u20101) (p=.001). In addition, they showed high levels of motivation and engagement in the exercise intervention. Genetic testing and exercise plan personalization revealed genetic polymorphisms and low fitness levels. The fitness tests revealed large interindividual differences.

Any thoughts on this criterion? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe Edison\u2122 System is a newly-developed therapy device with an investigational new drug, using a completely novel energy source (HIFEm, a form of ultrasound) to target tissue, causing targeted molecular disruption that results in tissue death and necrosis. The HistoSonics Edison\u2122 System is indicated for localized tumor ablation. HIFEm and histotripsy work to create a focused area of increased temperature and pressure in the tissue that leads to cell rupture, which is known as cavitation. In the case of the Edison\u2122 System, the goal is to induce necrosis of the tumor while minimizing unintended damage to surrounding tissues. The Edison\u2122 System will be used to ablate target lesions with a diameter of 3-5 cm through a multi-step process. Subjects will undergo CT-fluid perfusion imaging, MRI, and diagnostic biopsy followed by a diagnostic angiogram and a planning arteriogram. After the planning arteriogram and a temporary closure device is placed, subjects will undergo the Edison\u2122 Histotripsy procedure(s), consisting of a maximum of three treatments in a single procedure session. Safety and Efficacy of the HistoSonics Edison\u2122 System for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be evaluated by using MRI and other imaging techniques at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and every 4 weeks until the tumor is ablated, or at least 3 months post-procedure.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe HistoSonics Edison\u2122 System for Treatment of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Using Histotripsy - Pilot Clinical Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nPancreas Neoplasms, Ductal Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas",

The Ultrasound Platform includes three main elements: the main power source, the clinical workstation computer and monitor, and the controller. The Ultrasound Transducer uses a therapeutic ultrasound modality (i.e., histotripsy) to generate high-intensity, ultrasonic pulses and direct the pulses into the area of the organ to be treated. The primary use of the HistoSonics Edison System is to ablate or destroy the desired tissue.\nDuring the procedure, a specially trained physician will use the Histotonics Edison System to apply the ultrasound pulses to the tissue that is to be treated.

This is an open-label, single-center, single-arm, Phase II feasibility study. Patients will undergo initial HT treatment, followed by the administration of local ablation therapy and systemic chemotherapy over 3 months. Patients will be treated initially with up to two treatment sessions per week. Treatment will continue every 4-6 weeks until HCC progression or development of post-operative complication. Patients who experience HCC progression will continue to receive chemotherapy alone.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nWe intend to enroll up to 20 patients in this trial. Patients will be treated for an estimated total of 8-12 weeks. Patients may experience adverse events related to the procedure, such as pain, bruising, and post-operative complications. Overall, 20 patients will receive a total of up to 6-12 sessions of HT. Up to 72 weeks of follow-up will occur after the last HT or chemotherapy treatment, whichever occurs last. Patients will be evaluated at baseline and at each HT session for safety and treatment efficacy. Safety is based on recording adverse events and vital signs.

These tests were developed based on our prior studies using in vitro assays. They are more accurate, reliable and rapid than the current laboratory techniques. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from hospitalized children under 2 years of age. Each specimen was tested by three different methods; in vitro assays with labeled protein substrates, culture, and PCR. Fluorescence microscopy was employed for observation. RESULTS: The results of our in vitro assays coincided well with data from the other two culture\u2010based methods. With the use of fluorescent substrates, we successfully detected different kinds of bacterial proteases from 97% of isolates of P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae that were routinely cultured from patients. In general, our assay was more sensitive than culture, and was also successful on samples collected from patients whose throat swabs were negative. CONCLUSION: Using our assays, bacterial proteases from 30% of S. pneumoniae serotypes were also observed in some specimens, confirming the significance of the protease detection assays in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory tract infections.",

It assesses five key aspects of menopause-related quality of life \ufffd hot flashes, sexual function, physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, and social functioning. 3.7 What are your thoughts on this efficacy criterion? \n\nThe Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ) is a highly reliable and valid measure of menopausal symptoms and quality of life. Its five subscales \ufffd hot flashes, sexual function, physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, and social functioning \ufffd provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of menopause on overall well-being. By using this measure, researchers can accurately evaluate the effects of the Luo-Bu-Fu-Ke-Bi-RI Pill on menopausal symptoms and quality of life. 3.8 Based on the trial design and efficacy criterion, do you have any concerns or suggestions? \n\nBased on the available information, the trial seems to be well-designed and appropriate for evaluating the effects of the Luo-Bu-Fu-Ke-Bi-RI Pill on climacteric syndrome.

Up to 90% of patients with COPD have an abnormal respiratory pattern during sleep including periods of complete absence of breathing (apnea), periods of hypopnea, or periods of increased breathing effort. Compared to healthy controls, these features are more prevalent among patients with COPD as compared to healthy controls. In addition, COPD patients have significantly less effective chemoreflexes to low blood oxygen (hypoxia) during sleep compared to healthy controls. Poorly functioning chemoreflexes during sleep increases apnea frequency. The investigators have established a clinical trial to test the hypothesis that breathing a higher fraction of exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) during sleep may improve sleep quality in patients with COPD. This study will enroll 12 patients with COPD during a baseline visit and study measurements will be performed in the sleep laboratory at night 2-4 days later. The main aims are to: measure the impact of breathing a higher fraction of CO2 on sleep quality determine whether the higher fraction of CO2 improves sleep quality and breathing patterns during sleep determine whether the higher fraction of CO2 improves arterial oxygenation and blood pressure during sleep\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Effect of Hypercapnia on Sleep Quality in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Obstructive Sleep Apnea\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nSleep Disordered Breathing, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: carbon dioxide enriched mask\n* Device: carbon dioxide deficient mask\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Subjects must have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease (obstructive bron"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost\u2010effectiveness of the treatment of patients with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) with oral vs. IV antibiotic therapy and with a comparison between the two modalities. Design and method. One hundred forty\u2010nine patients with ONJ, including 128 with surgical and 21 without surgical intervention, were divided into two groups for antibiotic therapy: oral and IV antibiotics. The cost of the treatment was calculated by the number of visits, laboratory examinations and the number of intra\u2010oral procedures until the patient had complete healing. A cost\u2010effectiveness analysis (CEA) on the basis of the decision tree model using Monte Carlo simulation was applied in this study. Results. The total cost of the treatment of patients was statistically different between two groups, in which the IV group cost $2,550 vs. $1,450 for the oral group. The results showed that all the patients received IV medication in this group, but the oral group achieved comparable remission rates. The effectiveness in healing was slightly more pronounced in the oral group, but the difference was not statistically significant. This model was validated by using bootstrap analysis, which found that the mean cost\u2010effectiveness ratio for patients who had surgery without antibiotic therapy was $89,031.62 while that for patients who had surgery with antibiotics was $310,301.

Adequate hemostasis during endoscopic submucosal dissection will significantly prevent intraprocedural bleeding and post-procedural complications. A novel technique for hemostasis during endoscopy is the use of \u03b2-cyclodextrin-methyl methacrylate (CM) powder. This is a prospective and observational study that includes 80 patients with endoscopically resectable colorectal polyps undergoing ESD in our endoscopy unit. Primary outcome include immediate and delayed blood test results, and histologic results. The secondary outcome is to investigate the safety and efficacy of this novel hemostasis for ESD. All participating patients will be provided with a CM powder and apply it to the mucosal defect after ESD. Hemostasis will be evaluated using direct observation and vital signs.

The researchers will follow participants for up to one year and evaluate the success of the intervention.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nDespite being one of the most common periodontal surgeries, post-surgical dehiscence and fenestrations are relatively common. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) has recently been used for soft tissue regeneration techniques. Although there have been case reports and reports of clinical trials of PRF used for periodontal flap dehiscence and fenestrations, there are several limitations in the existing literature. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness and success rate of topical PRF application on post-operative defects after periodontal flap surgery and to follow the participants for up to one year to evaluate their success rates. To do this, the study will include consecutive patients aged 18 to 60 years with one or more posterior teeth requiring flap surgery for treatment of periodontal disease with pockets greater than 5 mm and vertical bone defects, and who have no other contraindications to participate in the study. The study will involve two stages. The first stage will be a pilot study of 10 participants who will receive PRF treatment. If successful, the second stage will involve a parallel randomized controlled trial of up to 100 participants with at least 50 receiving PRF treatment (intervention group) and 50 receiving conventional care, including an antibiotic washout and grafting of a resorbable collagen membrane, with a 3-month follow-up. The investigators hypothesize that PRF application will significantly increase the regeneration of soft tissue and hard tissue in post-operative defects after periodontal fl",

With the increasing importance of vision screening, the need for rapid and accurate vision screening tools that could be used in routine medical care is becoming ever more important. The purpose of this study was to provide some quantitative evidence for the validity of an alternative approach to vision screening to supplement the traditional tests. For 210 children and adolescents (mean age 9.1\u00a0years; range 4\u201017), visual acuity was measured at an individual, comfortable viewing distance with a standard vision screening tool and with a new screening tool. The new screening tool, a printed and a handheld object, was placed against a background at increasing angles and distances from the child's dominant eye. The child could look at the screen and then could push a button when the image was no longer clearly identifiable. The results suggest that the new screening tool has acceptable validity as a supplementary screening test for use in school settings and when vision screening with the traditional method is not possible.",

Are there any other drugs involved? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The aim of this study was to retrospectively review patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated in an academic setting. Methods: Records of 481 patients diagnosed with mCRC from 1997 to 2014 were reviewed. Median follow\u2010up was 5.1 years. Results: Median patient age was 64 years, and 316 (65.5%) were males. The average number of prior chemotherapeutic regimens was 2.5, and the most common agents were infusional fluoropyrimidines (94.8%) followed by irinotecan (82.7%), oxaliplatin (75.1%), and cetuximab (25.5%). For the entire cohort, overall survival (OS) was 25.2 months. A total of 115 patients (24.0%) received targeted therapy alone, 16 patients (3.3%) received chemotherapy only, 314 patients (65.2%) received both modalities, and the remainder were not treated for their metastatic disease, but were either untreated or treated with investigational agents. Median OS for the entire cohort was 25.5 months, and OS was not statistically significant after adjustment for clinical covariates. Among those receiving targeted therapy alone, the group with EGFR inhibitor plus BRAF inhibitor was associated with a shorter OS (17.8 versus 44.1 months P<0.01). Conclusions: In this large and heterogeneous group of patients with mCRC, outcomes differed widely based on treatment regimens. This retrospective analysis found that targeted therapeutics can be equally effective when considering patients with or without chemotherapy as frontline therapy.

We investigate whether the recruitment maneuver, performed after positive\u2010end\u2010expiratory pressure (PEEP), can improve oxygenation after reversing the muscle paralysis in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to either the recruitment maneuver group or the control group (25\u00a0patients each). After the muscle relaxant was stopped, the recruitment maneuver was performed at 40 cmH2O for 40 seconds followed by 5 cmH2O for at least 2\u00a0minutes in the recruitment group. All patients in the control group were ventilated with the same pressure. The difference in oxygenation between the two groups was assessed immediately after stopping the muscle paralysis and after the end of the procedure. RESULTS: The recruitment maneuver did not show any significant difference in arterial oxygen partial pressure or SpO2 from baseline to the end of the recovery period. CONCLUSIONS: A recruitment maneuver after reversing muscle paralysis did not improve oxygenation in patients after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

The overall mortality of endocarditis at 6 months is 15-30%. This prospective randomized controlled trial of early tricuspid valve surgery vs medical management of endocarditis, performed by the same tricuspid valve surgical approach utilized at Stanford, compares early surgery vs medical management and assesses its impact on clinical risk factors and outcomes in patients with active tricuspid valve endocarditis without complications.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nDespite improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, endocarditis involving the tricuspid valve in humans continues to remain an important cause of major morbidity and mortality. Tricuspid valve surgery is associated with high procedural risks and is often precluded by the presence of systemic infection, low cardiac output, and other comorbid conditions often associated with tricuspid endocarditis. Because of these associated risk factors, current recommendations for the treatment of tricuspid valve endocarditis in humans state that surgical treatment should be deferred for all patients early in the course of disease, with few exceptions. The use of appropriate antimicrobial therapy has improved the outcomes associated with bacterial endocarditis of the tricuspid valve, yet tricuspid valve surgery remains a necessity in about 60% of patients due to persistent abscess formation, systemic infection, endocarditis despite adequate antimicrobial therapy, persistent sepsis, hemolytic anemia, or ventricular failure.

The primary objective is to demonstrate technical success, defined as the absence of significant regurgitation on all echocardiographic views, at 30 days postimplantation, after treatment with the TTS by Tricident, Inc. (TCI) according to prespecified criteria. This exploratory study will assess, for the first time, TTS performance in a homogenous population with severe TR, including the safety, efficacy, and utility of the TTS in this particular patient population .\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study will involve implantation of the TricValve System (TTS), developed by TCI, in 4 patients (N=4), in the setting of high risk surgical subjects or patients that are either too high risk for open heart surgery or are not eligible for another available device. The TTS is a transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) device being developed by TCI as a solution to severe tricuspid regurgitation, which currently affects 10-15% of the population and has limited treatment options.

Thirty\u2010eight patients who underwent TUMT were randomized to receive amino acid infusion over 8 h or 4 h before surgery or 4 h before and after surgery (group C). Twenty\u2010six patients who underwent surgery without amino acid administration and 40 healthy subjects in our hospital were used as control (groups NC, PH, PH). The visual analogue scale (VAS) was assessed in all preoperative, postoperative, and 24 h after TUMT. The patients were allowed immediate hospital discharge after completing VAS. The amino acid levels before TUMT, 30 min, 2, 4, and 6 after surgery, and at 24 h after surgery were measured in 3 groups. Significant differences were observed in the serum amino acid levels and VAS score between 3 groups after surgery. A significant decrease in amino acid levels was observed in groups C\u2010PH 30 min after surgery (p < 0.05). Significant differences were observed in the VAS scores in groups C\u2010PH 24 h after surgery (p < 0.01).

By including pregnant individuals in the first trimester, the study aims to intervene early in pregnancy to potentially prevent preterm birth and assess the effect of synbiotics on the vaginal flora and pregnancy duration. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Now, let's proceed to the fifth inclusion criterion. It states that participants must have at least one of the following risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth: a prior spontaneous preterm birth, PPROM \u226437 weeks in a previous pregnancy but delivery \u226537 weeks, or a prior spontaneous second-trimester pregnancy loss. Including individuals with these risk factors increases the likelihood of identifying participants who may benefit from the intervention and have a higher risk of preterm birth. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Now that we have discussed all the inclusion criteria, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Would you like to proceed?",
            "Great! The first exclusion criterion is patients who are already using pro-, pre- or synbiotics. Excluding individuals who are already using similar interventions helps to ensure that the study results are not confounded by the effects of previous or concurrent use of synbiotics or similar products. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. It states that individuals with multiple pregnancies are excluded. This helps to focus the study on singleton pregnancies and reduce potential confounding factors related to multiple gestations. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion. It states that individuals who require primary (type 1) cerclage are excluded. This helps to ensure that the study population is not influenced by this specific intervention, which is used to prevent preterm birth in some cases. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said! Moving on to the fourth exclusion criterion. It states that individuals with inflammatory bowel disease are excluded. This helps to focus the study on pregnant individuals without this condition, as it may impact the gut microbiome and potentially confound the results related to vaginal microbiome and preterm birth. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Now, let's proceed to the fifth exclusion criterion. It states that individuals with known congenital uterine anomalies are excluded. This helps to focus the study on individuals without structural abnormalities that may impact pregnancy outcomes. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Well said! Lastly, let's discuss the sixth exclusion criterion. It states that individuals with a history of LLETZ conization are excluded. This helps to focus the study on individuals without this specific procedure, which may have implications for cervical health and potentially impact preterm birth outcomes.

Approximately 5 or 6 visits will occur during the year prior to receiving the study drugs, and once-a-month visits for 6 months after receiving study drugs. Participants will also be asked to attend one visit every 6 months for approximately 2 years after the last visit.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the effects of two medications, metformin and L-carnitine, on the heart muscle in patients with heart failure due to damage of the heart muscle secondary to blockage of the arteries supplying blood to the heart (coronary artery disease). Metformin is a commonly used medication in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, and L-carnitine is a naturally occurring substance that is needed by the heart muscle to function properly. We will administer metformin plus L-carnitine, or placebo plus L-carnitine, to all participants. We expect that the heart muscle will improve with less scar tissue in participants receiving metformin plus L-carnitine, compared with participants receiving placebo.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Randomized Double-Blind Crossover Trial of Metformin in Combination With L-Carnitine on Cardiac Health of Patients With Coronary Artery Disease\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCoronary Artery Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Metformin combined with L-Carnitine\n* Drug: Placebo combined with L-C",

The approved vaccine against EVD (rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV, Merck & Co, Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA) is a replication-competent, non-attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein, which has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in various clinical trials (2\u20134). Currently, the vaccine is recommended for administration to individuals at potential occupational risk for Ebola virus exposure (5\u20137). However, as there are no established guidelines for long-term protection after 3 doses of the vaccine, individuals with previous vaccination may require reinfection or booster vaccination to ensure continuous protection.\nTo evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single-dose heterologous vaccination regimen of rVSV\u0394G-ZEBOV and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, an approved vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, an ongoing study was conducted in the DR Congo (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05164550).

A total of 36 rhesus monkeys were randomly assigned to 48 groups (9 groups for each drug). The results demonstrated that naloxone, 10 mg/kg IV, caused complete reversal of the respiratory depressant effect of morphine (up to 2 mg/kg), but only partial reversal of the morphine effect at higher dose levels. Naloxone (6.25 and 12.5mg/kg) partially reversed the respiratory depression induced by pethidine (4.2 and 8.4 mg/kg), but did not significantly affect the depression induced by alfentanil (4 or 8 micrograms/kg). In addition, a total of 5 groups (10 monkeys) were also studied with respect to antagonism of naloxone. Naloxone (0.5\u20104mg/kg) caused a dose\u2010dependent reversal of respiratory depression induced by pethidine, but did not restore normal respiration at an opioid concentration of 8.4 micrograms/ml (12.5 mg/kg).

To date, no population\u2010based study has evaluated the association between gadolinium exposure from multiple imaging exams and adverse cognitive events in patients of various stages of kidney function. Study Design: All insured residents of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) with at least one MRI with gadolinium contrast agent from May 1, 2002, to December 31, 2014, without history of MRI or contrast\u2010associated adverse events were included.

We included patients < 16 years of age diagnosed with ALL and were treated with the Pediatric Oncology Group\u2010New approach protocols as per national guidelines (with or without allograft). Patients were followed for survival, relapse incidence, and treatment\u2010related mortality. We summarized outcomes using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method. Cox regression was performed to analyze the predictors of treatment failure. Results: A total of 436 patients with ALL were enrolled during the period from January 2000 to June 2009. The baseline characteristics are summarized in the Table. Of these patients, 21 (4.8%) died during the induction chemotherapy. The 5\u2010year survival rate was 72.4% (28.8%\u201086.1%), with a 5\u2010year cumulative incidence of 17.6% (11.1%\u201025.1%).

The study aims to recruit 40 participants. Participants will be randomised into two groups; 20 participants will be administered with the IP and 20 participants will be given the placebo. The allocation to receive either the IP or placebo will be on a 1:1 ratio, meaning that for each participant receiving the IP, another participant will receive the placebo. \nThe primary objective of the study is to demonstrate equivalence of the IP to placebo in relation to the improvement of the social responsiveness scale (SRS) score. The primary objective will be established on the basis of an observed difference of 1 standard deviation (SD) in the change from baseline score. The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of the IP compared with the placebo in relation to improvements in other clinical scales and the safety and tolerance of the IP in 40 children with autism. \nThe main clinical scales that will be used are the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist - Child (ATEC), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales II (VABS), the Pediatric Autism Rating Scale (PARS), the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL).

However, rehabilitation is currently an empirical therapy for restoring knee proprioception function after ACL surgery. This study aimed to compare the effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) versus electrotherapy on proprioception in patients with ACL rupture after reconstruction. This study was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki in 2020 and by the local ethical committee in Iran (IR.KMU.REC.1398.115). Thirty\u2010seven patients with ACL rupture after reconstructive surgery were involved in the study and randomly placed into two groups (the PNF group of 18 patients and the EMG group of 19 patients). The patients in the PNF group were treated using PNF stretching techniques, and the EMG group was treated using electrical stimulation of the quadriceps femoris muscles. The treatment was given three times a week for three weeks, and pre\u2010 and post\u2010treatment assessments included the time to reach maximum movement with active joint movement, knee range of motion (ROM), and modified Tegner activity score. Data were analyzed using SPSS software. Findings showed that, after treatment, proprioception function scores compared to pre\u2010treatment levels had significantly increased in both groups (p\u02c20.001). In addition, the PNF group showed a significant increase in proprioception function scores compared to the EMG group (p = 0.028). PNF stretching can more effectively improve proprioception function in patients with anterior cruciate ligament rupture than traditional electrotherapy after surgery.",

It seems like you've got it all covered. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe aim of the present study is to determine how the addition of the investigational medicine can help to prevent preterm birth in an animal model. This can help to develop new medications that can improve pregnancy, health and survival outcomes for premature babies.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground - preterm birth is estimated to occur in at least 1 in 10 pregnancies worldwide and remains one of the most significant causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide*. Despite an increase in understanding of the physiological processes underlying the pathophysiology of human preterm birth over the past decades, the incidence has not changed significantly over the past 30 years and is likely to rise due to the ageing of the population and improved obstetric surveillance**. Approximately 10% of preterm births are without an identifiable cause. A higher percentage of women that were primiparous or with a history of preterm birth, placental damage, uterine abnormalities, or chorioamnionitis are at higher risk for spontaneous labor, with the overall likelihood of developing a complication dependent on the number of factors that are present (multiparity, chorioamnionitis, abnormal placentation or abnormalities of uterine contractility)**. The present study can therefore contribute significantly to our understanding on gestational mechanisms underlying pregnancy and preterm labor, and thus, provide knowledge on how to improve pregnancy, health, and survival outcomes of preterm babies. Methods - the present study will be performed in non-pregnant (n=6) and pregnant female (n=6) Sprague Dawley pigs. The pregnant females are implanted with an Oocyte Stimulation Induction Pill and bred with a male pig to achieve pregnancy. After one month of pregnancy, pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound and endometrial biopsy, followed by collection of vaginal samples, blood samples, and endometrial biopsies to investigate cytokine levels. Afterwards, the investigational medicine will be administered via a subcutaneous (SC) injection. After four hours, pregnancy is reconfirmed by ultrasound and endometrial biopsy, and blood samples are again collected. This is followed by a",

Now, let's proceed to the next criterion. How should we categorize participants based on their renal function?",
            "That's a good approach. To categorize participants, we can use the pre-defined eGFR values based on the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. According to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) standards, what should be the range of eGFR values for each renal function group?",
            "Perfect! Categorizing participants based on these eGFR ranges will allow us to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of the medication across different levels of renal function.

Should we include participants requiring dialysis treatment?",
            "Including participants on haemodialysis will ensure that individuals with severe renal impairment are represented in the study.

Now, let's proceed to the next exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants who have used certain medications within 14 days before screening?",
            "Absolutely! Excluding participants who have used medications that may interfere with the study results will help ensure that the observed effects are due to the study medication and not influenced by other drugs. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants who have used drugs known to affect creatinine clearance?",

Excluding participants who have used medications known to impact creatinine clearance will enable us to accurately assess the effects of the study medication on kidney function without any confounding factors. Lastly, let's discuss the final exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants with clinically relevant conditions unrelated to renal impairment?",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of self\u2010help BPD online treatment for nonborderline personality disorder symptoms in an internet\u2010based sample of adult internet users with high self\u2010reported online contact frequency and to explore whether the BPD self\u2010help program has an influence on BPD symptoms (i.e., borderline symptomatology) and depressive symptoms. A quasi\u2010experimental design and a repeated measures design were established by using an online questionnaire. Participants with low scores on the borderline personality disorder self\u2010report scale were included (N = 797). After the first assessment, participants were matched in terms of baseline values and then randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group. The control group received two follow\u2010ups after 2 and 6 weeks (total T2 T3 design). Participants in the intervention group and the control group completed an online intervention or an attention control group in parallel. After 2 and 6 weeks, follow\u2010ups were held. Participants' borderline symptomatology and depressive symptomatology were assessed over the course of the study. At these measurements, mixed linear longitudinal models were used to examine differences in depression and borderline symptoms between the four\u2010time points. The results showed that BPD users were significantly more affected by depressive symptomatology. There was no significant effect for the other measurements, but there was a general improvement in depression and borderline symptoms across the entire four measurement periods. No differences were found between the control group and the intervention group. Although the intervention resulted in fewer borderline symptoms in the intervention group, all participants profited from the intervention.",

Methods: Thirty\u2010six patients with AKI on hemodialysis were randomized to receive HDF or HDVHDF supplemented with additional convective dose (HDF\u2010ADD). HDVHDF was defined as a 4 hour hemodialysis with a high\u2010flux membrane and added a convective dose of 10\u201015 ml/kg per hour. Results: The mean age of the study patients was 69.0 \u00b1 12.6 years old, and 18 were male (50.0%), while 18 had diabetes (50.0%). There were no significant differences between the baseline characteristics of the two treatment arms. The mortality rate was lower in the HDF\u2010ADD group [16.67% (95% CI: 0.38\u20100.87)] than that of the control group [63.89% (95% CI: 16.23\u201071.74)] (OR 0.26; 95% CI: 0.07\u20100.96, p=0.041). Patients in the HDF\u2010ADD arm had better clearance of myoglobin/lactate dehydrogenase and a lower incidence of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome and hemoperitoneum (p=0.007, p=0.016, p<0.001, respectively). All patients in the HDF\u2010ADD group survived (0.00%) at discharge.

Design: The incidence and etiology of CAUTI were analyzed and risk factors and etiologies were compared between male and female patients. Results: In this study, the incidence of CAUTI in female ICU patients was significantly higher than in male ICU patients (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that intravenous catheterization and the patient's age are independent risk factors, but the presence of a urinary catheter is not. In addition, the bacterial species associated with male and female urinary tract infections are different, and the main bacteria of catheter\u2010associated urinary tract infection are related to different uropathogenic bacteria. Conclusion: This study showed risk factors for CAUTI in female patients are older age and catheterization, while the urinary canal pathogen in female patient with CAUTI is significantly higher than that in male patients, which needs to be paid close attention to clinical diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.",

Several studies indicate the association between inflammatory response, cardiovascular biomarkers, and prognosis in AHF patients, but we still lack a comprehensive evaluation of the role of serum biomarkers in the short-term prognosis of AHF patients. This study is performed to evaluate the association between early changes in inflammatory response and the early mortality rate in patients with high risk of cardiac disease. For these aims, the researchers plan to conduct a prospective, longitudinal study. The primary endpoint will be a composite outcome of all-cause death or readmission within 30 days following index admission. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of all-cause death or cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and death within 30 days.

A study population of 528 healthy adults who had Hcy and IMT measurements was selected by simple random sampling. The levels of L\u2010Lysine, L\u2010Arginine and S\u2010Adenosyl methionine (SAMe) were also determined. Participants were divided into three Hcy groups, according to quintiles of the mean plasma Hcy values. The relationships between plasma Hcy levels and carotid IMT were examined. We found that plasma Hcy was significantly associated with carotid IMT after adjustment for known traditional risk factors. Moreover, significant associations of plasma L\u2010Arginine and L\u2010Lysine levels with the mean values of carotid IMT were also seen in both genders. We also found a significant positive correlation between plasma SAMe to Hcy (SAMe/Hcy) levels and mean values of carotid IMT, which was significant only in males. Our findings may provide a potential link between plasma Hcy and carotid IMT in healthy adults and suggest that modulating plasma Hcy levels may be a novel approach to prevent or delay atherosclerosis in individuals within the general population.Copyright \u00a9 2016 Li et al.

It's very important for patients with a Child-Pugh score of B or C that require additional supportive care before surgery. \n\nIn a previous randomized controlled trial on perioperative chemotherapy in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), the most common grade of adverse events (AEs) included grade 3 neutropenia (22.0%), fatigue (15.6%), and anorexia (8.5%) (NCT00701102). In this respect, adequate management of patients with liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension is mandatory to reduce the incidence of AEs. As a specific strategy to reduce drug concentration and exposure in patients with ICC and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), administration of chemotherapeutic agents within an ascites\u2010free state after draining ascites by repeated drainage procedures had been suggested, and several reports described the administration of chemotherapy in the outpatient setting (5). Although the administration of chemotherapy in the outpatient setting is one of the efforts to reduce AEs associated with chemotherapy, we consider the combination of chemotherapy with molecular targeted agents in the outpatient setting to be a more effective and safe regimen in the treatment of ICC.\n\n\n\nE.5 End points[inst]\nE.5.1 Primary end point(s): R0 resection rate after neoadjuvant therapy;\nE.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: Time of evaluation: The primary end points will be assessed when patients undergo surgery (the completion point of the study).

What do you think about this criterion? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis work is an applied research project that seeks to implement an individual counseling and exercise program that integrates yoga, based on a self-management program guided by positive psychoneurobiology and supported by a self-applied neuropsychological stress relief program. The study sample is made up of in vitro fertilization patients, after which they will receive a self-management program, where the main objective will be the training of the frontal cortex on a cognitive rehabilitation scheme in order to improve the ability to self-regulate emotions, the main strategy of the stress regulation system in the body. Cognitive rehabilitation is based on scientifically validated techniques, in vivo and based on neuroscience experiments, specifically in the field of neuropsychology and positive psychology, which include yoga. The yoga proposed in the research project is the laughter yoga, which is a non-physical exercise developed by an Indian doctor, Dr. Madan Kataria, as a result of his studies on stress, meditation, mental and physical therapy. This technique, together with the training proposed in an audiovisual format, form a self-applied program in which the patient is a key element in the success of cognitive rehabilitation. Specifically, the self-applied program consists of the use of video recordings, that is, the subjects, through the guidance of a psychologist specializing in cognitive therapy and clinical neuropsychologist will watch the videos with the aim of imitating and repeating the techniques and exercises proposed in each of them and finally incorporating them into their daily routine. The purpose of the video recordings is to adapt the techniques and exercises to the needs of the patient, thus improving the rate of inclusion in the rehabilitation program. The project will be carried out with the aim of evaluating the application of this psychoneurobiological approach to in vitro fertilization patients, analyzing the stress levels that may be linked to the experience, both in terms of physiological",

What do you think? \nStudy:\n\nDescription:\n=================\nBrief summary in scientific language:\n-----------------\nAnxiety disorders in a pregnancy environment are described by various symptoms, for example, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), in which the level of anxiety appears as unsteady or unsteady. These disorders have major health consequences; they can influence maternal outcomes and the child's health in turn. Although the number of people affected by mood disorders in pregnancy is high, anxiety symptoms in the first months of pregnancy are largely unreported and underdiagnosed. Pregnant women are often not offered evidence-based mental health care to prevent or alleviate symptoms. According to studies, psychotherapeutic programs based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for pregnancy anxiety reduce anxiety in pregnant women. In addition to therapeutic measures, additional factors such as social support appear to play a particularly important role in the outcome of anxiety in pregnant women. This study aims to investigate the effect of laughter yoga on the stress levels of pregnant women suffering from pregnancy anxiety and to test its mechanisms of action. The hypotheses are that laughter yoga can lead to a reduction in levels of anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. Moreover, the intervention and the mechanisms of action are expected to be mediated by perceived relaxation.\n\nHealth condition or problem studied\n=================\nFree text:: Pregnancy anxiety\nHealthy volunteers:: No Entry\n\n\nInterventions, Observational Groups\n=================\nArm 1:: The Laughter Yoga program will take place in a group setting, with a duration of 12 weeks.

This study includes adult patients with mCRC who commenced treatment with regorafenib after the date of January 1, 2013, and the date of diagnosis of mCRC was from July 1, 2018, through Dec 31, 2022, in the \u00adUS. The primary objective is to assess the proportion of mCRC patients who achieved 18-month or longer clinical stability (non-progression) from the date of first regorafenib treatment. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the clinical efficacy of regorafenib among patients with mCRC in the U.S. Additional objectives include evaluating outcomes based on patient, tumor and treatment characteristics, and evaluating outcomes when treating mCRC that remains responsive to fluoropyrimidine. Data will be collected from Flatiron's Oncology Electronic Data Network (EDN) using electronic health records (EHRs) for patients at participating sites. The data will include details related to regorafenib and other therapeutic agents, and clinical and radiology outcomes. The study results will be disseminated through posters, peer-reviewed journal publications, internal and external presentations such as symposia and national/international conferences. The study results will also be published on the Flatiron Health website and presented to external research organizations, patient advocacy groups, and the general public.\n\nOfficial Title",

            "Absolutely! We need to understand how effective the treatment is specifically in adults. Now, for the third criterion, we need to consider patients who have at least one recorded visit, laboratory test, or other recorded electronic medical record entry in the Flatiron network at least 3 months before the date of their first regorafenib treatment. However, if the patient was diagnosed with mCRC within the last 3 months, this requirement does not apply. What are your thoughts?",

The aim of this trial is to study whether the antidiabetic agent linagliptin improves the metabolic parameters in an obese, pre\u2010diabetic, and metabolic syndrome\u2010affected population. Subject and methods: A total of 62 subjects (34 men and 28 women) with a mean age of 53.9\u00b112.1 years have been evaluated by a nutritionist and enrolled in the trial. Body composition has been evaluated by DXA, blood glucose levels by glycemic profile, and metabolic hormones and markers of inflammation by laboratory analysis. Each subject has had three follow\u2010ups over a period of 14 months where weight and body composition were measured and glycemic control, blood pressure, and cardiovascular risk parameters were evaluated. Each subject was randomly divided into two groups based on the glycemic profile at the baseline. One group, linagliptin\u2010treated (LT) group, received 5 mg of Linagliptin orally once a day for 6 months. The second group, control group (CG), did not receive any medication. Results: An increase in visceral fat percentage and abdominal circumference was observed in both groups. In the LT group, waist circumference (\u00b10.080, P=0.003), fasting blood glucose level (\u00b10.02, P<0.001), and triglyceride levels (\u00b10.07, P=0.001) significantly decreased while the HDL level significantly increased (\u00b10.09, P<0.001). Furthermore, insulin resistance decreased (\u20130.22\u00b10.033, P<0.001), and cardiovascular risk score",

            "Great! Now, let's consider the exclusion criteria. After reviewing the title and intervention/treatment, I suggest the first exclusion criterion to be \"The patient has received more than 48 hours of antibiotics prior to the positive blood culture.\" This criterion ensures that the study population includes patients who have not received extensive antibiotic therapy before the diagnosis of Gram-negative bacteremia. This will help in evaluating the impact of the diagnostic technologies on the optimization of antibiotic therapy. What do you think? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nBackground: In critical care patients suffering from suspected bloodstream infections a rapid and reliable diagnostic approach is mandatory to optimize the initiation of antibiotic treatment and to choose the appropriate antibiotics. The new blood culture system BACT/ALERT\u00ae VIRTUO\u00ae is able to identify pathogens in less than 4 hours after sampling and has demonstrated in a recent study, in comparison to an old workflow including two conventional blood culture bottles, to detect 23 times more infections (8.4% vs 0.37%; p<0.001) based on three randomized controlled trials with a total of 4,557 patients. In this study, a prospective, pragmatic approach was used with the new generation blood culture system for clinically suspected blood stream infections. The aim of this study is to evaluate if the implementation of BAC/T/Alert VIRTUO\u00ae, BioFire Blood Culture Identification 2-BCID2 and REVEAL (bioM\u00e9rieux) leads to more adequate empiric antibiotic therapy and decreases duration of antibiotic treatment for patients with bacteremia confirmed by conventional or molecular techniques. Methods: In a prospective, open-label study (one-arm) patients with a positive blood culture will be identified. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with two blood cultures drawn within 24 hours for clinical suspicion of infection and the new generation blood culture system BAC/T/Alert VIRTUO\u00ae and the identification panel BCID2 (bioM\u00e9rieux) will be evaluated with regard to antibiotic therapy and duration of antibiotic therapy. The study population will be compared to all other clinical microbiology results in the time period from 2",
            "I'm glad we're on the same page. Regarding the exclusion criteria, I suggest adding a few criteria. Specifically, \"The patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.\" This criterion excludes patients who are unable to receive certain antibiotics or whose treatment may compromise the health of their unborn child or newborn. Let's move on to discuss the withdrawal criteria. I think there should be three withdrawal criteria for the \"after\" group. Firstly, \"The patient did not receive the study treatment (BacT/Alert\u00aeVIRTUO\u00ae, REVEAL\u00ae, or BioFire\u00ae Blood Culture Identification 2-BCID2).\" This criterion excludes patients who do not receive the experimental intervention, which is critical for this observational study. Secondly, \"The patient was lost to follow-up (did not receive or complete the study evaluations).\" It's important to ensure that the follow-up data is complete and reliable. Thirdly, \"The patient was determined to be non-adherent (for example, did not take the experimental intervention as prescribed or did not follow study protocols).\" Adherence is crucial for clinical studies, and non-adherent patients may skew the study results. Do you agree with these criteria?",
            "I agree that it's essential to avoid overlapping or conflicting results from other studies. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. \"Clinically significant and uncorrected coexisting disease that, in the judgment of the investigator, would put the patient at unacceptable risk for participation.\" This criterion ensures that only healthy participants are included in the study to avoid potential confounding factors that may affect the study results. What do you think? \nAbstract:\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the antihyperplastic and antiangiogenic effects of oral finasteride, dibutylstilbestrol, and tamoxifen in patients with prostate cancer. Eighty\u2010five subjects with histologically confirmed prostate cancer were divided into four groups (A, B, C, and D). Group A (prostate cancer 1) was not treated, group B (prostate cancer 2) was treated with finasteride (1 mg/day), group C (prostate cancer 3) was treated with finasteride (1 mg/day) and dibutylstilbestrol (1.5 mg/day), and group D (prostate cancer 4) was treated with finasteride (1 mg/day) and tamoxifen (20 mg/day). The results showed that serum prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA) levels were significantly lower in prostate cancer 2, 3, and 4 than in prostate cancer 1. The prostatic volume in prostate cancer 2 was significantly lower than in prostate cancer 1. In prostate cancer 3 and 4, the prostatic volume, mean urinary flow rate (QMAX), and nocturia were similar to or slightly better than in group A. Furthermore, the levels of sex hormone\u2010binding globulin (SHBG) and the androgen to SHBG ratio were significantly lower in prostate cancer 3 than in group A, and significantly higher in prostate cancer 4 than in group A. In conclusion, the combination of finasteride and dibutylstilbestrol showed the best antihyperplastic and antiangiogenic effects in patients with prostate cancer.",

Sialoron and HyoSyl \u00ae are orally available drugs with good efficacy in the treatment of acute sialadenitis, although there is limited availability in the market. In this pilot study, we intend to show whether topical use of Sialoron in combination (combitherapy) with hyosyl \u00ae (in the two studies) \u2010 or Sialoron alone (in the third study) \u2010 can reduce the subjective symptoms of sialoadenosis in people affected. Two secondary objectives are included in the study: to evaluate whether there are differential effects of each drug depending on whether there is a history of COVID-19, and to analyse whether the treatment has a positive effect on fatigue and quality of life of people with sialoadenosis. Methods: we have designed a single-centre, non-comparative, randomised, open-label, three-arm parallel clinical trial, which will take place across Spain.

This is of relevance as EA may cause increased trauma risk, post-operative respiratory depression and delayed extubation, especially in younger children. Currently available prophylaxis is limited and usually based on benzodiazepines, which cause side effects such as sedation. A small clinical study found that single-dose propofol prophylaxis resulted in reduced incidence of EA compared to placebo in older children. No study investigated efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in children, however, numerous studies in adults suggest that dexmedetomidine might represent a favourable alternative prophylactic treatment, also in this patient population. Additionally, it is likely that the frequency of EA is related to the concentration of sevoflurane applied at emergence. The present study aims to investigate the influence of a single dose of 30 milligrams (mg) dexmedetomidine and 50 mg propofol on emergence agitation in children after sevoflurane anaesthesia. In a single-blinded, randomised clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of two different doses of dexmedetomidine (0.02 and 0.04 microgram/kg) compared to 50 mg propofol will be evaluated.

However, the effect of empiric antibiotics before the clinical diagnosis of infection is not well established. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of early antibiotics (before the establishment of infection) on all cause 30\u2010day mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Methods: The investigators screened prospectively enrolled and treated patients in the Temporal Targeting of Treatment in Sepsis and Septic Shock trial. They excluded any patients who were enrolled in the EGDT arm (those with a lactate \u22654 mmol/L (> 30 mg/dL) and a time from ED arrival to first antibiotic \u2265120 minutes), and a subset of those who were enrolled in the initial control arm. These patients did not receive protocol\u2010based resuscitation to achieve hemodynamic goals. Rather, the treating physician was free to use their own judgment to choose treatments and resuscitation strategies. For this analysis, the investigators included those patients who fulfilled the sepsis\u20103 criteria for infection within 24 hours of enrollment. In patients who did not show evidence of infection within 24 hours of enrollment, the investigators compared early antibiotic receipt (on ED arrival) vs. later administration (any time later than 2 hours after admission). The primary endpoint was all cause mortality at 30 days. To adjust for potential confounders, the investigators utilized propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio using a greedy matching algorithm that maximizes the propensity score similarity. Results: 57.7% of the control patients did not have evidence of infection within 24 hours of enrollment. Among these patients, 49% were administered antibiotics within 2 hours of hospital arrival.

Home-based exercise: Exercises to help increase trunk and hip muscle strength; 2. Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS): EMS delivered to the trunk and hip muscles with a small, wearable device; and 3. Nutritional supplement: Omega-3 fish oil (PO) capsules.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nA two-arm parallel group randomized trial of 8 weeks duration using an active-comparator (control group) (1) and an experimental group (2). Both groups will be treated with the active-comparator (EMS + exercise + sham nutrition and usual care) and a group-specific intervention (EMS + exercise + fish oil and usual care), with the latter differing by intervention component. Hypothesis: Participants with chronic LBP receiving the active comparator (EMS + exercise + sham nutrition and usual care) will experience a reduction in pain and opioid use, as compared to participants receiving usual care alone. A participant's average pain over two weeks (primary outcome) will be assessed daily during the intervention period.

It's important to ensure that we have a well-defined and comprehensive list of criteria so that we can ensure that we're including the most appropriate patients for this trial. \n\n\nThe last thing I'd like to add is that we should mention that patients who are HRD-positive should be treated within 4 weeks of initial platinum/taxane chemotherapy. This criterion ensures that patients receive treatment within a clinically appropriate time frame after receiving platinum/taxane chemotherapy. \n\nNow that all the inclusion criteria are identified, we can move on to designing the exclusion criteria. \n\n1) Are there any conditions that should be excluded from this trial? \n\n2) If any, what are they? \n\n3) Can you provide any rationale for the exclusion criteria? \n\n4) What is the rationale for adding the exclusion criteria you mentioned? \n\n5) Is there anything else you'd like to mention regarding the trial design?\nSubmitted by RJ on July 25, 2023 at 6:03AM\nAnswered by RJ on July 25, 2023 at 6:03AM\nTo answer your question, yes, there are patients who should be excluded from the trial. Here are three examples:\n\nWe should exclude patients who are intolerant to gemcitabine-like agents. These patients may have had prior treatment with these agents or may be unable to tolerate them. Excluding them from the trial will ensure that we have a homogeneous group of patients who can tolerate the study treatment. \n\nWe should also exclude patients who are actively receiving other experimental drugs or who have received a PARP inhibitor or an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) within 21 days of first dose of study therapy. As these drugs are under investigation, they may interfere with the study design or may have unpredictable side effects. \n\nWe should also exclude patients who have had an uncontrolled, acute intratumoral hemorrhage within six months of entering the trial. This is because these patients have a high risk of bleeding complications, which could potentially compromise their safety. Additionally, we exclude patients with non-healing bone fract",

This ensures that everyone participating in the study receives the same treatment, so we can accurately assess its effectiveness. What are your thoughts on this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nThe objective of the present study was to assess the effect of low dose interleukin\u20102 (IL\u20102) subcutaneous (SC) injection in combination with doxorubicin chemotherapy with respect to local regional and distant control of breast cancer, as well as overall survivability, and their impact in long\u2010term survival. Thirty patients completed the study in this randomized phase III trial in the Instituto do C\u00e2ncer do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo. Patients were randomly assigned on day 1 of doxorubicin treatment to receive either SC injection of recombinant human IL\u20102 (rh2) 6 million IU after the third cycle of chemotherapy, or no rh2, as the control group. IL\u20102 was administered in a 25 million IU dose, given every three hours at three different sites (arm, abdomen and buttock). Tumor size, number of lymph nodes, and pathological type were similar between the two groups at recruitment, and all patients received a total of six cycles of doxorubicin. After a median of 31 months of follow\u2010up, patients in the rh2 group showed a superior median relapse\u2010free survival (32.6 versus 24.9 months, respectively) and overall survival (not reached versus 48.5 months, respectively). There was a difference in regional nodal status between the two groups, with a higher number of regional events in the control group (ten versus three, P = 0.034). A small increase in cardiac events was also observed in the rh2 group (8 events in each group). These results suggest that the administration of rh2 after the third cycle of doxorubicin chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer may improve long\u2010term survival and regional control.",

Patients who underwent adhesiolysis from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018 were randomly and retrospectively allocated into two groups. Group A underwent adhesiolysis using a 5% H2O2\u2010based solution while group B underwent adhesiolysis using a 19% H2O2\u2010based solution. Group A included 82 patients and group B included 55 patients. We found that the total operating time was significantly longer in group A with a mean of 24.82\u00b16.52 min compared to 19.33\u00b14.36 min in group B (P=0.0001), and the operation duration was 58% greater in group A compared to group B. Intraoperative complications, such as mucosal injury and bowel perforation, occurred in the majority of patients in groups A and B (61.5%; P=0.759), with no significant differences observed (P=0.833). The time required for hospitalization in groups A and B was 9.13\u00b12.54 days and 8.42\u00b12.24 days, respectively. Furthermore, 28% of the patients in groups A and B received other therapeutic treatments following the procedures to address symptoms of gas\u2010liquid blockage (P=0.269).

The intervention will be single-oral methotrexate at the dosage of 20 mg and 25 mg or placebo. The results of the study may provide useful information on the pharmacodynamics of low-dose methotrexate and the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nInflammation has been known to participate in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. One of the important mechanisms in human inflammation is angiotensin converting activity (ACE). ACE catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to II, which plays an important role in inducing inflammation, promoting vasoconstriction, regulating blood pressure, and inhibiting renal sodium reuptake. In recent years, the association between rheumatoid arthritis and ACE has been revealed. ACE inhibitors have been used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and have shown positive effects on the treatment of RA, but they are more suitable for systemic autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythematosus, because of the toxic and side effects. Therefore, ACE-I is not widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The rheumatoid factor (RF) is an autoantibody that is usually positive in rheumatoid arthritis, but RF-negative rheumatoid arthritis also exists. The incidence rate of ACE in RA patients was higher than that of RA patients. Serum ACE level was correlated with the positive rate of RF.

Design, subjects and methods: Data sets from 943 men and 1074 women (2017 subjects) were randomly and independently divided in two, a learning subset (50%, 1009 subjects) and a testing subset (50%, 1008 subjects) by an external computer program blinded to the composition of the study. Linear regression analysis was performed for the determination of beta co\u2010efficients and standard errors. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) were calculated for the discrimination of coronary heart disease (CHD) (disease present vs. disease absent) using the beta co\u2010efficients. Results and Conclusions: High reproducibility was observed for both self\u2010learning and conventional multiple linear regression analysis. In the total, ROC areas were larger in the self\u2010learning model (men: 0.74 vs. 0.67; women: 0.73 vs. 0.70).

It affects both sexes and is mainly attributed to the Western diet, although it may also be hereditary in some people. With aging, the prevalence of DD increases and is currently at approximately 70% among individuals over 80 years of age. DD consists of both an uncomplicated and a complicated course, which are referred to in the literature by different nomenclatures and with varying frequency. Acute diverticulitis is characterised by the clinical picture with systemic symptoms, fever, and inflammation of a segment of the intestine with an increase in the CRP concentration as well as the WBC count. Complicated diverticulitis refers to intra-abdominal abscesses or fistulas, obstruction, bleeding, or perforation of the intestinal wall, which can develop peritonitis, intestinal obstruction, intestinal ischemia or perforation. Mortality is 5-12%, and recurrent episodes of diverticular disease are present in 20-50% of patients. In most studies, the majority of patients have symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation, in addition to clinical symptoms, without the condition necessarily becoming complicated.

Patients with this disease can suffer from recurrent flare-ups of inflammation, which can lead to pain, fever, vomiting, diarrhea and other symptoms. The aim of this randomized, multi-center, open label, controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of two antibiotic regimens in treating patients with diverticulitis: 1-week course of moxifloxacin + metronidazole and 10-day course of ampicillin + amoxycillin + sulbactam. We hypothesize that a 7-day course of antibiotics with moxifloxacin and metronidazole will be equally effective in treating diverticulitis as a 10-day course of antibiotics with ampicillin, amoxycillin, and sulbactam in terms of symptom relief, resolution of inflammation and quality of life. Our study was approved by the local ethical review board. The primary outcome of this study is the resolution of inflammation, defined as a reduction of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level to <5 mg/L.

Anemia has been shown to increase the risk of HF in hypertensive patients and increase the risk of death in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, the relationship between Hb concentrations and prognosis in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between baseline Hb concentrations and mortality in a large cohort of patients with HFpEF. METHODS: We enrolled 6496 patients with HFpEF from the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Trial (PREVEND) population\u2010based cohort with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\u00a0\u2265\u00a050% and serum creatinine levels <2.0\u00a0mg/dL. We investigated the association between baseline Hb and all\u2010cause mortality using Cox proportional hazard analyses with time\u2010dependent analysis. RESULTS: Baseline serum Hb concentrations were associated with increased death rate in patients with HFpEF, after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, smoking, systolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), hypertension treatment, and use of ACEi or beta\u2010blockers. The adjusted HR (aHR) was 1.14 (95% CI: 1.02\u20101.27) for an Hb increase of 1\u00a0g/dL (per standard deviation).

One contributing factor is the baseline burden of comorbidities. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the risk of mortality on the effectiveness of the acellular dermatologic vaccine, DER\u201021 (Zostavax). Study design: We included 8,892 patients who received one dose of DER\u201021, and the patient had at least three consecutive visits after dosing. Patients who received live zoster vaccine were excluded. Efficacy of DER\u201021 was assessed as the prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia. The efficacy of DER\u201021 was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, and site. Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS and R. Results: Out of the 8,892 patients in the analysis, 34 died during the follow\u2010up period (mean, 3.3 years; median, 2.9 years), mostly due to the underlying disease. Patients who died had a significantly higher risk of HZ (Risk ratio [RR]: 3.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.85, 7.20; P=0.0002) and postherpetic neuralgia (RR: 3.83; 95% CI: 1.84, 8.03; P=0.0004) compared with surviving patients. Cox models were used to assess the relationship between efficacy and risk of mortality. We found that the RR of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia increased exponentially with the risk of mortality (RR of HZ per 10% increase in mortality risk: 2.08, P=0.007; RR of postherpetic neuralgia per",

Early studies showed that convalescent plasma of a recovered donor could improve the clinical outcome of patients with COVID\u201019. As vaccine rollout becomes ubiquitous around the world, increasing numbers of individuals are developing T cell responses that could be beneficial in the event of breakthrough infection. There are a growing number of single cell sequencing\u2010based assays for the detection of immune responses to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. We have developed a highly sensitive, high\u2010throughput COVID\u201019 repertoire sequencing assay using the Truseq HTS reagents. Methods: We enrolled adult patients with recent hospitalization for COVID\u201019, as well as healthy individuals and those with other viral syndromes. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were collected and tested using the Immudepth\u00ae 16V4 TCR Repertoire Assay. The data were processed and visualized using a newly developed in\u2010house computational pipeline known as RVIC. To perform a quantitative comparison of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell population sizes in individuals, a T cell clone expansion algorithm was utilized. The results of this study will be published and used as a reference point to guide future studies. Future work includes validation of the assay through the use of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 specific peptide pools and the optimization of the clinical trial and assay workflow. Results: We have obtained >300 sample repertoires from hospitalized patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and have developed a robust bioinformatics algorithm to analyze the data.

As a result of these advances, life expectancy for people living with HIV has increased significantly, with many patients surviving for many more years. Currently it is common for people living with HIV to use many different types of therapies including anti-viral medications and to be taking these therapies long-term. These developments have increased the number of people living with HIV who have long-term health conditions or diseases that cause more than one disease (often termed co-morbidities, or \u2018co-morbs\u2019). Co-morbs can include diseases of the cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological, and bone systems, as well as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Patients with HIV not only need to manage their HIV infection, but also their co-morbs. One major problem faced by patients living with HIV is fatigue. This is a symptom, or group of symptoms, caused by one or more diseases and is a common condition in those with HIV, estimated to affect up to 70% of people diagnosed. Symptoms of fatigue include tiredness or lack of energy, and can impact a person\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living and their quality of life (or how they perceive their life to be). Currently there are no established, evidence-based treatment options for reducing fatigue in people with HIV. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a supervised aerobic and resistance exercise intervention to reduce fatigue and improve quality of life in adults with advanced HIV compared with a control condition (standard of care). Who can participate?People over 18 years of age, living with HIV and fat",

According to the Canadian Cancer Society, physical activity in daily life can help improve the recovery of cancer survivors with less pain or depression and can improve the quality of life of cancer patients. Even though there is a lot of research on the effects of exercise and physical activity on cancer patients, there is no clear evidence or recommendation to motivate them to exercise regularly. However, many cancer patients avoid physical activity because they feel fatigues, they are often too exhausted to exercise, or have little time for exercise due to their disease. The purpose of this study is to develop effective exercise intervention programs to help cancer patients increase their physical activity level for healthy lifestyle changes. In particular, this research project is designed to provide a method to help cancer patients exercise by making adjustments according to their symptoms, treatment response, and the stage of the disease.Who can participate?Healthy adults suffering from advanced cancer (recurrence or metastasis) can participate in this study.The main exclusion criteria are subjects with advanced cancer (terminal stage) that require the palliative treatment to alleviate the symptoms of cancer, or subjects who are suffering from heart disease or brain damage, or subjects who are not willing to participate in physical activity for four months.What does the study involve?We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of exercise programs specially developed for advanced cancer patients on improving the quality of life and physical function of cancer patients. The intervention group (IG) is a group of advanced cancer patients who exercise under various conditions, while the control group (CG) is a group of advanced cancer patients who do not exercise under any conditions.

All parameters were measured after an equilibration period of five minutes using LDF\u2010derived blood flow measurements. Hypoxia caused a decrease in peripheral resistance in cutaneous vessels and this was accompanied by a dose\u2010dependent increase in blood flow upon histamine administration, whereas hyperoxemia prevented the increase in blood flow without any change in peripheral vascular resistance. The mean change in blood flow from the sham treatment was significantly higher in the hypoxemic group than in the hyperoxemic and sham treatment groups. These results suggest that alteration of arterial oxygen content causes a change in the irritant response of human skin.",
            "Consent is a fundamental ethical consideration in research. Including this criterion ensures that all patients or authorized third parties have consented to participate in the study. Now, let's move on to the fifth exclusion criterion. What do you have in mind? \nThis is a single center, parallel group, open-label, randomized controlled trial with three treatment groups (Arm A&B: Tamsulosin therapy of 0.4mg/day for 3months and 0.8mg/day for 6months combined with Tamsulosin therapy + 5% Nifedipine suspension for 3months, respectively; Arm A&C: Tamsulosin therapy of 0.4mg/day for 3months + 5% Nifedipine suspension for 6months; Arm B&C: Tamsulosin therapy + 5% Nifedipine suspension for 6months). To assess therapeutic efficacy of 3months vs. 6months use of tamsulosin, the following outcome parameters are planned: 1. Clinical assessments of urinary conditions; 2. Evaluation of International prostate symptom score (IPSS), Quality of life (QoL) based on IPSS Quality of life module (QLM), and International index of erectile function-5 (IIEF-5); 3. Safety and tolerability of tamsulosin through AE monitoring and clinical laboratory tests; 4. Hormone level change in serum testosterone (T) level, prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) level; 5. Inflammatory factor change in serum inflammatory factor levels, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, MMP-9, VEGF; 6. Pathological structure changes in prostate biopsy tissue (H&E staining and immunohistochemistry staining, including smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (SMA), p-SMAD3, P504S, Rho-GTPase, p-Rho, Rac1-GTPase, c-Met, NPY, 5-HT, E-cadherin",
            "That's a reasonable criterion. It ensures that the study does not unnecessarily expose participants to potential risks or discomfort. Thank you for your contributions. Let's summarize the final exclusion criterion. \n\n[EXCLUSION CRITERIA]\n1. More than 24 hours elapsed since ICU admission\n2. Death is deemed imminent and inevitable during the next 24 hours\n3. Known allergy to a textile component of the device\n4. Consent declined from patient or authorized third party\n5. The treating clinician believes that participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the patient\n\n[P0 1.2 END]\n\nStudy on the Prevalence and Epidemiology of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), Intermittent Claudication, and Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) in CKD Patients\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPatients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have increased odds of acute vascular complications, such as acute limb ischemia and limb amputation. The prevalence of PAD has been reportedly increasing over the past few years and the trend is most pronounced at lower extremities (PAD). Although patients with CKD are at increased risk for PAD, currently there are no large studies available on prevalence and severity of PAD in general and CKD population in a specific manner. In addition, the impact of CKD on the prognosis of patients with PAD has not been well-defined in the literature. Thus, a retrospective observational study will be conducted to obtain data on ABI tests in patients with CKD of whom at least 50% will be CKD patients with PAD. The investigators' study will focus on peripheral arterial disease (PAD), intermittent claudication, and ankle-brachial index (ABI) in CKD patients. Primary aims are: To estimate the actual prevalence of PAD in CKD population To analyze the relationship between eGFR and ABI To analyze the prevalence and severity of PAD by type of chronic kidney disease (CKD), its etiology, and stage of CKD To investigate",
            "I want to thank you for your valuable contribution. These inclusion and exclusion criteria help ensure that the study population is well-defined and that the study's findings are applicable to a targeted group of patients. It's wonderful to have your support in refining the criteria for this clinical trial."

            "Excellent suggestion! This criterion is crucial as it ensures that all participants have a consistent diagnosis of ARDS, which is essential for the study's focus on this specific condition. Now, let's proceed to the third inclusion criterion. What are your thoughts?",
            "Great idea! Patients with ARDS often require invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory support. Including only patients on mechanical ventilation ensures that the study population is similar in terms of disease severity and treatment. Now, for the fourth inclusion criterion, any suggestions?",
            "That's a comprehensive criterion. It's essential for the study to investigate the impact of depth of sedation on cerebrovascular reactivity in ARDS patients. Including patients who require deep sedation or neuromuscular blockade ensures that the study can assess this relationship effectively. Now, onto the last inclusion criterion. What do you propose?",
            "Good thinking! Since the study involves the use of monitoring devices such as Masimo O3 NIRS cerebral oximetry and SedLine processed EEG, ensuring that the application of these devices is feasible in all included patients is crucial for the successful implementation of the study. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. What ideas do you have for the first exclusion criterion?",
            "That's a valid point. Including patients who have been in the ICU for more than 24 hours may introduce confounding variables related to prior treatments and interventions. Excluding these patients helps maintain the homogeneity of the study population. Now, let's discuss the second exclusion criterion. Any thoughts?",
            "That's an important consideration. Including patients who are expected to die within the next 24 hours would not be appropriate for a research study. It's crucial to ensure patient safety and ethical considerations. Let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. What do you think it should be?",
            "Absolutely! Ensuring that all included patients do not have known allergies to the monitoring devices used in the study is crucial for their safety. Now, let's discuss the fourth exclusion criterion. Any ideas?",
            "Well said! Obtaining informed consent is a fundamental principle in research involving human subjects, and excluding patients who decline consent ensures that the study respects participants' autonomy. Now, for the final exclusion criterion, what do you suggest?",
            "That's an important criterion to prioritize patient well-being. If the treating clinician believes that participation in the study may pose risks or be detrimental to the patient's health, it is necessary to exclude the patient from the study to ensure their safety and best interest.",
            "That's correct! Well done. These criteria will help ensure that the clinical trial focuses on the appropriate patient population and maintains ethical considerations."
