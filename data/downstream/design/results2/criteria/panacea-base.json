            "Let me see if I understand your question correctly. You're asking why the fourth criterion requires a neoplastic lesion with a high percentage of neoplastic cells? \n\nYes, I think it's an important criterion. The tumor sample should have a sufficient amount of neoplastic cells to detect genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications. The cut-off of 70% was set based on the previous studies, which showed that the presence of a high percentage of neoplastic cells was necessary to obtain reliable and accurate results using genetic and epigenetic sequencing. Could you share more details about the fourth criterion, such as why you selected 70% and what data support this number?",

Studies have shown that obese individuals have a higher risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to lean individuals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in metabolic markers in obese individuals after bariatric surgery and investigate whether these changes were influenced by the type of bariatric procedure performed. This quasi\u2010experimental study recruited obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery between August 2018 and May 2019. 49 subjects were included, of which 26 received Roux\u2010en\u2010Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and 23 received sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Metabolic markers including Body Mass Index (BMI), lipid profile, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA\u2010IR) were measured before and after surgery. Data were analyzed using paired t\u2010test and the chi\u2010square test. A p\u2010value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in BMI, FBG, total cholesterol, low\u2013density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2010C), and HOMA\u2010IR in both groups (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in BMI, total cholesterol, low\u2013density lipoprotein",

The exercise group completed the training three times a week for 4 weeks prior to the surgery and 3 times a week for 6 weeks after the surgery. The exercise training was started approximately 6 weeks after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the IPSS score, and the secondary outcome measures included the QOL score, Mental health score, and body mass index.The IPSS and QOL scores were significantly lower at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the surgery in the preoperative exercise training group than in the postoperative exercise training group. The mental health scores were significantly higher in the postoperative exercise training group than in the preoperative exercise training group. The body mass index was significantly higher in the postoperative exercise training group than in the preoperative exercise training group at the 12th week.Preoperative and postoperative exercise training had similar effects on the recovery of LUTS. The preoperative exercise training group had a lower IPSS and QOL scores than the postoperative exercise training group, indicating that longer exercise duration reduced postoperative side effects and improved recovery.Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were enrolled in a study comparing preoperative and postoperative exercise programs for recovery from radical prostatectomy.

The tool, the 6\u2010item PREDICT scoring system is then used as soon as investigations have been done and the results considered.RESULTS: For 79 patients (66%) the tool recommended an invasive coronary investigation; the remaining 41 underwent a conservative management strategy which included an early non\u2010invasive ambulatory programme. Out of the 120 patients, 80 had a normal outcome, and 40 had an abnormal outcome confirmed initially or subsequently. Two patients with an abnormal outcome had their diagnoses made within 6 months, three had theirs made between 7 and 18 months, and two after 2.5 years. Forty\u2010eight (40%) of the 120 had a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), but only 21 (17.5%) had no abnormality on any of the investigations they had undergone.CONCLUSIONS: The 6\u2010item PREDICT scoring system is an effective tool in reducing the need for invasive coronary investigation.",

It is also an important contributor to caregiver strain and burden. Despite its high prevalence, the pain assessment in patients with dementia continues to be a challenge; the pain is frequently under\u2010recognized and under\u2010treated. The purpose of this study was, thus, to investigate the feasibility and impact on pain measurement of using the Patient InformatioN for Intensive Care Evaluation scale, the pain scale validated for the intensive care units, on 36 patients with dementia and pain in a geriatric rehabilitation unit. Patients were admitted from an acute hospital and had been referred to geriatric rehabilitation for neurologic or orthopedic decompensation. Patients were randomly allocated into control and intervention groups. Each one received standard care for pain management (opioids, nonopioids, or topical treatments); the intervention group was assessed using the PINNICLE scale in addition. Nurses received training on its use, as well as on the recognition and management of pain. The PINNICLE scale demonstrated its feasibility to be used in the evaluation of pain of patients with dementia. It allowed to identify painful situations, and even to detect a previously unrecognized pain condition. It was also possible to improve pain management and reduce medication use. Pain must be considered an essential clinical dimension of patients with dementia. The PINNICLE scale may be an important tool to improve management of pain for these patients.",

In addition, most of these proceedings papers are not published in scholarly journals, which may cast doubt on their quality. To improve these shortcomings, proceedings papers have been assigned a new status: Conference Proceeding (CP). This status has been defined as \"a conference paper that appears in the proceedings of a conference or symposium\", and is a good alternative to reporting preliminary results that have not yet been peer\u2010reviewed.

In spite of the advances in treatment of dementia, there are still 24.3 million individuals living with mild cognitive impairment who have no disease-modifying treatment options available. There is an unmet need for accessible and effective interventions for cognitive health in the aging brain. tDCS, a safe, non-invasive neuromodulation technique that utilizes weak electrical currents to modulate neuronal excitability, has emerged as a promising approach in cognitive rehabilitation. There is mounting evidence to suggest that tDCS can improve cognitive outcomes in a range of clinical conditions and healthy populations. However, there is still limited research on the use of tDCS for individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the context of cognitive functioning, mood, and sleep. OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on cognition, mood and sleep at 2 months. The secondary aim is to evaluate the effects on brain structure and function. Specifically, the study aims to: evaluate the short-term effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on the cognitive outcomes of verbal fluency, memory, and executive function evaluate the short-term effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on mood assessed by the PROMIS-mood instrument evaluate the short-term effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on sleep assessed through questionnaires (PSQI and PSQI-2) evaluate the effect of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise through functional brain imaging to assess whether changes in brain structure and function mediate improved cognitive performance in participants with mild cognitive impairment.

The second aim involved validating the questionnaire in a study that consisted of 50 patients that have undergone THA. The final aim focused on determining whether the score on the questionnaire reflects a significant improvement in health\u2010related QoL (HR\u2010QoL).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The QoL\u201050 questionnaire was developed using the method of test\u2010retest, reproducibility, and content validity. Fifty patients that have undergone THA are being used to test the face and concurrent validity of the questionnaire. We validated the developed questionnaire by comparing its sensitivity to the standard score of the generic EQ\u20105D\u20105L and the disease\u2010specific Short From Hip Scale (SF\u201012).RESULTS: Based on qualitative analysis, 10 items were selected as QoL criteria. The mean QoL score of patients pre\u2010 and postoperatively was 1.51 \u00b1 0.28 and 3.47 \u00b1 0.23, respectively. The Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire was 0.75. The QoL questionnaire showed high reliability for QoL changes (ICC = 0.98, P < 0.001). However, it showed slight agreement with the EQ\u20105D\u20105L questionnaire (ICC = 0.16, P < 0.001). The SF\u201012 questionnaire exhibited slightly greater agreement (r = 0.79, P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the QoL\u201050 questionnaire is a valid instrument for detecting HRQoL changes before and after THA.

On to the next one. \n\nIntroduction: While there is consensus that cancer treatments significantly impair physical function, there has been little attention paid to whether cognitive function is similarly affected. This could be particularly noteworthy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at high risk for cognitive decline. A previous meta-analysis demonstrated no significant cognitive changes with HNSCC treatment. However, no studies included patients with cognitive impairments and/or delirium at enrollment. Furthermore, all studies had a low risk of bias. The purpose of this study is to compare baseline cognitive function prior to initiation of treatment between newly diagnosed HNSCC patients with high risk for cognitive decline versus without using a validated tool. Method: Patients were recruited to the Neuro-Onco-Supportive-Treatment (NOST) clinical care trial at the University of Maryland (NCT03057184). Patients were randomized into the control arm vs the cognitive support intervention arm. High-risk criteria for cognitive decline included at least one prior stroke or moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment per screening assessment tools. For cognitive impairment, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used. Answering 6 or less questions correctly indicates mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. The cognitive support arm includes a cognitive enhancement protocol. Controls undergo standard symptom care per standard oncology care. Primary objective of the NOST trial is to determine the time to post-treatment cognitive decline (TCMD). Differences in TCM with cognitive impairment and without between arms will be reported according to the intent to treat (ITT) model. Secondary objective includes evaluating the feasibility of the cognitive protocol. Results: Preliminary data will be presented. Limitations: We anticipate high dropout rate due to the nature of the trial. Conclusion: This study will allow investigators to evaluate the degree of cognitive impairment within this high-risk group at baseline and compare the frequency of treatment induced cognitive decline (TDIC), comparing between the control and cognitive support arms of the NOST trial.",

However, despite the widespread use of music, there have been no previous studies in endoscopy clinics regarding the effect of music on anxiety, pain and patient satisfaction in the colonoscopy procedure. Colorectal cancer, which is the most common cancer in our country, affects about 7.4% of the population and is the second most common cause of cancer mortality in the world. Early diagnosis and treatment with rapid colonoscopy play a very important role in mortality and morbidity. Colonoscopy is a simple, noninvasive procedure and the golden standard for screening and symptom evaluation. In addition, with the use of conscious sedation, it can be performed as painless as possible without any harm to the patient. However, many patients have phobia and anxiety due to colonoscopy. Patients often experience anxiety and stress during the colonoscopy procedure. Colonoscopy with conscious sedation may cause side effects or complications related to sedation. Patients often experience some pain, anxiety and drowsiness during a colonoscopic examination.",

The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on LA function in AF patients are unknown. However, CPAP therapy can increase LA systolic function in congestive heart failure patients, the impact of CPAP on the LA in patients with AF and preserved systolic function is unknown.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CPAP therapy on LA volume, function, and electrical properties in non\u2010emergent AF patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; ejection fraction (EF)>50%).METHODS: This is a blinded, randomized, cross\u2010over trial in which patients with left atrial enlargement and AF with normal EF were randomized to CPAP or no CPAP for 6 weeks. Cardiac MRI was performed before and after treatment. The primary outcome was change in LA volume index. The change in regional and global longitudinal strain was examined as a secondary outcome.RESULTS: Eighteen patients with non\u2010emergent AF and normal EF were enrolled and underwent MRI (CPAP; n = 8 and no CPAP; n = 10). Mean age was 60.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7 years and 60% were male. Diastolic function was normal in all patients, and cardiac MRI revealed similar ventricular volumes and function in both groups before treatment. Six weeks of CPAP therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the LA volume index (CPAP vs. no CPAP: 35.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1\u00a0mL/m2 vs. 36.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2\u00a0mL/m2; P < 0.01). Additionally, the regional strain in the LA wall was significantly increased (39.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8% vs. 34.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8%; P < 0.01).

The purpose of the research is to evaluate the efficacy of the UP as an adjunctive intervention to the MS-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy (MS-CBT) and determine if its use is superior to the use of a waitlist control. It is hypothesized that participants assigned to the UP + MS-CBT condition will show a greater reduction in depressive symptomology, anxiety symptomology, and MS-specific distress than those assigned to the MS-CBT only or waitlist control conditions.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nRationale: Depression and anxiety are commonly reported symptoms in individuals living with a chronic illness such as MS, with rates approaching 50%. These symptoms can lead to decreased quality of life, decreased functioning, and adherence to treatment plans. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a recommended evidence-based therapy for depression and anxiety that has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms in individuals with MS. However, CBT is often not available or accessible to individuals living with MS, and it is often difficult to find practitioners with expertise in delivering both CBT and a cognitive approach to depression and anxiety in this population. The Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is a CBT-based intervention that has been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety in multiple populations and formats, including in-person settings, telehealth delivery, and as an individual and group modality. The UP has not been adapted for individuals with MS. This proposed pilot study will evaluate the effectiveness of the 12-week UP + MS-specific CBT in an adult population of MS. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate a revised UP that has been modified to address MS-specific issues. Based on feedback, it is envisioned that the UP",

Fifty\u2010six patients, 34 females and 22 males, 55.73 +/\u2010 16.68 years old with diagnosis of asthma will be recruited. They will be assigned randomly to treatment or control groups (n = 28). The treatment group will receive the Unified Protocol of Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders for 12 weeks, whereas the control group will not receive any intervention. The primary outcome will be assessed by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) at baseline, post\u2010treatment, 6\u2010week, 6\u2010month, and 12\u2010month follow\u2010up. The secondary outcome will comprise quality of life (as measured by the Asthma\u2010QoL), anxiety, depression, sleep, and mindfulness assessed at each assessment with the corresponding scale. A repeated\u2010measures ANOVA will be performed on outcome measures. Results. Preliminary data have been obtained in the first 23 patients enrolled (15 females and 8 males, mean age: 45.22 +/\u2010 18.84 years old).

So far, patients receiving the Unified Protocol showed significant improvement in comparison with the control group at 12 weeks after the end of the intervention. The impact of such treatment could be long\u2010lasting considering the improvement observed at the last follow\u2010up. Since few interventions are currently available for patients with asth",

The drug (hydrocortisone) used in this study is used frequently among critically ill infants, but the dose and length of time these drugs are used, and how long the drug stays in the body are unknown. For safety reasons, it is important to know about the metabolism (breakdown) and elimination (removal) of these drugs to help guide the dose and how long to give it to patients. Also, hydrocortisone binds to a certain protein in the blood while it takes a little time to reach the correct level. This study aims to help define how long the drug takes to reach the right level and how long it stays in the body. This study aims to enroll 22 very premature infants weighing up to 1000 grams after birth who are diagnosed with vitamin K dependent bleeding. Patients will be treated with hydrocortisone to manage bleeding. Blood will be withdrawn 4 times within 7 days for testing.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nProspective Study of Hydrocortisone Concentrations in Preterm Infants With Posthemorrhagic Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nVitamin K Dependent Hemorrhage\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Premature infant at <26 0/7 weeks gestational age born <1000 grams at birth, in the first 48 hours of life and requires the use of intravenous vitamin K for treatment of vitamin",

In addition, some patients receiving DEX\u2010IP therapy during awake surgery (AS) showed improvement in quality of life and cognition. Our pilot study is a single\u2010arm, prospective study which evaluated the safety and performance of DEX\u2010IP in patients who underwent AS for movement disorder. METHODS: The study design consisted of evaluation of safety, feasibility, and the effects of treatment on cognition and mood. Patients' safety, adverse events, and vital signs were assessed. Adverse events were defined as serious adverse events during AS and within 7\u00a0days. Cognitive and mood status were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: We conducted AS in 40 patients. The mean age was 66.3\u00b110.1 years, and 85% of the total patients (n\u00a0=\u00a034) were male. The mean duration of AS was 91.47\u00b136.01\u00a0min, and the mean infusion time of DEX\u2010IP was 77.43\u00b128.66\u00a0min. The most frequent adverse event was bradycardia, followed by hypotension, which often occurred during AS. No serious adverse events occurred. The mean MMSE score before surgery was 27.43\u00b11.68 and improved in 15 cases and decreased in 11 cases. In the HADS total score, the mean score before surgery was 6.18\u00b13.5",

Initially, we will use clinical evaluation and imaging studies to assess the patient's condition and ensure that they meet the inclusion criteria. Then, informed consent will be obtained for patients who are deemed eligible. Before surgery, we will obtain preoperative radiographs, CT scans, and MRIs. The surgical technique will be performed as follows: After positioning the patient prone, a posterior transpedicular approach will be used to enter the vertebral body through a 10- to 15-mm incision on the posterolateral aspect of the spine. The pedicle and superior and inferior endplates will be identified and reamed to create a channel. A balloon will then be inserted into the channel and inflated to create a cavity within the vertebral body. After deflating and removing the balloon, porous titanium microspheres will be filled into the cavity using a cannula. The excess material will be removed, and the wound will be closed appropriately. Postoperative management will consist of bed rest for 3 days, followed by ambulation and rehabilitation as tolerated. Postoperative imaging studies will be obtained to ensure proper placement of the microspheres and assess any complications. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months for clinical and radiographic assessment.

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing intervention on attitudes, beliefs, and self\u2010esteem in people with eating disorders. Methods: This study was a two\u2010group pre\u2010test and post\u2010test experimental design. The sample of this study included 30 patients with eating disorder. It was collected in stages 1 and 2 under the supervision of the researcher and in stages 3 and 4 by a trained therapist. After training both counselor groups and patients at home, the control group received routine care, but the intervention group was counseled using motivational interviewing for 4 sessions. Then, two weeks after counseling, the counselor and participants were evaluated. SPSS 22 was used to analyze and code the data, and the statistical population was compared using the t\u2010test. Results: The intervention group reported a significant difference in attitudes, beliefs, and the quality of life and self\u2010esteem before and after the intervention compared to the control group (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Motivational interviewing was an effective method in helping patients with eating disorders overcome negative attitudes and beliefs about themselves and their disease.",

The study will be conducted at approximately 20 hospital sites in the United States and Europe. Eligible patients must have been newly diagnosed, untreated aggressive large B cell lymphoma of the following histologic subtypes: T cell/Histocytic, T Cell Rich, Double HIT and NK cell lymphomas. Previous studies have shown that the B cell component of these aggressive lymphomas represents approximately half of the tumor. The BGB-A317 and ACT-301 components of this combination will target T cells and CD19+ B cells; thus, this combination targeted treatment is expected to impact two cells of the tumor (T+B+). In addition, the B cell component of this combination targeted treatment is expected to impact a previously untreated B cell component and may be expected to impact the efficacy of the treatment; this will be the key hypothesis of this study. The objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BGB-A317 and ACT-301 when used in combination to treat B cell lymphomas in this patient population.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Phase 1 Study Of BGB-A317 Combined With ACT-301 In Patients With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDiffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Biological: BGB-A317\n* Biological: ACT-301\n* Drug: Rituximab\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================",

When used together, the PET/CT integrated system is called PET/CT perfusion perfusion. The study method is based on PET/CT perfusion perfusion. It scans the abdomen, chest, and pelvis. The scan can be considered for the following patients. Abnormalities in 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT perfusion imaging are often considered indications of local malignant tumors, but abnormal signals may also be found in benign lesions such as inflammatory tissue. If the location, extent, and shape of the lesion are unclear, additional investigations such as biopsies are required. In addition, if there is more than one lesion, it is difficult to determine which lesion is responsible for the abnormality by PET/CT perfusion imaging.

There are also two secondary goals: 1. To assess for any changes in other areas of skin such as facial, breast, and abdominal skin. 2. To assess participants' perception of their perceived lymph and/or fluid state over the course of the 30 day use of the Apparel by using the Modified Lymphedema Questionnaire-20 survey.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Pilot Test/Prior to Market Feasibility Study Evaluating the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Early Signs of Efficacy of an Anti-Cellulite Lymphatic-Mimic Apparel\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCellulite\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Cell-u-Light compression pants\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Participant is age 18 and over.

            "You're completely right. By excluding participants on special diets for weight loss or other health issues, we can isolate the effects of the compression pants on cellulite appearance. Incorporating the exception of stable diets, such as the gluten-free diet for coeliac, ensures that the intervention's effectiveness is not confounded by pre-existing dietary restrictions.

What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "You're absolutely right. By excluding participants with a history of DVT, we can minimize potential risks or complications associated with compression therapy.\n\n*DVT refers to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a deep vein, typically in the leg. It can be a serious condition that requires medical attention.\n\n*Compression therapy involving the use of compression garments can provide graduated pressure to assist venous return and improve circulation. However, it is important to ensure that participants who have had a history of DVT are not at an increased risk of developing further complications if they engage in compression therapy.\n\nIt is recommended that healthcare providers evaluate each participant's individual medical history and ensure that compression therapy is safe for them.\n\n\nHere are some additional points to consider in relation to the exclusion criterion for participants with a history of DVT:\n\n1) Potential risks associated with compression therapy: Compression therapy can potentially increase venous pressure and blood flow in the deep veins, which could increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other complications for participants with a pre-existing condition like DVT.\n2) Medical evaluation: Participants with a history of DVT should undergo a thorough medical evaluation before enrolling in a study that involves compression therapy. This evaluation should include a review of the participant's medical history, a physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing to assess the risk of developing further complications.\n3) Follow-up and monitoring: Participants with a history of DVT should be monitored closely for any signs or symptoms of possible complications during the intervention period, including inflammation, pain, or swelling in the legs. If any concerns arise, prompt medical attention should be sought.\n\n*DVT stands for Deep Vein Thrombosis, which refers to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a deep vein, typically in the leg. It can be a serious condition that requires medical attention and can lead to complications like pulmonary embolism (PE) if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.\n\nIntroduction\n-----------------\nThis is a pilot study to ascertain the feasibility of recruiting a study group of patients suffering with cellulite and to identify any contraindications to the use of compression garment and UHF-EMF technology in",

The measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide has proven to be especially important during general anaesthesia in order to quickly detect possible hyper- and hypoventilation in the patient and to optimise ventilation according to these results. However, many of the current devices for non-invasive measurement of end-tidal carbon dioid are unreliable in children due to the use of a pneumo-tachograph or a mask capnometer in conjunction with a gas analyser. In addition, the use of these devices leads to an increase in dead space and work of breathing, and as a result to a deterioration of the patients' respiration.\nThe aim of the present study is to develop a device for the non-invasive measurement of end-tidal CO2 that is based on the measuring method of the NIST-ECCO2, which is a device for the invasive measurement of end-tidal CO2 using blood. This NIST-ECCO2 method has shown very good accuracy in adults, so the idea now is to adapt the non-invasive method of the NIST-ECCO2 to children. This can be done based on the fact that capnography in children and adults is based basically on the same physical principle, namely the Henry's law - which says that the CO2 content in the air is proportional to the partial pressure and CO2 concentration in the blood. Thus, the present study uses the same mathematical model of NIST-ECCO2, but this time with the aim of measuring the exhaled CO2"

Patients and Methods: This retrospective study compared 83 patients who underwent hemilaryngectomy from January 2009 to September 2020 with 67 patients who underwent total laryngectomy from January 2011 to September 2020 at a tertiary referral center in Tokyo. The primary endpoint was 5\u2010year overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were 5\u2010year disease\u2010specific survival (DSS), 5\u2010year failure\u2010free survival (FFS), and 5\u2010year progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Kaplan\u2010Meier method was used to compare the OS, DSS, FFS, and PFS rates. Cox\u2010proportional hazards regression analysis was employed to assess the effects of surgery type, treatment regimen, and other clinicopathological factors on OS. Statistical significance was established at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The 5\u2010year OS, DSS, FFS, and PFS rates did not significantly differ between hemilaryngectomy and total laryngectomy. The risk of distant metastasis in the total laryngectomy group was higher than in the hemilaryngectomy group (P = 0.034). The overall proportion of patients who developed complications after surgery did not significantly differ between the two groups (P = 0.553). Distant metastasis was the primary factor influencing OS (P < 0.001).

In order to develop a comprehensive list of recommended competencies for neuro\u2010oncology, the Joint Section on Neuro\u2010Oncology of the American Association of Neurosurgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons conducted a survey of fellowship\u2010training program directors to identify competencies important in the field of neuro\u2010oncology. The purpose of this study was to review this survey and report on the most commonly reported, important competencies required for competent neuro\u2010oncology fellowship training.METHODS: Two e\u2010mail surveys were sent to all neuro\u2010oncology fellowship program directors. The first survey contained open\u2010ended questions asking about competencies (knowledge, skill, and attitude) that are important to the practice of neuro\u2010oncology.

The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life (QoL), body function, and symptoms in breast cancer patients and to evaluate the association between PORT and QoL after CT. Methods: A total of 172 patients were divided into 2 groups: CT \u2010 RT group (n = 79), and CT + RT group (n = 93). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. Psychometric instruments were used to evaluate QoL (EORTC QLQ\u2010C30 global health status and functional scales) and symptoms (FACT\u2010B). The correlation between the change in the QLQ\u2010C30 total score and the sum of FACT\u2010B symptom scores (TOTS) for the different domains was analyzed to identify domains more severely affected by treatment. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In our sample, we identified a statistically significant negative correlation between breast cancer\u2010related QoL (global health status and functional scales) and the severity of the symptoms of breast cancer\u2010related symptoms. Analyzing the results from the CT + RT group, the QLQ\u2010C30 total score and TOTS decreased from baseline to 6 months in all of the domains. The baseline CT + RT group exhibited a clinically significant improvement in the quality of life and body functions. The FACT\u2010B symptoms decreased in most domains, with some improvement observed in physical well\u2010being and emotional well\u2010being.

While the number of people living with HIV worldwide has decreased, many people still lack access to HIV testing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Community-based testing, which can be provided by non-clinical community members, has shown great potential in increasing the coverage of HIV testing in resource-limited settings. The effectiveness of community-based testing in Kazakhstan needs further research. This study aims to explore the perspectives of individuals who received a community-based HIV testing service (CBHTS) in Mangystau region of Kazakhstan.\u00a0\n\nA community-based testing service (CBHTS) was implemented in five of its districts, namely Kyzylorda, Shieli, Aktau, Mangystau, and Beyneu. Kazakhstan has a predominantly Muslim population, and a high rate of alcohol and drug use among the population. Alcohol use is considered a high-risk behavior for HIV infection in the country. \u00a0Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with risky sexual behavior and increased HIV transmission.\n\nKazakhstan\u00a0has a population of 18.7 million people, with over 50% living in rural areas. The Mangystau region\u00a0is considered\u00a0one of the most vulnerable regions in Kazakhstan due to the prevalence of HIV, AIDS, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\u00a0The prevalence of HIV in the Mangystau region is 0.59% and the prevalence of HIV in the sex worker population is 1.86%.\u00a0\n\nHIV rates reported by the UN in 2020 show that the overall prevalence of HIV in the Mangystau region is higher than in the rest of Kazakhstan, but AIDS prevalence has remained constant in the region since 2010. Furthermore, the HIV inc",

This criterion will help us evaluate the study interventions' effectiveness in individuals with a higher risk of HIV progression.

Patients and Methods: This study included 30 healthy postmenopausal women having a hysteroscopy for IUA removal. The expression patterns and intensity of ERs and ARs were observed in the endometrium, myometrium and vaginal walls using the immunohistochemical staining method and evaluated. Results: The mean age of patients was 52.5 \u00b1 5.7 years. The positive rate of ARs in the cervical mucosa, endometrium and myometrium was 80%, 0.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The expressions of ARs in the endometrium and myometrium were statistically less than those in the cervical mucosa (P=0.012, P=0.031). The positive rate of ERs in the cervical mucosa, endometrium and myometrium was 93.3%, 86.7% and 60%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the expression of ERs between the cervical and endometrial tissues (P=0.380), and there was a statistical difference between the endometrium and myometrium (P=0.012).

Can you describe what this means in detail? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Atelectasis due to bronchial asthma is a common postoperative complication during cardiac surgery. This study investigated the frequency and potential mechanism of atelectasis. Patients and methods: Seventy\u2010five patients were recruited during general anesthesia cardiac surgery with bronchial asthma, and 100 matched patients with general anesthesia cardiac surgery without bronchial asthma were selected as the control group. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, group A and B. The preoperative spirometry and pulmonary function were measured in all patients. At the end of the operation, arterial blood gas, lung ultrasound and chest radiography were observed and recorded. Results: There were no significant differences in sex, BMI, age and pulmonary function between groups A and B. Anesthesia induction time, intubation time, operation time and operation time did not show a statistical difference. The number of patients with PO4 < 1.4 mmol/L after tracheal intubation and operation in the Atelectasis group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The number of patients with arterial PCO2 (pHPA) \u2264 35 mmHg in the atelectasis group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). An increase in PO4 and pHPA in the atelectasis group, which can effectively predict atelectasis, was also observed. Conclusion: Bronchial asthma is a risk factor for postoperative atelectasis, and a decrease in pHPA and an increase in pCO2 are risk factors for atelectasis. We hope that these results can provide a basis for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of atelectasis in bronchial asthma patients.",

Objectives: We aimed to clarify the effect of a nurse\u2010based telephone coaching on patients with COPD. Methods: The randomized, open\u2010labelled controlled trial was conducted at Kobe University Hospital from March 2013 to March 2015. Of participants with COPD, 47 were assigned to test and 53 to control group. The test group was given individualised telephone coaching, while the control group did not receive any phone calls. The mean of intervention duration was 4.9 months (range 1.0 month \u2010 12.5 months). Results: The total number of hospitalizations due to COPD and the average number of acute exacerbations per patient year were significantly reduced in the test group, however.

It remains unclear whether fluoroscopic navigation catheters actually improve procedural outcomes, and many questions remain regarding their use. This study aimed to provide an overview of the evidence on the safety and efficacy of fluoroscopic navigation catheters during PCI. METHODS: Comprehensive systematic literature searches were performed on the efficacy of fluoroscopic navigation catheter\u2010assisted PCI compared with conventional PCI. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of fluoroscopic navigation catheters. The main outcome measures were procedural success, major complication rates, procedural duration, radiation dose and cardiac enzyme levels. Data were extracted from each article and outcomes were analyzed and tabulated. RESULTS: A total of six studies, including 646 (n=318; fluoroscopy group, n=328) patients, were included. Fluoroscopy\u2010guided PCI was associated with higher procedural success (six of six studies; relative risk [RR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.11\u20101.53, P=0.001) than conventional PCI. Major complication rates and radiation exposure between the two groups were similar. There were no significant differences in periprocedural myocardial infarction and mortality. CONCLUSION: The preliminary evidence shows improved procedural success when a fluoroscopic navigation catheter is used. Further research is needed to ascertain its impact on long\u2010term outcomes and to determine other clinical benefits of this technology.",

In patients with obesity, bariatric surgery may provide weight loss with beneficial metabolic effects. Bariatric surgery is usually preceded by a 6\u2010month preparation period of diet counseling and weight loss. Despite the efficacy of behavioral treatment options for obesity, most of these patients will need pharmacological intervention to achieve targeted weight loss targets. This multicenter, prospective, randomized, and non\u2010blinded pilot study wants to investigate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of orlistat during the preparation period in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods. 140 subjects were randomized to receive 120 mg orlistat thrice a day (OD) or placebo OD for 6 months prior to bariatric surgery. Exclusion criteria were: diabetes, hyperlipidemia, renal failure, liver failure, active gastrinoma, gastrointestinal conditions or drug taking that increases gastric acid secretion, pregnancy, lactation, chronic pancreatitis and uncontrolled seizure disorder. The primary outcome measures were weight loss, glycometabolic profile, blood pressure, liver function and adverse effects of orlistat. Results. 135 subjects completed the trial (76 subjects in the OD 120 mg group and 59 subjects in the OD placebo group). Baseline characteristics were not different between the groups. Subjects in both groups showed a significant reduction in weight (P < 0.0001, paired t tests).

The most common condition is ankylosing spondylitis, but there are several other conditions in the group.  It is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation and damage to the joints, spinal discs, ligaments, and tendons. It can cause pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is the subgroup of spondyloarthritis that predominantly affects the spine (especially the sacroiliac joints and the lower spine), causing stiffness and pain. AxSpA has a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life, including physical abilities",

After obtaining written informed consent, all patients were submitted to coronary angiography. The study was approved by our local ethics committee and all patients had written informed consent prior to any procedure. Patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), previous revascularization, diabetes or uncontrolled systemic arterial hypertension were excluded from the study. All patients were submitted to standard angiography followed by a final kissing balloon dilatation of the stenosis. The mean age was 53.74+12.18 years and 45.14+10.4years in the FDR and control group, respectively. Patients were randomized in 2 groups according to the use of the intracoronary nitrate (NTG) or not (C group). A comparison of the coronary flow reserve (CFR) in the C group showed that the FDR had significantly reduced CFR after nitrate administration with a mean value of 1.28 +0.44 vs 2.05+0.76 in controls (p<0.001). All controls presented mean CFRs greater than 2, whereas 10 of 13 FDR had values less than 2. No differences in the CAD lesion characteristics were found between control and FDR. Thus, in comparison to control, the FDR showed a greater reduction of CFR, which has clinical relevance as the CFR represents the myocardial oxygen supply reserve and could contribute to reduced symptoms at exercise, which are more",

We performed a cross\u2010sectional study that comprised 100 adults with hypertension taking various antihypertensive medications. Methods: Patients were divided into a case group (oral administration of curcumin\u2010piperine for more than two months, n = 59) and a control group using the antihypertensive regimen without curcumin\u2010piperine (n = 41). Both groups were treated for six months, and the frequency of treatment was adjusted as necessary during the study period. The main outcome criteria were the prevalence of SAS in the two groups before and after treatment. Secondary outcome criteria included the changes in blood pressure and medication dosage before and after treatment. The SAS diagnostic criteria included (1) the number of times snoring occurred was >50/h and (2) the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) was > 5/h. A statistical analysis of the data was performed using the t\u2010test, chi\u2010square test, Mann\u2010Whitney U test, or Fisher's exact probability test as appropriate. Results: The prevalence of SAS before treatment in case and control groups was 23.7% and 36.6%, respectively, with no statistical difference. However, the prevalence of SAS after treatment was significantly lower in the case group than the control group (25.4% vs. 34.1%, p = 0.008). In addition, the number of snoring events in the case group was significantly reduced compared to the control group (30.0 \u00b1 25.2 vs. 42.2 \u00b1 21.4, p = 0.018).

The spinal pump used in this study employs a pneumatic pump to discharge pressurized air into the subarachnoid space via a lumbar subarachnoid catheter and is usually managed in the outpatient clinic. It is a minimally invasive intervention and is often used for patients with complex and refractory LBP that has not responded to other forms of therapy. Home use of a 3L hand-held spinal pump is a new approach that involves educating the patient and caregiver to safely operate the pump at home. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this approach. The study will also evaluate patient outcomes, including pain reduction, functional improvement, and quality of life improvement. This study will enroll 30 subjects into the 3L hand-held spinal pump group and 30 subjects into the standard care control group. The follow-up duration for each subject will be 24 weeks. The study will be conducted in a university medical center in Thailand.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEfficacy and Safety of the 3L Hand-held Spinal Pump for Management of Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nLow Back Pain\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Three-liter hand-held spinal pump\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients aged 18-65 years Clinical diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis or sciatic nerve pain Radiological evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis or sciatic nerve",

Are there any other ideas for exclusion criteria? \nIntroduction:\nMotor control is essential for human movement. One factor that affects the ability to move is the strength of muscle contractions. It has been shown that muscle strength is reduced during prolonged contraction, which is a concern for individuals who need to generate a large amount of force for extended periods to perform daily activities. Fatigue has been shown to have negative effects on performance, motivation, and cognitive function in young, healthy males. This is particularly important for athletes and individuals with neurological disorders who rely on muscle strength to perform specific tasks. Fatigue-related muscle weakness can result in injuries and reduced performance, which can lead to decreased quality of life and increased health care expenses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of fatigue on isokinetic muscle strength and explosive strength in healthy young men. The study aims to assess the impact of fatigue on muscle strength and determine whether there is a correlation between muscle strength and performance after fatigue. This study will help us better understand the mechanisms underlying the decrease in muscle strength during fatigue and identify interventions to improve muscle strength and alleviate fatigue.\nObjective:\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of fatigue on isokinetic muscle strength and explosive strength in healthy young men.\nInclusion Criteria:\nThe study will enroll 20 healthy young men between the ages of 18 and 35.

Material and Methods: We conducted a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial in 90 patients to compare the efficacy of 20 mg of compounded papaverine, 10 mg of Caverject\u00ae and 0.5 mg of Regitine\u00ae injection, with placebo injection in ED patients, and to evaluate the safety of these treatments. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a satisfactory erection, defined as a score of 7 or better on the Erectile Function Domain scale (EF\u2010ED) score  of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Results: All participants received a total of four \u2010 injections during each of eight weeks of the double\u2010blind trial period. The incidence of treatment\u2010related serious adverse events was similar across the three treatment groups (pneumonia, 1 in the papaverine group; angina and myocardial infarction, 1 with Caverject and placebo).

The control group received 2 conventional 13\u2010mm diameter implants, and the study group received 1 wedge implant. The conventional 13\u2010mm diameter implants were inserted 10 mm apart, while the wedge implant was placed 2 mm closer to the midline. The primary outcome was the marginal bone level after 24 months. Secondary outcomes included implant stability indices, quality of life measurements, and clinical scores.RESULTS: After 24 months, no statistically significant differences in marginal bone loss (\u20100.09 + 0.17 mm and \u20100.09 + 0.21 mm; p = 0.99) and plaque index score (0.09 + 0.13 versus 0.09 + 0.17; p = 0.84) were observed between the 2 groups.

The study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. \nMethods:\n48 patients(35 men, 13 women) with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction from August 2017 to August 2020 in Wonju Severance Christian Hospital were studied. All patients visited a medical center at least once a year for routine follow-up after initial diagnosis. Patients without hospital admission related to heart failure, who participated in cardiac rehabilitation on at least one occasion during a follow-up period due to heart failure related symptoms such as dyspnea or fatigue, were considered as the CR group(n=25, 52.0%), whereas those who failed to participate in any CR program (did not receive any rehabilitation exercise) (n=23, 48.0%) were considered as the non-CR group.\nThe primary outcome measurement was the changes in 6-minute walking distance(6MWD) between the baseline and the end of the study. The 6MWT assessed symptomatic differences from dyspnea and fatigue, an objective measurement of exercise capacity, and clinical prognostication in patients with heart failure. Demographic and clinical characteristics such as age, gender, medical history of diabetes mellitus(DM) and hypertension(HTN), NYHA functional class, LVEF, E/e' ratio, echocardiographic data, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), treatment modality, initial and final 6MWD were collected from medical records. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the independent impact of cardiac rehabilitation(CR) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Statistical significance was determined at a P-value of less than 0.05. The analysis was",

Aim of the study The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of UI in our clinic and to assess the impact of intracavernosal injection on UI symptoms. Patients and methods This a randomized double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, multicenter trial was conducted in male patients with ED in the urology clinics of the faculty of medicine of the Palestinian Arab University. Between January 2015 and March 2016, 200 patients suffering from ED were included in the study. The patients were randomized equally into three groups: Group A received intracavernosal therapy for 6 consecutive weeks, Group B was given placebo, and no treatment was given to Group C. Patients were assessed at baseline, and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was the development of UI symptoms. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction, quality of life (QoL), and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire. Results There were no significant differences between the 3 groups in age, duration of ED, prior ED treatment, and baseline IIEF score. Overall, there was a statistically significant decrease in baseline IIEF scores after treatment. Only 33 patients developed urinary leakage while using the active therapy. Two patients (33.3%) in Group A developed UI symptoms, and one of the patients in Group A underwent urethroplasty. The mean UI symptom score was lower than baseline in the control and place",

Minimal invasive access techniques using a percutaneous approach may represent an attractive alternative to the open thigh technique. However, a number of issues remain to be addressed, including: 1/ the lack of long term data regarding the durability of this type of access technique 2/ in many cases a femoral artery anatomy unsuitable for such an approach still exists; 3/ the ability to use a femoral artery with anatomical features of less than 2mm (anatomy of the distal portion of the femoral artery) or 5mm (anatomy of the proximal portion of the femoral artery) 4/ difficult entry and progression of femoral endografts 5/ the use of a distal anastomosis in cases of severe tortuosity of the popliteal artery. The objective of this study is to assess the early and late performance of the percutaneous approach for access using TransVascular EndoAortic Technique (TEVAR) technology compared to the traditional surgical approach in patients undergoing elective surgery for aortoiliac or bifurcation aortic disease. PRESENT PROBLEMS: Currently, the preferred conduit for femorotibial graft harvesting is via an open thigh approach. However, this technique is known to be associated with: poorer patient quality of life (QoL) following surgery, high postoperative morbidity including the need for blood transfusions and the requirement for general ana",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical utility of fibrotest\u00ae and hyaluronic acid levels (HA) as biomarkers for hepatotoxicity induced by OIMs in patients with IBD. Methods: This was a nationwide multicenter registry including 264 biological\u2010na\u00efve anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (antiTNF)\u2010treated adult patients scheduled for first\u2010line adalimumab or infliximab treatment without OIMs. Fibrotest results and HA levels were available for 221 patients.

The group assigned to the intervention arm will receive telephone\u2010based education on the prevention of pain recurrence, functional capacity, medication recommendations, and self\u2010awareness. The data collection will be carried out at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months, using self\u2010administered questionnaires for the collection of sociodemographic and clinical data, the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF\u201036), the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index, the Brief Pain Inventory, and the Impact of Deteriorating Health Status, among others.DISCUSSION: Low Back Pain is one of the most widespread musculoskeletal conditions worldwide, which results in high healthcare costs. There is no evidence about the effectiveness of educational programmes in improving patients' wellbeing and quality of life. These measures, combined with the functional status of LBP, will give us a more complete health profile and will allow us to compare their impact over time. If the results of this research are positive, an education programme could serve as a model and resource for primary care facilities, and it could be used to improve primary care management.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT04638634.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nTo this day, it has become evident that low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent condition that represents a public health issue worldwide",

In this study, 3585 subjects from the Epidemiological Survey of Periodontal Diseases in Nara Prefecture, Japan were selected using the randomized method. OHRQoL was measured using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). Oral hygiene behavior was classified into \"good\" and \"inadequate\" when the score was \u226560 and <60, respectively, according to Japanese criteria. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the variables associated with the presence or absence of edentulism in addition to gender, age and the absence of dentures, among other confounding factors. Of the 3585 subjects, 2220 were \"good\" in oral hygiene. In the logistic regression model, a GOHAI score of \u226560 was associated with the absence of dentures, education level of \u2265junior high school, absence of hypertension and higher socioeconomic class. We concluded that an improved GOHAI score was associated with regular dental hygiene and the absence of dentures.",

However, the optimum volume of the drug or sterile fluid is still unknown. Using the lateral patellofemoral (LF) compartment as the index of pressure, we sought out to determine, in subjects presenting for diagnostic knee arthroscopy, the effect of injecting variable volumes of bupivacaine or saline on intracompartmental pressure and the relationship of pressure to the volume injected. This prospective, randomized controlled trial included 36 volunteers aged 18\u201080 years old with oligo/symptomatic LF arthritis undergoing knee arthroscopy without portal placement or any other surgical intervention. The LF space was accessed with a spinal needle inserted under fluoroscopic guidance. Randomization of either 20 mL saline (group 1) or 20 mL bupivacaine (group 2) was carried out after baseline arthroscopy of the LF compartment. For this preliminary study, a larger volume (40 mL) was tested after arthroscopic debridement, but without subsequent portal placement or intraarticular injection. In group 1 subjects, arthroscopy of LF compartment was performed before injection of the solution and the average pressure of the LF space was recorded, with maximum pressure measurements of the lateral knee recorded before and after injection. After injection of 20 mL fluid, the arthroscopic joint space was re\u2010evaluated and intracameral LF pressures were recorded. This was also performed after injection of 40 mL fluid. At the conclusion of the case, an unblinded arthroscopist assessed the visual clarity of the lateral joint space. Mean intracameral pressure in the LF compartment (mm Hg) before the saline injection was similar to pre\u2010injection measurements (28.0% vs. 26.2%). After injection of 20 mL saline, the post\u2010injection pressure was similar to pre\u2010injection",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost\u2010effectiveness of an occupational health screening program for cocaine use compared to the current approach using standard urinalysis. METHODS: We conducted a decision\u2010analytic cost\u2010effectiveness model based on retrospectively collected employee drug\u2010testing data from December 2008 to September 2009 in a large Midwestern health system. Cases were randomly assigned to cohort C (n = 66) screened with standard urinalysis only and cohort OH (n = 44) screened with additional oral fluid cocaine testing for patients receiving standard urinalysis. Patients were excluded if they refused drug testing, were not working at that time, or were employed at another site not covered by the insurance. In the model, each cohort underwent testing every quarter (every 90 days), depending on job category. Modeling was conducted from a payer's perspective and was divided into 2 primary scenarios. In addition to annual medical expenses, potential productivity losses due to absenteeism and presenteeism were considered. RESULTS: Cocaine users with positive test results for urinalysis and oral fluid testing incurred similar annual medical costs in cohort OH compared to cohort C ($3,876.43 and $3,872.95, respectively). The incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to compare the cost of cocaine detection in cohorts C and OH. As compared to cohort C, the ICER for cohort OH was $101,070.05 per annual medical cost. The overall effectiveness of screening with oral fluid cocaine testing was a relative risk reduction of 63.6%, with an average of 1.91 fewer days missed from work by patients in cohort OH. CONCLUSION: Cocaine use poses a significant public health concern and presents challenges in the workplace. Oral fluid cocaine testing is a potential alternative to current standard of urine drug testing. Although the initial cost of adding",

Our hypothesis is that higher baseline serum galectin\u20103 levels are associated with shorter overall survival (OS), progression\u2010free survival (PFS), and time to treatment failure (TTF). We present a pilot study conducted at Aichi Cancer Institute to test this hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2019 and September 2020, 45 patients were enrolled. All patients had newly diagnosed advanced mRCC treated with first\u2010line TKIs. This study was not originally registered in a public trial registry; only registration is planned and underway. Baseline blood sampling was required before the start of treatment. Immunohistochemical staining for galectin\u20103 was performed using the tissue microarray of primary mRCC tissue. OS, PFS, TTF, and the time from TKI treatment for each patient were recorded. Associations between baseline serum galectin\u20103 level and clinical outcomes was assessed by Kaplan\u2010Meier and log\u2010rank tests. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were eligible for data analysis (34 men, median age 69 years; range, 42\u201085 years). All patients received sunitinib or pazopanib. In the first half of the series (n = 20) there were 7 deaths, 1 complete response, 7 progressive disease (PD), and 3 PR. In the second half of the series (n = 20) there were 8 deaths, 5 PD, and 5 PR.

What are your thoughts on excluding patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise testing? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nAlthough anecdotal, it has been previously observed that patients with a history of adverse reactions to previous exercise tests may experience severe adverse reactions to subsequent exercises. Therefore, patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise testing were classified in an Exclusion group. Among patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise tests, the study population will consist of patients who had previously undergone exercise testing using ECG, in addition to those who have not received previous exercise tests. As there is no previous work reporting the prognosis of patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise tests, these patients will be compared with patients who have not previously undergone exercise tests to confirm that they do not have a poor prognosis. Therefore, in the future, it will be possible to expand the indication for exercise testing to patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise tests.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nExercise stress test (SST) is a standard method for detecting ischemia by applying treadmill or bike exercise or coronary catheter injection exercise in addition to the imaging study. Therefore, in patients without an indication for coronary angiography, it is a relatively easy and safe study method to determine whether SST or coronary CT angiography is appropriate. In the case of patients without an indication for coronary angiography, if patients without heart disease have a positive test result during stress exercise (positive cardiac stress test), they are referred to a cardiologist, and if heart disease is determined, there is a high possibility of ischemia or acute heart failure leading to myocardial infarction or arrhythmia. If patients with a history of adverse reactions to SST wish to undergo SST, they may undergo SST using a catheter or coronary intravascular injection, but the test result is generally positive. Therefore, we assume a high risk of cardiac events in patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise test.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nComparison of Mortality and Card",

Primary endpoints were freedom from stent thrombosis at 30 days and angiographic success. Results: Mean age of the study patients was 62.4 \u00b1 5.2 years. Most were men (76.5%) with single\u2010vessel disease (52.9%). Both groups contained patients with a complex stenotic lesion (Bentall class C type 1: 5 with CADSI and 4 with standard of care). There were no significant differences between the two groups in demographic characteristics, lesion complexity or primary outcomes. All patients in both groups had successful stent placement and did not experience any major adverse events (MAEs) at 30 days. Overall, there was significantly higher angiographic success in the CADSI group compared to conventional stenting (93.8% vs 77.8%). Conclusions: CADSI\u2010guided stent placement is safe and effective in the setting of elective percutaneous coronary interventions. While larger randomized controlled trials are needed to determine efficacy and cost efficacy of this technique, CADSI\u2010guided stent placement appears to improve angiographic outcomes and should be considered as a promising alternative to conventional techniques.",

To date, no studies have explored the relationship between iron and fractures in elderly Chinese women.METHODS: This study aimed to prospectively investigate the link between serum ferritin and the risk of major fractures among elderly women in southern China. Participants in this prospective study were recruited from the Sun Yat\u2010sen University Cancer Center. Participants completed a questionnaire addressing sociodemographic characteristics and other lifestyle factors, and were followed up until December 4, 2019. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of fractures according to the serum ferritin.RESULTS: Of the 1027 women, 694 (67.6%) had a blood test, and 116 (16.1%) women developed at least one major fracture during the follow\u2010up. Of those with fractures, 79 (68.0%) had osteoporotic fractures, including 29 (25.0%) hip fractures and 7 (6.0%) non\u2010vertebral and vertebral fractures. The multivariate\u2010adjusted HR of major and any fracture was significantly increasing with the increase of serum ferritin (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.08, P\u2010trend = 0.003; HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.04, P\u2010trend = 0.002, respectively).

This project, funded by the US Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, developed a measure of pain\u2010related outcomes in subjects with neck pain who do not have other neurological or musculoskeletal conditions. Two hundred and fifty\u2010nine subjects meeting the inclusion criteria completed this project. The resulting PNSNS Pain\u2010Related Functional Disability (PRFD) index includes 5 subscales (physical, emotional, cognitive, sleep, self\u2010rated health), each comprising 3\u20104 items. Each item is rated using a 6\u2010point scale indicating the degree of problem experienced over the past week (1 = not at all; 6 = very much). The overall PRFD score is derived by summing the subscale item scores (range 0\u201051). The measure has a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85). The measure also has good construct validity, showing significant correlations with other relevant measures of disability (e.g., Neck Disability Index; r = 0.82, P < 0.001) and measures of depression, pain intensity, and pain interference (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory\u2010II; r = 0.53, P < 0.001; visual analog scale; r = 0.57, P < 0.001, and Pain and Disability Scale; r = 0.57, P < 0.001). The PRFD score demonstrates an association with pain intensity and interference with ADL (beta = 0.57; P < 0.001 and beta = 0.56; P < 0.001, respectively) even after adjustment for potential confounding variables (e.g., age, education, and depression).

We evaluated the effect of TMP\u2010SMX on mucosal transmission of HIV in a nonrandomized, open\u2010label, placebo\u2010controlled double\u2010blind HIV\u2010risk reduction study conducted in serodiscordant mixed sexual partnerships. Seventy\u2010five sexually active, HIV\u2010infected males were randomly assigned to either a placebo or TMP\u2010SMX group; all had a matched seronegative partner. In the double\u2010blind step, participants were followed for 12 months at 3\u2010monthly intervals when they received either TMP\u2010SMX or placebo without partner notification. In the open\u2010label step, sexually active participants received long\u2010term TMP\u2010SMX prophylaxis for the next 18 months, while participants with unidentified partners were referred for partner notification. Seronegative female partners were followed at 1\u2010monthly intervals to document HIV transmission. Eight cases of HIV transmission were observed (7/20 (35%) in the placebo arm versus 1/15 (6.7%) in the TMP\u2010SMX arm), translating to an estimated protection rate of 80.7% (95% CI, \u201022% to 95%). We estimate that this corresponded to an impact on risk of HIV transmission of 23.7% (95% CI, \u201053.9% to 56.7%), although wider confidence intervals are likely given that the primary analysis was not a randomized comparison. TMP\u2010SMX\u2010based HIV interventions for male discordant couples could be a valuable tool in the prevention of HIV transmission and disease in communities where antiretroviral therapy is not widely available. We believe that large trials, including studies of nonmale\u2010male couple relationships, are justified and could have a major impact on the HIV/AIDS",

Background: Cases of gastro esophageal reflux (GERD) due to eosinophil esophagitis (EoE) are not uncommon and the condition is difficult to diagnose, as standard laboratory and diagnostic approaches may not be sufficient, particularly in cases of mild disease or those with atypical symptoms. Endoscopic evaluation has a moderate yield. In cases without endoscopic or histologic features of EoE, patients with unexplained GERD symptoms or atypical symptoms should be considered for high\u2010resolution esophageal manometry (HREM). 2. Objectives: To demonstrate the usefulness of HREM in identifying cases of subclinical EoE in patients that otherwise appear to have a diagnosis of GERD, either based on symptom or endoscopic appearance alone. 3. Methods: A retrospective chart review at a tertiary care medical center between April 2012 and June 2015 was performed for patients that had undergone HREM, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and biopsy for dyspeptic symptoms for which they were otherwise felt to have reflux disease. EoE was diagnosed and classified based on criteria set by the 2011 clinical guideline established by the Physician\u2010Based Association of Gastroesophageal Diseases (PAGI). The diagnosis of esophageal eosinophilia associated with reflux (EER) was made if the esophageal mucosa demonstrated >70 eosinophils/500 power field, but less than 15 eosinophils/500 power field, based on the modified Cincinnati consensus on EoE. The diagnosis of non\u2010eosinophilic EER (NEEER) was made if 0 to 65 eosinophils were found in the epithelium and histologic features of GERD were found, such as reflux esophagitis, gastric fund",

We recorded 2 to 4 hours of audio and conducted individual interviews with patients on care and the characteristics of their diseases. The data were interpreted through constant comparative analysis. We identified 5 main categories: 1) information about a better death; 2) anxiety about the time of death; 3) the need for comfort during death; 4) the importance of the communication between the patient and the team; and 5) the need for autonomy and the ability to choose for the end stage. There is a positive relationship between the death trajectory and the need to communicate with the team.

Twenty\u2010six patients were allocated to receive treatment with either sodium fluoride slurry or an artificial sodium fluoride foam in the clinical study. This was a multicentre clinical trial that followed up with the patients for 15 months after therapy began. The debit of 10% sodium fluoride was started immediately in the treatment side at the baseline. After drying the surface, the 10% foam was applied to the treatment side and held in place for 90 s for 6 days a week for three months. The 31 patients (Group I) had an initial 50% sodium fluoride slurry rinse for 30 s and then used the rinse for 4 weeks. After drying the surface, the 10% foam application was then applied for 90 s for 6 days a week for three additional months (Group II). After three months, the percentage of root surface loss was lower for the 50% slurry compared to the 10% foam (p = 0.308). At the end of the study, a reduction of approximately 20% was found in the root coverage at sites between 1.5 and 5.0 mm. A tendency to relapse (10 mm) was found during the third month of follow\u2010up in the 10% foam group when the mean scores of the two sub\u2010groups were compared. However, no difference in relapse rate was observed between the 50% slurry and the 10% foam groups.",

The primary outcome measure was complete resolution of symptoms and signs of blepharoconjunctivitis within 48 hours. Additional endpoints included timepoint of complete resolution and resolution of predefined symptoms, signs, and associated findings.RESULTS: Sequential 2\u2010day treatment resulted in high efficacy (97.2%) in treating adult subjects with signs and symptoms of staphylococcul blepharoconjunctivitis and, for pediatric patients, was nearly identical to that achieved with 4\u2010day therapy (98.5%). Among eyes meeting all primary criteria for the diagnosis of staphylococcal blepharoconjunctivitis, efficacy was again similar (97.0% and 97.2%, respectively). Timepoints of resolution of signs and symptoms were similar in both groups: 10 hours and day 2, respectively, with all resolutions being by day 14 (87.9% to 98.4%).

Furthermore, increasing concentrations of cTnI are associated with a higher number of myocardial ischemic events. However, it is unclear whether cTnI predicts major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) irrespective of known CAD. Aims: To evaluate whether cTnI predicts 6\u2010month MACE independent of CAD in stable patients referred to nuclear pharmacological stress test. Methods: Patients were referred to adenosine stress echocardiography. All patients had a normal or aborted exercise electrocardiogram on a maximal tolerance test and with no clinical evidence of acute coronary syndrome. Adenosine stress echocardiography and pharmacological blood sample were obtained within 30 minutes after stopping adenosine infusion. Patients with known CAD were excluded. MACE included death, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina within approximately 6 months of the study. Results: A total of 244 patients were included for analysis. Of these, 81 patients developed MACE during the 6\u2010month follow\u2010up period. Patients with increased cTnI (>0.03 ng/mL) had a significantly higher odds of experiencing MACE compared to patients with normal cTnI (0.03\u20100.14 ng/mL: adjusted OR 2,11; 95%CI 1.13\u20103.93). A cTnI cut\u2010off value >0.04 ng/mL had the highest sensitivity (0.66) and specificity (0.79) to predict MACE. However, there were no differences between the 3 groups in the rate of hospitalization for chest pain (0.03\u20100.04 ng/mL vs 0.04\u20100.14 ng/mL vs >0.14 ng/mL: adjusted OR 0.7",

However, adherence to recommended activities is challenging, and knee pain and fatigue may impede participation. This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a goal\u2010paced activity program improved adherence to a home\u2010based exercise program for OA of the hip/knee. A post hoc secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial was performed in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group (combination of behavioral goal setting and tailored feedback and home\u2010based exercise) or a control group (home\u2010based exercise only). Participants were assessed at baseline, after 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The study's primary goal was to determine the extent to which an intervention focused on goal\u2010paced activities (GPA) affected adherence to a 4\u2010week home\u2010based exercise intervention. Three hundred and twenty patients were included for the primary analysis. The primary outcome was adherence (number of completed sessions) after 4 week, measured by GPA. Adherence to GPA was compared before and after the intervention, and between the intervention and control groups using t\u2010tests for paired samples. Thirty\u2010four (34) participants dropped out during the study.

In addition to the growing demand for clinical services, there are more difficulties in managing the elderly, such as the occurrence of delirium. There is a need to establish a new geriatric emergency management system. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of geriatric triage in emergency departments among different age groups with different types of care in elderly patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was designed to enroll participants from March 2017 to February 2019 using a random number generator. An electronic emergency triage system based on the emergency severity index was developed. The emergency severity index points of age\u2010stratified patients and scores, vital signs, and laboratory examinations were obtained. We assessed the age and gender distributions of patients. We also explored the correlations of age and gender with emergency severity index points, vital signs, and laboratory examinations in order to evaluate the differences in the types of care needed among age groups. Results: The results of the study included 47,050 patients divided by the emergency severity index into the following age groups: 5\u201059 years (Group 1; n=17,817 patients), 60\u201069 years (Group 2; n=13,866 patients), 70\u201079 years (Group 3; n=8715 patients), and 80 years and older (Group 4; n=6752 patients). Conclusion: Older age was linked with an increase in emergency severity index scores, vital signs, and laboratory examinations. Furthermore, there were substantial distinctions in the type of care needed in each age group. These findings have important implications for emergency care for elderly patients.",

It can be a painful and disabling condition and is treated quite successfully in most cases by one or more of four treatments: exercise, acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol), topical oral medications, or NSAIDs (e.g. Ibuprofen, Naproxen, etc). Exercise therapy has been demonstrated to be as effective as other therapies but most patients are not willing to engage in a dedicated exercise program. Acetaminophen is less effective than NSAIDs and has been shown to be no more effective than a placebo. Topical oral medications are somewhat less effective than NSAIDs given orally but still more effective than placebo and do not have the side effects that NSAIDs may cause. However, the vast majority of physicians in North America, Australia, and Europe prescribe NSAIDs for patients with OAK. It is not clear if NSAIDs are more efficacious than topical oral medications and/or acetaminophen so this study aims to answer that question. Patients with moderate to severe OAK will be randomized (like flipping a coin) 1:1 ratio to topical oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or placebo. Patients will have an injection into the back of their knee to cause inflammation and to see if NSAIDs or the placebo have an effect on inflammation (with MRI scans) to determine which is better. Patients will also complete questionnaires",

With the correct methodology and follow-up, patients recover quickly and can return to their usual activities. Therefore, mOAT is a frequent diagnosis among physiotherapists.1 This clinical picture is most frequently due to external trauma,2 and usually, there is bone and cartilage (chondral) damage, which is why it is often defined as osteochondral fracture of the talus (OCF). Nevertheless, this injury is not exclusive to external trauma and causes of mOAT that are linked to overuse may be due to previous injuries in the ankle joint, inadequate posture and excessive loading, especially in sport such as gymnastics, basketball, or dance.3 In order to assess the effectiveness of treatment in patients with mOAT, a review of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Pubmed, and The Cochrane Library. The search was conducted between January 2017 and December 2021, including only papers in medical English. The key words used were osteochondral, mOAT, and lateral ankle sprain. A total of 347 papers were found, of which nine were studies with patients under 35 years of age with a mOAT diagnosis. A recent Cochrane Review on the management of ankle joint trauma highlighted the effectiveness of physiotherapy programs and highlighted the importance of strengthening the lower limb during the rehabilitation process.4 The authors of this review found 22 randomized controlled trials and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of different physiotherapy techniques due to the heterogeneity of the interventions that were evaluated as well as their limited",

However, there is limited knowledge regarding their efficacy in school settings. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the Fast ForWord training program for reading in children with ASD in the school setting. METHODS: A group of 14 children with ASD aged 5\u201010 years was recruited from five randomly selected school centers and randomly assigned to an intervention group or a waiting control group. The intervention group received 36 hours of the Fast ForWord training program. The waiting control group received standard academic intervention. All participants underwent pre\u2010 and post\u2010treatment testing on a one\u2010to\u2010one basis and were administered a standardized reading test and a parent questionnaire. RESULTS: A significant improvement in word attack and reading comprehension was observed in the trained group compared to the waiting control group. No significant improvement in reading fluency, spelling, reading speed, or letter knowledge was observed in the trained group compared to the waiting control group. CONCLUSIONS: The Fast ForWord training program effectively improved word attack and reading comprehension skills in children with ASD. The improvements in reading skills may benefit children with ASD.",

Patients with OSA may experience various symptoms, such as snoring, daytime sleepiness, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The most effective treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. However, some patients may find it challenging to tolerate CPAP therapy due to discomfort or disrupted sleep. Oral appliance therapy (OAT) is an alternative treatment for mild to moderate OSA that uses a custom-fit oral device to keep the airway open during sleep. The O2Vent Optima oral appliance is a popular device that has been shown to be effective in reducing OSA symptoms. The ExVent accessory is a new accessory that can be used in combination with the O2Vent Optima oral appliance to provide additional stability and support to the tongue and soft palate during sleep. The ExVent accessory is made of a soft-textured silicone material and is designed to fit comfortably over the upper and lower teeth. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the ExVent accessory when used in combination with the O2Vent Optima oral appliance in participants with mild to moderate OSA.

What are your thoughts on this criterion? \nAbstract:\nPurpose: To evaluate the efficacy of the ExVent accessory in reducing daytime sleepiness for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treated with the O2Vent Optima device. Methods: This is a randomized, single\u2010centre, single\u2010blinded, crossover, multi\u2010arm clinical trial at a US sleep disorders centre in patients with OSA. The ExVent accessory is a disposable disposable accessory that can be inserted into the O2Vent Optima device to reduce the pressure needed to treat apneas. In this study, the participants used the O2Vent Optima device without and with the ExVent accessory, in random order, at home for two nights each. Participants also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale before and after each night of study participation. The statistical significance of the difference in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score between the two nights was evaluated. A significant reduction in the overall Epworth Sleepiness Scale score indicates a better outcome. Results: The participants in this study include 10 males and 5 females. The average age of the participants is 55. The average apnea hypopnea index is 29 before treatment with O2Vent Optima device without ExVent accessory, and 23 after treatment with O2Vent Optima device without ExVent accessory or vice versa. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores are 7.1\u00b14.7 and 6.41\u00b14.8 during the baseline condition and ExVent condition without statistical significance. The overall Epworth Sleepiness Scale score had a tendency to decrease with treatment of O2Vent Optima with ExVent accessory. Conclusion: The ExVent accessory had no statistical significance of improvement of daytime sleepiness in this study. We believe that the ExVent accessory may be useful in patients who have a high level of daytime sleepiness, as well as with the",

Anal dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition, causing considerable patient discomfort. It might even affect patient's quality of life. Clinicians frequently use topical corticosteroids, which play an important role in its treatment. However, these medications are usually associated with side effects, including irritancy and bleeding after toilet use. There is also a risk of dependency, and inadequate control of disease can result in relapse. Occlusives can provide a physical barrier to protect the damaged epithelium from incontinence, as well as help to reduce inflammation and itching. Therefore, the ointment based on beeswax would provide a better protection to skin barrier in the treatment of anal dermatitis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSkin at the perianal region is the most susceptible to dermatitis at any age. Anal dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition, which might be acute or chronic. It may manifest as simple pruritus, or more seriously as fissures. Anal dermatitis might even affect patient quality of life. Clinicians frequently use topical corticosteroids, which play an important role in its treatment. However, these medications are usually associated with side effects, including irritancy and bleeding after toilet use. There is also a risk of dependency, and inadequate control of disease can result in relapse. Besides, some patients may have adverse drug reactions, such as systemic absorption of corticosteroids, or development of local steroid acne. Occlusive therapy combined with topical steroid treatment can help patients avoid repeated inflammation and scarring after healing. The present prospective, open-label, randomized, single center, controlled study was designed to test a new skin-protectant ointment containing a combination of glycerin, dexpanthenol, and beeswax formulated to promote wound healing",

However, its application can lead to severe tissue trauma, leaving unpredictable and lasting marks. There is paucity of literature documenting outcomes of the treatment, especially from low\u2010 and medium\u2010income regions of India. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of dermabrasion in treating moderate to severe nodules or cysts as well as post\u2010inflammatory hyperpigmentation and atrophic acne scars. Methods: Fifty\u2010five patients of both genders, aged between 13 and 55 years, were included in the study at a private dermatology clinic. Subjects were recruited after meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An informed consent was obtained and demographic data were collected. Subjects were divided based on the anatomical site of lesion to be treated, gender, and the type of lesion being treated. Dermabrasion was performed on nodular, cystic, and scarred skin lesions using aluminium oxide particles at three grades of abrasion using 60, 100, and 150 microns. Each treatment was provided once weekly. The lesions were assessed based on their response to treatment using the physician and patient global assessment scale (PGAS) on a monthly basis for 3 months. Results: After three months, the post\u2010procedural skin was found to be of an even colour with the majority of patients responding positively in terms of improved colour and texture of the skin. There was a significant decrease in the number of lesions with an improvement in the grade as compared to baseline. Conclusion: Based on the improvement in the number of lesions and overall improvement after 3 months of treatment, it can be concluded that dermabrasion is quite effective in treating moderate to severe nodules or cysts and post\u2010inflammatory hyperpigmentation and can be performed regularly at a fraction of the cost of",

Methods: We screened hospitalized patients with IgM deposits from 2016 to 2019, and clinical data were collected. A total of 800 patients with IgM deposits met our inclusion criteria. We divided the patients into three regions: 1) central region; 2) eastern region; and 3) western region. We compared the proportion of clinical manifestations, histopathological changes, treatment methods, and remission rates (primary remission, complete response, and partial response) in these regions. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to explore the factors related to renal prognosis. Results: There was no significant difference in the baseline data of patients in the three regions (P > 0.05). The overall primary remission and complete response rates were 27.5% and 9.14%, respectively. The primary remission and complete response rates between the regional populations were significantly different (P < 0.001). The 5\u2010year survival rate of the eastern region was significantly higher than that of the western region (P < 0.05). A total of 263 risk factors (57%) were identified by univariate analysis.

In general, for 70% of STS patients surgery is the initial treatment of choice, but for a substantial number adjuvant radiotherapy is applied due to high local recurrence rates that have been observed after purely surgical management. It is not possible for the treating physician to assess the radiotherapy benefit of different soft tissue tumor patients, because the response rate is low (< 15%) and no molecular classifiers are available.\nIt therefore is our objective to use NGS and an integrated bioinformatic pipeline to analyze molecular biomark",

Eligible patients will be assigned at random, to a R-PFS group (radiation dose > 54 Gy) or to a PFS group (radiation dose <= 54 Gy). Patients will be assessed for prognostic and predictive relevance of immune checkpoints and TCR signatures in resectable soft tissue sarcomas by gene expression analysis of primary and metastatic biopsies at diagnosis, on post-surgical resection specimen and on locally progressing tumor. In addition, the presence of clonal T cells will be analyzed with multimarker immunohistochemistry of primary and metastatic tumors, also evaluating intratumoral CD8 T cell activity through multiplex in situ hybridization immunoanalysis of CD8, MSH1, MSH2, PARP1.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvaluation of Immunogenic Signatures for Prediction of Radiation Sensitivity in Soft Tissue Sarcomas\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nSoft Tissue Sarcoma, Sarcoma, Connective Tissue, Leiomyosarcoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure: Biopsy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients eligible for R-PFS or PFS surgical resection, based on the ASTRO/ESSO/ENTSO-E guidelines for non-operable patients, with planned chemotherapy for non-r-PFS patients Patients willing and able to sign written informed consent Exclusion Criteria: Pregnant patient Patient who are breastfeeding Patient unable to provide informed consent",

In the international phase II study SHARP (sorafenib vs. sorafenib and rapamycin - SHARP), the combination of TRAIL and sorafenib resulted in a greater benefit on survival for patients than sorafenib alone in a population of cirrhotic patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. A confirmatory Phase III clinical trial (SHARP) is in progress to assess TRAIL added to SOF (sorafenib) and assess its safety and efficacy compared to SOF alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis. The PREVIER trial, therefore, is an exploratory, prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, observational study, intended to investigate the use of TRAIL combined with SOF for the first time in the routine clinical setting in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to estimate the safety of the addition of TRAIL to SOF (sorafenib) according to the frequency and intensity of adverse events. The secondary objectives are to document its efficacy as well as its effect on quality of life. Study objectives: To describe the frequency and severity of adverse events. To describe the overall survival of patients. To measure the changes in the quality of life of patients (Quality-of-Life and SF-36 questionnaires). To describe the evolution of biomarkers (liver function parameters, blood counts) Design: Prospective non-comparative study of an observational nature: no control group. Recruitment: Patients with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with cirrhosis who have received TRAIL as part of the SHARP clinical trial as well as Sorafenib will be included. Follow-up: the study will have a minimum follow-up duration of 24 months. The date of inclusion and the date of death or last visit will be collected.

This will be measured by the rate of recurrence of H. pylori infection in both groups at 12 months from baseline. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of both probiotics over the same period of time based on the rates of adverse events and to also evaluate the acceptability of the treatment and quality of life in both groups of patients. This study will be conducted in Australia.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy of two formulations of probiotics against a placebo for the prevention of Helicobacter pylori infection recurrence after standard treatment eradication. The probiotics for the study are two enteric-coated products (strain of L-carnitine, H-pylori antagonists, DGL-acid) called Eraviv and Probioviv, manufactured by Probiotix Ltd (South Australia). The placebo formulation will contain the same excipients as the probiotics. Patients will be randomized into three groups: probiotic A (Eraviv), probiotic B (Probioviv) or placebo. Randomization will be done using randomization software such as Stata (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA).

Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed? \nAlzheimer's Detection\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all cases. A large proportion of the cost in treatment of Alzheimer's disease relates to costs for long-term care as the disease progresses. For this reason, early detection of the disease has a significant impact on the patient outcomes, in particular preventing permanent placement in long-term facilities. Additionally, early detection enables early diagnosis through intervention, better treatment options, and better education for families with a loved one with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2008, a clinical practice guideline on how-to diagnose patients for early Alzheimer's disease was published (QI, 2008). However, primary care physicians (PCP's) seldom use these recommendations or order cognitive testing of their patients. Most cognitive testing is done exclusively by neurologists due to a lack of training on how to determine who should be tested and how to interpret the test results. This practice needs to be changed by educating primary care nurses on basic memory assessment skills and how to conduct cognitive screening in office. If the primary care setting could perform cognitive testing for Alzheimer's disease, it could impact the outcome of patients immensely. A study was done in 2011 by Alzheimer's Disease Association to determine how many patients with memory complaints were not referred to a neurologist for assessment or were sent to neurology with no diagnostic assessment done (Pearce et al., 2011). It was found that 47% of patients with memory complaints were not referred to a specialist, with follow up only to determine if the patient was on any psychotropic medications. Another study was done at Yale New Haven Hospital (Giannini et al., 2013) in 2013 and found that only 7% of patients referred to PCP's for cognitive concerns received any evaluation, with 74% of those tests ordered by the PCP being of the neuropsychological type.

The study is designed as an open-labelled, single-center, two-arm, prospective, parallel and randomized controlled study.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nIn the present study, the investigators want to investigate the lung ventilation perfusion (V/Q) difference to study early proning effect in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients undergoing PPV. According to the mechanical ventilation setting of patients, the investigators will divide the patients into V/Q mismatch group and V/Q matching group. Then, the investigators will conduct the early supine-prone-supine switch on 20 ARDS patients in each group. The investigators will measure the V/Q values, arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2), Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the three positions, and the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) changes. Then, the investigators will estimate the changes of ventilation-perfusion match before and after proning in ARDS patients, and explore the possibility of early proning in patients with V/Q mismatch-\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nTo Use Electrical Impedance Tomography to Explore the Possibility of Prone Positioning in Patients With Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) Mismatch in Early Stage\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: prone position ventilation\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: age>=18 years; patients with ARDS within 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation admission A history of COVID",

ACC is characterized by mutations within the kinase domain of KIT, which provides the rationale to study KIT inhibitors in ACC. Unfortunately, KIT inhibitors have shown limited single-agent activity in ACC patients. To date, the only approved and therapeutically effective drug combination for the treatment of ACC is ara-C based combination chemotherapy. However, there is no clear evidence that dual inhibition of the signaling pathway containing KIT and VEGFR2 has synergistic activity with standard ara-C chemotherapy. In this open label, non-randomized, phase I trial, combination therapy of dual target small molecule inhibitors (Sunitinib and Sorafenib) plus Ara-C with Mitomycin C will be investigated at 4 centers in Belgium. The first 6 patients included in the study will explore the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the regimen in patients with advanced metastatic/recurrent ACC. After identification of the RP2D, it will be tested in a cohort of at least 17 patients. The primary purpose of the trial is to assess the safety of dual KIT/VEGFR inhibition using Sunitinib and Sorafenib in combination with ara-C based combination chemotherapy in metastatic/recurrent ACC, and to assess the anti-tumor activity of this combination treatment. Furthermore, exploratory research will evaluate the pharmacogenomics of the KIT-mutation in the tumor to evaluate whether certain genomic profiles may predict either response or resistance in advanced metastatic/recurrent ACC.\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAlveolar Soft Part Sarcoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Sorafenib tosylate\n* Drug: Sunitinib malate\n* Drug:",

This criterion ensures that the study includes advanced patients who have received prior systemic therapies, representing a more difficult-to-treat population. By including such patients, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment in a real-world setting. \n\nAbstract:\nPURPOSE: This is a retrospective study to evaluate the effects and safety of pazopanib in the adjuvant treatment of resected stage II and IIIa melanoma without sentinel lymph node metastasis or in the neoadjuvant therapy. Materials and methods: We studied 55 patients with completely removed primary cutaneous melanomas from a dermatologic cancer center. A total of 36 patients had undergone neoadjuvant treatment with pazopanib to decrease the risk of lymph node metastasis. A total of 19 patients underwent adjuvant therapy due to histological characteristics such as high mitotic counts, lymphovascular invasion, and ulceration of the primary lesion to prevent the occurrence of distant metastasis. All study subjects received 800 mg/day of pazopanib for 2 year as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. RESULTS: In neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, no serious adverse events (grade \u2265 3) were observed. Lymph node downstaging occurred in one\u2010third of the neoadjuvant group. None of the patients showed a positive regional lymph node, and no distant metastasis was observed. CONCLUSIONS: 800 mg of pazopanib was well tolerated when used before and after radical surgery for primary cutaneous melanoma. The antimetastatic effect of 800 mg of pazopanib was clearly demonstrated in this study, although the number of enrolled patients was small and the follow\u2010up periods were short. Based on the results of the ongoing randomized clinical trials, neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy using MEK and CD137 inhibitors has been reported to be effective in preventing recurrence and metastasis.",

            "That makes sense. Now let's proceed to the next inclusion criterion. How about including patients with adequate organ function? Maintaining adequate organ function is crucial to ensure the safety of patients and to allow them to tolerate the treatment effectively. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: There is a growing recognition that patients with cancer may present with symptoms and/or impairments that influence their ability to participate in rehabilitation and physical health. However, these factors are not consistently reported in the context of rehabilitation and physical health assessment.OBJECTIVES: The objective was to explore the extent to which self\u2010reported symptoms and impairments are concurrently reported with the physical function of patients with cancer.METHODS: This study used data from an RCT (n = 246) in which cancer survivors underwent pre/post and 10\u2010week follow\u2010up assessments of symptoms and impairments using five validated questionnaires. Logistic regression models were used to determine the relative contributions of symptoms and impairments to the physical function of survivors.RESULTS: Acute symptoms and impairments were reported by 48% of the survivors while impairments were consistently correlated with physical function at every assessment. Physical symptoms were correlated with physical function within assessment. However, in the final model, the only significant predictors of self\u2010reported physical function were physical and cognitive impairments.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the impact of impairments on the self\u2010reported physical function of survivors suggesting that the assessment of impairments should be given greater consideration during rehabilitation and physical health assessments. Future studies would benefit from the use of structured interviews in order to more effectively identify and record physical and cognitive impairments for each patient.",

Objective: This study investigated whether DBT differentially impacts the onset and course of substance use disorders (SUDs) and general psychopathology. METHOD: The authors conducted a secondary examination of the 12 clinical sites participating in the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Research Clinical Data Collection Project and compared the course of participants who received DBT with those who received treatment as usual (TAU). Results: Although no significant differences were found between DBT and TAU at pre\u2010treatment, the DBT and TAU groups significantly differed at post\u2010treatment and follow\u2010up on DSM\u2010IV substance use disorder criteria and on the Brief Symptom Inventory total score, as well as on many of the individual symptom items.

It is now known that an esophagus with structural changes related to reflux has more severe symptoms and that in a high proportion of subjects who are not symptomatic, pH is in the normal range. As a consequence, esophageal high\u2010resolution manometry (HRM) is often performed for subjects who are suspected of having GERD. Although several studies have investigated the relationship between abnormalities detected by HRM and pH\u2010impaired acid clearance, they have not reached any firm conclusions. The hypothesis of the present study is that pHi < 3.4 on acid exposure testing (AET) is a strong predictor of abnormalities at HRM. To test this hypothesis, five groups of subjects were constituted from a group of 254 subjects with gastroesophageal reflux recorded by pH\u2010impaired clearance (Dor et al. 2011, Endoscopy 43: 1092\u20101097). Group I (n = 48) had normal pHi and pH monitoring (normal group); group II (n = 54) had normal pHi and pH monitoring (impaired acid clearance group); group III (n = 68) with both abnormal pHi ( < 3.4) and AET (impaired acid clearance group); group IV (n = 46) abnormal pHi and no pH monitoring (impaired pHi group); and group V (n = 42) had abnormal pHi but normal AET (abnormal pHi, normal AET group). The HRM parameters of each of these groups were compared. Group III (impaired acid clearance group) had significantly higher bolus distensibility (P < .001) (72.7 +/\u2010 7.3 mm3 vs 42.9 +/\u2010 7.1 mm3) and basal pressure (8.",

Although most cSDHs can be treated with conservative treatment, up to 30% cannot be successfully treated with conservative treatment, and these patients are considered for surgical or interventional treatment. Interventional treatment of cSDH with endovascular techniques has emerged as a non\u2010invasive and safe modality for cSDH evacuation since the 1990s. Materials and Methods: A total of 61 patients \u2265 60 years old admitted to our center with symptoms suspected of cSDH were evaluated, of whom 44 cases were found to have chronic subdural hygromma and 17 cases were found to have cSDH. In the CT group, 16 patients underwent conservative treatment, including 10 patients who were treated conservatively with drug infusion, 2 with puncture, and 5 with surgery. In the endoscopic group, 3 cases were treated under endoscopic guidance, and the recurrence rate was 0 %, there were 17 cases of endovascular treatment, including 11 cases in the microcatheter balloon dilation group and 6 cases in the coil embolization group; there were 3 cases of recurrence, all of which were embolized in the 2nd endovascular intervention.

The number of drinks and tablets used, and the number of drinks per drinking day were recorded in self\u2010reports on a daily basis for 28 days.RESULTS: The total number of drinks used by the MI group decreased from 63 to 52 and from 85 to 77 in the control groups for alcohol and benzodiazepine\u2010like drugs, respectively. A significant intergroup difference (P < .05) was found in the number of tablets and drinks used for benzodiazepine (P = .035) or alcohol (P = .037).

The trial team hypothesized that older adults receiving the behavioral activation intervention will show improvement in cognitive functioning and depression symptoms in comparison to those receiving the control condition of a psychoeducation intervention. The team will recruit 56 elderly participants with a diagnosis of mild-cognitive impairment or depressive symptoms. Half the participants will receive a three-session intervention targeting behavioral activation (BA) and the other half will receive a psychoeducational (PE) intervention. All participants will be assessed at baseline and three times, immediately after completing their respective interventions. The primary outcome measure will be change in cognitive functioning, depression symptoms, and functional capacity as measured by the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III, Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Lawton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale. The team will also collect demographic and medical information, sleep quality, self and informant perceptions of depression, perceived stress, and social support. In addition, the secondary outcome measures will include a qualitative analysis of each group of participants' experiences receiving their respective intervention to assess what elements of the intervention worked well and potential unintended consequences. The study will allow the team to establish preliminary evidence for a follow-up, randomized controlled trial of a behavioral activation intervention in a larger sample size, as well as providing an opportunity to develop and pilot protocols for future research studies.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Feasibility and Acceptability Trial of a Behavioral Activation Intervention in Community-Dwelling Older Adults"

However, the role of CMR in detecting myocardial changes associated with long\u2010term COVID\u201019 symptoms, such as fatigue, is not fully understood. The prognosis of patients with long\u2010term COVID\u201019 symptoms remains unclear. Methods: A prospective observational study of patients with fatigue (n = 24) over 12 months was conducted to describe the longitudinal changes of myocardial contrast (MC) and myocardial strain ratio (SR) after COVID\u201019. CMR images were obtained from 24 patients (median age, 60.2 \u00b1 3.8 years; 66.67% female) who were admitted due to abnormalities in electrocardiography. Patients underwent CMR examinations undergoing gadolinium. We evaluated M\u2010S using a myocardial contrast medium and analyzed longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain (SR) by circumferential short\u2010axis (CSA), radial short\u2010axis (RSA), and four\u2010chamber views (4CV). D\u2010Carmen strain analysis (DCA) was performed at peak systole and at peak contraction. Results: The baseline CSA\u2010SR (median 31.3 \u00b1 12.2%; interquartile range 25.2% to 46.9%) and RSA\u2010SR (median 27.6 \u00b1 12.7%; interquartile range 19.7% to 40.5%) values were significantly lower in CSA and RSA than in 4CV (63.1 \u00b1 7.7%; interquartile range 54.6% to 62.5%, P < 0.001 for both comparisons).

            "Super! Let's move on to the second criterion, voluntarily participating in the study. This is also common to both groups. Any concerns about including this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Few studies provide prospective data on the efficacy of second\u2010line therapy with the combination of chemotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) in malignant glioma after initial radiotherapy. Furthermore, the optimal dose of TMZ remains controversial with current doses ranging from 150 to 250 mg/m2/day. In this analysis, we analyzed the results of our previously presented randomized trial comparing chemoradiation to chemoradiation plus concomitant and adjuvant TMZ in patients with malignant glioma. Methods: Eligible patients received external beam irradiation 5 Gy a day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks in addition to intravenous PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, and vincris\u2010teine) for 18 weeks and temozolomide (75 mg daily during the first 2 weeks if no previous treatment and 100\u2013125 mg daily if previous treatment) for 4 to 6 weeks following radiotherapy. The primary end points were time to progression and overall survival. Results: The results include 138 patients. In the experimental arm, the median overall survival of those patients who received adjuvant and concomitant treatment with temozolomide (n = 60) was 43 months compared with 24 months for those patients in whom the temozolomide was given for an adjuvant treatment only (n = 78) (P = .006). However, in patients who received concomitant treatment, the median progression\u2010free survival was similar to the median that would be expected with chemoradiation alone, that is, 8 to 10 months for the median. Multivariate survival analysis identified poor performance status and extent of resection as factors adversely affecting survival. Conclusion: In a homogeneous group of patients, the addition of concomitant temozolomide to chemoradiation improved overall survival. In such patients, the addition of adjuvant temozolomide to postoperative radiotherapy may be an alternative treatment choice.",

So based on these criteria, we would be comparing the physical evaluations of post-COVID-19 individuals with idiopathic scoliosis to non-post-COVID-19 individuals with idiopathic scoliosis.

It was hypothesized that COVID\u201019 would influence the physical function of patients with idiopathic scoliosis, regardless of spinal curve angles. Method Between June 2019 and June 2021, a retrospective analysis of patients with idiopathic scoliosis was performed. We evaluated the medical charts of 46 patients who were previously diagnosed with post\u2010COVID\u201019 syndrome. All patients were divided into two groups: group A (n = 46) included post\u2010COVID\u201019 syndrome patients who received a new MRI at least 3 months after their last COVID\u201019 diagnosis, while group B (n = 503) included patients diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis prior to the COVID\u201019 pandemic. The parameters analyzed were age, gender, scoliosis angle, presence of respiratory symptoms prior to COVID\u201019 diagnosis, Cobb Angle increase in scoliosis patients who had undergone a pre\u2010 and post\u2010COVID\u201019 MRI, and the Modified Scoliosis Research Society\u201035 (mSRS\u201035) and Lumbopelvic Pain and Disability Questionnaire (LPQD) scores. Results The female sex was found to be more frequent in group A. The median age in group A was 13.5 years, and 58.7% received a diagnosis of subacute or acute COVID\u201019 syndrome. No significant difference was found in terms of scoliosis curve progression between the pre\u2010 and post\u2010pandemic periods (p = 0.822).

Patients and disease characteristics as well as the safety profile of each drug were also considered. The final analysis was performed on 14 February 2017. Patient demographics and cancer characteristics were summarized by treatment arm, with comparisons between treatment arms conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Fisher\u2019s exact tests where appropriate. Time to next treatment and survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan--Meier methods; hazard ratio (HR) and log-rank tests of difference between treatment arms for both measures were computed. Objective response rate was determined by the proportion of patients who achieved a partial or complete response to treatment. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the methods of Lin et al, as appropriate. The analysis was based on the intent-to-treat principle. All calculations were performed with STATA version 14. P values <0.05 were considered significant. \n\nAdjudication and analysis of study outcomes: The primary objective of this analysis was not to establish the effectiveness of CPI-613 versus standard chemotherapy regimens but to determine which study outcome to prioritize in future clinical trials. We chose the following as high-priority outcomes: time to next treatment, 1-year OS, and overall response rate (ORR) based upon recommendations from clinical trialists and patient advocates. Time to next treatment, 1-year OS, and ORR were determined by an expert oncology adjudication panel composed of nine members, including two hematologists, two medical oncologists, two radiation oncologists, two surgeons, and three advanced practice nurses (one nurse practitioner and two clinical nurse specialists), who were not involved in conducting the literature review or data analysis for this study. The criteria used in adjudication were: 1) confirmed documentation of disease progression; 2) death from any cause; 3) an improvement in measurable disease, as indicated by the investigator when evaluating an objective response to CPI-613; 4) unconfirmed assessment of either measure of interest, per local practice"

PATIENTS AND METHODS/STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind, and double\u2010dummy study in subjects with a chronic diabetic plantar foot ulcer. After screening and treatment of infections, approximately 200 patients with target foot ulcers will be randomized to receive twice daily DPN\u2010100 therapy or matching placebo. The primary endpoint is time to complete wound closure. Secondary endpoints include assessment of wound area, pain, and wound\u2010related quality of life. Safety and tolerability will also be evaluated. Aims include establishing the safety profile, wound\u2010healing efficacy, and improvement of pain. Frequency of dose modifications, incidence of treatment\u2010limiting adverse events, and discontinuations secondary to adverse events will be evaluated. CONCLUSION: DOPSIDE\u20101 is a large\u2010scale, multicenter clinical trial. The results of the primary endpoint will be available in 2023.\n\nIntroduction\nChronic wounds affect around 2% of the adult population in developed countries  and result in significant physical, psychological, and economic burdens. The lifetime probability of an uninjured individual developing a chronic wound is estimated to be 11% , and it has been estimated that around 3\u20135% of patients with insulin\u2010dependent diabetes mellitus will develop foot ulcers .",

What are your thoughts on this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nTo determine whether single vs. multiple in\u2010session cognitive behavior therapy sessions would produce better cognitive restructuring for social anxiety disorder. METHOD: The authors assigned 53 participants to a single session or multiple session condition. Pre and posttherapy data included cognitive restructuring frequency, severity of social anxiety disorder, and self\u2010disclosure behavior. Social Anxiety Inventory scores significantly decreased after both single and multiple sessions (p<.001). The 2 interventions were not significantly different in terms of social anxiety reduction (p =.814). Subjective levels of change in social anxiety and self\u2010disclosure behavior were not significantly different between groups. Both groups improved significantly in self\u2010disclosure on the Therapeutic Change Form (p < .001). Single session and multiple session conditions showed cognitive restructuring gains that significantly improved social anxiety. Change scores were not significantly different between groups in terms of frequency (Cramer's V =.02; n = 24) or severity (Cramer's V =.07; n = 21); posttherapy scores in both groups were significantly different from no change scores (Cramer's V = .53 and .76, respectively; n = 21 and 23; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Results of a pilot study on 53 social anxiety disorder patients suggest that single and multiple sessions of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) result in significant decreases in social anxiety. Preliminary results did not support the hypothesis that multiple sessions would produce better therapeutic benefit on measures of self\u2010disclosure or cognitive restructuring. Single session therapy may be a more efficient and cost\u2010effective treatment modality.",

Published Online First: 16 Dec 2021. https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052641)\n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction Vitamin A is a well\u2010known antioxidant and has protective effects against severe respiratory infections, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an inflammatory respiratory manifestation of COVID\u201019. Animal studies have shown promise for vitamin A in providing protective effects against the clinical manifestations of coronavirus infections. Several clinical trials in patients with vitamin A deficiency have demonstrated favourable effects of vitamin A at preventing mortality from pneumonia and sepsis, and a recent study showed a reduced need for mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients with vitamin A deficiency. This exploratory trial aims to assess the effect of vitamin A on patient survival and the incidence of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID\u201019.Methods and analysis This randomised, blinded, controlled clinical trial will recruit hospitalised patients who are confirmed to have COVID\u201019. Patients who are aged over 18 years and have had COVID\u201019 for at least two days will be randomised (1:1) to receive an intramuscular injection of 600 mg of vitamin A, 50 000 IU, or placebo once daily for up to two weeks or until discharge, if sooner. The primary endpoint will be a time\u2010to\u2010event analysis of mortality and a binary composite outcome of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or death. The two groups (vitamin A vs placebo) will be compared for differences in the primary endpoint (log\u2010rank test). Other exploratory endpoints include secondary endpoints, including other time\u2010to\u2010event analyses, binary analyses for the primary endpoint and ICU admissions, clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcomes,",

The consensus statement suggests that a subset of five \"core\" domains be used to facilitate comparisons between different interventions and settings. However, it has been suggested that, as with other measures such as health\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL), the degree to which 'core' domains are applicable across patient populations and settings is questionable. Methods: To investigate the breadth of applicability of the MRC SOF in musculoskeletal trials, and particularly in early arthritis (RA), a review of recent RA trials was performed retrospectively to highlight whether trials were using MRC SOF items or alternative social outcomes measures. The MRC SOF domains that comprise the five\u2010item core domain set were identified, and whether existing trials were measuring each domain was recorded. Furthermore, whether these trials were measuring the core domains exclusively or supplementing them with additional domains that a patient would consider of greater importance in the context of RA was recorded. Results: The review of all RA trials published between 2008 and 2019 identified nine trials that measured MRC SOF domains in early RA. Of these, eight were found to be measuring the core domain set exclusively, and one was found to be measuring the core domain set in conjunction with a broader set of domains. Conclusions: This study highlights the need for further consensus about the applicability and relevance of the MRC SOF in musculoskeletal trials. The use of a standardised set of core domains (for example, the five core domains of the MRC SOF) is encouraged as it will facilitate direct comparisons of studies. Indeed, this study shows that even",

We have \"Patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis who are planning to undergo bronchoscopy and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).\" Do you have any suggestions for this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) administration on blood pressure (BP) reduction and heart rate (HR) decrease in patients with hypertension or tachycardia under anesthesia. Methods: In this randomized double\u2010blind clinical trial study; 65 patients were evaluated during elective lower abdominal surgery. The patients were randomly divided into two groups : TUDCA group and control group. Hemodynamic data (HR, non\u2010invasive BP) were recorded before and after induction, after incision and at the end of surgery. Results: There was a significant rise in the HR immediately after incision in patients under general anesthesia (P<0.001). TUDCA given in a dose of 8mg / kg had a significantly greater effect on HR reduction at this point in comparison with the control group (P<0.001). In terms of non\u2010invasive BP immediately after incision, the effect of TUDCA in comparison with the control group was less pronounced but significantly different (P=0.049). On the other hand, TUDCA reduced the HR at every post\u2010incision data collection point relative to the control group and was significantly different at the end of anesthesia (P<0.001). Conclusions: TUDCA could affect anesthesia\u2010induced hypertension through BP regulation as well as it can reduce anesthesia\u2010related tachycardia.",

A structured interview was used to elicit detailed psychiatric information including menstrual cycle history. A blood sample was collected at days 21\u201028 to measure the serum concentration of sex hormones before and during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.RESULTS: Of the 169 women in the suicide attempt cohort, 84% had experienced a suicide attempt during menstruation. During their last suicide attempt, women in the suicide attempt group had increased anxiety (P=0.049), cognitive impairment (P=0.008) and dysphoria (P=0.002), when compared to women in the control group. In addition, serum estradiol concentration was positively correlated with negative symptoms (P=0.014) among women who had experienced a suicide attempt in the last menstrual cycle.CONCLUSION: The present study lends support to the hypothesis that hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle may contribute to the risk of suicide attempts, especially among adolescent girls with borderline personality or mood disorders.",

            "Great. It's crucial to address safety factors. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a common disease found in developing countries, including Malaysia. The diagnosis of PTB often relies on microbiological confirmation with the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in sputum. Urine examination has been recommended in those with high pretest probabilities for PTB, but the accuracy of the urinary M.tb antigen (UMA) test has not been assessed in settings where the prevalence of PTB is high. In Malaysia, the prevalence of PTB is high (0.2\u201014.2 %) in adult patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the accuracy of the UMA test in a hospital setting in a high\u2010TB prevalence country. Methods: 246 patients suspected of smear\u2010positive PTB were enrolled over a four month period. The UMA test was performed on 239 urine samples, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated with mycobacteriology culture and smear microscopy as the reference standards. Results: The UMA test had a sensitivity of 71 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 52\u201085) for M.tb detection in adults and children with sputum smear positivity. The specificity of the UMA test was 100 %, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 16.2 and 0.3, respectively. However, the sensitivity of the UMA test in smear\u2010negative adults was only 47 % (95 % CI: 29\u201067). Conclusion: The UMA test has low sensitivity in high\u2010prevalence settings. However, in a hospital setting where a high proportion of smear\u2010positive sputum is available, the specificity of the UMA test is high, and it may be useful for distinguishing true\u2010positive from negative urinary samples.

The most affected age-group appears to be the elderly. With the elderly already burdened with health issues such as hypertension, heart failure and diabetes, not only are they more at risk of acquiring the disease, but also facing more physical and mental complications. The quarantine imposed to contain the spread of the disease has created an adverse impact on mental health in this age group, with the fear of COVID-19 leading to increased anxiety and reduced quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the reduction in quality of life in the elderly (60 years and older) during pre and post pandemic periods. The study will also evaluate the change in their quality of life as their understanding and awareness about the virus increases. The objectives of the present study are (1) to find out the percentage prevalence of the coronavirus before and during the pandemic among the elderly, (2) to determine the quality of life of the elderly before and during the coronavirus pandemic, and (3)to study the effect of awareness regarding COVID-19 on the quality of life of the elderly. The research will be carried out by employing an explanatory cross-sectional design with a mixed methods approach. Convenience sampling will be used to sample the elderly in nursing homes in Bengaluru. The study will be conducted in various nursing homes in various parts of Bengaluru. These nursing homes will be selected using a purposive sampling technique. For the quantitative part of the study, the data will be collected by filling out questionnaires. The questionnaires will include two parts-",

Excluding patients who suffer from chronic pain syndrome or chronic opioid use will help ensure that their outcomes are not influenced by pain perception and response issues. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. What do you think? \nAbstract:\nThe pathology and pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) are poorly undertood. Frequently, the patient undergoes multiple surgical interventons with an unclear benefit, and the clinical results vary significantly. To this day, no biomarker can define the chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The treatment of CPP includes multidisciplinary treatment and surgical intervention. The most common surgical indications include uterro\u2010vaginal adhesions, uteroidenomas, pelvic endometriosis, adnexal pathologies. In a systematic literature review, we wanted to assess the effectiveness of surgical treatment on the subjective (pain) and objective (return to normal activity) outcomes of patients affected with CPP. A systematic review of the literature was performed on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database with an initial search query of surgical management and CPP. The literature was reviewed independently by two authors, two additional articles were obtained from references within the articles selected. Two reviews published in 2008 assessed the impact of uterus\u2010vaginal adhesiolysis, uteroidenoma removal, and hysterectomy in CPP. These reviews found that in 16% of women, pelvic pain improved after surgery. According to a recent prospective randomized controlled study (2019), the only significant finding was that the quality of sex life was improved more by hysterectomy than by adhesiolysis. A randomised control trial (2019) of laparoscopic salpingectomy resulted in significant improvement of pain. All the studies reviewed have limitations due to the lack of control intervention and the lack of objective parameters for assessing pain and quality of life. There are few studies assessing the effects of surgical treatment in women with CPP. More well\u2010controlled clinical trials are needed to accurately assess the clinical benefits of this treatment.",

A total of 439 treatment\u2010na\u00efve adult patients enrolled at baseline in a randomized controlled trial of zidovudine (ZDV) and stavudine (D4T) versus ZDV alone (PRO1457) were studied. Methods: The study was conducted at 12 clinics globally. Patient drug resistance was monitored at 48 weeks using the reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction and genotype assays and categorized as treatment regimen failure. Results: Of 439 patients, 365 were CMV negative and 74 were CMV\u2010positive at baseline, 33 were male and 41 were female (59%/41%). Sixteen CMV\u2010positive patients (8 women, 8 men, mean baseline CD4+ cell count of 148 cells x 10<sup>6</sup>/L) had CMV resistance at baseline. There were no significant differences between the CMV\u2010positive and CMV\u2010negative groups regarding age, sex, ethnicity, median CD4+ cell count, or median HIV\u20101 RNA levels at baseline. After a median treatment time of 20 weeks (IQR 7\u201037), 6 CMV\u2010positive patients (median nadir CD4+ cell count of 56 cells x 10<sup>6</sup>/L) developed virologic failure, compared with 15 CMV\u2010negative patients (median nadir CD4+ cell count of 38 cells x 10<sup>6</sup>/L).

However, a good survival outcome is possible for patients having an entirely and well\u2010performed histological sampling (p < 0.001), and the number of sections is more directly correlated with the probability of making a specific histological diagnosis than the number of blocks.

The sample comprised participants with MS aged over 18 who are currently experiencing moderate fatigue and live in the Vancouver area (Canada). We will use a randomized, between\u2010subjects design to compare the effects of four acupuncture delivery systems: real acupuncture, sham acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, and electroacupuncture applied for 20 minutes each, over the course of five consecutive treatment sessions (total treatment time = 2.5 hours). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the four groups using block randomization, and be assessed at four time points: immediately postintervention, 24 hours postintervention, 2 weeks post interventions, and 6 weeks postinterventions. The primary outcome is patient\u2010rated fatigue according to a fatigue impact scale and a pain impact scale. Data will be analyzed using ANOVA with repeated measures and Bonferroni's post\u2010hoc test to determine which group had the minimal significant change at the four time points. Results from this study will identify the most acceptable delivery system of acupuncture for MS patients in terms of fatigue and determine whether acupuncture reduces fatigue and pain in patients with MS. This finding will be used to develop a more effective acupuncture intervention to treat MS\u2010related fatigue. Furthermore, it will also inform future researchers on how to design acupuncture interventions to reduce fatigue.",

What is the fifth exclusion criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nPURPOSE: Although several trials have described the role of postoperative early oral feeding on surgical outcomes in patients undergoing major abdominal and urologic surgery, there are little data available for patients undergoing gynecological surgery. We investigated the clinical role of early oral feeding in gynecological laparotomy cases.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was done between April 2010 and April 2011, in 90 patients scheduled for gynecological laparotomy. The patients were randomly distributed to one of two groups: early (on the first postoperative day) (45 patients), or delayed (on the third postoperative day) (45 patients) oral feeding groups.RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with respect to mean age, obesity group, disease grade, operation time, postoperative stay in the UICU and ICU; postoperative days and length of stay in the hospital. Complications occurred in three patients (2%) who were in the delayed oral group, and in five patients (11%) in the early oral group. The mean daily calorie intake and weight loss within 24 h in patients in the early and delayed oral group were, respectively, 1006.99 \u00b1 212.57 kcal and 214.11 \u00b1 322.68 g, and 954.44 \u00b1 166.98 kcal and 244.07 \u00b1 281.37 g. During our survey, the early oral feeding group consumed considerably more calories after 24 h of oral feeding (P,0.001); the total calorie consumption was 15.4 \u00b1 2.82 vs. 13,33 \u00b1 2.8 kcal for the early and the delayed oral feeding groups.

Any other exclusion criteria you can think of? \n\nStudy hypothesis\n=================\nRationale and aims: Acute postoperative pain is one of the most unpleasant sequelae of breast biopsies, although it may not be completely avoided. Various studies have suggested that the use of regional anesthetic techniques (e.g., local infusion anesthesia (ILA), pectoral nerve block (PNSB), and paravertebral thoracic anesthesia (PVTA) ) can effectively reduce postoperative pain in patients undergoing breast biopsies. However, the analgesic effect of these techniques remains unknown in patients undergoing biopsy under ultrasound-guided local anesthesia (USGIA). This study aims to explore the analgesic effect of these techniques in patients undergoing biopsy under USGIA. Further, this study aims to determine the best technique for relieving pain post-USGIA. Methods: This study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized, assessor-blinded, comparative study. A total of 60 adult patients aged 20-60 years, each scheduled for USGIA breast biopsy, will be allocated into one of the four study groups using the block randomization method: USGIA local anesthesia group (group A), USGIA ILA group (group B), USGIA PNSB group (group C), and USGIA PVTA group (group D). Each group undergoes a different analgesic technique. The primary outcome is the numerical rating scale (NRS) score for pain at rest one day after surgery, while the key secondary outcome is the postoperative NRS score. Moreover, pain at rest and during movement, the opioid analgesic consumption, the incidence of nausea and vomiting, and other adverse events will also be evaluated. Results: The results will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses, and the significance level will be set at p<0.05. Discussion: This study will be the first to explore the effectiveness of various analgesic techniques in patients undergoing breast biops",

We will calculate the time between referral and the first needle in the groin and define a binary outcome variable (treatment delay < 30 minutes / t.d. >= 30 minutes). We will investigate the difference between the proportion of patients with treatment delay > 30 minutes in the group with standardized alarming system (n =104) compared with the group with regular process of alarming (n =104).\n- Secondary outcome: secondary outcomes are the treatment delay between the time of referral and the time that the patient enters the CT scanner at the referral center (binary variable) and door-to-needle time (in minutes) will be calculated. We will assess whether the implementation of the standardized alarming system reduces the proportion of the patients with a treatment delay > 30 minutes between arrival with the ambulance/ helicopter and start of treatment. The proportion of patients with a door to needle time of at least 60 minutes will be compared between the two groups using the above mentioned ternary logistic regression model.\n- Secondary outcome: secondary outcomes are the time between admission of the patient to the primary stroke centre",

Several CAR\u2010T\u2010cells targeting BCMA have been developed over the past decade, but they all suffer from a limited clinical success due to resistance mechanisms triggered by the BCMA antigen. Our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BCMA\u2010based CAR\u2010T\u2010cells in newly diagnosed, relapsed refractory, and high risk MM. Methods & Design All patients who had progressed after at least three lines of therapy, received autologous transplant or not, or achieved only a partial response to their last line of therapy were eligible. Study procedure: 1) Patients are assessed and staged according to standard guidelines and procedures to determine eligibility; 2) Once the criteria are met, informed consent is obtained  and all patients are evaluated for clinical inclusion in the trial; 3) Eligible patients may be enrolled in the study and their data will be collected after their inclusion in the study; 4) Data will be collected on patients for a maximum of 10 years, including follow\u2010up visits and tests, as well as clinical data and adverse events.

Methods: This prospective, open\u2010label, multicenter, randomized phase I study enrolled patients with relapsed and progressive CLL after at least 1 line of treatment. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to two groups, group A received the CD47 bispecific antibody, SGN\u2010403, and group B received SGN\u2010403 in combination with nivolumab. Safety was assessed by the incidence of treatment\u2010related adverse events (TRAEs). Effectiveness was assessed using standard clinical criteria for response to therapy, such as the European CLL Criteria (EUCLL) 2018. Results: A total of 18 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to group A (n = 10) or group B (n = 8). Median follow\u2010up was 9.5 months. Median time to treatment failure was 4.8 months in group A and 1.1 months in group B. The overall response rate was 70% in group A and 75% in group B.

To expand on the effectiveness of CBCT, which has been assessed in a heteronormative model, it is crucial to adapt the treatment protocol to address the unique concerns of same\u2010sex couples. Method: The primary aim is to examine the effectiveness of the new protocol, designed to be gender neutral, among same\u2010sex couples compared to traditional CBCT. Twenty same\u2010sex couples will be randomly allocated to either a CBCT group or a CBCT+ mindfulness and acceptance (CBCT+MA) group. All participants will complete baseline measures of psychosocial variables, and then will participate in six 105\u2010minutes weekly sessions of CBCT or CBCT+MA. The primary outcome measures will be psychosocial outcomes: the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) and the Mindfulness\u2010Acceptance Scale (MAS). We will also explore possible mediating effect of attachment style (Attach Scale for Adult Romantic Relationships) through structural equation modeling (SEM). Hypotheses: We expect the new treatment protocol to be more effective against traditional CBCT among same\u2010sex couples, with higher attachment style predicting more positive psychosocial adjustment. Results: If recruitment proves challenging, a larger sample may be necessary or we may need to revise our recruitment strategy. However, we expect our protocol to be effective in improving psychosocial adjustment and reducing sexual difficulties. Discussion: The study has the potential to develop an evidence\u2010based CBT protocol, which could be used in future studies with larger sample sizes.",

Method: We retrospectively analyzed 501 consecutive patients with ATBAD from Jan 1990 to Sep 2017 in a high\u2010volume tertiary referral center. We classified ATBAD cases based on a standardized definition and classified type I into the true and false forms based on the anatomical location of the entry tear. The true type I was defined as involving the intima of the descending aorta and false type I was defined as a non\u2010true one. Results: Among the 501 patients, 158 patients (31.5%) died before or at discharge. The overall incidence of in\u2010hospital mortality was 31.5% (158/501). The incidence of in\u2010hospital mortality of the true type I and false type I was 25.4% (37/146) and 27.1% (54/200) (P = 0.649).

Childhood obesity has been increasing worldwide in recent years. One of the main factors associated with hepatic steatosis is obesity, which is due to a change in eating habits. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can also be associated with other diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia. In addition, hepatic steatosis may precede the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or arterial hypertension. Current treatments include maintaining a healthy lifestyle, exercise and nutrition. However, due to the growing prevalence of hepatic steatosis and obesity, prevention programs with nutritional education are required. In Mexico, hepatic steatosis is estimated at 11% of the population, obesity at 34% and diabetes at 13.7% in children and adolescents. It has recently been published that the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in adolescents is 15% and the prevalence of obesity is 26.4%. Although children who receive nutritional education have a decreased incidence of obesity, diabetes and hepatic steatosis, there are no published studies, specifically on nutritional education with low-calorie sugars (D-allulose) and low glycemic index. Previously, our research group observed that nutritional education including low-calorie D-allulose can impact the glycemic profile and anthropometric markers in adult obese individuals. Objective: To investigate the effect of nutritional education on the anthropometric, lipid and glycemic profile in obese adolescents with hepatic steatosis using low-calorie D-allulose. Methodology: Participants will be randomized into two groups.",

Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of D\u2010allulose in children born to women who were not pregnant when the drugs were taken. Methods: A single\u2010center, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, randomized, parallel, dose\u2010escalation trial in a total of 12 children was performed. Children were randomly allocated to receive one of four dose levels (15, 30, 60, or 90 mg per kg per day) of D\u2010allulose or placebo. A 14\u2010day washout period was followed by a second 14\u2010day active\u2010drug period or continued dosing during the intervention phase. The primary outcome was the change in serum amylase levels from baseline to week 12 and the secondary outcomes included changes in serum lipids, liver function, hormonal levels, and urinary microalbumin/creatinine ratio. Results: No serious adverse events were observed during the intervention period, and the number of adverse events showed no consistent trend. Significant differences in changes in the serum lipids and glucose levels between D\u2010allulose groups and the placebo group were observed. The serum levels of glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride in the 30mg/kg/day group significantly decreased after the intervention compared to baseline. Conclusion: D\u2010allulose is a safe and well\u2010tolerated drug with potential efficacy in children. Large, long\u2010term, and multi\u2010center trials are needed to fully evaluate the safety and efficacy of D\u2010allulose in children born to women who were not pregnant when the drugs were taken.",

The investigators hypothesize that D-allulose does not affect the rate at which FFAs or glucose are absorbed from a postprandial high fat meal.

            "That's a great suggestion! Ensuring that parents maintain their child's usual routine will help us isolate the effects of D-allulose on gastrointestinal tolerance. Finally, we should include children whose parents are willing and able to attend all 7 visits. This will ensure participant compliance and data collection throughout the study.",

            "Excellent suggestion! Excluding participants who have used prescription medication will help us isolate the effects of D-allulose more accurately. Now, let's discuss the criterion related to regular GI complaints. Any thoughts on this?",
            "That's a smart consideration! By excluding children with regular GI complaints, we can minimize the potential influence of these complaints on the study results. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. How do you think we should handle known intolerance or sensitivity to the study products?",
            "That's a valid point! Ensuring participant safety is of utmost importance, and excluding those with known intolerances or sensitivities is necessary to achieve that. Now, let's discuss the criterion related to psychiatric disorders. Any ideas on this?",

Excluding children with psychiatric disorders will help us focus on the impact of D-allulose on gastrointestinal tolerance without potential psychological influences. Finally, we should also exclude children with lactose intolerance, as well as those who have used supplements that may have affected the GI system. Any thoughts on these criteria?",

            "OK. And how has this been measured? \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVES: To define the evolution of symptoms following bulking agent injections (BI) in patients with urinary incontinence (UI).BACKGROUND: BI has been shown to be an effective treatment for mild\u2010to\u2010moderate UI due to urodynamic or non\u2010urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (SUI), but there is little data concerning its long term follow up and the time course of its effect, in women with SUI only.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data in this retrospective study comes from a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing BI for stress SUI. A total of 131 consecutive patients underwent BI at a tertiary referral center. Demographic data and results of urodynamic studies pre\u2010 and post BI were recorded. At the same time, the patients were asked to complete the validated Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI\u20106) and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire\u2010Urinary (ICIQ\u2010UI).RESULTS: Only 102 eligible patients completed both pre\u2010 and post\u2010operative UDIs and ICIQ\u2010UI questionnaires. Mean follow up was 24 months. No difference was noted between the UDIs and the ICIQ\u2010UI pre\u2010 and post\u2010injection. Median number of injections received was 1. There appeared to be an initial improvement in the majority of patients with a decline in the benefits at 18 months. The degree of improvement in patients with no symptoms pre\u2010treatment was greater than those with mild or moderate symptoms pre\u2010treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of BI were greatest in patients with mild or no stress symptoms. The improvement was not maintained over 18 months of follow up, but the number of patients with symptoms were low. It is concluded that BI is still a good treatment option, with the majority of women feeling a benefit and no complications incurred.",

Exclusion criteria include known cases of diabetes, pre existing renal failure, immunosuppressive medication, and other pre-existing co-morbidities. Consecutive patients attending OPD surgical clinic at UGMC on weekly basis were reviewed. Their demographic details  are documented alongside all the laboratory investigations. Those patients scheduled for elective cholecystectomy are recruited into the study and  enrolled on the day of admission. Before surgery in the operating room, 1.0 mL of venous blood was drawn for PCT measurement from each study participant. Serum samples were centrifuged and the serum stored at -70\u00b0C until use. Serum PCT levels were taken into account in addition to clinical parameters known to be associated with surgical site infections, such as age, sex, BMI, type of surgery, length of surgery, history of antibiotic use, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and perioperative risk of wound infection. For post-operative monitoring, clinical data as well as lab parameters (PCT, blood glucose, blood urea, creatinine, and hemoglobin), were recorded on the day of surgery, the first post-operative day, the second post-operative day, and at the time of discharge (range 4-5 days) after the operation.  Blood samples were collected from each patient immediately before surgery, on the first post-operative day, and at discharge on the fourth or fifth day.

The perioperative data and parameters were investigated. We compared the clinical and radiological data between the PSF group, the POBF group, and the DS\u2010PLIF group.RESULTS: A total of 141 patients with ALDS were enrolled in the study, with an average follow\u2010up time of 24 months. The PSF fusion rate was 92.9% (36/39), and the POBF fusion rate was 92.6% (26/28). The interbody fusion rate of the POBF group was higher than that of the PSF group [92.9% vs. 90.5%, (PSF + POBF) = 90.5%, both P > 0.050].

We diagnosed a confirmed case by reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction testing for Rift Valley fever virus. The severity of the disease was assessed using case fatalities (CF) and survival rates (SR%). Results: We diagnosed 79 patients, with a case fatality rate of 29%. The mean age was 30.65 years (range 10 months\u201069 years). Most cases had at least one bleeding episode, including gastrointestinal bleeding in 29.1% and menorrhagia in 7.6% of females. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (98.7%), headache (86.1%), jaundice (84.8%), and vomiting (81.0%).

Primary and secondary outcome measures were assessed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that determined changes at the end of treatment (EOT), or the difference between baseline and EOT, or changes at each measurement of two or more time points after randomization using meta\u2010analysis techniques. A standardized mean difference (SMD) was defined when comparing continuous variables, and risk ratio (RR) was utilized for dichotomous variables at a threshold of P < 0.05. Results: Six RCTs (total 519 subjects) were identified. Most of the studies included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or DFUs. The mean age was close to 65\u00a0years, and over two\u2010thirds (69.4%) were female. Participants with a short duration of the DFU showed a 58% reduction in the EOT relative risk of complete wound healing (RR\u00a0= 0.42, CI 95% 0.20\u20100.89) in comparison with the nonvitamin D group, but there was no significant difference, with a RR of 1.30 (CI 95% 0.92\u20101.85) in the vitamin D group compared with the control group (RR\u00a0= 0.68, CI 95% 0.44\u20101.05).

The clinical symptoms vary according to the location of the damage and the degree of the damage. 2% of all ischemic stroke cases have lower extremity deficits, and spasticity, muscle atrophy, and other related symptoms affect the patient's activities of daily living and activities of daily living quality, which are the main problems that patients suffer from. Among them, spasticity that occurs in the lower limbs is a disease in which the hyperreflexic state of the skeletal muscle is observed due to the disorder of the nervous system. It is one of the factors that hinder the restoration of mobility in patients with lower limb disorders. In cases of focal motor paralysis, the muscles of the lower extremities, including the gastrocnemius muscle, quadriceps muscle, and hamstring muscle, are paralyzed in a flaccid manner. In addition, spasticity increases as the tone of the muscle is restored due to muscle spasm. Joints are fixed in a flexion posture to increase the pressure on the joint and limit its mobility. An increase in the pressure on the joints and the limited mobility of the joints due to spastic",

The rapid spread of the disease and the limited treatment options have led to a high mortality rate. This study aimed to assess the mortality rate and risk factors associated with Covid19 pneumonia in Khorasan Razavi and the effect of early invasive ventilation on mortality in Covid19\u2010intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods: According to the available records of Covid19\u2010inpatients from 7 hospitals belonging to the Khorasan Razavi Medical Sciences University in Iran, 305 patients were randomly selected and then randomly assigned to two groups of intervention and control. In the intervention group, invasive ventilation was performed immediately when patients presented with hypoxia, whereas patients in the control group were given high\u2010flow nasal catheter (HFNC) during the initial 72 h. The outcome measure chosen for evaluation in terms of statistical significance was between\u2010group mortality rates. Results: The mortality rate among patients who underwent invasive ventilation was 14.86%, whereas the mortality rate among those who underwent HFNC was 29.22%. The 72\u2010hour mortality rate was significantly lower in patients receiving invasive ventilation than in the HFNC group (P<0.001). The risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity, were similar in the intervention and the control groups. Conclusions: The mortality rate in critically ill Covid19 patients is high. Early and effective ventilation has been associated with a lower mortality rate and may result in fewer ICU deaths.",

The tumor thrombus of HCC has the characteristics of strong invasiveness, rapid spread and fast growing. Therefore, to find a novel, effective and reliable treatment for HCC would be meaningful. Currently, radiofrequency thermal therapy has been used with good efficacy in the treatment of small-sized hepatocellular carcinomas and has been widely used in clinical, but this method has some shortcomings, such as being difficult to get the expected curative effect in huge-sized hepatocellular carcinomas, and so on. The new idea of using PVA nano-bubble (PNB) in combination with cryosurgery has been tried in animal experiments. In comparison of other targeted anti-tumor therapies, PVA nano-bubble (PNB) plays its own role in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a new idea and method that has not been widely used in the clinical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. PVA nanobubble has the unique advantage of being harmless to normal tissue without hemorrhagic transformation and its safety and feasibility have no safety concerns, as well as minimal adverse reaction in patients with high recurrence rate. In conclusion, PVA nano-bubble (PNB) + cryosurgery can provide an approach for preventing the recurrence of HCC after liver resection, which has important clinical significance in improving the prognosis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer related death throughout the world.

Background and rationale: Over one third of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) progress to develop biliary cancer (BC) with only an estimated 3 years survival. PBC is a chronic autoimmune disease leading to progressive fibrosis and destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. Over 90% of BC in PBC are of an intrahepatic type with a high cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) component. Elevated risk of BC in PBC is associated with several clinical, serological, radiological, and histological characteristics. Previous GWAS identified single nucleotide variants associated with risk of BC in PBC as well as liver fibrosis. However, these risk factors only captured a small proportion of the genetic contribution of BC risk in PBC, suggesting that additional genetic factors remain to be discovered. To this end, we assembled a large consortium of 10 UK referral centres and several centres in Europe.

Both SUPREMAT1 (NCT02116377) and SUPREMAT2 (NCT02609268), randomized, double\u2010blind, multicenter studies, are currently underway to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of Durellis\u00ae (Durosant\u00ae), after implantation in the medial and/or lateral carpal tunnel, in order to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Durosant\u00ae for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In SUPREMAT1, Durosant\u00ae is implanted as a single intra\u2010operative dose and the patient is assessed up to 6months, while in SUPREMAT2, the implant is administered as half dose implants per each side with a second re\u2010injection. The primary outcome measures of the SUPREMAT1 and 2 studies are the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), symptom bother rating, and CTS\u2010Related Localized Symptom Score (CTS\u2010RLSS) at treatment Day (T0) and up to 6months.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of and associated factors with pregabalin consumption in a population receiving treatment for substance use disorder. Methods: We conducted an observational study on 150 patients admitted for the treatment of substance use disorder. All patients were screened for pregabalin consumption at admission. Clinical and demographic data were collected and analyzed to identify associated factors. Results: The overall proportion of pregabalin use was 43.3% (65 of 150 individuals). In Multivariate analysis; having a diagnosis of depression (OR 4.08, CI [1.62\u20109.76], p 0.003) and using other benzodiazepines (Odds ratio: 3.68, CI [1.30\u201010.46], p 0.01) were identified as the predictors of pregabalin use. Having a prescription for pregabalin was strongly and positively associated with pregabalin use (OR 47.3, CI [22.84\u201098.33], p < 0.001). Conclusion: Among patients treated for drug addiction, a significant proportion of patients used pregabalin at the time of admission. These cases are an indication of increasing pregabalin misuse which demands closer monitoring and regulation of use. Furthermore, depressive symptoms and other benzodiazepine use were correlated with pregabalin use and should be closely evaluated. 2023 Elsevier Ltd",

What do you think? \n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nOne type of toothpaste widely utilized in dentistry to date, known as the CPP-ACP (Casein Phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate) system, can strengthen the enamel with help from fluoride. CPP-ACP technology has been developed in the 1980s and is used in many commercial toothpastes. The most commonly used CPP-ACP material is called Recaldent\u2122. CPP-ACP is a biologically active protein-based compound derived from milk. CPP-ACP releases Ca, P and phosphoproteins from the protein. CPP-ACP has the ability to incorporate saliva calcium into the outer surface of the demineralized enamel crystal and bind this calcium ion in the crystal. CPP-ACP and fluoride is often used in dentistry for remineralization therapy. However, this approach has limitations. For example, some of the CPP-ACP molecules penetrate the teeth, and others do not. Moreover, they may be less effective when a toothbrush is not available or when a person does not know exactly where the demineralized tooth is. The authors propose to develop a new, non-invasive tooth remineralization therapy. The authors believe that this therapy is better because instead of coating the tooth surface, we can deliver the active agent directly to the demineralized areas using toothbrush and/or chewing gum delivery methods. The aim of the present study is to investigate a new material, chitosan-coated gold nanoshells (CNGS) for tooth remineralization therapy. Nanoshells show promising oral care benefits when combined with other treatments. It has been shown that CPP-ACP and chitosan work synergistically to promote the remineralization of enamel.

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2018, with \"patellofemoral pain syndrome,\" \"low energy shock wave therapy,\" \"exercise therapy,\" and \"randomized controlled trial\" as key search words. Seven randomized controlled trials involving 274 patients were included in the final meta\u2010analysis. The data from individual studies showed that SWT combined with exercise therapy significantly decreased the pain numeric rating scale (p<0.01) and improved WOMAC physical function (p<0.05) and Lysholm knee score (p<0.05) in patients. In addition, the combined treatment significantly improved the KOOS function subscale score (p<0.05), Patellar Pain (p<0.05), and VAS\u2010knee (p<0.05) in patients. This meta\u2010analysis suggested that the combined use of SWT and exercise therapy may be more effective than exercise therapy alone in reducing pain and improving functional outcomes in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. However, the therapeutic effects may vary by intervention duration. Hence, a larger sample size is required to further validate the results.\n\nIntroduction\nPatellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a chronic disease with the main clinical manifestation of anterior knee pain, which is accompanied by a series of symptoms such as pain, effusion, and muscle weakness. It is mainly caused by a variety of risk factors, including anatomical abnormalities, muscle strength, gait and movement pattern, and knee cartilage degeneration . Most cases of PFPS are conservative, and the main treatment method is non-pharmacological intervention. Exercise therapy",

We set out to examine the characteristics and outcomes during 2 years of psychosocial therapy treatment among children and adolescents diagnosed with MDD, their parents, and teachers. Methods: We recruited participants aged 7\u201317, with parent and teacher evaluation of a depressive episode according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM\u20105). Participants received weekly group therapy treatment for 2 years. Patients rated depression severity using the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). Results: Three hundred forty\u2010three participants completed the study and were included in this analysis. The mean age was 12.5 years and 60% were girls. Their mean CDI score was 44.0. Of the 343 participants, 14.9% met criteria for persistent severe depression after 2 years of treatment, and 65.2% met criteria for a depression\u2010free state. Teachers rated the average CDI score the highest, followed by children and parents (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The severity of depression was consistently lower in patients than caregivers. Children with persistent severe MDD over 2 years of treatment should be considered at higher risk for a cascade of psychiatric disorders.",

It is an antibody that blocks programmed\u2010death\u20101 (PD\u20101), which helps tumor cells evade immune system detection and destruction. In this study, we explored the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in patients with mNSCLC and adenocarcinoma histology who had progressed after receiving other treatments. Methods: A total of 31 mNSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma histology and disease progression following chemoradiotherapy or as first\u2010line platinum\u2010based doublet therapy for advanced disease were enrolled in this study between November 2014 and October 2015. Patients received nivolumab every 3 weeks until disease recurrence or progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. After the first cycle of nivolumab, restaging was done 4 \u2010 6 weeks after the initial response. Efficacy was assessed 9 \u2010 12 weeks after the first infusion. The primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and progression\u2010free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: The median age of the 31 patients was 70 years (interquartile range: 63, 76). 12 patients (39%) had squamous subtype and 19 patients (61%) had nonsmoking\u2010related disease. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were found in nine patients (29%). 22 patients (71%) had stage IV disease, whereas 9 (29%) had stages IIIB or IV. 12 patients (39%) received one line of chemotherapy prior to enrollment, 13 (42%) received two lines of chemotherapy and 6 (19%) received only chemoradiotherapy, which did not include a first\u2010line platinum\u2010based doublet.

Our novel molecule, MM-140, is under investigation for its potential to treat relapsed or refractory MM. This is a phase 1 trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MM-140 given as a single agent intravenously (IV) over 4 and 22 weeks. This study will also evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity and evaluate MM-140's drug-drug interaction with daratumumab.\nDESIGN: This is a phase 1, single-arm, open-label, two-staged dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial. The primary objective is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MM-140 and evaluate the safety and tolerability of MM-140 in participants with relapsed or refractory MM. The RP2D will be determined based on 1) the proportion of participants with adverse events consistent with grade 2 (CTCAE v5.0), 2) dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and 3) clinically significant deviation of pharmacokinetic parameters. In addition, the study will evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity at the RP2D. In the dose-expansion, participants will receive MM-140 and daratumumab concomitantly.\nPARTICIPANTS: Adult participants (18 years or older) with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have failed 1-3 prior lines of therapy are eligible. No prior treatment with daratumumab or proteasome inhibitors is required.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants will receive MM-140 IV for 6 cycles.

What else would you like to add to the inclusion criteria? \n\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Radiation therapy (RT) has been used to control symptoms of locally advanced or metastatic bone metastases (BM) since the late 19th century.1 The advent of modern radiotherapy techniques, namely intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), has led to better local control rates than conventional radiotherapy. Moreover, the rapid introduction of IMRT and SBRT has resulted in limited data available to compare these newer techniques with each other. Material and Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed. The search strategy was comprehensive and focused on randomized trials (RCT) and high\u2010level observational studies only. Results: Overall, 17 articles were reviewed, and 5 RCTs met our criteria for inclusion. This review demonstrates the superior local control rates of IMRT compared to conventional RT as well as the benefit of SBRT over IMRT. Furthermore, it shows that IMRT delivers a better overall survival than conventional RT despite the use of higher doses. However, there is currently no evidence showing significant improvement in OS with the use of SBRT in the setting of palliative RT. Conclusion: This is a robust systematic review of high\u2010level literature in the use of IMRT and SBRT showing that, regardless of technique, IMRT and SBRT have similar efficacy in the treatment of painful BM. Moreover, the use of IMRT delivers a better rate of local control while maintaining local toxicity, especially with the addition of gaiters. However, there is a lack of high\u2010level evidence showing a clear survival benefit of both techniques over one another. Randomized trials with appropriate study designs and adequate statistical powering should be conducted to better characterize the benefits of these local treatment methods.

Methods: A nationwide random population survey was conducted among 23,291 community\u2010dwelling adults of \u2265 18 years of age. Mental disorders were measured using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Depression was ascertained by the 12\u2010item short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (short\u2010GDS\u201012), and suicide ideation was ascertained by the suicide\u2010related item (SQ5) derived from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Sleep disturbance was assessed using the Sleep Subscale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS\u201021). Multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between sleep disturbance and depression/suicide ideation. Results: Depression was present in 814 (3.5%) participants, and suicide ideation was present in 482 (2.1%) participants. The multinomial logistic regression showed that poor sleep quality was independently associated with depression and suicide ideation [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10\u20101.48; adjusted OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.11\u20101.55, respectively]. The ordinal regression analysis further showed that participants with greater severity of sleep disturbance had higher odds of having severe/very severe depression compared with those without sleep disturbance (adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.45\u20102.00), even after adjusting for all potential confounders. Significant interactions were also detected between sleep disturbance and depression/suicidal ideation, showing that the risk of depression was most pronounced among those with severe sleep disturbance (adjusted OR = 2.",

Patients and Methods: A retrospective cohort study used data from the National Cancer Database for 89,099 patients (41,949 TA and 47,150 SR) who presented with non\u2010metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma between 2012 and 2017. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) with secondary outcomes of mortality, morbidity, and cost\u2010effectiveness. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves were used to estimate overall survival and time to next treatment. A cost\u2010effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted from the perspective of US healthcare payers. Results: The median age was 68 (range 32\u201389). TA and SR were similar in terms of sex (62.8% vs 60.6%, p=0.004). Compared to women (HR: 7.5, p<0.001), TA was performed on more White patients (87.2% vs 85.2%, p<0.001). For White patients, TA was associated with OS compared to SR (HR: 0.75, p<0.001) while for non\u2010White patients, there was no difference in OS. Overall, treatment was associated with OS regardless of patient race. Conclusion: Although there was no statistically significant difference in mortality rates between patients who underwent TA and those who underwent SR, these 2 strategies were associated with significant differences in OS and morbidity rates among White vs non\u2010White patients.

We sought to determine whether the surgical technique, whether conventional or coblation tonsillectomy with either bipolar or monopolar energy, was associated with a difference in bleeding risk in 2 large studies. Methods: Our retrospective study included patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy using our coblation protocol. We used our institutional database to identify patients undergoing any tonsillectomy technique between 2005 and 2015 followed by at least 30 days of observation. Descriptive statistics were calculated for perioperative parameters. Univariable analysis identified risk factors associated with post\u2010tonsillectomy hemorrhage (PTH). Multivariable analysis was conducted to identify independent risk factors of PTH. Results: This study consists of 1,526 patients undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomies between 2005 and 2015. In 94% of cases, bipolar energy was used and 46% used monopolar energy. Of the 1,526 patients, the cohort had a 3.15% overall rate of post\u2010operative bleeding (141 bleeding events, 92 bipolar 55 monopolar cohort), whereas 3 patients experienced a more severe complication (6.58% re\u2010operation patients):2 required blood transfusions, 1 developed pneumonia, and 2 patients presented for hematoma evacuation after spontaneous spontaneous reabsorption of the hemorrhage (13\u2010day post\u2010op).

The cells used for this study are immune cells known as dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are found in the immune system and help the body to fight infection. They are one of the body's defences against cancer. \n\nDendritic cells can be made from a patient's own immune cells. They can then be activated to make them better at fighting cancer.

Thank you! This was an excellent discussion on inclusion and exclusion criteria. I appreciate your input and look forward to finalizing the criteria for the study. \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: Although endoscopic ultrasound\u2010 guided transgastric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (EUS\u2010Guided ERC) has been widely used for many years, there are few reports on EUS\u2010Guided ERC with large duodenal diverticulum (DD) cases. Herein, we first review 5 cases of EUS\u2010Guided ERC with large DDs. Case Presentation: For five patients, 26\u201338 year old (mean age, 30.3 years old) with DD and cholangitis, Ercp was performed by the EUS\u2010Guided method with DDs ranging in size between 5.8cm to 6.7cm. There was no intraoperative complication, such as bleeding and perforation. No patient developed pancreatitis after treatment, and no patient had DD or cholangitis recurrence during follow\u2010up. Discussion: The present study demonstrated that EUS\u2010Guided ERC had high safety and efficacy when performed for patients with large DDs. The procedure was well tolerated; however, it was still associated with a learning curve. Therefore, well training and understanding of relevant anatomy and technical skills (including fluoroscopy and pancreatic duct cannulation) are important for a safe and effective technique. Conclusions: For patients with DDs, careful preprocedural imaging and accurate diagnosis of the anatomy are necessary. EUS\u2010Guided ERC and pancreatic sphincterotomy can effectively deal with cholangitis, which offers a new method of treating refractory cholangitis, improving the prognosis of patients, and reducing the incidence of cholangitis recurrence.",

Recent literature has shown that a subset of patients with HER2\u2010positive breast cancer and germline\u00a0BRCA mutation may be candidates for systemic therapy in addition to neo\u2010adjuvant chemotherapy and/or HER2 therapy. In this study, the authors assessed outcomes of patients with HER\u2010positive breast cancer who were not candidates for PARP inhibitors but had germline\u00a0BRCA mutations. The authors identified 88 patients who received sequential dual checkpoint inhibitors (n=21) and then an anti\u2010HER2 agent (n=55), or who received either dual or single checkpoint inhibitors (n=12) with HER2\u2010targeted therapy (n=9 and n=3, respectively). With a median follow\u2010up of 32.2 months, 7\u2010year outcomes included an invasive disease\u2010free survival (IDFS) rate of 67.9%, recurrence\u2010free survival rate of 69.8%, and distant recurrence\u2010free survival rate of 66.5%. Compared with previous studies, the authors observed a higher proportion of lymph node\u2010negative patients and lower proportion of those with visceral disease. The authors found that pathological complete response (pCR) rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients receiving sequential dual checkpoint inhibitors and anti\u2010HER2 therapy were 80% for the breast and 97% for the axilla. Overall, the authors found that high rates of pCR were observed with this regimen, but this remains to be seen in randomized studies. The authors also noted that patients who received dual checkpoint inhibitors with anti\u2010HER2 therapy had significantly higher IDFS and distant recurrence\u2010free survival rates compared with those who received both types of therapy sequentially or who received only a single type of therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.50; p",

            "That's a crucial criterion to include. By considering the extent of myometrial invasion, we can better understand the relationship between immunohistochemistry, prognosis, and the need for specific surgical interventions. Any other suggestions for inclusion criteria?",
            "That's an important consideration. Including lymph node invasion as a criterion will provide valuable information for guiding surgical planning and treatment decisions. Can you think of any other criteria?",

            "That's an excellent addition. By including the expression of biomarkers as a criterion, we can explore new prognostic markers and potentially improve patient stratification.",
            "That's correct! The inclusion criteria for your trial are as follows: aged 36-72 years, previously diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma, histological type of the tumor, myometrial invasion, lymph node invasion, cervical invasion, and biomarkers expression. Well done! Is there anything else I can assist you with?"

This helps us further investigate the treatment's efficacy in a larger population. Are you comfortable with this criterion? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: To investigate the effect of a 2\u2010year exercise program on the cognitive function of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) on stable medication.METHODS: 42 male patients with a history of IHD, aged between 50\u201070 yr, on stable medication were randomized into two groups: an experimental group (n = 23) who performed a 2\u2010year, structured exercise program along with usual treatment; and a control group (n = 19) who were given usual treatment. After the exercise program, patients were assessed using serial neuropsychological tests to assess changes in cognitive function.RESULTS: The experimental group showed higher scores than controls in several tests (Wilcoxon Test, p = 0.005).CONCLUSION: The 2\u2010year, structured exercise program improved cognitive function and prevented cognitive decline among IHD patients.",

I think this criterion is necessary. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis is a phase III open-label, multicenter, three-arm design, randomized controlled study. This study aims to compare the efficacy, safety, and quality of life of lenalidomide combined with bortezomib or dexamethasone alone as first-line treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have participated in the 3-weekly bortezomib and dexamethasone maintenance therapy for the previous 3-6 cycles after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe overall survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is around 5 years, and relapse or refractory is the main cause of death after 3-6 3-month cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone maintenance therapy (MT) after ASCT. In addition to MT after ASCT, there is still no established treatment regimen for patients with relapse or refractory. Lenalidomide is a new drug developed for the treatment of patients with MM who have relapsed or refractory or are refractory to therapy. Lenalidomide plus bortezomib and dexamethasone (LBd) has received orphan designation in the United States and the European Union (EU) for the treatment of MM. The study is a prospective, randomized controlled, multicenter, three-arm design, phase III study, in which patients with refractory and recurrent MM after 3-6 cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone maintenance therapy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are recruited and randomized to receive lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone or bortezomib and dexamethasone as first-line treatment for patients with refractory and recurrent multiple myeloma. The primary endpoints are the time to disease progression and overall survival. In the safety evaluation, the adverse reactions of the two treatment groups are compared. The secondary indicators",

Participants must have a creatinine clearance of at least 50 mL/min (calculated per the Cockcroft and Gault formula). This criterion ensures that participants have sufficient renal function to clear the study drug safely. What are your thoughts on this criterion?"

            "Exactly! Consistency in the patient population is crucial for accurate evaluation. Now, let's discuss the criterion for Part 2. Previously untreated participants with a FLIPI-1 score of 0 to 5 are included in this phase. This allows for a broader range of participants in the randomized controlled phase of the study.
