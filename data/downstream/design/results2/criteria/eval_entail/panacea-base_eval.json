            "Let me see if I understand your question correctly. You're asking why the fourth criterion requires a neoplastic lesion with a high percentage of neoplastic cells? \n\nYes, I think it's an important criterion. The tumor sample should have a sufficient amount of neoplastic cells to detect genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications. The cut-off of 70% was set based on the previous studies, which showed that the presence of a high percentage of neoplastic cells was necessary to obtain reliable and accurate results using genetic and epigenetic sequencing. Could you share more details about the fourth criterion, such as why you selected 70% and what data support this number?",
            "Sure! Here are my suggestions for the exclusion criteria:\n\n1. Prior or concomitant malignancy except for carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin cancer or low-grade follicular lymphoma.\n2. Prior history of any systemic anti-cancer treatment.\n3.

Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\nI think these exclude all the participants who may confound the study results or cannot comply with the study protocol. What do you think? \n\nAbstract:\nThe study of the pathophysiology of obesity is an important area of research. Studies have shown that obese individuals have a higher risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to lean individuals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in metabolic markers in obese individuals after bariatric surgery and investigate whether these changes were influenced by the type of bariatric procedure performed. This quasi\u2010experimental study recruited obese individuals who underwent bariatric surgery between August 2018 and May 2019. 49 subjects were included, of which 26 received Roux\u2010en\u2010Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and 23 received sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Metabolic markers including Body Mass Index (BMI), lipid profile, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA\u2010IR) were measured before and after surgery. Data were analyzed using paired t\u2010test and the chi\u2010square test. A p\u2010value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in BMI, FBG, total cholesterol, low\u2013density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL\u2010C), and HOMA\u2010IR in both groups (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in BMI, total cholesterol, low\u2013density lipoprotein",

Secondary study endpoints: a) Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from the start of enrollment to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause.\nb) Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported.\nc) Overall response rate (ORR) will be assessed after treatment.\nd) Quality of life of patients will be measured using validated questionnaires (e.g., EORTC-HN35).\ne) Changes in tumor biomarkers and gene mutations before and after treatment, if available.\nf) Patient satisfaction with treatment and clinical management.\n\nAre these endpoints consistent with the study objectives? \n\n\nDoes the trial involve multiple intervention/treatment arms with multiple control or comparison groups?"

The subjects were divided into two groups: preoperative exercise training group group and postoperative exercise training group. A total of 60 participants were assigned to each group using a computer\u2010generated random number table. The exercise prescription included warm up, stretching, strength training, and aerobic training. The exercise group completed the training three times a week for 4 weeks prior to the surgery and 3 times a week for 6 weeks after the surgery. The exercise training was started approximately 6 weeks after surgery. The primary outcome measure was the IPSS score, and the secondary outcome measures included the QOL score, Mental health score, and body mass index.The IPSS and QOL scores were significantly lower at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the surgery in the preoperative exercise training group than in the postoperative exercise training group. The mental health scores were significantly higher in the postoperative exercise training group than in the preoperative exercise training group. The body mass index was significantly higher in the postoperative exercise training group than in the preoperative exercise training group at the 12th week.Preoperative and postoperative exercise training had similar effects on the recovery of LUTS. The preoperative exercise training group had a lower IPSS and QOL scores than the postoperative exercise training group, indicating that longer exercise duration reduced postoperative side effects and improved recovery.Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were enrolled in a study comparing preoperative and postoperative exercise programs for recovery from radical prostatectomy.

Clinical data are gathered on the day of presentation at the centre. The tool, the 6\u2010item PREDICT scoring system is then used as soon as investigations have been done and the results considered.RESULTS: For 79 patients (66%) the tool recommended an invasive coronary investigation; the remaining 41 underwent a conservative management strategy which included an early non\u2010invasive ambulatory programme. Out of the 120 patients, 80 had a normal outcome, and 40 had an abnormal outcome confirmed initially or subsequently. Two patients with an abnormal outcome had their diagnoses made within 6 months, three had theirs made between 7 and 18 months, and two after 2.5 years. Forty\u2010eight (40%) of the 120 had a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), but only 21 (17.5%) had no abnormality on any of the investigations they had undergone.CONCLUSIONS: The 6\u2010item PREDICT scoring system is an effective tool in reducing the need for invasive coronary investigation.",

The purpose of this study was, thus, to investigate the feasibility and impact on pain measurement of using the Patient InformatioN for Intensive Care Evaluation scale, the pain scale validated for the intensive care units, on 36 patients with dementia and pain in a geriatric rehabilitation unit. Patients were admitted from an acute hospital and had been referred to geriatric rehabilitation for neurologic or orthopedic decompensation. Patients were randomly allocated into control and intervention groups. Each one received standard care for pain management (opioids, nonopioids, or topical treatments); the intervention group was assessed using the PINNICLE scale in addition. Nurses received training on its use, as well as on the recognition and management of pain. The PINNICLE scale demonstrated its feasibility to be used in the evaluation of pain of patients with dementia. It allowed to identify painful situations, and even to detect a previously unrecognized pain condition. It was also possible to improve pain management and reduce medication use. Pain must be considered an essential clinical dimension of patients with dementia. The PINNICLE scale may be an important tool to improve management of pain for these patients.",

In addition, most of these proceedings papers are not published in scholarly journals, which may cast doubt on their quality.

In spite of the advances in treatment of dementia, there are still 24.3 million individuals living with mild cognitive impairment who have no disease-modifying treatment options available. There is an unmet need for accessible and effective interventions for cognitive health in the aging brain. tDCS, a safe, non-invasive neuromodulation technique that utilizes weak electrical currents to modulate neuronal excitability, has emerged as a promising approach in cognitive rehabilitation. There is mounting evidence to suggest that tDCS can improve cognitive outcomes in a range of clinical conditions and healthy populations. However, there is still limited research on the use of tDCS for individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the context of cognitive functioning, mood, and sleep. OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on cognition, mood and sleep at 2 months. The secondary aim is to evaluate the effects on brain structure and function. Specifically, the study aims to: evaluate the short-term effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on the cognitive outcomes of verbal fluency, memory, and executive function evaluate the short-term effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on mood assessed by the PROMIS-mood instrument evaluate the short-term effects of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise on sleep assessed through questionnaires (PSQI and PSQI-2) evaluate the effect of tDCS combined with aerobic exercise through functional brain imaging to assess whether changes in brain structure and function mediate improved cognitive performance in participants with mild cognitive impairment.

            "That's a valuable criterion to include. Excluding individuals with dementia or psychotic disorder will ensure that the study results are not influenced by these conditions. Adding this to our exclusion criteria will help us focus on participants with more homogeneous characteristics. Are there any other exclusion criteria you'd like to add? \nAbstract:\nAIM: The first aim of the present study was to develop a questionnaire for evaluating quality of life (QoL) before and after total hip arthroplasty (THA). The second aim involved validating the questionnaire in a study that consisted of 50 patients that have undergone THA. The final aim focused on determining whether the score on the questionnaire reflects a significant improvement in health\u2010related QoL (HR\u2010QoL).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The QoL\u201050 questionnaire was developed using the method of test\u2010retest, reproducibility, and content validity. Fifty patients that have undergone THA are being used to test the face and concurrent validity of the questionnaire. We validated the developed questionnaire by comparing its sensitivity to the standard score of the generic EQ\u20105D\u20105L and the disease\u2010specific Short From Hip Scale (SF\u201012).RESULTS: Based on qualitative analysis, 10 items were selected as QoL criteria. The mean QoL score of patients pre\u2010 and postoperatively was 1.51 \u00b1 0.28 and 3.47 \u00b1 0.23, respectively. The Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire was 0.75. The QoL questionnaire showed high reliability for QoL changes (ICC = 0.98, P < 0.001). However, it showed slight agreement with the EQ\u20105D\u20105L questionnaire (ICC = 0.16, P < 0.001). The SF\u201012 questionnaire exhibited slightly greater agreement (r = 0.79, P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the QoL\u201050 questionnaire is a valid instrument for detecting HRQoL changes before and after THA.

Fourteen patients each received AFSC suspensions using two different formulations. The first four patients of both formulations acted as their own control.RESULTS: Two\u2010dimensional and three\u2010dimensional images of magnetic resonance images (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) images were obtained before and 3\u2010months following AFSC administration for all patients. Synovitis and bone regeneration occurred in most patients with or without intra\u2010articular hyaluronic acid (HA) use. A significant decrease in synovial fluid viscosity was observed after AFSC administration. Mild side effects were observed, such as pain (n = 4), swelling (n = 2), and fever (n = 1). However, all side effects disappeared within seven days.CONCLUSION: The AFSC is a promising treatment candidate for OA with mild or moderate symptoms. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of AFSCs in OA treatment.\n\nIntroduction\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent type of arthritis. OA is a chronic, in\ufb02ammatory degenerative disease that produces pain and joint deformation through progressive cartilage destruction. OA symptoms significantly reduce patients\u2019 quality of life and severely impact their activities of daily living.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hyaluronic acid (HA) are among the most frequently administered medications",

            "Perfect! On to the next one. \n\nIntroduction: While there is consensus that cancer treatments significantly impair physical function, there has been little attention paid to whether cognitive function is similarly affected. This could be particularly noteworthy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at high risk for cognitive decline. A previous meta-analysis demonstrated no significant cognitive changes with HNSCC treatment. However, no studies included patients with cognitive impairments and/or delirium at enrollment. Furthermore, all studies had a low risk of bias. The purpose of this study is to compare baseline cognitive function prior to initiation of treatment between newly diagnosed HNSCC patients with high risk for cognitive decline versus without using a validated tool. Method: Patients were recruited to the Neuro-Onco-Supportive-Treatment (NOST) clinical care trial at the University of Maryland (NCT03057184). Patients were randomized into the control arm vs the cognitive support intervention arm. High-risk criteria for cognitive decline included at least one prior stroke or moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment per screening assessment tools. For cognitive impairment, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used. Answering 6 or less questions correctly indicates mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. The cognitive support arm includes a cognitive enhancement protocol. Controls undergo standard symptom care per standard oncology care. Primary objective of the NOST trial is to determine the time to post-treatment cognitive decline (TCMD). Differences in TCM with cognitive impairment and without between arms will be reported according to the intent to treat (ITT) model. Secondary objective includes evaluating the feasibility of the cognitive protocol. Results: Preliminary data will be presented. Limitations: We anticipate high dropout rate due to the nature of the trial. Conclusion: This study will allow investigators to evaluate the degree of cognitive impairment within this high-risk group at baseline and compare the frequency of treatment induced cognitive decline (TDIC), comparing between the control and cognitive support arms of the NOST trial.",

            "The eighth inclusion criterion is \"Patients who were not taking any pain medication\". This criterion is important as pain medications can potentially confound the results of the study and impair the effectiveness of the stress ball intervention. What do you think about this criterion? \n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate and compare the effect of different types of music on anxiety, pain, satisfaction in patients undergoing colonic examination. The effect of classical and religious music on anxiety, pain and satisfaction in patients undergoing colonic examination will be evaluated. The music will be provided by an earphone to the patients undergoing colonic examination by an ultrasonography probe attached to their shoulder. The subjects will be randomly assigned to experimental group and control group. The subjects in the experimental group will listen to the music of their choice. The subjects in the control group will not listen to any music.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe method of this study was developed by Hattori et al in 2007 from Tokyo, Japan. They demonstrated that music reduces anxiety and pain during a colonoscopy examination. The effects of music on anxiety during colonoscopy have been evaluated since 1980. The aim is to reduce anxiety and pain, and to increase patient satisfaction with the examination. However, despite the widespread use of music, there have been no previous studies in endoscopy clinics regarding the effect of music on anxiety, pain and patient satisfaction in the colonoscopy procedure. Colorectal cancer, which is the most common cancer in our country, affects about 7.4% of the population and is the second most common cause of cancer mortality in the world. Early diagnosis and treatment with rapid colonoscopy play a very important role in mortality and morbidity. Colonoscopy is a simple, noninvasive procedure and the golden standard for screening and symptom evaluation. In addition, with the use of conscious sedation, it can be performed as painless as possible without any harm to the patient. However, many patients have phobia and anxiety due to colonoscopy. Patients often experience anxiety and stress during the colonoscopy procedure. Colonoscopy with conscious sedation may cause side effects or complications related to sedation. Patients often experience some pain, anxiety and drowsiness during a colonoscopic examination.",

Let's proceed to the next exclusion criterion. \nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea has been shown to increase left atrial (LA) size and cause electrical abnormalities in both patients with and without atrial fibrillation (AF). The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on LA function in AF patients are unknown. However, CPAP therapy can increase LA systolic function in congestive heart failure patients, the impact of CPAP on the LA in patients with AF and preserved systolic function is unknown.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CPAP therapy on LA volume, function, and electrical properties in non\u2010emergent AF patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; ejection fraction (EF)>50%).METHODS: This is a blinded, randomized, cross\u2010over trial in which patients with left atrial enlargement and AF with normal EF were randomized to CPAP or no CPAP for 6 weeks. Cardiac MRI was performed before and after treatment. The primary outcome was change in LA volume index. The change in regional and global longitudinal strain was examined as a secondary outcome.RESULTS: Eighteen patients with non\u2010emergent AF and normal EF were enrolled and underwent MRI (CPAP; n = 8 and no CPAP; n = 10). Mean age was 60.2\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7 years and 60% were male. Diastolic function was normal in all patients, and cardiac MRI revealed similar ventricular volumes and function in both groups before treatment. Six weeks of CPAP therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the LA volume index (CPAP vs. no CPAP: 35.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1\u00a0mL/m2 vs. 36.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2\u00a0mL/m2; P < 0.01). Additionally, the regional strain in the LA wall was significantly increased (39.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8% vs. 34.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8%; P < 0.01).

The study will also evaluate healthcare resource usage and quality of life (QOL).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is an open-label, observational, longitudinal, multicenter prospective real-world study of adult and pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis initiating dupilumab in routine clinical practice in Canada and Europe. Eligible patients will be seen at regular clinic visits during the duration of the observational period. At each visit, investigators will collect demographic information, disease severity, medication adherence, and overall symptoms through questionnaires on patient health-related quality of life and disease and skin symptom severity. The investigators will also collect information on biologic treatment history and treatment side effects, healthcare resourcing in the form of doctor and patient service use/costs, and information for calculating overall treatment costs and cost per unit of skin clearance.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Prospective Multicentre Real-world Observational Study Evaluating the Effectiveness, Tolerability, and Healthcare Resource Utilization in Patients With Atopic Dermatitis Initiating Dupilumab in Routine Clinical Practice in Canada and Europe\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAtopic Dermatitis\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Dupilumab\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Canadian adult and pediatric patients >6 years of age",

This criterion is necessary to avoid confounding effects from concurrent therapies and ensure that the results of the study are attributed solely to the Unified Protocol. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) in adults living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with comorbid depression and/or anxiety. The purpose of the research is to evaluate the efficacy of the UP as an adjunctive intervention to the MS-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy (MS-CBT) and determine if its use is superior to the use of a waitlist control. It is hypothesized that participants assigned to the UP + MS-CBT condition will show a greater reduction in depressive symptomology, anxiety symptomology, and MS-specific distress than those assigned to the MS-CBT only or waitlist control conditions.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nRationale: Depression and anxiety are commonly reported symptoms in individuals living with a chronic illness such as MS, with rates approaching 50%. These symptoms can lead to decreased quality of life, decreased functioning, and adherence to treatment plans. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a recommended evidence-based therapy for depression and anxiety that has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms in individuals with MS. However, CBT is often not available or accessible to individuals living with MS, and it is often difficult to find practitioners with expertise in delivering both CBT and a cognitive approach to depression and anxiety in this population. The Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is a CBT-based intervention that has been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety in multiple populations and formats, including in-person settings, telehealth delivery, and as an individual and group modality. The UP has not been adapted for individuals with MS. This proposed pilot study will evaluate the effectiveness of the 12-week UP + MS-specific CBT in an adult population of MS. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate a revised UP that has been modified to address MS-specific issues. Based on feedback, it is envisioned that the UP",

The aim of the trial is to study the effectiveness of the Unified Protocol on emotion dysregulation in patients with asthma.Methods. Fifty\u2010six patients, 34 females and 22 males, 55.73 +/\u2010 16.68 years old with diagnosis of asthma will be recruited. They will be assigned randomly to treatment or control groups (n = 28). The treatment group will receive the Unified Protocol of Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders for 12 weeks, whereas the control group will not receive any intervention. The primary outcome will be assessed by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) at baseline, post\u2010treatment, 6\u2010week, 6\u2010month, and 12\u2010month follow\u2010up. The secondary outcome will comprise quality of life (as measured by the Asthma\u2010QoL), anxiety, depression, sleep, and mindfulness assessed at each assessment with the corresponding scale. A repeated\u2010measures ANOVA will be performed on outcome measures. Results. Preliminary data have been obtained in the first 23 patients enrolled (15 females and 8 males, mean age: 45.22 +/\u2010 18.84 years old).

So far, patients receiving the Unified Protocol showed significant improvement in comparison with the control group at 12 weeks after the end of the intervention. The impact of such treatment could be long\u2010lasting considering the improvement observed at the last follow\u2010up. Since few interventions are currently available for patients with asth"

In addition, some patients receiving DEX\u2010IP therapy during awake surgery (AS) showed improvement in quality of life and cognition. Our pilot study is a single\u2010arm, prospective study which evaluated the safety and performance of DEX\u2010IP in patients who underwent AS for movement disorder. METHODS: The study design consisted of evaluation of safety, feasibility, and the effects of treatment on cognition and mood. Patients' safety, adverse events, and vital signs were assessed. Adverse events were defined as serious adverse events during AS and within 7\u00a0days. Cognitive and mood status were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: We conducted AS in 40 patients. The mean age was 66.3\u00b110.1 years, and 85% of the total patients (n\u00a0=\u00a034) were male.

Adult patients aged over 20 years with symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral body fractures (OVFs) with or without pain and/or limitation of movement\n2. Radiologic confirmation of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures (13-15: OF2.1, OF2.3, OF3.1, OF3.2 or OF4 on AO Spine classification) with anterior wedge angle of at least 15 degrees and at least 25% height loss on lumbar spine radiography, lateral thoracolumbar spine radiography, or computed tomography (CT) after the fracture\n3.

The secondary outcomes were pain, functionality, and patient satisfaction assessed by pain VAS, Owestry Disability Index (ODI) score and McMaster University Low Back Radiating Pain Questionnaire (MLQ) scores respectively at 12 months. I believe that the proposed study design carefully considers the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the randomization process, and data collection and analysis methods. It also appropriately defines the primary and secondary outcomes, ensuring that they are relevant and scientifically meaningful.

            "Agreed. [DESIGN] In this prospective study, we will include patients presenting to our institution with acute vertebral fractures and determine their eligibility for the study by the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Initially, we will use clinical evaluation and imaging studies to assess the patient's condition and ensure that they meet the inclusion criteria. Then, informed consent will be obtained for patients who are deemed eligible. Before surgery, we will obtain preoperative radiographs, CT scans, and MRIs. The surgical technique will be performed as follows: After positioning the patient prone, a posterior transpedicular approach will be used to enter the vertebral body through a 10- to 15-mm incision on the posterolateral aspect of the spine. The pedicle and superior and inferior endplates will be identified and reamed to create a channel. A balloon will then be inserted into the channel and inflated to create a cavity within the vertebral body. After deflating and removing the balloon, porous titanium microspheres will be filled into the cavity using a cannula. The excess material will be removed, and the wound will be closed appropriately. Postoperative management will consist of bed rest for 3 days, followed by ambulation and rehabilitation as tolerated. Postoperative imaging studies will be obtained to ensure proper placement of the microspheres and assess any complications. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled at 3, 6, and 12 months for clinical and radiographic assessment. [/DESIGN] I think this is a well-designed study that follows a standard and systematic approach to treat patients with acute vertebral fractures using porous titanium microspheres. The inclusion and exclusion criteria ensure that the study population is homogenous and avoids potential confounding factors. The study protocol outlines a clear and precise surgical technique and includes postoperative management and follow-up to assess the long-term outcomes of the treatment."

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing intervention on attitudes, beliefs, and self\u2010esteem in people with eating disorders. Methods: This study was a two\u2010group pre\u2010test and post\u2010test experimental design. The sample of this study included 30 patients with eating disorder. It was collected in stages 1 and 2 under the supervision of the researcher and in stages 3 and 4 by a trained therapist. After training both counselor groups and patients at home, the control group received routine care, but the intervention group was counseled using motivational interviewing for 4 sessions. Then, two weeks after counseling, the counselor and participants were evaluated. SPSS 22 was used to analyze and code the data, and the statistical population was compared using the t\u2010test. Results: The intervention group reported a significant difference in attitudes, beliefs, and the quality of life and self\u2010esteem before and after the intervention compared to the control group (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Motivational interviewing was an effective method in helping patients with eating disorders overcome negative attitudes and beliefs about themselves and their disease.",

The study will be conducted at approximately 20 hospital sites in the United States and Europe. Eligible patients must have been newly diagnosed, untreated aggressive large B cell lymphoma of the following histologic subtypes: T cell/Histocytic, T Cell Rich, Double HIT and NK cell lymphomas. Previous studies have shown that the B cell component of these aggressive lymphomas represents approximately half of the tumor. The BGB-A317 and ACT-301 components of this combination will target T cells and CD19+ B cells; thus, this combination targeted treatment is expected to impact two cells of the tumor (T+B+). In addition, the B cell component of this combination targeted treatment is expected to impact a previously untreated B cell component and may be expected to impact the efficacy of the treatment; this will be the key hypothesis of this study. The objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BGB-A317 and ACT-301 when used in combination to treat B cell lymphomas in this patient population.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Phase 1 Study Of BGB-A317 Combined With ACT-301 In Patients With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDiffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Biological: BGB-A317\n* Biological: ACT-301\n* Drug: Rituximab\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================",

Methods:\nForty\u2010one Egyptian patients presenting with GAE were included in the current study. All patients were treated with 30 mg/day of acitretin over 2 months. At the end of 2 months, the erythema and acneiform rash and total score were evaluated monthly by 2 blinded dermatologists. Results:\nThe total median baseline score was 5 (IQR: 3\u20106) and decreased to 2.5 (IQR: 1\u20104) after 2 months of treatment (p=0.002). At the end of the second month, 16 patients (38.8%) showed a complete response and 18 (43.8%) showed a partial response, while 7 patients (17.4%) had no response or deterioration. Conclusion:\n----------------\u2010\nThis study demonstrates the effectiveness of acitretin in reducing acneiform rash in non\u2010acne\u2010specific GAE. A larger, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, and comparative trial are warranted to support our preliminary findings.\n\nThe use of oral retinoids in guttate erythematosus (GAE) has been traditionally reported in the literature. Retinoids are known to exhibit anti\u2010inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which are similar to those of topical corticosteroids. As such, they play a role in the treatment of various inflammatory and dermatological conditions. As corticosteroids are usually the first\u2010line treatment for GAE, the efficacy of retinoids has not been adequately compared to those of corticosteroids.\nAcneform rash that resembles the picture of acne vulgaris is frequently reported in GAE patients. Acneform rash is most commonly located on the upper extremities, neck"

            "The first exclusion criterion: participants who are unable to maintain a static leg position for the duration of the scan. This criterion is crucial for the successful execution of PET/CT perfusion perfusion imaging. Do you have any thoughts on this criterion? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study has developed a perfusion software method based on PET/CT perfusion perfusion images of the skeletal muscles. This study is to evaluate the new perfusion software method in comparison to an existing software method based on venous sampling. This study will enroll a total of 25 patients with a suspected local malignant tumor. Patients with PET/CT positive findings in the abdomen, chest, or pelvis will be evaluated. The skeletal muscles of all the patients will be imaged using PET/CT perfusion perfusion images. The perfusion perfusion signals will be obtained using both software methods and then compared visually by a specialized radiologist.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPET is a functional image method that quantitatively evaluates abnormalities in organs by tracing metabolic changes in tissues based on the principle of positron emission, and CT performs cross-sectional imaging using radiation. When used together, the PET/CT integrated system is called PET/CT perfusion perfusion. The study method is based on PET/CT perfusion perfusion. It scans the abdomen, chest, and pelvis. The scan can be considered for the following patients. Abnormalities in 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT perfusion imaging are often considered indications of local malignant tumors, but abnormal signals may also be found in benign lesions such as inflammatory tissue. If the location, extent, and shape of the lesion are unclear, additional investigations such as biopsies are required. In addition, if there is more than one lesion, it is difficult to determine which lesion is responsible for the abnormality by PET/CT perfusion imaging. This study is a prospective study of 25 adult male or female patients at SNUBH Hospital who were suspected or diagnosed with a local malignant tumor based on 18F- FDG PET/CT perfusion",
            "Absolutely. Excluding participants on special diets or medications will help us better assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. Participants should not have undergone any recent cosmetic procedures, such as liposuction or cellulite injections, within the last six months. What's your opinion on this criterion? \n\nStudy type\n=================\nObservational\n\nStudy design\n=================\nCross-sectional study\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\n1.

            "That's correct. By excluding participants with malignancies, we can ensure a safe and effective trial. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. Participants who have received any non-invasive cellulite treatment within 6 months prior to the study should be excluded. What do you think about this criterion? \n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe primary goals of this study are: To document the reduction of cellulite on buttocks, hips and thighs using ultrasound imagery, a standard technique that is validated for assessing the amount of cellulite, and to assess participants' comfort while wearing the apparel. To examine participants' perception of their perceived cellulite status over the course of the 30 day use of the Cell-u-Light Apparel by using the Cellulite Appearance Questionnaire survey. There are also two secondary goals: 1. To assess for any changes in other areas of skin such as facial, breast, and abdominal skin. 2. To assess participants' perception of their perceived lymph and/or fluid state over the course of the 30 day use of the Apparel by using the Modified Lymphedema Questionnaire-20 survey.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Pilot Test/Prior to Market Feasibility Study Evaluating the Feasibility, Acceptability, and Early Signs of Efficacy of an Anti-Cellulite Lymphatic-Mimic Apparel\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCellulite\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Cell-u-Light compression pants\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Participant is age 18 and over. Participant has an average BMI between 25-35 kg/m^2 . Participant has grade 2 cellulite on both buttocks as assessed by ultrasound imagery. Participant has a minimal average of 3 cellulite dimples at the same location on the buttocks/hips/thighs which is considered the minimum level in our assessment system for inclusion in the study. No other medical condition or history known to confound the results of this study such as: - Diab",
            "Great. Excluding participants with any active medical conditions will help ensure the validity of the trial results. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion. Participants should not be pregnant, as pregnancy and breastfeeding could interfere with the study results and pose a risk to participants and their fetuses. What are your thoughts on this criterion? \n\n\nStudy\n=================\n\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Design:: Epidemiology Study\nPhase:: Not applicable\nIntervention Model:: Sequential Assignment\nBlinding:: Double blinded subjects\nBlinding Description:: For the randomization, a random number list is generated using a computer program and a statistician who is not otherwise involved in the study implements the randomization procedure.

This number is used to determine which group they are part of (experimental or control) based on the random number list. Participants and investigators are not aware of the group assignment.\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: Medical Device\nIntervention Description:: Group 1: Use of the Cell-U-Light Apparel. The protocol consists of 2 wearings of the apparel per week for a period of 8 weeks. Each wear lasts for 6 hours per day and involves daily usage of the device according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nGroup 2: Use of a placebo product, consisting of a similar garment without any active components (such as LED lighting).

            "You're completely right. By excluding participants on special diets for weight loss or other health issues, we can isolate the effects of the compression pants on cellulite appearance. Incorporating the exception of stable diets, such as the gluten-free diet for coeliac, ensures that the intervention's effectiveness is not confounded by pre-existing dietary restrictions. Now, let's move on to the fifth exclusion criterion. Participants with any condition affecting the lymphatic system that causes fluid to build up in the arms or legs should be excluded. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "You're absolutely right. By excluding participants with a history of DVT, we can minimize potential risks or complications associated with compression therapy.\n\n*DVT refers to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a deep vein, typically in the leg. It can be a serious condition that requires medical attention.\n\n*Compression therapy involving the use of compression garments can provide graduated pressure to assist venous return and improve circulation. However, it is important to ensure that participants who have had a history of DVT are not at an increased risk of developing further complications if they engage in compression therapy.\n\nIt is recommended that healthcare providers evaluate each participant's individual medical history and ensure that compression therapy is safe for them.\n\n\nHere are some additional points to consider in relation to the exclusion criterion for participants with a history of DVT:\n\n1) Potential risks associated with compression therapy: Compression therapy can potentially increase venous pressure and blood flow in the deep veins, which could increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other complications for participants with a pre-existing condition like DVT.\n2) Medical evaluation: Participants with a history of DVT should undergo a thorough medical evaluation before enrolling in a study that involves compression therapy. This evaluation should include a review of the participant's medical history, a physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing to assess the risk of developing further complications.\n3) Follow-up and monitoring: Participants with a history of DVT should be monitored closely for any signs or symptoms of possible complications during the intervention period, including inflammation, pain, or swelling in the legs. If any concerns arise, prompt medical attention should be sought.\n\n*DVT stands for Deep Vein Thrombosis, which refers to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a deep vein, typically in the leg. It can be a serious condition that requires medical attention and can lead to complications like pulmonary embolism (PE) if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.\n\nIntroduction\n-----------------\nThis is a pilot study to ascertain the feasibility of recruiting a study group of patients suffering with cellulite and to identify any contraindications to the use of compression garment and UHF-EMF technology in",
            "You're absolutely right. Excluding participants with abnormal leg swelling will help ensure that the intervention is accurately evaluated. Now, let's assess if there are any other inclusion or exclusion criteria that you think are necessary for this trial.",
            "Exactly. By excluding participants who have had abdominal or leg operations within 1 year, we can reduce the risk of confounding factors and potential complications related to the intervention. Now, let's move on to the eighth and final exclusion criterion. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant or attempting to become pregnant should be excluded. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "That's correct. By excluding participants who are not mobile, we can select participants who can actively engage in the study and provide reliable data.

Patients and Methods: This retrospective study compared 83 patients who underwent hemilaryngectomy from January 2009 to September 2020 with 67 patients who underwent total laryngectomy from January 2011 to September 2020 at a tertiary referral center in Tokyo. The primary endpoint was 5\u2010year overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were 5\u2010year disease\u2010specific survival (DSS), 5\u2010year failure\u2010free survival (FFS), and 5\u2010year progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Kaplan\u2010Meier method was used to compare the OS, DSS, FFS, and PFS rates. Cox\u2010proportional hazards regression analysis was employed to assess the effects of surgery type, treatment regimen, and other clinicopathological factors on OS. Statistical significance was established at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The 5\u2010year OS, DSS, FFS, and PFS rates did not significantly differ between hemilaryngectomy and total laryngectomy. The risk of distant metastasis in the total laryngectomy group was higher than in the hemilaryngectomy group (P = 0.034). The overall proportion of patients who developed complications after surgery did not significantly differ between the two groups (P = 0.553). Distant metastasis was the primary factor influencing OS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hemilaryngectomy and total laryngectomy have comparable oncologic outcomes, but total laryngectomy tends to increase the risk of distant metast",

In order to develop a comprehensive list of recommended competencies for neuro\u2010oncology, the Joint Section on Neuro\u2010Oncology of the American Association of Neurosurgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons conducted a survey of fellowship\u2010training program directors to identify competencies important in the field of neuro\u2010oncology. The purpose of this study was to review this survey and report on the most commonly reported, important competencies required for competent neuro\u2010oncology fellowship training.METHODS: Two e\u2010mail surveys were sent to all neuro\u2010oncology fellowship program directors. The first survey contained open\u2010ended questions asking about competencies (knowledge, skill, and attitude) that are important to the practice of neuro\u2010oncology. The survey also asked about specific areas of neuro\u2010oncology in which competency may be lacking among trainees. The second survey followed and listed the responses from the first survey. The survey listed and ranked the listed competencies. Survey participants were asked to choose the 5 competencies they deemed most important and to also evaluate their fellowship program's overall preparation in the respective area.RESULTS: Nineteen surveys (100%) were completed by neuro\u2010oncology fellowship program directors (11 from academic centers and 8 from private practices). A number of critical competencies were cited on both surveys, including radiation oncology (academic 90.9%, private 100%), medical oncology (academic 81.8%, private 62.5%), neurosurgery (academic 81.8%, private 62.5%), stereotactic radiosurgery (academic and private 76.9%), and surgical oncology (academic 76.9%, private 62.5%). Radiation oncology received the highest rankings (academic 52.6%, private 87.5%). Few areas had low ratings: clinical trials",

The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life (QoL), body function, and symptoms in breast cancer patients and to evaluate the association between PORT and QoL after CT. Methods: A total of 172 patients were divided into 2 groups: CT \u2010 RT group (n = 79), and CT + RT group (n = 93). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. Psychometric instruments were used to evaluate QoL (EORTC QLQ\u2010C30 global health status and functional scales) and symptoms (FACT\u2010B). The correlation between the change in the QLQ\u2010C30 total score and the sum of FACT\u2010B symptom scores (TOTS) for the different domains was analyzed to identify domains more severely affected by treatment. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In our sample, we identified a statistically significant negative correlation between breast cancer\u2010related QoL (global health status and functional scales) and the severity of the symptoms of breast cancer\u2010related symptoms. Analyzing the results from the CT + RT group, the QLQ\u2010C30 total score and TOTS decreased from baseline to 6 months in all of the domains. The baseline CT + RT group exhibited a clinically significant improvement in the quality of life and body functions. The FACT\u2010B symptoms decreased in most domains, with some improvement observed in physical well\u2010being and emotional well\u2010being. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study revealed that patients who underwent CT + RT experienced a decline in QoL and body functions and showed symptoms related to cancer and treatment. It is recommended to identify symptoms and provide appropriate interventions to maintain quality of life in breast cancer patients.\n\n\nBreast cancer\u00a0is one of the most common diseases and the most common malignancy in women worldwide,",

While the number of people living with HIV worldwide has decreased, many people still lack access to HIV testing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Community-based testing, which can be provided by non-clinical community members, has shown great potential in increasing the coverage of HIV testing in resource-limited settings. The effectiveness of community-based testing in Kazakhstan needs further research. This study aims to explore the perspectives of individuals who received a community-based HIV testing service (CBHTS) in Mangystau region of Kazakhstan.\u00a0\n\nA community-based testing service (CBHTS) was implemented in five of its districts, namely Kyzylorda, Shieli, Aktau, Mangystau, and Beyneu. Kazakhstan has a predominantly Muslim population, and a high rate of alcohol and drug use among the population. Alcohol use is considered a high-risk behavior for HIV infection in the country. \u00a0Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with risky sexual behavior and increased HIV transmission.\n\nKazakhstan\u00a0has a population of 18.7 million people, with over 50% living in rural areas. The Mangystau region\u00a0is considered\u00a0one of the most vulnerable regions in Kazakhstan due to the prevalence of HIV, AIDS, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\u00a0The prevalence of HIV in the Mangystau region is 0.59% and the prevalence of HIV in the sex worker population is 1.86%.\u00a0\n\nHIV rates reported by the UN in 2020 show that the overall prevalence of HIV in the Mangystau region is higher than in the rest of Kazakhstan, but AIDS prevalence has remained constant in the region since 2010. Furthermore, the HIV inc"

Patients and Methods: This study included 30 healthy postmenopausal women having a hysteroscopy for IUA removal. The expression patterns and intensity of ERs and ARs were observed in the endometrium, myometrium and vaginal walls using the immunohistochemical staining method and evaluated. Results: The mean age of patients was 52.5 \u00b1 5.7 years. The positive rate of ARs in the cervical mucosa, endometrium and myometrium was 80%, 0.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The expressions of ARs in the endometrium and myometrium were statistically less than those in the cervical mucosa (P=0.012, P=0.031). The positive rate of ERs in the cervical mucosa, endometrium and myometrium was 93.3%, 86.7% and 60%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the expression of ERs between the cervical and endometrial tissues (P=0.380), and there was a statistical difference between the endometrium and myometrium (P=0.012).

This study investigated the frequency and potential mechanism of atelectasis. Patients and methods: Seventy\u2010five patients were recruited during general anesthesia cardiac surgery with bronchial asthma, and 100 matched patients with general anesthesia cardiac surgery without bronchial asthma were selected as the control group. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, group A and B. The preoperative spirometry and pulmonary function were measured in all patients. At the end of the operation, arterial blood gas, lung ultrasound and chest radiography were observed and recorded. Results: There were no significant differences in sex, BMI, age and pulmonary function between groups A and B. Anesthesia induction time, intubation time, operation time and operation time did not show a statistical difference. The number of patients with PO4 < 1.4 mmol/L after tracheal intubation and operation in the Atelectasis group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The number of patients with arterial PCO2 (pHPA) \u2264 35 mmHg in the atelectasis group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). An increase in PO4 and pHPA in the atelectasis group, which can effectively predict atelectasis, was also observed. Conclusion: Bronchial asthma is a risk factor for postoperative atelectasis, and a decrease in pHPA and an increase in pCO2 are risk factors for atelectasis. We hope that these results can provide a basis for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of atelectasis in bronchial asthma patients.",

Objectives: We aimed to clarify the effect of a nurse\u2010based telephone coaching on patients with COPD. Methods: The randomized, open\u2010labelled controlled trial was conducted at Kobe University Hospital from March 2013 to March 2015. Of participants with COPD, 47 were assigned to test and 53 to control group. The test group was given individualised telephone coaching, while the control group did not receive any phone calls. The mean of intervention duration was 4.9 months (range 1.0 month \u2010 12.5 months). Results: The total number of hospitalizations due to COPD and the average number of acute exacerbations per patient year were significantly reduced in the test group, however. The number of days missed from home was significantly reduced in the test group. On the contrary, there were no statistically significant differences in other outcomes. Conclusion: A nurse\u2010based telephone coaching may contribute to COPD management in the future.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCOPD is now estimated to be responsible for 3.23 million deaths per year. It is projected that COPD will become the third leading cause of death globally by 2030  and the fifth most burdensome illness by 2020.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends providing smoking cessation programs for patients with COPD, and improving the self-management of COPD with pharmacotherapy and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Patients with COPD also require careful clinical management to prevent COPD exacerbation (COPD-E). However, a study revealed that 24% of COPD patients did not visit doctors within 1 year of hospitalization. Furthermore, only one third of COPD patients in the United States received any form of non-smoking treatment, and only 50% of COPD victims received PR therapy following their discharge. The majority of patients with COPD are not able to attend a hospital for follow-up care due to",

It remains unclear whether fluoroscopic navigation catheters actually improve procedural outcomes, and many questions remain regarding their use. This study aimed to provide an overview of the evidence on the safety and efficacy of fluoroscopic navigation catheters during PCI. METHODS: Comprehensive systematic literature searches were performed on the efficacy of fluoroscopic navigation catheter\u2010assisted PCI compared with conventional PCI. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of fluoroscopic navigation catheters. The main outcome measures were procedural success, major complication rates, procedural duration, radiation dose and cardiac enzyme levels. Data were extracted from each article and outcomes were analyzed and tabulated. RESULTS: A total of six studies, including 646 (n=318; fluoroscopy group, n=328) patients, were included. Fluoroscopy\u2010guided PCI was associated with higher procedural success (six of six studies; relative risk [RR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.11\u20101.53, P=0.001) than conventional PCI. Major complication rates and radiation exposure between the two groups were similar. There were no significant differences in periprocedural myocardial infarction and mortality. CONCLUSION: The preliminary evidence shows improved procedural success when a fluoroscopic navigation catheter is used. Further research is needed to ascertain its impact on long\u2010term outcomes and to determine other clinical benefits of this technology.",

In patients with obesity, bariatric surgery may provide weight loss with beneficial metabolic effects. Bariatric surgery is usually preceded by a 6\u2010month preparation period of diet counseling and weight loss. Despite the efficacy of behavioral treatment options for obesity, most of these patients will need pharmacological intervention to achieve targeted weight loss targets. This multicenter, prospective, randomized, and non\u2010blinded pilot study wants to investigate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of orlistat during the preparation period in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods. 140 subjects were randomized to receive 120 mg orlistat thrice a day (OD) or placebo OD for 6 months prior to bariatric surgery. Exclusion criteria were: diabetes, hyperlipidemia, renal failure, liver failure, active gastrinoma, gastrointestinal conditions or drug taking that increases gastric acid secretion, pregnancy, lactation, chronic pancreatitis and uncontrolled seizure disorder. The primary outcome measures were weight loss, glycometabolic profile, blood pressure, liver function and adverse effects of orlistat. Results. 135 subjects completed the trial (76 subjects in the OD 120 mg group and 59 subjects in the OD placebo group). Baseline characteristics were not different between the groups. Subjects in both groups showed a significant reduction in weight (P < 0.0001, paired t tests). At 6 months, mean weight loss was 11.66 \u00b1 4.09 kilograms (Kg) for the OD orlistat group and 9.09 \u00b1 2.59 Kg for the OD placebo group (between\u2010group difference of 2.57 Kg; 95% CI: 0.82, 4.32; P",

The most common condition is ankylosing spondylitis, but there are several other conditions in the group.  It is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation and damage to the joints, spinal discs, ligaments, and tendons. It can cause pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is the subgroup of spondyloarthritis that predominantly affects the spine (especially the sacroiliac joints and the lower spine), causing stiffness and pain.

After obtaining written informed consent, all patients were submitted to coronary angiography. The study was approved by our local ethics committee and all patients had written informed consent prior to any procedure. Patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), previous revascularization, diabetes or uncontrolled systemic arterial hypertension were excluded from the study. All patients were submitted to standard angiography followed by a final kissing balloon dilatation of the stenosis. The mean age was 53.74+12.18 years and 45.14+10.4years in the FDR and control group, respectively. Patients were randomized in 2 groups according to the use of the intracoronary nitrate (NTG) or not (C group). A comparison of the coronary flow reserve (CFR) in the C group showed that the FDR had significantly reduced CFR after nitrate administration with a mean value of 1.28 +0.44 vs 2.05+0.76 in controls (p<0.001). All controls presented mean CFRs greater than 2, whereas 10 of 13 FDR had values less than 2. No differences in the CAD lesion characteristics were found between control and FDR.

We performed a cross\u2010sectional study that comprised 100 adults with hypertension taking various antihypertensive medications. Methods: Patients were divided into a case group (oral administration of curcumin\u2010piperine for more than two months, n = 59) and a control group using the antihypertensive regimen without curcumin\u2010piperine (n = 41). Both groups were treated for six months, and the frequency of treatment was adjusted as necessary during the study period. The main outcome criteria were the prevalence of SAS in the two groups before and after treatment. Secondary outcome criteria included the changes in blood pressure and medication dosage before and after treatment. The SAS diagnostic criteria included (1) the number of times snoring occurred was >50/h and (2) the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) was > 5/h. A statistical analysis of the data was performed using the t\u2010test, chi\u2010square test, Mann\u2010Whitney U test, or Fisher's exact probability test as appropriate. Results: The prevalence of SAS before treatment in case and control groups was 23.7% and 36.6%, respectively, with no statistical difference. However, the prevalence of SAS after treatment was significantly lower in the case group than the control group (25.4% vs. 34.1%, p = 0.008). In addition, the number of snoring events in the case group was significantly reduced compared to the control group (30.0 \u00b1 25.2 vs. 42.2 \u00b1 21.4, p = 0.018).

The spinal pump used in this study employs a pneumatic pump to discharge pressurized air into the subarachnoid space via a lumbar subarachnoid catheter and is usually managed in the outpatient clinic. It is a minimally invasive intervention and is often used for patients with complex and refractory LBP that has not responded to other forms of therapy. Home use of a 3L hand-held spinal pump is a new approach that involves educating the patient and caregiver to safely operate the pump at home. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this approach. The study will also evaluate patient outcomes, including pain reduction, functional improvement, and quality of life improvement. This study will enroll 30 subjects into the 3L hand-held spinal pump group and 30 subjects into the standard care control group. The follow-up duration for each subject will be 24 weeks. The study will be conducted in a university medical center in Thailand.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEfficacy and Safety of the 3L Hand-held Spinal Pump for Management of Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nLow Back Pain\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Three-liter hand-held spinal pump\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients aged 18-65 years Clinical diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis or sciatic nerve pain Radiological evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis or sciatic nerve",

Are there any other ideas for exclusion criteria? \nIntroduction:\nMotor control is essential for human movement. One factor that affects the ability to move is the strength of muscle contractions. It has been shown that muscle strength is reduced during prolonged contraction, which is a concern for individuals who need to generate a large amount of force for extended periods to perform daily activities. Fatigue has been shown to have negative effects on performance, motivation, and cognitive function in young, healthy males. This is particularly important for athletes and individuals with neurological disorders who rely on muscle strength to perform specific tasks. Fatigue-related muscle weakness can result in injuries and reduced performance, which can lead to decreased quality of life and increased health care expenses. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of fatigue on isokinetic muscle strength and explosive strength in healthy young men. The study aims to assess the impact of fatigue on muscle strength and determine whether there is a correlation between muscle strength and performance after fatigue. This study will help us better understand the mechanisms underlying the decrease in muscle strength during fatigue and identify interventions to improve muscle strength and alleviate fatigue.\nObjective:\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of fatigue on isokinetic muscle strength and explosive strength in healthy young men.\nInclusion Criteria:\nThe study will enroll 20 healthy young men between the ages of 18 and 35. The candidates will be free from any musculoskeletal or neurological conditions that may affect muscle function. Additionally, the study candidates will be free from any medical history that may affect performance. Candidates will be asked to refrain from any strenuous physical activity for at least 48 hours before the testing session.\nExclusion Criteria:\nExclusion criteria are musculoskeletal or neurological conditions, medical history that may affect performance, and engaging in strenuous physical activity within 48 hours of the testing session.\nStudy Design:\nThe study will be a cross-sectional study design with a pre-post design. It means that we will collect data from the subjects before and after the experimental intervention.\nIntervention &amp; Comparator:",

Material and Methods: We conducted a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial in 90 patients to compare the efficacy of 20 mg of compounded papaverine, 10 mg of Caverject\u00ae and 0.5 mg of Regitine\u00ae injection, with placebo injection in ED patients, and to evaluate the safety of these treatments. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a satisfactory erection, defined as a score of 7 or better on the Erectile Function Domain scale (EF\u2010ED) score  of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Results: All participants received a total of four \u2010 injections during each of eight weeks of the double\u2010blind trial period. The incidence of treatment\u2010related serious adverse events was similar across the three treatment groups (pneumonia, 1 in the papaverine group; angina and myocardial infarction, 1 with Caverject and placebo). Significant differences were observed between the three treatment groups: papaverine and placebo injections were significantly more effective than Caverject\u00ae  injections. The results of the EF\u2010E score in the papaverine group did not differ significantly from the placebo group; whereas the results in the Regitine\u00ae group were significantly better than those of the placebo group. Conclusions: Intracavernosal injections of 20 mg of compounded papaverine combined with 0.5 mg of Regitine\u00ae improved erectile function significantly more than 10 mg of Caverject\u00ae without increasing the risk of serious adverse events.",

Now, how about the criterion for the absence or presence of dentures? \n\nAbstract:\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: This randomized clinical study compared a wedge implant with a conventional 2\u2010implant overdenture.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty\u2010eight edentulous patients were prospectively enrolled, and randomized into 2 groups who were followed for 24 months. The control group received 2 conventional 13\u2010mm diameter implants, and the study group received 1 wedge implant. The conventional 13\u2010mm diameter implants were inserted 10 mm apart, while the wedge implant was placed 2 mm closer to the midline. The primary outcome was the marginal bone level after 24 months. Secondary outcomes included implant stability indices, quality of life measurements, and clinical scores.RESULTS: After 24 months, no statistically significant differences in marginal bone loss (\u20100.09 + 0.17 mm and \u20100.09 + 0.21 mm; p = 0.99) and plaque index score (0.09 + 0.13 versus 0.09 + 0.17; p = 0.84) were observed between the 2 groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the implant stability indices or the Clinical Outcome Score.CONCLUSION: The wedge implant has shown promising results, comparable to a 2\u2010implant overdenture, and offers a potential alternative for edentulous patients. Our study was limited by its small sample size, which may have affected statistical significance. However, the wedge implant showed no difference in marginal bone level, plaque index, or Clinical Outcome Score compared to the conventional 2\u2010implant overdenture system..",

The study duration in the clinic will last 2-1/2 yrs. The duration of study participation is expected to be 4 years, but may be longer with the option of continuing if clinically indicated. Participants will be randomized into two groups, either a hydrogen peroxide 1% (HP\u00ae) study group or a placebo control group. HP\u00ae group: Participants in the HP\u00ae group will be instructed to use the HP\u00ae twice a day for 6 months during the initial 12 month study period (after which an individualized regimen will be determined after a clinical evaluation. Placebo control group: Participants in the placebo control group will be instructed to rinse with a similar tasting placebo daily for 6 months during the initial 12 month study period (following which HP\u00ae or placebo will be determined on a case- by-case basis for study retention ). A trained dental hygienist will measure gingival health at every participant's initial and final visit, 12 and 24 months later. Patients will be clinically assessed for attachment level and pocket probing depths at every visit and also receive an assessment of their medical history and dental records at baseline and follow-ups. Clinical data will be collected and recorded in a secure, HIPAA-compliant database. The primary endpoint of the study is to compare differences in gingival health between groups using PASI-C restoratively modified plaque index and gingival bleeding index (PASI-G) as measured by a Calibrated and certified Examiners at 12 and 24 months post-enrollment.",

The study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. \nMethods:\n48 patients(35 men, 13 women) with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction from August 2017 to August 2020 in Wonju Severance Christian Hospital were studied. All patients visited a medical center at least once a year for routine follow-up after initial diagnosis. Patients without hospital admission related to heart failure, who participated in cardiac rehabilitation on at least one occasion during a follow-up period due to heart failure related symptoms such as dyspnea or fatigue, were considered as the CR group(n=25, 52.0%), whereas those who failed to participate in any CR program (did not receive any rehabilitation exercise) (n=23, 48.0%) were considered as the non-CR group.\nThe primary outcome measurement was the changes in 6-minute walking distance(6MWD) between the baseline and the end of the study. The 6MWT assessed symptomatic differences from dyspnea and fatigue, an objective measurement of exercise capacity, and clinical prognostication in patients with heart failure. Demographic and clinical characteristics such as age, gender, medical history of diabetes mellitus(DM) and hypertension(HTN), NYHA functional class, LVEF, E/e' ratio, echocardiographic data, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), treatment modality, initial and final 6MWD were collected from medical records. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the independent impact of cardiac rehabilitation(CR) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Statistical significance was determined at a P-value of less than 0.05. The analysis was",

Now, what about the conditions you are studying in this trial? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to determine (i) the effect of the drug on the incidence of postoperative chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients after lung cancer screening (LC) and thoracotomy lung cancer surgery, (ii) the effect of the drug on plasma neuroklin levels before and after treatment with the drug and on plasma neuroklin levels and neuroklin/arginase ratio in the blood stream of patients with and without LC who have not received any treatment in the hospital. The investigators intend to perform two studies, one at the hospital as a pilot study and another after receiving approval from the hospital ethics committee. The investigators will recruit 40 patients in each of the four groups, including: 10 patients treated with LC screening and conventional treatment, 10 patients treated with LC screening, conventional treatment, and the drug in the study at a dose of 25 mg (LD50) in the blood stream, 10 patients treated with LC screening, conventional treatment, and the drug in the study at a dose of 50 mg (LD50) in the blood stream, and 10 patients to whom the drug will be administered in the study at a dose of 100 mg (LD50) in the blood stream, but who will not receive LC screening and thoracotomy. The LD50 is the drug concentration that kills 50% of patients in the mouse after 30 days. For 30 days after the completion of the study (30th day), the investigators will follow up with patients to determine the incidence of chronic PTSD in patients in each group.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAs the investigators know there is no specific treatment for PTSD in most situations. In the present study, the effect of drug therapy on the treatment and prevention of PTSD will be examined. According to the research model of the investigators that has been approved by the ethics committee, 40 patients will be randomly and equally assigned to each of the four groups, including: 10 patients treated with LC screening and conventional treatment, 10 patients treated with LC screening, conventional treatment",

            "Makes sense to me. Now, let's consider the second exclusion criterion: diabetes mellitus, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, neurological/psychiatric disease, hemoglobinopathy, and/or hepatitis. These conditions are often associated with complications during pregnancy and labor, and they may interact with the intervention under study.

Intracavernosal injection is the most effective therapy for ED and is widely prescribed in the Middle East, but the use of intracavernosal injections can be significantly reduced in patients with UI symptoms due to concerns about urinary leakage. Aim of the study The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of UI in our clinic and to assess the impact of intracavernosal injection on UI symptoms. Patients and methods This a randomized double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, multicenter trial was conducted in male patients with ED in the urology clinics of the faculty of medicine of the Palestinian Arab University. Between January 2015 and March 2016, 200 patients suffering from ED were included in the study. The patients were randomized equally into three groups: Group A received intracavernosal therapy for 6 consecutive weeks, Group B was given placebo, and no treatment was given to Group C. Patients were assessed at baseline, and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was the development of UI symptoms. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction, quality of life (QoL), and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire. Results There were no significant differences between the 3 groups in age, duration of ED, prior ED treatment, and baseline IIEF score. Overall, there was a statistically significant decrease in baseline IIEF scores after treatment. Only 33 patients developed urinary leakage while using the active therapy. Two patients (33.3%) in Group A developed UI symptoms, and one of the patients in Group A underwent urethroplasty. The mean UI symptom score was lower than baseline in the control and place",

Minimal invasive access techniques using a percutaneous approach may represent an attractive alternative to the open thigh technique. However, a number of issues remain to be addressed, including: 1/ the lack of long term data regarding the durability of this type of access technique 2/ in many cases a femoral artery anatomy unsuitable for such an approach still exists; 3/ the ability to use a femoral artery with anatomical features of less than 2mm (anatomy of the distal portion of the femoral artery) or 5mm (anatomy of the proximal portion of the femoral artery) 4/ difficult entry and progression of femoral endografts 5/ the use of a distal anastomosis in cases of severe tortuosity of the popliteal artery.

The study will be conducted in two phases.\nPhase 1: Prevention of Sternal Wound Infection\nThe primary objective of Phase 1 is to compare the rate of sternal wound infection between the PREVENA\u00ae group and the PICO\u00ae group. It is hypothesized that the PREVENA\u00ae dressing will reduce the rate of sternal wound infection compared to standard dressing (PICO\u00ae).\nStudy Design\nThis is a prospective, observational, descriptive, randomized study that will be conducted in two steps. The initial study phase will take approximately 6 months to collect data, after which a review of the data will be carried out. If a significant difference is found between the PREVENA\u2122 group and the PICO\u00ae group, the protocol will be amended to compare the rate of reoperation after sternal closure. The amended study design will continue until the end of the initial study (expected length 1 year).\nStudy Setting\nThe study will be conducted at the surgical department of the Razi Hospital in Tehran, Iran.

However, there is a paucity of data on noninvasive biomarkers for hepatotoxicity in this setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical utility of fibrotest\u00ae and hyaluronic acid levels (HA) as biomarkers for hepatotoxicity induced by OIMs in patients with IBD. Methods: This was a nationwide multicenter registry including 264 biological\u2010na\u00efve anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (antiTNF)\u2010treated adult patients scheduled for first\u2010line adalimumab or infliximab treatment without OIMs. Fibrotest results and HA levels were available for 221 patients. At 3 months, all patients were assessed for the occurrence of serious adverse events related to hepatotoxicity (SAEs). A total of 34 patients were excluded because of the lack of hepatotoxicity data. Results: A total of 263 patients with biomarkers data were included in this analysis, 69 of whom experienced hepatotoxicity. Patients who experienced hepatotoxicity had higher baseline fibrotest scores (10.2 +/\u2010 10.2 vs. 1.3 +/\u2010 1.6, p<0.001), higher baseline antiadalimumab levels (1858 +/\u2010 1138 ng/mL vs. 1224 +/\u2010 912 ng/mL, p=0.03), and higher baseline antiinfliximab levels (921 ng/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI), 800\u20131043 ng/m",

Patients will be instructed to complete a questionnaire assessing their HRQoL at eight time points, one every 30 days for 28 days, starting from the day of their first visit to the gynecology-oncology clinic. The questionnaire will assess various aspects of HRQoL, including physical, role, emotional, and social functioning, as well as fatigue, nausea, and pain. Additionally, baseline patient demographics and medical history will be collected, and changes in functional status will be recorded at the end of the study. We anticipate that the data collected from this study will help enhance our understanding of the impact of niraparib treatment and identify potential factors associated with changes in HRQoL.

The data collection will be carried out at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months, using self\u2010administered questionnaires for the collection of sociodemographic and clinical data, the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF\u201036), the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index, the Brief Pain Inventory, and the Impact of Deteriorating Health Status, among others.DISCUSSION: Low Back Pain is one of the most widespread musculoskeletal conditions worldwide, which results in high healthcare costs. There is no evidence about the effectiveness of educational programmes in improving patients' wellbeing and quality of life. These measures, combined with the functional status of LBP, will give us a more complete health profile and will allow us to compare their impact over time. If the results of this research are positive, an education programme could serve as a model and resource for primary care facilities, and it could be used to improve primary care management.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT04638634.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nTo this day, it has become evident that low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent condition that represents a public health issue worldwide",

However, the relationship between the quality of oral care and the oral health\u2010related quality of life (OHRQoL) of the elderly remains unclear. In this study, 3585 subjects from the Epidemiological Survey of Periodontal Diseases in Nara Prefecture, Japan were selected using the randomized method. OHRQoL was measured using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). Oral hygiene behavior was classified into \"good\" and \"inadequate\" when the score was \u226560 and <60, respectively, according to Japanese criteria. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the variables associated with the presence or absence of edentulism in addition to gender, age and the absence of dentures, among other confounding factors. Of the 3585 subjects, 2220 were \"good\" in oral hygiene. In the logistic regression model, a GOHAI score of \u226560 was associated with the absence of dentures, education level of \u2265junior high school, absence of hypertension and higher socioeconomic class. We concluded that an improved GOHAI score was associated with regular dental hygiene and the absence of dentures."

However, the optimum volume of the drug or sterile fluid is still unknown. Using the lateral patellofemoral (LF) compartment as the index of pressure, we sought out to determine, in subjects presenting for diagnostic knee arthroscopy, the effect of injecting variable volumes of bupivacaine or saline on intracompartmental pressure and the relationship of pressure to the volume injected. This prospective, randomized controlled trial included 36 volunteers aged 18\u201080 years old with oligo/symptomatic LF arthritis undergoing knee arthroscopy without portal placement or any other surgical intervention. The LF space was accessed with a spinal needle inserted under fluoroscopic guidance. Randomization of either 20 mL saline (group 1) or 20 mL bupivacaine (group 2) was carried out after baseline arthroscopy of the LF compartment. For this preliminary study, a larger volume (40 mL) was tested after arthroscopic debridement, but without subsequent portal placement or intraarticular injection. In group 1 subjects, arthroscopy of LF compartment was performed before injection of the solution and the average pressure of the LF space was recorded, with maximum pressure measurements of the lateral knee recorded before and after injection. After injection of 20 mL fluid, the arthroscopic joint space was re\u2010evaluated and intracameral LF pressures were recorded. This was also performed after injection of 40 mL fluid. At the conclusion of the case, an unblinded arthroscopist assessed the visual clarity of the lateral joint space. Mean intracameral pressure in the LF compartment (mm Hg) before the saline injection was similar to pre\u2010injection measurements (28.0% vs. 26.2%). After injection of 20 mL saline, the post\u2010injection pressure was similar to pre\u2010injection",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost\u2010effectiveness of an occupational health screening program for cocaine use compared to the current approach using standard urinalysis. METHODS: We conducted a decision\u2010analytic cost\u2010effectiveness model based on retrospectively collected employee drug\u2010testing data from December 2008 to September 2009 in a large Midwestern health system. Cases were randomly assigned to cohort C (n = 66) screened with standard urinalysis only and cohort OH (n = 44) screened with additional oral fluid cocaine testing for patients receiving standard urinalysis. Patients were excluded if they refused drug testing, were not working at that time, or were employed at another site not covered by the insurance. In the model, each cohort underwent testing every quarter (every 90 days), depending on job category. Modeling was conducted from a payer's perspective and was divided into 2 primary scenarios. In addition to annual medical expenses, potential productivity losses due to absenteeism and presenteeism were considered. RESULTS: Cocaine users with positive test results for urinalysis and oral fluid testing incurred similar annual medical costs in cohort OH compared to cohort C ($3,876.43 and $3,872.95, respectively). The incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to compare the cost of cocaine detection in cohorts C and OH. As compared to cohort C, the ICER for cohort OH was $101,070.05 per annual medical cost. The overall effectiveness of screening with oral fluid cocaine testing was a relative risk reduction of 63.6%, with an average of 1.91 fewer days missed from work by patients in cohort OH. CONCLUSION: Cocaine use poses a significant public health concern and presents challenges in the workplace. Oral fluid cocaine testing is a potential alternative to current standard of urine drug testing. Although the initial cost of adding",

What are your thoughts on the first primary outcome measure, which is serum Galectin-3 levels at baseline? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: We have an observational, cross\u2010sectional study investigating serum galectin\u20103 level as a possible prognostic marker for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Our hypothesis is that higher baseline serum galectin\u20103 levels are associated with shorter overall survival (OS), progression\u2010free survival (PFS), and time to treatment failure (TTF). We present a pilot study conducted at Aichi Cancer Institute to test this hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2019 and September 2020, 45 patients were enrolled. All patients had newly diagnosed advanced mRCC treated with first\u2010line TKIs. This study was not originally registered in a public trial registry; only registration is planned and underway. Baseline blood sampling was required before the start of treatment. Immunohistochemical staining for galectin\u20103 was performed using the tissue microarray of primary mRCC tissue. OS, PFS, TTF, and the time from TKI treatment for each patient were recorded. Associations between baseline serum galectin\u20103 level and clinical outcomes was assessed by Kaplan\u2010Meier and log\u2010rank tests. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were eligible for data analysis (34 men, median age 69 years; range, 42\u201085 years). All patients received sunitinib or pazopanib. In the first half of the series (n = 20) there were 7 deaths, 1 complete response, 7 progressive disease (PD), and 3 PR. In the second half of the series (n = 20) there were 8 deaths, 5 PD, and 5 PR. The mean galectin\u20103 level was 1.71 in the first half and 2.28 in the second half, p = 0.38. Baseline serum galectin\u20103 levels and clinical outcomes are presented in Table 1. Con"

What are your thoughts on excluding patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise testing? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nAlthough anecdotal, it has been previously observed that patients with a history of adverse reactions to previous exercise tests may experience severe adverse reactions to subsequent exercises. Therefore, patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise testing were classified in an Exclusion group. Among patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise tests, the study population will consist of patients who had previously undergone exercise testing using ECG, in addition to those who have not received previous exercise tests. As there is no previous work reporting the prognosis of patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise tests, these patients will be compared with patients who have not previously undergone exercise tests to confirm that they do not have a poor prognosis. Therefore, in the future, it will be possible to expand the indication for exercise testing to patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise tests.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nExercise stress test (SST) is a standard method for detecting ischemia by applying treadmill or bike exercise or coronary catheter injection exercise in addition to the imaging study. Therefore, in patients without an indication for coronary angiography, it is a relatively easy and safe study method to determine whether SST or coronary CT angiography is appropriate. In the case of patients without an indication for coronary angiography, if patients without heart disease have a positive test result during stress exercise (positive cardiac stress test), they are referred to a cardiologist, and if heart disease is determined, there is a high possibility of ischemia or acute heart failure leading to myocardial infarction or arrhythmia. If patients with a history of adverse reactions to SST wish to undergo SST, they may undergo SST using a catheter or coronary intravascular injection, but the test result is generally positive. Therefore, we assume a high risk of cardiac events in patients with a history of adverse reactions to exercise test.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nComparison of Mortality and Card",

Methods: The study population included patients with unresectable, local advanced, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that had previously been treated with a platinum\u2010based regimen. Patients received niraparib 300 mg daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment assessments took place as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria version (v) 1.1. Results: The primary end point was progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), safety, and response rates. Seventy\u2010five patients were enrolled and received a median of 14.5 cycles of niraparib therapy. Patients were heavily pretreated median number of 3 prior treatment lines 14.5 cycles of niraparib therapy). Overall, the median PFS was 3.6 months and median OS was 8.3 months. The 12\u2010month PFS and OS were 20.9% and 60.2%, respectively. Two\u2010year PFS and OS rates were also estimated as 9.3% and 43.3%, respectively. With a median follow\u2010up of 26.2 months, PFS was 5.5 months, and median OS was not reached at the time of analysis. Treatment was well tolerated with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2.

It can track the position of a balloon catheter in real\u2010time and provide real\u2010time feedback to the physician performing the procedure. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of CADSI\u2010guided coronary artery stent placement in comparison to standard of care techniques. Methods: Seventeen patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary interventions were randomized to receive either CADSI\u2010guided stent placement (n = 8) or conventional stent placement (n = 9). Primary endpoints were freedom from stent thrombosis at 30 days and angiographic success. Results: Mean age of the study patients was 62.4 \u00b1 5.2 years. Most were men (76.5%) with single\u2010vessel disease (52.9%). Both groups contained patients with a complex stenotic lesion (Bentall class C type 1: 5 with CADSI and 4 with standard of care). There were no significant differences between the two groups in demographic characteristics, lesion complexity or primary outcomes. All patients in both groups had successful stent placement and did not experience any major adverse events (MAEs) at 30 days. Overall, there was significantly higher angiographic success in the CADSI group compared to conventional stenting (93.8% vs 77.8%). Conclusions: CADSI\u2010guided stent placement is safe and effective in the setting of elective percutaneous coronary interventions. While larger randomized controlled trials are needed to determine efficacy and cost efficacy of this technique, CADSI\u2010guided stent placement appears to improve angiographic outcomes and should be considered as a promising alternative to conventional techniques.",

This unique stent is designed to release a drug at the site of the blockage to help promote healing and minimize the risk of further blockages. \n- In this study, the DES is a drug-eluting stent (DES). DESs are made of a thin wire mesh coated with a polymer that releases medications into the bloodstream. The medication in the polymer is released over time, helping the stent to maintain its position in the blood vessel and promoting healing after the procedure. \n- The stent will be implanted using a combination of two techniques, known as balloon angioplasty and stenting. \n- Balloon angioplasty is a procedure in which a small balloon is inflated inside the blocked artery, which helps to open the blocked blood vessel and improve blood flow to the heart. \n- The stent will be placed over the balloon and expanded, positioning it securely within the blocked artery to help prevent future blockages. \n- After the stent is in place, the balloon will be deflated and removed, leaving the stent in place. \n- For the first 12 hours after the procedure, the patient will be required to take the study drug (Ticagrelor) by mouth, without interruption, twice a day in addition to the prescribed medications. \n- After 1",

To date, no studies have explored the relationship between iron and fractures in elderly Chinese women.METHODS: This study aimed to prospectively investigate the link between serum ferritin and the risk of major fractures among elderly women in southern China. Participants in this prospective study were recruited from the Sun Yat\u2010sen University Cancer Center. Participants completed a questionnaire addressing sociodemographic characteristics and other lifestyle factors, and were followed up until December 4, 2019. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of fractures according to the serum ferritin.RESULTS: Of the 1027 women, 694 (67.6%) had a blood test, and 116 (16.1%) women developed at least one major fracture during the follow\u2010up. Of those with fractures, 79 (68.0%) had osteoporotic fractures, including 29 (25.0%) hip fractures and 7 (6.0%) non\u2010vertebral and vertebral fractures. The multivariate\u2010adjusted HR of major and any fracture was significantly increasing with the increase of serum ferritin (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.08, P\u2010trend = 0.003; HR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.04, P\u2010trend = 0.002, respectively).

Now, let's move on to the sixth inclusion criterion. \n\nAbstract:\nThere is a lack of reliable, valid measures that assess the physical pain, emotional pain, and functional impairment related to painful, nonspecific neck symptoms (PNSNS). This project, funded by the US Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, developed a measure of pain\u2010related outcomes in subjects with neck pain who do not have other neurological or musculoskeletal conditions. Two hundred and fifty\u2010nine subjects meeting the inclusion criteria completed this project. The resulting PNSNS Pain\u2010Related Functional Disability (PRFD) index includes 5 subscales (physical, emotional, cognitive, sleep, self\u2010rated health), each comprising 3\u20104 items. Each item is rated using a 6\u2010point scale indicating the degree of problem experienced over the past week (1 = not at all; 6 = very much). The overall PRFD score is derived by summing the subscale item scores (range 0\u201051). The measure has a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85). The measure also has good construct validity, showing significant correlations with other relevant measures of disability (e.g., Neck Disability Index; r = 0.82, P < 0.001) and measures of depression, pain intensity, and pain interference (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory\u2010II; r = 0.53, P < 0.001; visual analog scale; r = 0.57, P < 0.001, and Pain and Disability Scale; r = 0.57, P < 0.001). The PRFD score demonstrates an association with pain intensity and interference with ADL (beta = 0.57; P < 0.001 and beta = 0.56; P < 0.001, respectively) even after adjustment for potential confounding variables (e.g., age, education, and depression).

Now, let's move on to the seventh inclusion criterion. \n\nAbstract:\nThe antifolate drug trimethoprim\u2010sulfamethoxazole (TMP\u2010SMX), which is widely used in the treatment of severe malaria, has recently been shown to have antiviral activity against HIV\u20101 and may prevent mucosal transmission of HIV. We evaluated the effect of TMP\u2010SMX on mucosal transmission of HIV in a nonrandomized, open\u2010label, placebo\u2010controlled double\u2010blind HIV\u2010risk reduction study conducted in serodiscordant mixed sexual partnerships. Seventy\u2010five sexually active, HIV\u2010infected males were randomly assigned to either a placebo or TMP\u2010SMX group; all had a matched seronegative partner. In the double\u2010blind step, participants were followed for 12 months at 3\u2010monthly intervals when they received either TMP\u2010SMX or placebo without partner notification. In the open\u2010label step, sexually active participants received long\u2010term TMP\u2010SMX prophylaxis for the next 18 months, while participants with unidentified partners were referred for partner notification. Seronegative female partners were followed at 1\u2010monthly intervals to document HIV transmission. Eight cases of HIV transmission were observed (7/20 (35%) in the placebo arm versus 1/15 (6.7%) in the TMP\u2010SMX arm), translating to an estimated protection rate of 80.7% (95% CI, \u201022% to 95%). We estimate that this corresponded to an impact on risk of HIV transmission of 23.7% (95% CI, \u201053.9% to 56.7%), although wider confidence intervals are likely given that the primary analysis was not a randomized comparison. TMP\u2010SMX\u2010based HIV interventions for male discordant couples could be a valuable tool in the prevention of HIV transmission and disease in communities where antiretroviral therapy is not widely available. We believe that large trials, including studies of nonmale\u2010male couple relationships, are justified and could have a major impact on the HIV/AIDS",

Now, let's proceed to the second exclusion criterion. \n\nAbstract:\n1. Background: Cases of gastro esophageal reflux (GERD) due to eosinophil esophagitis (EoE) are not uncommon and the condition is difficult to diagnose, as standard laboratory and diagnostic approaches may not be sufficient, particularly in cases of mild disease or those with atypical symptoms. Endoscopic evaluation has a moderate yield. In cases without endoscopic or histologic features of EoE, patients with unexplained GERD symptoms or atypical symptoms should be considered for high\u2010resolution esophageal manometry (HREM). 2. Objectives: To demonstrate the usefulness of HREM in identifying cases of subclinical EoE in patients that otherwise appear to have a diagnosis of GERD, either based on symptom or endoscopic appearance alone. 3. Methods: A retrospective chart review at a tertiary care medical center between April 2012 and June 2015 was performed for patients that had undergone HREM, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and biopsy for dyspeptic symptoms for which they were otherwise felt to have reflux disease. EoE was diagnosed and classified based on criteria set by the 2011 clinical guideline established by the Physician\u2010Based Association of Gastroesophageal Diseases (PAGI). The diagnosis of esophageal eosinophilia associated with reflux (EER) was made if the esophageal mucosa demonstrated >70 eosinophils/500 power field, but less than 15 eosinophils/500 power field, based on the modified Cincinnati consensus on EoE. The diagnosis of non\u2010eosinophilic EER (NEEER) was made if 0 to 65 eosinophils were found in the epithelium and histologic features of GERD were found, such as reflux esophagitis, gastric fund",

This study is aimed at showing improvement in symptoms that cause distress to the end of life patient who receives sedatives. We carried out a qualitative study with a descriptive\u2010analytical approach and in grounded theory using 30 patients with advanced chronic disease, with a diagnosis of end stage disease and on hospice care. We recorded 2 to 4 hours of audio and conducted individual interviews with patients on care and the characteristics of their diseases. The data were interpreted through constant comparative analysis. We identified 5 main categories: 1) information about a better death; 2) anxiety about the time of death; 3) the need for comfort during death; 4) the importance of the communication between the patient and the team; and 5) the need for autonomy and the ability to choose for the end stage. There is a positive relationship between the death trajectory and the need to communicate with the team. The information about a better death occurs to improve the quality of death during sedation and analgesia on hospice care. The information was mostly provided by the patients themselves.",

Twenty\u2010six patients were allocated to receive treatment with either sodium fluoride slurry or an artificial sodium fluoride foam in the clinical study. This was a multicentre clinical trial that followed up with the patients for 15 months after therapy began. The debit of 10% sodium fluoride was started immediately in the treatment side at the baseline. After drying the surface, the 10% foam was applied to the treatment side and held in place for 90 s for 6 days a week for three months. The 31 patients (Group I) had an initial 50% sodium fluoride slurry rinse for 30 s and then used the rinse for 4 weeks. After drying the surface, the 10% foam application was then applied for 90 s for 6 days a week for three additional months (Group II). After three months, the percentage of root surface loss was lower for the 50% slurry compared to the 10% foam (p = 0.308). At the end of the study, a reduction of approximately 20% was found in the root coverage at sites between 1.5 and 5.0 mm. A tendency to relapse (10 mm) was found during the third month of follow\u2010up in the 10% foam group when the mean scores of the two sub\u2010groups were compared. However, no difference in relapse rate was observed between the 50% slurry and the 10% foam groups.",

The primary outcome measure was complete resolution of symptoms and signs of blepharoconjunctivitis within 48 hours. Additional endpoints included timepoint of complete resolution and resolution of predefined symptoms, signs, and associated findings.RESULTS: Sequential 2\u2010day treatment resulted in high efficacy (97.2%) in treating adult subjects with signs and symptoms of staphylococcul blepharoconjunctivitis and, for pediatric patients, was nearly identical to that achieved with 4\u2010day therapy (98.5%). Among eyes meeting all primary criteria for the diagnosis of staphylococcal blepharoconjunctivitis, efficacy was again similar (97.0% and 97.2%, respectively). Timepoints of resolution of signs and symptoms were similar in both groups: 10 hours and day 2, respectively, with all resolutions being by day 14 (87.9% to 98.4%). For the prespecified subgroup with presepsis, sequential 2\u2010day therapy was associated with significantly more rapid resolution of swollen preauricular lymph nodes in adult (P < .015) and pediatric (P = .023) subjects.CONCLUSION: A sequential 2\u2010day course of mupirocin ophthalmic solution was equally",

Furthermore, increasing concentrations of cTnI are associated with a higher number of myocardial ischemic events. However, it is unclear whether cTnI predicts major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) irrespective of known CAD. Aims: To evaluate whether cTnI predicts 6\u2010month MACE independent of CAD in stable patients referred to nuclear pharmacological stress test. Methods: Patients were referred to adenosine stress echocardiography. All patients had a normal or aborted exercise electrocardiogram on a maximal tolerance test and with no clinical evidence of acute coronary syndrome. Adenosine stress echocardiography and pharmacological blood sample were obtained within 30 minutes after stopping adenosine infusion. Patients with known CAD were excluded. MACE included death, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure or unstable angina within approximately 6 months of the study. Results: A total of 244 patients were included for analysis. Of these, 81 patients developed MACE during the 6\u2010month follow\u2010up period. Patients with increased cTnI (>0.03 ng/mL) had a significantly higher odds of experiencing MACE compared to patients with normal cTnI (0.03\u20100.14 ng/mL: adjusted OR 2,11; 95%CI 1.13\u20103.93). A cTnI cut\u2010off value >0.04 ng/mL had the highest sensitivity (0.66) and specificity (0.79) to predict MACE. However, there were no differences between the 3 groups in the rate of hospitalization for chest pain (0.03\u20100.04 ng/mL vs 0.04\u20100.14 ng/mL vs >0.14 ng/mL: adjusted OR 0.7",

However, adherence to recommended activities is challenging, and knee pain and fatigue may impede participation. This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a goal\u2010paced activity program improved adherence to a home\u2010based exercise program for OA of the hip/knee. A post hoc secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial was performed in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group (combination of behavioral goal setting and tailored feedback and home\u2010based exercise) or a control group (home\u2010based exercise only). Participants were assessed at baseline, after 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The study's primary goal was to determine the extent to which an intervention focused on goal\u2010paced activities (GPA) affected adherence to a 4\u2010week home\u2010based exercise intervention. Three hundred and twenty patients were included for the primary analysis. The primary outcome was adherence (number of completed sessions) after 4 week, measured by GPA. Adherence to GPA was compared before and after the intervention, and between the intervention and control groups using t\u2010tests for paired samples. Thirty\u2010four (34) participants dropped out during the study.

In addition to the growing demand for clinical services, there are more difficulties in managing the elderly, such as the occurrence of delirium. There is a need to establish a new geriatric emergency management system. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of geriatric triage in emergency departments among different age groups with different types of care in elderly patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was designed to enroll participants from March 2017 to February 2019 using a random number generator. An electronic emergency triage system based on the emergency severity index was developed. The emergency severity index points of age\u2010stratified patients and scores, vital signs, and laboratory examinations were obtained. We assessed the age and gender distributions of patients. We also explored the correlations of age and gender with emergency severity index points, vital signs, and laboratory examinations in order to evaluate the differences in the types of care needed among age groups. Results: The results of the study included 47,050 patients divided by the emergency severity index into the following age groups: 5\u201059 years (Group 1; n=17,817 patients), 60\u201069 years (Group 2; n=13,866 patients), 70\u201079 years (Group 3; n=8715 patients), and 80 years and older (Group 4; n=6752 patients). Conclusion: Older age was linked with an increase in emergency severity index scores, vital signs, and laboratory examinations. Furthermore, there were substantial distinctions in the type of care needed in each age group. These findings have important implications for emergency care for elderly patients.",

What do you think about this criterion? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nNSAIDs for OSTEOARTRITIS OF THE KNEE: The goal of this study is to determine if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are as safe as the current, usual non-NSAID therapies for osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nOsteoarthritis of the knee (OAK) is the most common reason why individuals older than 65 year go to see their family doctors or orthopedists for pain in the knee. It can be a painful and disabling condition and is treated quite successfully in most cases by one or more of four treatments: exercise, acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol), topical oral medications, or NSAIDs (e.g. Ibuprofen, Naproxen, etc). Exercise therapy has been demonstrated to be as effective as other therapies but most patients are not willing to engage in a dedicated exercise program. Acetaminophen is less effective than NSAIDs and has been shown to be no more effective than a placebo. Topical oral medications are somewhat less effective than NSAIDs given orally but still more effective than placebo and do not have the side effects that NSAIDs may cause. However, the vast majority of physicians in North America, Australia, and Europe prescribe NSAIDs for patients with OAK. It is not clear if NSAIDs are more efficacious than topical oral medications and/or acetaminophen so this study aims to answer that question. Patients with moderate to severe OAK will be randomized (like flipping a coin) 1:1 ratio to topical oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or placebo. Patients will have an injection into the back of their knee to cause inflammation and to see if NSAIDs or the placebo have an effect on inflammation (with MRI scans) to determine which is better. Patients will also complete questionnaires",

With the correct methodology and follow-up, patients recover quickly and can return to their usual activities.

Nevertheless, this injury is not exclusive to external trauma and causes of mOAT that are linked to overuse may be due to previous injuries in the ankle joint, inadequate posture and excessive loading, especially in sport such as gymnastics, basketball, or dance.3 In order to assess the effectiveness of treatment in patients with mOAT, a review of the literature was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Pubmed, and The Cochrane Library. The search was conducted between January 2017 and December 2021, including only papers in medical English. The key words used were osteochondral, mOAT, and lateral ankle sprain. A total of 347 papers were found, of which nine were studies with patients under 35 years of age with a mOAT diagnosis. A recent Cochrane Review on the management of ankle joint trauma highlighted the effectiveness of physiotherapy programs and highlighted the importance of strengthening the lower limb during the rehabilitation process.4 The authors of this review found 22 randomized controlled trials and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of different physiotherapy techniques due to the heterogeneity of the interventions that were evaluated as well as their limited",

Therefore, the match prediction is 0, indicating that the criteria from the model output are not included in the groundtruth criteria list.",
            "Match prediction: 0\n\nExplanation:\nThe model output mentions \"excluding patients with a history of severe neutropenia\" as a criterion, but this criterion is not present in the provided groundtruth criteria list. The groundtruth criteria list includes only two exclusion criteria: \"Patients who refuse to sign the consent form\" and \"Patients who have previously experienced severe neutropenia during chemotherapy\". The model output's criterion of \"excluding patients with a history of severe neutropenia\" is not fully included in the groundtruth criteria list, so the match prediction is 0."
