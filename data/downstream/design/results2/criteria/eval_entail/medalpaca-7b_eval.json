Receiving definitive treatment with either radical surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy + adjuvant chemotherapy, or definitive chemo-radiotherapy (CRT)\n3.

            "Excellent! Let's proceed to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is \"Patients in the NICU/PICU or in a similar ICU unit where the administration of stress balls is not permitted\".

This criterion is to include patients who require a subcutaneous injection for vaccination or inoculation as part of their treatment.

With those additions, I think we have good criteria for inclusion and exclusion. \nWhat About Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for the Control Group?\nAfter brainstorming with the rest of the research team, we decided to include a control group in our clinical trial as well to more accurately compare the outcomes of the intervention group to a group of participants who did not receive the intervention. We will include all participants with the same eligibility criteria as the intervention group but without the sildenafil citrate. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the control group will be similar to those for the intervention group, with a few exceptions. \nLet's take a look at the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the control group: \n[instead of: Participants with a singleton pregnancy at less than 37 weeks gestation, with at least one fetal heart rate (FHR) between 110-160 beats per minute in the upper two-thirds of the range as judged by a two-electrode, umbilical artery Doppler.]\n[instead of : Participants with multiple pregnancies, a singleton pregnancy at less than 37 weeks gestation, with at least one FHR between 110 to 160 beats per minute in the upper two-thirds of the range as judged by a two-electrode, umbilical artery Doppler, and a history of prior vaginal/C-section delivery or other uterine surgery]\nThis change in the inclusion criteria for the control group reflects our decision to exclude participants with a history of prior uterine surgery, which may alter the cervix and vaginal canal and potentially impact outcomes of the intervention. \nWe also decided not to include women with any history of preterm birth, as we are specifically interested in outcomes of using sildenafil citrate for accelerating labor in women with long latent phase labors.

[/USER_4] No, we shouldn't include a criteria for HbA1c levels. HbA1c is a measure of average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months, but it's not a good indicator of blood glucose control on a daily or weekly basis. Additionally, having an HbA1c target may exclude individuals who are not able to maintain a specific blood glucose level due to various reasons such as lifestyle patterns or genetic factors.

            "Yes, that's a good idea too. The third criterion is that patients should have had a previous endoscopy-based fibrosis score. This helps us to identify the degree of fibrosis in the intestinal wall. What do you think about this criterion?",

This will help us assess the utility of elastography in detecting intestinal fibrosis in both limited and extensive forms of Crohn's disease. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "What about the second exclusion criterion? We should exclude patients with prior abdominal surgery. This ensures that the affected segment is the same despite previous surgeries, and it helps maintain homogeneity of the study sample. What are your thoughts on this criterion? \u260e The transcript for this session is provided by Sonix. Click here for more information about transcripts.",

            "Great work! Our inclusion and exclusion criteria are now set. Let's move on to the next step: deciding on the sample size. Our study population consists of 32 years of age to 60 years of age. For women, the inclusion criteria is of 18 to 45 years of age. With these parameters, how many patients do we need to enroll to have 80% power at a significance level of .05? 20 patients per group will yield 80% power at a significance level of .05. What about the number of participants per each group if we are looking to have 100% power at the same significance level? 40 per group will provide 100% power at the same significance level. What if we want to ensure 100% statistical power at a significance level of .01? We need only 15 patients per group. This final criterion is considered conservative. I hope this information helps with your study design.",

These criteria help ensure the safety and well-being of patients, while also maximizing the internal validity and reproducibility of the study."
