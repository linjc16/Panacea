            "Well, my original plan was to find all OPSCC patients in the database and then evaluate only those with at least 40% neoplastic cells. This means that I would have excluded patients with no tumour or benign diseases, including the cases in which the tumour was undetectable to the doctor. Unfortunately, there was no data on this. However, I have found out that the percentage of neoplastic cells may have an impact on the prognosis. This prompted me to examine the cases with at least 70% neoplastic content in detail to exclude any potential errors in data collection.\n<s>",

The treatment and prevention of cysticercus granuloma.\nAbstract 1.\nThe experimental treatments of human and animal cysticercosis have been reviewed with particular reference to the immune status of the animals used, and the methods of assaying the efficacy of any treatment.\n 2.\nThe possible mechanisms of action of drugs, corticosteroids, and immunomodulating agents are discussed. 3.\nMethods of prevention of cysticercosis, as well as of therapy of the patients, are reviewed. Impact of GSTP1 gene polymorphism on hormonal and molecular responses of breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) to ginger constituents\n\nIncreased glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTP1) activity has been recorded in human breast cancer compared to non-cancerous breast tissue. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of GSTP1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes in the response of MCF-7 breast cancer cell line to ginger and its major constituents. In this study GSTP1 polymorphisms and mRNA expression were determined using polymerase chain reaction allele-specific restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique and real-time PCR. The effect of ginger and three of its major bioactive constituents, [6]-shogaol, [10]-shogaol and Zingiberine on the expression of GSTP1 was investigated. The results illustrated that GSTP1 polymorphisms did not play a significant role in breast cancer metastasis. In agreement with previously published data, the data obtained herein showed that the mRNA expression level of GSTP1 was induced by ginger and its major constituents. Our results showed that GSTP1 polymorphisms had no significant impact on breast cancer metastasis. However, the ability of ginger and its major constituents to alter GSTP1 gene expression may shed light on the molecular mechanisms behind the antimetastatic potential of ginger.\n\n# Introduction\nMammary carcinoma is a life-threatening disorder which has an incidence of 45-50 cases out of 1",
            "It's always good to get agreement, thank you. Immune Thrombocytopenia: A Common Disorder With Various Complications\n\nImmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder characterized by low platelet count due to anti-platelet antibodies, low platelet production, and increased platelet destruction. The clinical severity ranges from mild bruising to life-threatening bleeding. Different approaches, including supportive treatment, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, thrombopoietin mimetics, splenectomy, and novel biological therapies have been described. Supportive measures in the form of replacement of platelets and iron supplementation are the cornerstone of the management of ITP. Corticosteroids are used in cases that do not respond to supportive therapy. The next available drug is thrombopoietin mimetics which work by binding to its receptor and result in the proliferation of megakaryocytes. These drugs are used when the patient has a low platelet count with symptoms of bleeding. Splenectomy is the fourth drug used following all the others. However, it may result in complications, such as portal hypertension and sepsis. New biological therapies, such as rituximab -an anti B cells monoclonal drug, and Fostamatinib -a Syk inhibitor, have been used successfully for ITP management.\n\n# Introduction and background\nImmune thrombocytopenia (ITP), formerly known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was first described by MacCallum in 1884 as the bleeding disorder that results in the low platelet count. It is an autoimmune bleeding disorder resulting from impaired production and destruction of platelets, which is ultimately treated with platelet transfusions or intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). The etiology of the condition is unclear and includes multiple factors along with platelet destruction, such as impaired platelet production due to bone marrow suppression, accelerated megakaryocyte breakdown, and platelet sequestration. The destruction"
