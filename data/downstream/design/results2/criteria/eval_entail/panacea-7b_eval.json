Patients with these conditions may have different treatment outcomes, potentially confounding the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The second criterion is the exclusion of patients who do not speak, read, or understand Dutch or English. This is necessary to ensure that patients can adequately understand and provide informed consent for the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! The third criterion is the presence of previous surgery in the thoracic spine, including surgery to prevent or correct kyphosis. Excluding patients with previous spinal surgery helps to ensure that the study population is not influenced by prior surgical interventions that could affect the outcomes of the treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Very well! The fourth criterion is the exclusion of patients with osteopaenia, osteopenia, or osteomalacia diagnosis according to bone mineral density (BMD) Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the lumbar spine or other sites, below T-score of -2.5. Excluding patients with certain bone mineral density diagnoses ensures that the study population has osteoporosis specifically, as defined by the WHO. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

The fifth criterion is the exclusion of patients with concomitant medical conditions or comorbidities that could be a contra-indication or a risk for complications during the surgical or follow-up period. This helps to ensure the safety of the participants and avoid potential complications during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Osteoporotic vertebral fracture within the previous 6 weeks (CT, MRI or X-ray documented).\n2.

            "Absolutely. By excluding participants on special diets or medications that could affect weight, we can minimize any potential confounding factors and more accurately assess the effects of the intervention. Now, let's discuss the second exclusion criterion. Participants should not have any open, infected areas of the treated skin surface. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "That's correct. Excluding participants with active cancer treatments helps ensure participant safety and prevents confounding factors that could affect the outcomes.

The groundtruth criteria list includes the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the clinical trial, and there is no conflict between the model's output and the groundtruth criteria. The criteria mentioned in the model's output, such as \"Ability to provide written informed consent\", are fully included in the groundtruth criteria list under the \"Exclusion Criteria\" section. Therefore, the criteria mentioned in the model's output are present in the full list of the groundtruth criteria, and the match prediction is 1."

Diagnosed with unresectable pancreaticobiliary cancer.\n3. Scheduled to receive chemotherapy using nal-IRI/5-FU/LV combination chemotherapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1.

This indicates that the ability to provide written informed consent is a requirement for inclusion in the study, which aligns with the criterion proposed in the model output.",

The groundtruth criteria list includes an inclusion criterion of \"Patients aged at least 19 years old, diagnosed with unresectable pancreaticobiliary cancer, and scheduled to receive chemotherapy using nal-IRI/5-FU/LV combination chemotherapy\", but no exclusion criterion related to not receiving this specific chemotherapy regimen.\n\nSince the exclusion criterion mentioned in the model output is not present in the groundtruth criteria list, the match prediction is 0, indicating that the criteria from the model's output are not fully included in the groundtruth criteria list.",
