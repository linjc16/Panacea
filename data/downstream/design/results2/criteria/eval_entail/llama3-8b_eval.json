However, it's not uncommon for individuals to be diagnosed at a younger or older age.\n\nA reasonable age range for this study could be:\n\n* 18 to 65 years old\n\nThis allows for a broad range of participants while still being specific to the typical age range for multiple sclerosis. However, it's essential to consider the specific needs and requirements of your study, such as the Unified Protocol, and adjust the age range accordingly.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this age range? Would you like to adjust it or add any additional age-related criteria?",

This criterion is important because individuals with MS often require ongoing treatment, and it's essential to ensure that participants are receiving a stable regimen to minimize any potential confounding variables. By including only participants with a stable treatment regimen, we can reduce the risk of variables affecting the outcome of the study. What do you think?",

Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. One of the exclusion criteria is a history of facial surgery, trauma, or significant facial asymmetry. This is to ensure that the participants do not have any pre-existing conditions that could affect the results of the study or the treatment itself.\n\nAnother exclusion criterion is a history of severe allergies or anaphylaxis. This is to minimize the risk of any adverse reactions to the treatment. What are your thoughts on these exclusion criteria?",

This is important because hyaluronic acid is the main component of the RHA Redensity filler being used in the study, and severe allergies or hypersensitivity could lead to adverse reactions. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

The primary endpoint of the trial is the change in the radial cheek lines from baseline to 6 months after treatment. Participants will be assessed at multiple time points during the trial, including at the time of treatment, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment.\n\nAs a participant, you would be required to attend all scheduled visits and follow the study protocol as instructed. You would also be asked to complete questionnaires and undergo assessments to evaluate the treatment's effectiveness.\n\nBefore enrolling in the trial, you would need to provide informed consent, which means you would need to understand the trial's purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits. You would also need to be willing to participate in the trial for the entire duration, which is approximately 6 months.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on participating in this trial? Do you have any questions or concerns?",

            "So, the study is an interventional trial, which means it involves a treatment or intervention being tested, and the phase is \"not applicable\", which means it's not a clinical trial in a specific phase of drug development (e.g. phase I, II, III, etc.).\n\nCan you tell me what the primary objective of this trial is? Is it to evaluate the safety, efficacy, or feasibility of the parasternal block combined with rectus sheath block for cardiac surgery under sternotomy?",
            "The second inclusion criterion is \"Aged 18-80 years\". This criterion is necessary to ensure that the patients included in the trial are adults, as the safety and efficacy of the interventions have not been established in children or elderly patients. Additionally, this age range allows for a more homogeneous patient population, which is important for ensuring the validity of the trial results. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "The next inclusion criterion is \"American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III\". This criterion is important as it ensures that participants are generally healthy or have mild to moderate systemic disease, which is a common characteristic of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. This criterion also helps to exclude patients with severe systemic disease that may affect the outcome of the study. Do you agree with this criterion?",

            "Excellent. The next exclusion criterion is \"Coagulopathy or bleeding disorder\". This criterion is important because patients with coagulopathy or bleeding disorders may be at risk of bleeding complications during or after the intervention. Excluding such patients ensures that the study population is relatively homogeneous and minimizes the risk of adverse events. Do you agree with this criterion?",

Are there any specific conditions or factors that would exclude patients from participating in the trial? For example, would we exclude patients with severe kidney disease, recent myocardial infarction, or certain medications that could interfere with the test results?",
            "Informed consent is a critical aspect of clinical trials. It's essential to ensure that participants fully understand the risks and benefits of participating in the trial. I completely agree with you.\n\nNext, let's think about the criterion related to cardiac function. What do you think about including patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 30%? This could help ensure that participants have a reasonable level of cardiac function to undergo the pharmacological stress CMR test.\n\nAdditionally, we might also want to consider including a criterion related to the ability to perform exercise. For example, patients should be able to perform a minimum of 4 minutes of exercise on the treadmill or stationary bike. This would help ensure that participants are able to complete the exercise component of the diagnostic test.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these suggestions?",
