The rate of peri-implant disruption is typically measured radiographically, so we can assess the bone levels and contours.

            "That's great, let's move onto the patient- reported outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes are an important measure of treatment effectiveness from the patient's perspective. I suggest evaluating three measures: The European Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), the cancer-specific Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (proSMaRT), and the Assessing Cancer-related Outpatients' Quality-of-Life (ACqOL). I recommend evaluating these at baseline and then again after 3 and 6 months of treatment. What do you think?",

This measure evaluates the occurrence of any adverse events that may have occurred during the treatment. It provides information on the safety profile of the treatment. I recommend evaluating the incidence of adverse events at 6 months. What do you think about this measure?",
            "Based on the discussion, we have agreed on the following outcome measures: \u2022 Objective response rate (ORR), assessed by imaging, as a primary measure of efficacy at 3 months \u2022 Objective response rate (ORR), assessed by imaging, as a secondary measure of efficacy at 6 months \u2022 Progression-free survival (PFS) as a secondary measure of efficacy at 12 months \u2022 Duration of response (DoR) as a secondary measure of efficacy at 15 months \u2022 Disease control rate as a secondary measure of efficacy at 24 months \u2022 Adverse events as a secondary measure of safety at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months Additionally, we may consider adding a few additional measures to capture long-term efficacy and safety outcomes, such as overall survival and incidence of adverse events beyond 1 year. These measures may be added to the protocol at a later stage based on the accumulation of safety and efficacy data during the early-phase clinical trial. We have reviewed the planned timelines and the proposed measures, and we have agreed that the trial has a strong chance of supporting a 351 application to the FDA.\nClinical trial protocols should be designed to provide a wealth of information that can be used to answer key questions about the safety, efficacy, and optimal use of a new treatment. However, the measures used in a clinical trial to answer these questions should be selected carefully to minimize the burden on participants, preserve the ability of patients to receive the standard of care, and ensure the ability to accrue the necessary number of participants. The measures included in the protocol discussed in this vignette are those that we believe will provide the most information in the most efficient and ethical way to meet these objectives. Implementing the agreed-upon measures should help us answer the key questions about the safety, efficacy, and optimal use of the new treatment with the highest level of confidence while minimizing the burden on patients and the costs of the trial.",

The DASH measure is a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses physical function, mobility, and hand and arm function in patients with upper limb injuries. It has been widely used in orthopedic research and is well-suited to assess the functional outcomes of distal radius fractures. The VAS is a simple pain measures that is widely used in clinical practice and research, and provides a numeric representation of the severity of a patient's pain. A lower score indicates less pain. These measures have time frames of 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months post-surgery. Do you have any other suggestions or feedback on the design of outcome measures?",

Based on the goals of your trial, I suggest measuring the chemotherapy relative dose intensity. This measure reflects the ratio of the delivered dose intensity to the standard or planned dose intensity.

For cardiorespiratory fitness, we can assess it using a graded exercise test on a treadmill to measure peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). This measure can be evaluated at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks. For physical function, we can use the 6-minute walk test to measure the distance walked in 6 minutes. This measure can also be evaluated at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks. Finally, for quality of life, we can use the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) questionnaire. This measure can be assessed at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks.

            "For the secondary outcome measure, I propose measuring the change in activity evoked within the medial prefrontal cortex during the contemplation of artwork. This measure also focuses on hemodynamic variations, specifically the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2). The medial prefrontal cortex plays a role in social cognition, self-referential processing, and emotional responses, which are relevant for the contemplation of artwork and self-reflection. \n\nSimilar to the primary outcome measure, we would assess this outcome measure before and after the 6 weeks of interventions. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the museum interventions on brain activity in different regions. Monitoring changes in the medial prefrontal cortex activity can provide insights into how the interventions influence emotional and self-referential processes during artwork contemplation.

Let's call it the \"Treatment-emergent immune-mediated event rate (time-point 0 to 3 years).\" However, it could be more helpful if we were able to quantify the frequency and severity of these events, so we can better understand the impact of the treatment on patients' quality of life.  I think it's important that we add a item to assess how treatment is impacting patients' functional status. Do you have any other concerns or suggestions?[/inst] Well, I have one more suggestion. We should also measure the time to progression (TTP) for each patient.
