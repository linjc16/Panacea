Goodbye!\n\n2023-05-17\n\nAbstract:\nRecent reports indicate that the incidence of peritonitis is relatively high with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Our aim was to determine risk factors for peritonitis in a randomized, controlled CAPSANA study. A total of 848 patients were prospectively randomized in order to receive either high\u2010volume or standard volume (HD and SD) CAPD. There were no significant differences in the incidence of peritonitis (38 and 42 episodes in the SD and high dialysate volume (HDV) groups, respectively) and mortality (9 and 12%, respectively) after a follow\u2010up period of 36 months. Of all patient records (n = 3,941), 348 episodes of peritonitis (incidence 79/1,000 catheter\u2010years) were registered. Independent predictors for peritonitis were type of fluid used (relative risk ratio [RRR] 5.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32\u201022.78, P = 0.02) and the use of systemic steroids (hazard ratio [HR] 2.85, 95% CI 1.39\u20105.84, P = 0.004). Risk of peritonitis was higher in female gender (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.98\u20101.54, P = 0.09), diabetes (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.88\u20101.54, P = 0.28), older (> or = 50 years) (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.82\u20101.45, P = 0.49) and HDV group. The risk ratio of peritonitis was also higher after the first 1,000 dialysate\u2010years (RRR 1.40 (CI 1.05\u20101.88), P = 0.02)."

            "Thank you very much for your reply. Could you please explain to me the primary objective of your study and research questions? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCognitive changes, depression and anxiety are very evident during stroke and recovery periods. They can increase mortality and morbidity of stroke. Many of them can be related to cerebral infarction which may be treated by thrombolysis. So, the purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a significant change in the clinical characteristics of stroke patients after thrombolysis. The data collection will continue over a period of 3 months (Jul - Nov). The researchers will record the severity of cognitive symptoms of patients receiving thrombolysis, the duration of time they are in the hospital, and the changes in the psychological wellbeing of patients during their stay at the hospital. In the case of patient death, the family will be asked to complete our questionnaire. The clinical scores of the patients before and after thrombolysis will be compared. According to research by Lee and others in Taiwan in 2009, anxiety symptoms of patients after thrombolysis were lower compared to symptom severity prior to treatment. Also, in a study by Kroenke et al in 1998, 1 in 6 people between the ages of 18 and 65 in the United States was depressed or had depression symptoms.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nStroke is a major cause of health care costs and medical disability, so the number of studies is increasing rapidly. In contrast to acute neurological symptoms such as acute motor paralysis in stroke survivors, most patients have sequelae from cognitive impairment and mood-related symptoms in particular. Therefore, there is a need to assess cognitive symptoms, mood and emotional changes of patients to improve their quality of life. Thrombolytic therapy should be carried out in the emergency room, but it is not commonly administered due to a lack of awareness or poor compliance. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of thrombolysis on the clinical characteristics of stroke patients. In the case of death, the family will be asked to complete our questionnaire. The clinical characteristics of patients before and after thrombolysis and the factors affecting the clinical characteristics were also explored. The data collection will be performed by a trained nurse on admission and discharge.",

Methods: A prospective study was conducted at a University Hospital over a 24 months period. The study population included the subacute and acute stroke patients, according to the guidelines of the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which were admitted from January 2018 to December 2019. These criteria included the age 18 to 85 years and the absence of a history of stroke. The NIHSS was done at admission. Also, the patient history and examination findings were recorded. The patients\u2019 files were reviewed 3 months after discharge to see what are the most common medical complications and the rate of favorable outcome. Result: The study included 107 patients, the first two months of observation are the acute stages, and the next 10 months are the subacute stages. It showed a great number of medical complications, including pneumonia (56%), urinary tract infection (34.4%), sepsis (25.2%) followed by cerebral edema (1.8%) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (1.8%) as the worst complication. Pneumonia and urinary tract infection represent (80.8%), a great percentage of total complications. The total number of favorable outcomes for the acute patients is 55%, and the ones for the subacute patients is 31%. The NIHSS score significantly correlates to the most common medical complications and the favorable outcome. Conclusion: Acute stroke is the most common neurological emergency. The NIHSS score correlates to medical complications and the percentage of a good outcome. It is a strong tool for stratifying the severity of stroke.",

Background Data: After a stroke, patients often suffer from mobility disorders such as poor posture and reduced postural stability. The goal of our study is to find out if there is a difference between exercise and manipulation in improving the stability and posture of individuals suffering from a stroke. Methods: This research is a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. The trial participants are patients between the ages of 18 and 75 who have had a stroke at least six months ago, can walk without assistance for at least 10 meters, and have a minimum score of 15 on the Mini\u2010Mental Status Test. Each individual will be randomly assigned to either the control group or either the exercise group or the exercise/Manip group, depending on a randomization schedule. The exercise group will undergo an intervention consisting of stretching, strengthening, and functional exercises. The exercise and Manip group will undergo an intervention consisting of stretching, strengthening, functional and Manip exercises.

However, it is still a matter of debate as to whether such a mechanism exists and if it affects clinical outcomes. AIM: Evaluate the potential association between vitamin D status and PPI use with fracture occurrence in elderly men from the Prevention with FeO and tRobolx IbUPROfen Effectiveness (PREFORMA) trial. METHODS: An ancillary substudy from the randomised controlled PREFORMA trial was performed in a subset of male participants (n = 346) aged 50\u201069 years enrolled in primary care. 25\u2010hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum levels were measured at baseline and fractures were self\u2010reported at one year of follow\u2010up.RESULTS: Baseline vitamin D levels were normal in most men (97.7%); mean (SD) serum vitamin D was 66.2 \u00b1 20.9 nmol/L in men who used PPI (n = 100) and 69.7 \u00b1 24.8 nmol/L in men who did not (n = 250). Fractures (n = 25) occurred in both PPI users and non\u2010users in a comparable manner (RR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.48\u20101.70). Low vitamin D status at baseline was not associated with increased risk of fracture (RR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.40\u20101.73).CONCLUSION: Vitamin D levels were not associated with fracture occurrence, irrespective of PPI use. These findings refute the hypothesis of a potential mechanistic link between PPI use and vitamin D\u2010mediated fracture risk in elderly men.",

            "Virtual Tai Chi Easy, or VTCE, is based on the traditional mind-body exercise, Tai Chi Easy. VTCE was previously tested in people with opioid use disorder and chronic pain. Research suggests VTCE helps decrease opioid use in those managing chronic pain. In addition, practicing tai chi has been shown to decrease anxiety. The VTCE program focuses on 4 main movements that are designed to focus inward, so the benefits of tai chi are achieved in a short time. VTCE is designed to be accessible from any location with an internet connection and can be practiced from the comfort of one\u2019s environment at home. We believe the low cost and potential efficacy of this intervention for reducing opioid dose in the general population suggest that it would be beneficial for people experiencing opioid use disorder.

            "I see. How does the treatment work? \n\nAbstract:\nThirty to 40% of all lung cancers are peripheral, with a majority arising in the lower lobes. When diagnosed early, peripheral stage I non\u2010small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have excellent long\u2010term survival after resection. Although surgical resection offers a curative approach in many patients, it is invasive and potentially morbid. Minimally invasive strategies such as robotic\u2010assisted bronchoscopic (RAB) laser ablation (LABA) of NSCLC lesions have been developed to reduce morbidity while achieving complete tumor ablation. However, the recurrence rates for minimally invasive ablation are higher than for surgery. Herein we report the results of a phase 1 clinical trial using Padeliporfin, a second\u2010generation photosensitizer with good uptake in solid tumors. After successful robotic access of peripheral lung lesions, intra\u2010tumoral injection of PadDelPorfin, followed by IV injection of PadDelPorfin and subsequent intraluminal laser ablation, 5 of 6 patients undergoing Padeliporfin vascular targeted photodynamic (VTP) ablation were disease\u2010free 10 months after treatment, with a single recurrence outside the ablated volume successfully treated. This promising approach for treatment of stage I peripheral NSCLC provides a high probability of local control while potentially sparing patients the morbidity and mortality of surgery.",

The operating time between using a conventional bimanual operating method and using the novel image stabiliser was recorded at different stages of the procedure. Twenty\u2010five VRS were randomly allocated to each group. The operating time for each stage of the scleral buckling procedure was calculated as a percentage of the total procedure time.RESULTS: The mean operating time was shorter in the image stabiliser group at each stage of the scleral buckling procedure (P=0.015). There was no learning effect on operating time for the VRS in the bimanual operating method group (P=0.451). However, there was a significant reduction in operating time from the beginning to the end of the procedure for the VRS in the image stabiliser group (r=\u20100.991, P=0.039).CONCLUSIONS: Use of the novel image stabiliser (iSorb, OCULUS) enables a reduction in surgery time, especially at the beginning of the procedure, compared to a conventional bimanual operating method."

Comparing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms treated with EVAR to those treated with a CT-Scan procedure will allow us to see if there are any differences in the outcomes, such as aneurysmal volume changes and graft migration. Now, I'd like to ask about the sample size. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The current guidelines recommend yearly CT\u2010scan examination of aortic stent\u2010grafts to detect graft\u2010migration and other complications. These examinations are time\u2010consuming and expose the patient to increased radiation dose. A non\u2010invasive device that allows reliable estimation of aneurysmal volume and graft migration without irradiation might contribute to decreasing surveillance protocols and could improve cost\u2010effectiveness. Purpose: To compare semi\u2010automated analysis by anatomical landmarks with a dedicated fully automated software in 400 infra\u2010renal aortic stent\u2010grafts over a 5\u2010year period versus a simple circumference measurement in 200 aortic stent\u2010grafts, to measure stent\u2010graft migration, to determine the feasibility and interobserver reproducibility. Methods: One hundred patients with an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm treated with an endovascular aortic repair in the past year were selected: Fifty of them with a dedicated fully automated analysis using a software that detects geometric landmarks of the stent\u2010graft (Vessel Navi; Volumetric S.r.l., Rome, Italy). For the other 50 patients we performed an external\u2010vessel reconstruction by an orthogonal segmentation without automatic detection of vascular wall and lumen contours (Medipix, Milano, Italy). A dedicated software (EVE) superimposes previous images and calculates the volume difference. Results: Analysis of both datasets was realized by an expert surgeon and a senior radiologist. In 18.5% our algorithm failed to detect the aneurysm and we had to resort to the segmentation, and in 21% of cases, the landmarks of the stent\u2010grafts were lost for both methods. The algorithm was able to correctly identify all anatomical landmarks of the stent\u2010graft but failed to reconstruct the vessel",

Thanks for your help!\n\n\nStudy\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nBackground and Scientific Rationale Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a life-threatening respiratory condition characterized by repetitive partial or complete airway obstruction that occurs during sleep and has serious implications for human health. Currently, OSA is the world's fastest-growing chronic disease but is understudied and underdiagnosed. It is estimated that up to 25% of adults over 30 years of age are affected worldwide. OSA often leads to impaired daytime functioning and impaired cognition. It is responsible for the increased risk of car accidents and is associated with obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment and stroke. Studies have shown that about 85% of people with OSA have obesity, which further exacerbates the condition. Obstructive sleep apnea is also associated with an increased risk of death. Current treatment options for OSA include lifestyle changes such as weight loss, the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, surgery to remove obstructions in the upper airway, and lifestyle interventions to prevent weight gain and obesity. However, adherence to these treatments is often low, and there is a need for more effective treatment options. Emerging technology and research have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to improve cognitive functioning and symptoms in individuals with OSA. tDCS is a form of neurostimulation that involves delivering a low-level electrical current to the brain to modulate brain activity and improve cognitive functioning. Previous studies have shown that tDCS improves cognitive functioning in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. In individuals with OSA, tDCS has been shown to improve measures of alertness, sleepiness, and cognitive functioning. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of tDCS in the treatment of OSA. Objectives The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation training (CRT) and tDCS as a treatment option for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Specifically, the study will examine the changes in cognitive functioning, quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and adherence to treatment,",

            "Abstract:\nBackground and Purpose: In response to increasing recognition of the importance of the intestinal microbiome in health and disease, human gut microbiota transplantation trials are increasingly being used to study human microbiome in health and disease. This study utilized prebiotic fibre, inulin, as a form of gut microbiota transplantation to investigate the effect of microbiome manipulation in chronic inflammatory disease. It aimed to identify microbiome signatures following gut microbiota transplantation, to examine whether such signatures affect disease outcomes, and to assess the effects of gut microbiota transplantation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Twelve patients with active disease (disease activity score (DAS28) >3.2) participated in a single centre randomised controlled trial. After a washout period, participants consumed one of two supplements for four weeks: inulin or a placebo. Faecal samples were collected at baseline, four weeks and at 12 weeks. The DAS28 score was assessed at week zero and 12. An intestinal microbiome was profiled by next\u2010generation sequencing using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing, and the data were statistically analysed. The impact of the transplanted microbial signatures on RA disease activity was determined using a probabilistic Bayesian approach. Results: There was a significant decrease in DAS28 at 12 weeks compared with baseline. The baseline gut microbiome composition of two patients who achieved remission differed from those patients who did not; one patient had an increased abundance of Enterococcacea family while another had a greater abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila. No differences in the gut microbiome composition at the end of four and 12 weeks were seen in those patients who achieved clinical improvement or not. Conclusion: Although the overall population demonstrated a trend towards clinical improvement, this change was not associated with a detectable change in the gut microbiome. Further investigation of the role of selected commensals in rheumatoid arthritis is warranted.\n\n1.

The third study arm will include participants with the HEXB2 gene who will take the placebo, and the fourth study arm will include participants with the HEXB2 variant who will also receive the placebo. Does this make sense? \nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis is an innovative clinical trial that tests the effects of diet, exercise, and other lifestyle factors on depression and metabolic syndrome by measuring the effects on molecular phenotypes (proteins) and metabolites. Patients will be randomized to one of two different lifestyle interventions for 12 weeks and then will return to usual care for another 6 months.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nLevels of the HEXB2 gene's product (FBP-26) are associated with major depressive disorder/unipolar depression (MDD/ UD) and also with metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is a cluster of disorders associated with both MDD and UD and involves high blood pressure, high and bad cholesterol, obesity, and insulin resistance. FBP-26 causes insulin resistance by inhibiting phosphofructokinase, one of the key enzymes involved in the metabolism of sugar into energy. We theorize that lowering FBP-26 concentrations with changes in lifestyle can improve the blood sugar-insulin system and potentially alleviate the negative effects of MetS. This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial will allow us to test for the first time the hypothesis that reduced FBP-26 levels due to a program of lifestyle changes improves blood sugar levels, weight, fat distribution, and depression in subjects at risk for MetS. MetS is increasingly recognized as a leading cause of depression in older adults and causes morbidity and mortality. The trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial of a diet and exercise intervention.

Forty biopsy\u2010proven chronic, HCV (HCV) antibody\u2010positive, HCV RNA\u2010positive patients who received standard\u2010of\u2010care therapy between February 1993 and February 1996 were included. Fifty\u2010one biopsy\u2010proven patients who received HCV treatment between November 2003 and October 2005 with or without concurrent anticirrhotic therapy were prospectively enrolled. Patients were followed up until December 31, 2006. The prevalence of HPH was higher in patients treated before 2000 (63.6%) than it was in patients treated after 2000 (25%; P = 0.0001). The development of HPH decreased with the introduction of peginterferon alfa\u20102a alone (25%) and therapy with peginterferon alfa\u20102a plus ribavirin (10%; P = 0.0008). HCV treatment with boceprevir\u2010containing triple therapy was also associated with decreased HPH development but was not significant (13%; P = 0.7). The HPH development rate was lower in patients with baseline alanine aminotransferase \u22645 times the upper limit of normal (UUN) (20%) than in those with liver dysfunction (HPH prevalence 83.3%; P < 0.0001). However, the presence of liver dysfunction at the time of treatment initiation was not associated with HPH development (P = 0.83).

The HCC patients received targeted drug therapy and immunotherapy followed by radical treatment of radical surgery or ablative therapy were included in the research. The results of the trials were encouraging and effective. This clinical study intends to apply the treatment of advanced unresectable HCC patients, including chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors for conversion treatment to transform the advanced unresectable HCC patients from unresectable to resectable, and finally perform radical resection or interventional treatment to prolong the survival time of HCC patients.

            "Alright. Thank you for providing the information. Now, let's move on to the endpoints. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground and Aims. Fibromyalgia is a complex syndrome that affects women more often than men. Previous studies showed that physical interventions such as aerobic or resistance training have no positive effect on fibromyalgia symptoms. We hypothesized that combined aerobic and strength training are feasible and effective in women with fibromyalgia. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of 12\u2010weeks of combined aerobic and strenght training in patients with fibromyalgia. Material and Methods. The study included 30 women with fibromyalgia, aged from 18 to 55 years. The participants performed 40\u2010minute training 2 times a week during 4 months. An aerobic session consisted of moderate\u2010intensity treadmill walking, elliptical training, or stationary bicycling, while a strength\u2010training session consisted of exercises performed on aerobics and step platforms, resistance bands, and free weight. Before and after the sessions, participants' perception of pain, health\u2010related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and physical abilities were evaluated. The pre and post\u2010sessions were compared using the unpaired t test. Results. We found significant improvement in the overall score of visual analog scale for pain and overall health scale score of Short\u2010Form 36, and significant reduction in the scores of Beck Depression Inventory\u2010II in the group of women with fibromyalgia following the sessions. Conclusion. Combined aerobic and resistance training improved women's perception of pain and mood and overall well\u2010being. Further research is indicated to verify the effects of this type of combined training program on symptoms of fibromyalgia among women.",

Now, how long do you expect the trial to last? \n\nStudy type\n=================\nObservational\n\nIntervention\n=================\nCurrent interventions as of 16 September 2022:\nThe Rapid Mood Screener (RMS) is an easy-to-use and practical algorithm for major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, and schizophrenia that healthcare providers can use to quickly and accurately diagnose and assess these conditions. It will be applied by the providers and the questionnaires will be collected from the participants.RMS data will be summarized and reviewed.\n\nBrief summary in scientific language\n=================\nThe screening process for depression that takes place in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics is time-consuming and relies on self-reporting by the patient, which may lead to a false diagnosis. If these problems can be overcome, it might lead to more timely and accurate treatment of mental health illnesses that require prompt attention to avoid complications.To address this concern, we developed the Rapid Mood Screener (RMS), a practical method to aid healthcare providers in diagnosing mental illnesses, including major depressive disorder, bipolar 1 depression, and schizophrenia through a single set of questions. Although this paper is specific to bipolar 1 depression, there are plans to develop it to accommodate other psychiatric conditions, and potentially generalizable it for use in primary care settings.In this project, we will apply the RMS to adult participants with a primary complaint of depressive symptoms in a community psychiatry clinic and compare its accuracy to self-reporting by the patient during the visit. To validate the RMS, we will compare its results to a gold standard diagnosis using an established diagnostic questionnaire, a clinical diagnostic interview, and a mood disorder diagnostic interview. We hypothesize that the RMS will be more accurate in diagnosing depression and other mental health illnesses than self-reporting by the patient.The application of the RMS can help healthcare providers quickly diagnose and accurately assess individuals with depression, bipolar depression, and schizophrenia using a set of easy-to-use questions. This approach can result in more timely and accurate treatment for mental health illnesses that require prompt attention to avoid complications.\n\nHealth condition or problem studied\n=================",

Because Hispanic women experience cultural, health literacy, language and socioeconomic barriers to navigating cancer care, they often face inequities in accessing high-quality care. The long-term goal of this project is to decrease barriers to navigating breast cancer care and improving the health outcomes and quality of life for Hispanic women. This goal will be achieved by addressing cancer care-related challenges and enhancing social and economic determinants of health (SEHDs) and health related quality of life (HRQOL) for Hispanic breast cancer patients. The program will implement linguistically and culturally appropriate interventions to meet SEHDs and provide social and emotional support.

Eligible patients with LES aged greater than 18 years were identified by the presence of LES in the Electronic Medical record (EMR) and/or using a self-reported language survey. The project was implemented in two phases, pilot followed by scale-up. Specific aims included 1) designing linguistically, culturally and functionally-specific materials of the patient encounter process, 2) evaluating the preliminary impact of the interventions on patients, providers and hospital staff, 3) establishing procedures for patient/family education regarding community and medical translation and interpretation services. In the pilot phase, the project was implemented in the emergency department and 2 non-procedural clinics within the HHS.

Methods: Twenty\u2010six patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) were randomized to use different walking assist devices and completed the same gait training program: 30\u2010minutes daily exercise. The patients used each device in a random order for 3 months on each limb. Ten healthy volunteers were also recruited as a baseline group. The 6\u2010Minute Walk Test, 30\u2010Second Sit\u2010to\u2010Stand Test, and Walking Ability Test\u201012 (WAT\u201012) were used in both SCI and healthy groups. Isokinetic muscle dynamometry (Nicholas Muscle Dynamometer, JTECH medical, CA, USA) was used to assess the maximum strength of both lower limbs in 4 protocols: concentric contractions with flexion of knee and hip joints, and eccentric contractions with hyperextension of knee and hip joints with a 10\u2010second interval for each item. The walking velocity and metabolic cost index were also assessed during the walking trial. Results: Maximum strength of the lower limbs in the 4 protocols was significantly higher in healthy volunteers than in the SCI groups. Maximum walking velocity and 6\u2010minute walking distance were significantly lower in the SCI groups than in the healthy volunteers. Conclusion: Lower\u2010limb strength is the major factor affecting gait ability in SCI patients. The ankle\u2010foot orthosis effectively assisted walking in the patient with SCI, but it was limited to a narrow walking path. The lower\u2010limb exoskeleton and robotic walker have the potential for assisting walking in patients with lower\u2010limb weakness",

The most recent American College of Emergency Physicians clinical policy statement on alcohol intoxication, published in 2015, includes management principles that focus on treating alcohol intoxication in a timely manner, determining intentionality, screening for suicide risk, and arranging for follow\u2010up care. There is growing interest in the use of the Benzodiazepine Agonist/Antagonist Lofexidine to reduce the risk of violence and alcohol\u2010related hospital admissions. The goal of this study is to determine the role of Lofexidine in the management of patients who present to the emergency department with alcohol intoxication. Our objective is to perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and conduct a meta\u2010analysis comparing the effect of Lofexidine therapy versus placebo or standard care in adult patients who present to the emergency department with alcohol intoxication. We plan to search PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE from the earliest date available to March 2022. Two researchers will independently screen the identified citations, abstracts, and full papers. All conflicts will be resolved by a third reviewer. Two researchers will independently extract data using a standardized form and perform a meta\u2010analysis using random\u2010effects models. The primary outcomes will be violence and police involvement, and the secondary outcomes will be alcohol\u2010related hospital admissions and time to resolution of alcohol intoxication. This study will help determine the role of Lofexidine therapy in the management of patients who present to the emergency department with alcohol intoxication, and whether this therapy can provide additional benefit in reducing the risk of violence and alcohol\u2010related hospital admissions. We believe this is an important area of research that can help improve the management of patients with alcohol intoxication and reduce emergency department resource utilization",
            "Yes, it is vital to have a control group for comparison purposes. We can move on to designing the study arms. The third arm, Active Comparator: Combined Museum intervention, includes participants who will undergo a combined museum intervention for six weeks. The combined intervention involves weekly museum visits in groups of 10 participants, with both a well-being museum mediator and a classic museum volunteer guide trained in art history. Do you think a multi-treatment approach would be beneficial for this study?",

The first arm, Experimental: Well-Being Museum intervention, includes participants who will undergo a well-being museum intervention for six weeks. The well-being intervention involves weekly museum visits in groups of 10 participants, with the support of a museum mediator. The mediator helps participants develop a personal and sensitive understanding of artworks by encouraging the expression of feelings, impressions, and interpretations. This approach aims to foster a more subjective engagement with the artwork. What do you think about this arm?",
            "That's a valid concern. A smaller group size might allow for more focused and individualized discussions. Perhaps we can consider reducing the group size to 5 participants in future studies. For this particular trial, we can keep the group size at 10 to maintain consistency with the classic intervention arm. Does that sound reasonable?",
            "Great. Now, let's move on to the second arm, Active Comparator: Classic Museum intervention. This arm includes participants who will undergo a classic museum intervention for six weeks. The classic intervention involves weekly museum visits in groups of 10 participants, guided by a volunteer guide trained in art history. The guide provides information about art pieces, the artist, and the historical context of the artwork without influencing the participants' discussions or interpretations. This arm serves as the control group to compare the effects of the well-being intervention. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "I agree. Having a control group will provide valuable insights into the unique benefits of engaging with art in a more personal and subjective manner.

In the first-in-human, Phase 1 open-label clinical study, REGN2810 (cemiplimab) monotherapy resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 15.4% (95% [CI]: 3, 30), in a population of PD-L1-positive, advanced NSCLC patients (n = 49). Although, the effect of REGN2810 was modest, it was well tolerated and there were no associated deaths. There is considerable evidence supporting the use of platinum-containing chemotherapy in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapies with a 1-year survival of 13.9% in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy alone. A subsequent trial with combination PD-1/PD-L1/platinum therapy resulted in a response rate of 56% (95% CI: 35, 75) in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-L1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, followed by maintenance pembrolizumab. The ORR for the approved anti-PD-L1 inhibitor nivolumab is 29% (95% CI: 24, 35).

Good luck with the trial!\n\n1.Introduction\nIn this paper, we propose a model that incorporates a linear-linear model and a linear-Emax model. First, we used a linear-linear model to investigate the dose-response relationship of the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawal events. Second, we used a linear-Emax model to investigate the dose-response relationship of the effect of the drug (or medication). The drug effect in many of the models is measured by log (HRs), which represents the probability of success. Therefore, we assumed that the effect of the drug is linearly proportional to the logarithm of HRs. Third, we fitted a linear-linear model with log (HRs) to investigate the dose-response relationship of drug toxicity. If the drug had no effect on the effect of the drug, the linear-linear model with log (HRs) would have been fitted to investigate the dose-response relationship of drug toxicity. This model was referred to as a linear-linear drug toxicity model. Furthermore, we investigated whether there was a relationship between the drug effect and the dose. In this paper, we investigated the dose-response relationship of drug toxicity by comparing a linear-linear drug toxicity model with a linear-Emax drug toxicity model. We performed a simulation study to evaluate the effect of confounding on both linear-linear drug toxicity and linear-Emax drug toxicity models. The main aim of this study was to compare the performance of the 2 models of the effect. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the same 2 models regarding their ability to detect an emerging safety signal.\nThe performance of the linear-Emax drug toxicity model was evaluated by comparing its effect estimate and 95% confidence interval with that of a linear-linear drug toxicity model. We used 100 simulation scenarios with 1000 replicates. To calculate the effect estimates and their associated 95% confidence intervals, we used the Bayesian approach in which the likelihood is a likelihood with overdispersion. To evaluate the ability of the linear-Emax drug toxicity model to detect an emerging safety signal, we calculated the power (%) to detect the effect in the Bayesian dose-response model with the linear-linear drug toxicity model and linear-Emax drug toxicity model"

Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in women, and most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. The diagnosis of peritoneal lesions is usually made through exploration surgery and intraoperative pathology diagnosis of cancer cells or peritoneal malignant tumors. The conventional treatment of peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer is the combination of chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery, but it has not been proven in clinical trials to prolong patients' overall survival. At present, there are no drugs that have been approved for treatment of this situation, and most peritoneal lesions recur after surgery. The number of deaths caused by this disease is increasing. At present, the standard treatment of patients with peritoneal metastasis is that patients with peritoneal metastasis should receive laparoscopy and peritoneal puncture of the greater omentum if there are signs of malignant peritonitis. In recent years, with the study of epigastric arterial lymph node biopsy, a new treatment method has been found to determine the existence and number of epigastric lymph node metastases and to detect peritoneal lesions. The researchers will design a study to determine whether patients with ovarian cancer and epigastric arterial lymph node metastasis who are not suitable for surgery can benefit from antiangiogenic treatment targeting the epigastric artery.\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nOvarian Cancer, Recurrent Ovarian Cancer, Stage I Ovarian Cancer, Stage II Ovarian Cancer, Stage III Ovarian Cancer, Stage IV Ovarian Cancer\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure: Epigastric lymph node biopsy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients who have ovarian cancer and whose clinically assessed peritone",

            "Alright. Could you give us a more detailed description of the method? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCardiac remodeling is the main driver in the progression of heart failure (HF). One of the main hallmarks of HF pathology is the impairment of mitochondrial function. Sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and hospitalization in patients with HF by reducing the incidence of cardiac remodeling. Aside from its impact on glucose metabolism, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial function. The use of sGC agonists is associated with positive cardiac remodeling and reduction of oxidative stress. Phosmetasome has been shown to improve mitochondrial function and protect myocardial cells from oxidative stress, indicating beneficial role in reducing HF. To further enhance this, Solriamfetol is well studied ARNI, which has antioxidant effect and protects from adverse cardiac remodeling in preclinical models. In this study, the impact of combination therapy (two SGLT2 inhibitors with sGC stimulator, phosmetasome, and Solriamfetol; four drugs) on improving mitochondrial function compared to usual care will be assessed.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, two-stage study is to assess the impact of triple therapy in addition to standard therapy for heart failure (HF) that is already on standard medication in patients with moderate or severe reduction in ejection fraction (ejection fraction < 45%) compared to standard therapy alone on markers of mitochondrial metabolism such as glucose, fatty acid, keto acid, and lactate. We hypotheshize that combination therapy in addition to standard therapies will improve clinical and subclinical outcomes in HF patients. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, two-stage study (N=40) will be conducted for 12 weeks. For 6 weeks of the study, all patients will receive the standard dose of SGLT2",

And what are the objectives of the study? \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of providing a nurse\u2010led telephone intervention to patients and caregivers of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The intervention is intended to supplement care provided by an interdisciplinary ALS Clinic and was modeled after a previous study.DESIGN: Participants were enrolled at two academic ALS centers using standard inclusion and exclusion criteria. Caregivers and patients with documented ALS were eligible to enroll. In this feasibility study, an experienced nurse (interventionist) engaged patients and their caregivers by telephone with monthly communication. During these monthly phone calls, the nurse helped patients and caregivers identify and manage issues arising from the disease. Caregivers were encouraged to participate in telephone calls, but the patient was the primary focus of the calls. Patient enrollment was staggered to allow for continuous monitoring of patient and caregiver needs. The study was designed to enroll patients at each site who were either new to the ALS Clinic or who had been seen at the ALS Clinic for an extended period of time and were therefore more likely to experience symptom and functional deterioration. At the start of the intervention, patients and their caregivers were asked the following question on a scale of 1 (not important) to 10 (most important): How much do you believe that the nurse telephone calls will be helpful in assisting you to cope with issues that arise from your ALS? How would you rate your understanding of the medication currently being used to treat your ALS? The same question was repeated at 6\u2009months. The primary goals were to measure changes in disease symptoms and functioning at 6 months following baseline and explore the feasibility of providing telephone\u2010focused care to a sample of patients with ALS.SETTING: Study sites were the VA Tampa Healthcare System (Tampa, FL) and University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA), USA.PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen Veterans were recruited from the Tampa site and seven patients with ALS were recruited from the Philadelphia site, along with the caregivers of the patients.

In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study design, the investigators evaluated the acute and longer-term effects of cathodal ventromedial prefrontal cortex modulation on illness awareness in 30 inpatients or outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Clinical and functional imaging effects will be assessed across study visits.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe aim of this study is to determine the clinical and functional imaging effects of serial CVS on illness awareness. There is much interest in understanding how illness awareness and insight affect outcomes such as illness engagement, treatment adherence, and relapse prevention. Additionally, insight into the mechanisms of action that drive these outcomes would accelerate research into the neurobiology of illness awareness and potentially lead to the development of new interventions. In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we will evaluate the acute and longer-term effects of cathodal ventromedial prefrontal cortex modulation on illness awareness in 30 inpatients or outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, the current study is the first to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate the PFC in patients with schizophrenia, and it is the first to examine the impact of modulating ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity (vmPFC) on illness awareness. The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, crossover study to determine whether cathodal versus sham vmPFC electrical stimulation has a different impact on illness awareness and insight. Patients will consent to 8 study visits and randomized into one of two treatment conditions (cathodal ventromedial prefrontal cortex vs. sham ventromedial prefrontal cortex) in a block design.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether there is a difference between the effect of scaling and root planing in patients with obesity (BMI >30) and patients with normal BMI in reducing periodontal inflammation. METHODS: A randomized control trial with a parallel control group was conducted in 50 periodontitis patients. The patients were divided into 2 categories with a ratio of 1:1, in accordance to the inclusion criteria based on body mass index (BMI) (N=25 in each group; 20 normal weight patients and 5 patients with obesity). After 3 months from the baseline, scaling and root planing were conducted, and follow\u2010ups were done after 3 and 6 months. All the patients had their BMI recorded and underwent periodontal examination: gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), bleeding index (BI), and complete measurements of the clinical attachment level on the first molar. The scores were converted to the average and then compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: All the variables decreased significantly in the obesity group after 6 months. The results showed that BMI had a significant effect on periodontal inflammation (p=0.001). When the obese group was compared to the normal group after 3 months, there was a significant decrease in the average GI and BI (p<0.001). However, when the groups were compared after 6 months, no difference was shown among the 2 groups (p>0.05). There were significant decreases in the mean PD, CAL, and PI of both groups at 3 and 6 months (p<0.001), with no significant difference in mean PI between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Scaling and root planing had the same effect on reducing periodontal inflammation in patients with normal and abnormal BMI.",

Our primary outcomes will be objective assessments of sleep behavior through the use of wrist\u2010worn actigraph monitors that will capture night\u2010time movement and sleep cycles. Secondary outcome measures will be measures of sleep quality as well as other potential factors to be assessed, including demographic and other socio\u2010economic data, information on sleep hygiene behaviors, and self\u2010report of sleep quality. We hypothesize that the weekly SMS intervention will lead to a significant improvement in sleep patterns as reported via sleep actigraphy. Discussion: This novel intervention provides a unique opportunity to test non\u2010invasive, personalized, wearable devices to encourage individualized behavior change and address the large health disparities in breast cancer.

The lifetime chance of being alive with PCa is estimated at about 15% and as high as 25% for men age 80 and older. Recent data suggest, due in part to increasing screening, that prostate cancer mortality is significantly decreasing. However, PCa is the third most common cause of cancer death among men in the United States, indicating a need for better screening strategies and more accurate diagnostic tests. The goal of this research study is to determine if the combination of specific ultrasound measurements, called Transient Elastography (TE), and MRI can detect prostate cancer in patients referred for biopsy based on a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value less than 10ng/mL. Current standard of care requires men with a PSA level less than 3ng/mL not to receive a prostate biopsy, yet some prostate cancers will escape detection until they are at a more advanced stage when it is more difficult to cure. While biopsy is the current standard of care to assess the presence of prostate cancer, it is an invasive procedure and the results may be inaccurate, causing the need for repeat biopsies. A common reason for repeat biopsies is due to inflammation in the prostate that causes the prostate tissue to appear abnormal. While PSA testing has been instrumental to increasing early detection of prostate cancer, it is also associated with over-diagnosis whereby prostate cancers are found that ultimately are likely not to cause any harm during a patient's lifetime. Over the years, the threshold PSA cutoff value has been gradually lowering, however, a PSA value above the new cutoffs of 8 or 10 ng/mL is still associated with an approximately 25% to 30% likelihood of detecting prostate cancer on biopsy. The reason why PSA values are still elevated even when the cutoff value has been made extremely"

The common cold is a mild acute upper respiratory infection caused by a variety of viruses, which result in nasal congestion, runny nose, blocked nose, and sneezing. The symptoms occur from the day of infection with the virus to 7-14 days. Symptoms of the common cold are usually mild; however, they can be very disruptive to the daily lives of patients, particularly adolescents and young adults who may return to the study site or clinic for a nasal or throat culture taken up to 3 times per day. This may occur over a period of several days to a week in order to assess microbial cultures. A large portion of these patients develop an inflammatory response to the virus within the nasal cavity, known as \"rhinitis\". A study in patients in Japan suggests that up to six times more patients suffered from nasal congestion due to a blocked nasal cavity, than in adults. This inflammation is characterized by the presence of an inflammatory response in the blood, which includes an increase in an immune cell called a T cell, and T cells are activated after infection with the virus. The immune system is activated through the presence of specific proteins called cytokines. These cytokines (eg, interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma) cause an increase in the number of T cells which leads to inflammation of the nasal mucosa. In adults, the cytokines involved in this response are interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-5, IL-9, and other cytokines, including Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2). Inhibition of these various cytokines has been found effective as a treatment for various inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arth",

Sample Size: 100 participants in each group (study and control group) \n\nStudy Design Rationale:\n1. Study Type: Observational - This study design involves observing the participants and collecting data without intervention to examine the prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis among patients with a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. \n2. Study Duration: 5 years - This duration should be sufficient to recruit and enroll the required number of participants and to collect the necessary data for analysis. \n3. Sample Size: 100 participants in each group - The sample size is considered adequate to detect statistically significant differences between the study and control group. \n\nStudy Design Rationale:\n\nThe study design is appropriate for the investigation of the relationship between spinal stenosis and cardiac amyloidosis. By observing participants in each group and performing DPD scintigraphy, researchers can determine the prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis in individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis and whether it is different from individuals without lumbar spinal stenosis. \nThe study duration of 5 years is reasonable and allows for sufficient time to recruit and enroll the required number of participants. It also allows for adequate data collection and statistical analysis of the results.

Participation to the study will be limited to medical and/or non-medical files already entered in the national registry of people with heart failure. In order to improve detection of dementia and psychiatric illness, patients will be questioned using scales for patient self-report, informant or professional, the results of these scales being systematically linked to an available diagnosis of heart failure.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe results will allow assessment of the rate of neuropsychiatric illness in a contemporary cohort of people with heart failure. This study will focus on the association with clinical factors (comorbidity and treatment of heart failure), cognitive function, biomarkers possibly associated to increased risk of this type of cardiovascular disease in the general population. It will also help to assess the potential predictive role of biomarkers (blood levels of the biologically active hormone of angiotensin II) and the potential association of these biomarkers and neuropsychiatric illness in people with heart failure. The results of this study will be important for optimizing medical management of patients with heart failure. Study design: All patients included in the national registry of heart failure who have signed the consent will be invited to participate in this multicentric prospective study. Each patient will be asked to indicate another heart failure patient of a similar age category and sex. No new patient with cognitive impairment will be recruited.

            "Excellent! Let's move on to the goals and objectives of the study. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Myocardial protection during coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a leading topic in cardiac surgery. Indeed, although recent guidelines state that there is no difference between myocardial protection methods and cardiac preservation technologies, the European consensus proposes that cardioplegia should be the primary mode of myocardial protection during heart surgery. However, recent studies highlight a trend in favor of myocardial protection, mainly using extracorporeal circulation in patients undergoing heart surgery. Nevertheless, although promising, these results only concern a minority of hospitals and patients. AIMS: The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze the safety and feasibility of a pharmacological myocardial protection strategy compared to a cardioplegic strategy in patients undergoing heart surgery in a real\u2010life context.METHODS: This study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open\u2010label study including patients undergoing isolated or associated left heart surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass and extracorporeal circulation. Following randomization, the patients will receive a cardioplegic or pharmacological strategy. The primary endpoint is the rate of ischemic\u2010related arrhythmias (including atrial arrhythmias (AA), atrio\u2010ventricular block (AVB) > 2nd degree at discharge). Secondary endpoints include composite endpoints at 30 days post\u2010operative (Mace\u20103 score, echocardiographic evaluation of systolic and diastolic dysfunction), functional status (NYHA function score, 6\u2010MWD, LVEF evaluated by radionuclide ventriculography), and adverse events (myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, ventilation, and renal replacement therapy duration). Finally, an economic evaluation will be performed on the same inclusion population.CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to assess the feasibility of a pharmacological myocardial protection strategy compared to a cardioplegic strategy. If this study demonstrates its interest, the subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT) will allow us to assess the effect of pharmacological myocardial protection on clinical outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical\u00a0Trials\u00a0-",

Based on the preliminary study results, DSP-7888 for treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 (SAS) is selected as the most promising drug among DSP-7888 and three other anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs with the help of a machine learning model. In the phase 2 clinical trial, this is a randomized, double-blind controlled study in which DSP-7888 or placebo is administered once a day.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause lower respiratory tract infections such as viral pneumonia and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, the optimal drug treatment of COVID-19 has not been found. At the present stage of the COVID-19, the development of efficacious antiviral drugs is the most urgent need for patients with COVID\u201019. Due to its convenient method and simple operation, intravenous infusion has been extensively applied to the treatment of SAS. Therefore, investigators designed and conducted an exploratory study to screen effective drugs in a limited number of patients with COVID-19, and a multiphase clinical trial was carried out to further verify their efficacy while expanding the sample size. According to the results of preliminary research, DSP-7888 emerged as the most promising candidate. Based on the results, DSP-7888 for treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 (SAS) was selected as the most promising drug among DSP-7888 and three other anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs with the help of a machine learning model.

Where can I find more information? \n\nBrief summary\n=================\nPurpose and Overview: To assess the effect of the Decision Tool to improve knowledge and perceived risk compared to the conventional Spanish information in women receiving maintenance chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in the community setting. \n\nDesign and Approach: This is a cluster randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants will be invited to complete surveys at baseline and 3 months. Outcomes will be knowledge and perceived risk. Participants will also complete an acceptability survey.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAn estimated 22,530 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, 14,030 of whom will die from the disease (1,957-2016 National Cancer Institute Surveillance and Epidemiology and End Results Program). The overall five-year survival rate (SEER 10) is 47.6%. The most robust treatment approach for ovarian cancer is surgery followed by chemotherapy. Patients are recommended to receive at least six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence suggests that the administration of up to 12 additional maintenance cytotoxic chemotherapy cycles after completing the standard six cycles is associated with improved overall survival compared to observation alone. Nonetheless, in reality, approximately 50% of patients elect to receive maintenance chemotherapy. The decision to elect or not to elect additional chemotherapy is particularly relevant to women with ovarian cancer because chemotherapy can elicit significant toxicities, including myelosuppression, alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy. Moreover, many patients have received multiple medical treatments with significant side effects and may not have the desire to accept more therapy. Because maintenance chemotherapy is not universally available and is often provided only in academic medical centers, patients in community hospitals may not be informed about this treatment option. A Shared Decision Tool (SDT) consisting of a fact sheet in Spanish providing information about the benefits and risks of treatment has been created that allows women under treatment to obtain information, reflect on their preferences, discuss their options with their clinicians, and consider whether to accept or decline this treatment option. This Shared Decision Tool includes information and figures that are specific to women diagnosed with ovarian cancer and receiving maintenance chemotherapy in the ambul",

There are, however, limitations of the current denture design with a standard attachment system. Moreover, overdenture prosthetic construction with computer\u2010aided design and computer\u2010aided manufacturing (CAD/ CAM) is known to cause fabrication errors due to the limitations in intra\u2010oral scanners or CAD systems. Thus, the aim of this study was to introduce a new scanning and CAD/CAM method to fabricate a new overdenture prototype and determine its clinical applicability. Methods: A total of 24 patients with good oral, systemic health, and a bilateral full\u2010arch edentulous jaw with a minimum height of the residual alveolar ridge of 6\u00a0mm were selected. Two sets of complete denture (maxilla and mandible) were fabricated for each patient. After initial denture construction, impressions, surgical stents, and guide pins were fabricated for implant placement. Implants were inserted for both the maxillary and mandibular jaw at an average of 8\u00a0weeks after the surgical procedure. After the second stage surgery and occlusal adjustment, two sets of complete denture (maxilla and mandible) were fabricated. Then, the mandibular complete denture was fabricated at two different methods. One complete denture was fabricated with a conventional method, and the other complete denture was fabricated at a digitized method (3Shape Exocad software). Patients were followed at 2, 4, and 6\u00a0weeks after the implant placement for evaluation. A digital scanner (Bilbray 3D i500 Scanner; Carestream Dental, Atlanta, GA, USA) was used to scan the two maxillary complete dentures and two mandibular complete dentures over the first one\u2010year follow\u2010up. Patients were instructed to perform chewing of hard and soft textured food and evaluated by the Percival Occluzer (Percival Instrument Co., Inc., Mundelein, IL, USA)",

The mandibular condyle is crucial in TMD patients, and the conventional mandibular overdenture has been the conventional treatment option. Nevertheless, it is a challenge to achieve the ideal position for the mandibular overdenture. Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology offer precision in the mandibular overdenture position and is widely used in modern prosthodontics.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThere is a lack of clinical evidence regarding the effect of CAD/CAM milling on overdenture bases between CAD/CAM milled and conventional mandibular overdentures. This study aimed to explore the effect of CAD/CAM mandibular overdentures on temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function. It was hypothesized that the CAD/CAM mandibular overdenture is superior in restoring TMJ biomechanics and function. Patients with a maxillary complete conventional complete denture or a complete mandibular conventional complete denture were included. They were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. At first, patients in the experimental group were treated with CAD/CAM mandibular overdentures while patients in the control group received conventional mandibular overdentures. TMJ sounds, joint laxity, mouth opening, headache intensity, pain threshold, occlusal function, and oral quality of life were assessed during and after treatment.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nComparison Between Computer-Assisted Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing and Conventional Mandibular Overdenture in Patients With Complete Dentures\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nMissing Teeth\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) treatment\n* Other: conventional mandibular overdenture (control treatment)\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients with normal occlusion; Age ranging from 21 to 45; Patients had TMD with no inter-",

However, the surgical procedure itself can be painful and cause discomfort for patients. Research has suggested that injecting hyaluronic acid into the implant socket before implantation can reduce post-implantation pain and promote faster healing. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hyaluronic acid injection in reducing post-implantation pain and its impact on patient outcomes. [/CONTEXT] [/TITLE]\n\n[ABSTRACT] [EN] Implant dentures have become a popular choice for edentulous patients due to their numerous advantages such as high stability, comfort, and function while preserving oral health. However, the surgical procedure for implant placement can be painful and cause discomfort for patients. Research has shown that injecting hyaluronic acid into the implant socket before implantation can help reduce post-implantation pain and promote faster healing. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of hyaluronic acid injection in reducing post-implantation pain in 70 edentulous patients undergoing implant surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the experimental group received hyaluronic acid injection into the implant socket, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Pain intensity and duration, patient satisfaction, and complications were assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-surgery, and the data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The results showed that the patients in the experimental group had significantly lower pain intensity and duration compared to the control group, and had higher levels of satisfaction with their treatment. There were no serious complications in either group, and no significant differences in implant success and failure rates were observed. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that hyaluronic acid injection before implantation can effectively reduce post-implantation pain and improve patient outcomes, with no significant adverse effects or complications. This approach represents a novel",

Patients with a stroke or TIA in the context of small vessel disease participated in the study. The ataxia was evaluated using four subtests of the Movement Intention Test by a blinded assessor, both at pre-treatment and 6 weeks after first treatment session. The intensity of ataxia in the upper and lower extremities was analyzed regarding a different level of experience. The effect of treatment was compared to another group with small-vessel disease without ataxia and a third non-patient group with small-vessel disease based on their scores of depression and anxiety. The patients with ataxia and non-patients were analyzed based on their lesion distribution. We also analyzed how the intensity of depression and anxiety influenced the treatment response.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEfficacy of Physiotherapy for Upper and Lower Limb Ataxia in Patients With Small Vessel Lesions- a Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nStroke, Transient Ischemic Attack, Ataxia, Parkinson's Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Behavioral: Physiotherapy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: All inclusion criteria are assessed at the first contact with the patient.

Treatment-naive participants with symptomatic ATTR-PN/CM will be randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous infusions of NTLA-2001 at 55 mg, 2:1 randomization 3:1 or placebo. The primary hypothesis of the study is that NTLA-2001 treatment is sufficient to reduce the rate of decline in the composite primary endpoint of change from baseline to Weeks 96 and 144 in the NT-proBNP and 6-minute walking distance (6MWD). 55 mg is the maximum therapeutic dose for ATTR-PN/CM based on pre-clinical data and a dose-ranging clinical trial previously conducted. In these studies, 55 mg was found to significantly reduce TTR protein in the blood compared to placebo. Other doses have been evaluated in an ATTR-CM only study. In ATTR-CM only studies, higher doses of NTLA-2001 were associated with increased rate of hepatic dysfunction. These higher doses have been shown to be better tolerated in ATTR-PN/CM when combined with vitamin A supplementation, resulting in long-term stability of LDL cholesterol. The 55 mg dose has been shown to also be well tolerated and have better liver safety profile in ATTR-PN/CM. This dose is well supported based on the previous studies using biomarkers and biopsy assessments.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nMulticenter, Double-blind, Randomized Study to Assess the Safety, Efficacy and Tol",

Their levels of depression (based on the PHQ\u20109 and DTSQ) and glycemic control (based on HbA1c levels) were assessed using a questionnaire. Results: Significant differences in PHQ\u20109 scores, DTSQ scores, and HbA1c levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were found between the depressed and nondepressed patients. A statistically significant positive correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.782, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) was found between the patients' PHQ\u20109 and DTSQ scores, indicating that the higher the patient's PHQ\u20109 score, the weaker their treatment satisfaction. A positive correlation between DTSQ scores and HbA1c levels was also found (r\u00a0=\u00a00.291, p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), indicating that the better the treatment satisfaction, the better the patients' glycemic control. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that depression in pediatric patients with Type\u00a01 diabetes is negatively associated with their glycemic control, suggesting that healthcare providers should consider depression treatment as part of their treatment approach in improving glycemic control.",

The use of hot air balloons to deliver local anesthesia is a new, promising development in this field. Hot air balloon (HAB) anesthesia is an advanced technique that allows the delivery of high concentrations of local anesthetics into a small volume of space around the nerve, leading to effective anesthesia and a significant reduction in the risk of ChPOP. However, compared to the traditional saline injection, it is not clear exactly how using a hot air balloon affects pain levels and the amounts of postoperative pain medications used. This study will investigate whether using a hot air balloon for local anesthesia reduces postoperative pain and pain medication use compared to saline injection during total knee replacement (TKR). The study will include forty adult patients who are candidates for TKR with ChPOP. In this interventional study, 20 patients in each group will be randomly assigned to receive either a hot air balloon or a standard saline injection during surgery. Both treatment groups will receive standard postoperative care, including pain medication and physical therapy. The study will last for a total of twelve weeks and will involve multiple follow-up visits to assess pain levels, pain medication use, and the patients' overall recovery. The study is innovative because it uses HAB anesthesia in conjunction with local anesthetic injection to prevent postoperative pain. It is also innovative because it uses a patient survey to evaluate postoperative pain and patient satisfaction with the method of local anesthetic injection.

Of particular interest was the difference in the rate of neutropenia reported by the two treatment arms. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly lower (5.6% versus 30.8%, P\u2009<\u20090.05), as was the requirement for prophylactic colony stimulating factor (5/62 versus 14/65). The response rate in the bevacizumab biosimilar arm was similar to that with Avastin(\u00ae) (11/62 versus 10/65). Two patient deaths in the trial were considered by the investigator to be due to disease progression. In conclusion, this bevacizumab biosimilar is well tolerated, easy to administer and has a comparable response rate as compared to the reference product.\n\nIntroduction\nApproximately 1 million patients worldwide with the metastatic form of lung cancer will require anti",

Now, could you please provide me with some details about the interventions used in your clinical trial? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nBACKGROUND SUMMARY AND RATIONALE The prevalence of shoulder arthroscopy has been rising 300% during the past 20 years, which is one of the most common orthopaedic surgeries. Shoulder arthroscopy involves multiple irrigation and suction cycles, thus there is a significant fluid shift into the extravascular compartment with a consequent risk of postoperative fluid volume overload and pulmonary complications (PE). However, due to the absence of a standard fluid management strategy during shoulder arthroscopy, 30% of patients develop symptomatic pulmonary edema (PPE), and postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are the cause of increased length of hospital stay and costs, and increased readmissions and morbidity. Thus, there is a need for developing a standard fluid management strategy without increasing adverse outcomes to decrease PPCs and costs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of different intraoperative fluid management strategies on hemodynamics and pulmonary complications in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial will enroll 162 adult patients of either sex undergoing shoulder arthroscopy. Participants will be randomly assigned to either liberal or restrictive fluid management strategies: the 'liberal' strategy group will receive iso-oncotic crystalloid solution to maintain a fluid balance goal of 10% above preoperative body weight during surgery, and the 'restrictive' strategy group will be managed with a fluid balance goal of 0-3% above preoperative body weight during surgery. Cardiovascular instability will be managed with either vasoactive drugs, or packed red blood cells, or vasopressin, or both. The primary outcome measure will be the development of symptomatic PPE. Cardiac biomarkers of myocardial injury, lung injury, renal injury, and electrolyte imbalances will be also assessed. Discussion Trial results will show which of the two intraoperative fluid management strategies",

Specifically, we propose to treat patients with elevated baseline plasma yKL-40 with methotrexate, as compared to placebo, to prevent disease progression and the development of erosive disease in RA. We speculate that patients with elevated yKL-40 are at higher risk for disease progression and may be good candidates for rapid and aggressive treatment to improve long-term outcomes.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Outcome of Early Intervention in RA Study (the ORBIT Study)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nRheumatoid Arthritis\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Methotrexate\n* Drug: Placebo\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Diagnosis of early RA based on 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria On no disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or treatment with the exception of glucocorticoids for symptomatic treatment of disease (maximum dose 10 mg/day, prednisone equivalent) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for malaria prophylaxis Elevated baseline plasma yKL-40 Exclusion Criteria: Use of concurrent medications that are contraindicated to methotrexate, including penicillamine, allopurinol, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or TNF inhibitors Known or suspected hypersensitivity to drugs containing glutaraldehyde, phenol, or formaldehyde (methotrexate) Positive screening laboratory tests: Urine pregnancy test or pregnancy Platelet count <",

T\u00fcbingen, Germany). The precise, computer-assisted intraoperative targeting and the minimally invasive approach of this intracerebrally applied laser technique are intended to provide high ablative accuracy and good clinical results in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The FIRST design replicates our institutional pilot trial. The sample size of 30 patients (one additional patient is added after interim analysis) will evaluate both safety and efficacy of infratentorial NaviFUS (Tuberositas LITT with Sparrow) vs. conventional technique of radiofrequency (RF) coagulation. In this multi-center, non-comparative, prospective, observational study, the primary objectives are safety (adverse events, adverse drug reactions, serious adverse events), and efficacy (seizure freedom rate).

Could you describe intervention/treatment components, such as the type, dose, and route of administration, as well as the schedule, duration, and follow-up? \n\nStudy\n=================\n\nOverview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nAcute and chronic pain is highly prevalent among Veterans with recent battle-related war injuries. The most prevalent combat injuries are traumatic limb injuries or traumas to the head. Currently, medications are widely used to treat combat related pain, but they have many limitations. Veterans receiving narcotics through Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) suffer from under treatment of their chronic pain, as well as negative physical and mental health outcomes due to the misuse of opioids, including: tolerance (higher doses to effectively control pain), hyperalgesia (intense pain to mild stimuli), impaired immune function, and cognitive impairment. This lack of effective pain medication is particularly problematic because combat related injuries are often associated with chronic pain, limiting rehabilitation, physical recovery and the resumption of normal duties. There is a clear need to develop new medications that can provide analgesia without the side effects associated with current opioid based treatments. There has been tremendous interest in the medicinal potential of cannabinoids as they present an alternative and potentially more effective method for the management of pain. These compounds exist in the body's endocannabinoid system, a system that is activated by external cannabinoids through the activation of the CB1 and CB2 receptors. They elicit several anti-nociceptive effects, suggesting a possible role for these receptor mediators in the treatment of pain. Recent evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid anandamide is released following tissue injury from surgical and chronic inflammatory pain stimuli in humans. In addition, studies have shown that repeated daily administration of exogenous anandamide exerts anti-nociceptive effects when administered at low doses. Anandamide is rapidly degraded by the enzyme FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase). Inhibition of this enzyme, could extend the duration of pain relief following acute injury and would therefore serve as a rationale for the use of FAAH inhibitors. However, FAAH inhibition results in increases in brain",

            "Abstract:\nOBJECTIVE: To identify reasons for early termination (ET) or not continuing to trial intervention after the first 6\u2010month appointment in the PATHS randomized, open\u2010label clinical trial.METHODS: One hundred sixty clinicians were randomized to either the usual care (UC) or a care\u2010management (CM)\u2010plus\u2010guideline intervention. The intervention included care managers implementing individualized action plans to achieve goals. We conducted qualitative interviews with 39 parents who had not responded to the first 6\u2010month CM appointment, 30 parents who terminated during the first 6 months, 10 parents who terminated after the first 6 months, and 29 parent advocates who worked with parents in CM. We employed a phenomenological approach using constant comparison analysis to develop patterns among and between the different interview groups.RESULTS: We identified 5 key themes: (1) parent experiences of stress leading to EMs; (2) parent experiences of stress as a barrier to responding to CM; (3) issues related to timing of the trial; (4) issues related to the CM intervention; and (5) issues related to the UC intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Parents had varying levels of stress that increased the likelihood of ET or nonresponse. Timing was a key factor in parent EMs, with some parents preferring the first 6 months to be a trial of the intervention, whereas others did not want to wait. Among the issues related to the CM intervention, parents were reluctant to open up to someone new. For parents on the UC randomization arm, the intervention did not align well with their parenting experiences and therefore was not particularly relevant for them. Based on our findings, we identified a number of strategies to improve enrollment and retention in CM."

However, there were no significant differences between acuities. To avoid potential effects of the natural history of rehabilitation, it is important to focus on acute\u2010phase stroke patients. Objective: To establish the feasibility of conducting a phase III randomized, controlled trial comparing functional use and upper limb function in acute\u2010phase stroke patients who were treated using either a MCDS or conventional rehabilitation exercises (CTRL). Method: The study is a pilot study that will focus on acute stroke patients. The patient groups will be randomized to either the CTRL group or MCDS group. Both groups will receive the same amount of rehabilitation exercise sessions, but the MCDS group will use MCDS for their rehabilitation exercises, which consists of wrist/forearm movement, whereas the CTRL group will use physiotherapy\u2010led exercises. Participants will be assessed at three clinical sessions, and the outcome measures will be the Fugl\u2010Meyer Motor Assessment \u2013 upper limb (UE) score, Action Research Arm Test, and functional use tests such as Box andBlocks Test, and nine\u2010hole peg test. The outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 weeks. Both groups will receive the same amount of rehabilitation physical therapy.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of septic shock, occurring in up to 40% of patients, and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. Despite intensive care and treatment with sepsis bundles, the prognosis for such patients remains poor.  In this setting, the early identification of those patients at risk of progressing to AKI may help guide appropriate individualized therapy to prevent or limit its development. \n\nRationale for the study: In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the role of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis-related AKI.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a coconut water supplement combined with dietary dark chocolate in the management of menstrual pain compared to nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in adolescent women (N = 50; 15\u201017 y) with primary dysmenorrhea. Methods: Participants were randomized into three groups: dark chocolate and coconut water supplementation (DM), dark chocolate supplementation (MC), and a control group receiving NSAIDs (NSAID). The study design included a baseline questionnaire regarding demographics, medical history, smoking, and daily oral contraceptive use, followed by one week of supplementation with or without NSAIDs. Participants recorded their pain scores and evaluated their levels of satisfaction using a standardized online questionnaire. Analyses included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and the post hoc Tukey and Kruskal\u2010Wallis tests. Results: The participants' mean age was 17 and the majority were adolescent women. Adolescents in the DM group reported lower levels of pain than those in the NSAID group (p = 0.002). The highest satisfaction with treatment was reported by those in the DM group. There were no statistically significant differences in the use of the supplements between adolescent women. However, satisfaction was positively related to pain intensity. Conclusion: Our study suggests that dark chocolate and coconut water supplementation could be an effective strategy for managing menstrual pain due to dysmenorrhea in adolescent women. Although the satisfaction scores were satisfactory in all participants, more research is needed to determine whether there is a link between pain intensity and the use of supplements with a possible synergistic effect.",

If they are allocated to the observation group, they will undergo imaging evaluation after 48 hours and surgery will be performed if the imaging shows appendicitis. Clinical tests will be performed throughout the study to monitor the patient's health and response to treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the duration of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures will include the occurrence of complications, patient satisfaction, and the cost-effectiveness of the treatment regimen.

Who is eligible for this study? \n\nStudy population\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nTumours of the adrenal gland are rare with the annual incidence per 100,000 being estimated as 0.6 males and 0.3 females. The most common tumours are adrenal cortical tumours such as adenoma (40-70%), adenocortical carcinoma (ACC) (30-40%) and pheochromocytoma (PCC) (10-18%). Clinical symptoms are either very suggestive for an underlying adrenocortical tumour or the diagnosis is established by chance due to abnormal findings on cross sectional imaging examinations, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the abdomen performed in patients with a variety of other abdominal or extra abdominal clinical problems. Diagnosis is usually established by biopsy, either percutaneous or by surgical biopsy. If possible surgical exploration is still the gold standard. However, in many patients adrenal tumour cannot be proven by biopsy and imaging findings are often insufficient for a reliable diagnosis. The main reasons may be the absence of distinct clinical features, or a non specific biologic profile of the adenoma. This is particularly the case with cortical benign neoplasms, which are often smaller than 3 cm, the biopsy yield is low and the biologic profile is similar to non neoplastic cortical tissue. The distinction between nodular hyperplasia, ectopic cortisol secreting tumour and adenoma is often difficult to make. In such cases medical therapy or surgical treatment without preoperative diagnosis is a debated topic. Several prospective randomized studies are ongoing to investigate the risk of recurrence after medical treatment with Mitotane alone versus Mitotane plus surgery. To date no prospective randomized study has been published investigating the outcome of surgical therapy versus follow-up with medical treatment with Mitotane alone for patients with ACC. This study aims to evaluate and compare the clinical outcome after radical surgical adrenalectomy versus follow-up with mitotane mon",

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided cholangioscopy (EUS-C) and cystogastro-duodenoscopy (EUS-CD) are effective for the treatment of gallstones and gallbladder cancer. Lumen apposing metal stent (LAMS) is associated with less postoperative pain and fewer complications compared with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting, but further studies are required to investigate EUS-C/EUS-CD guided LAMS in the treatment of gallbladder disease. However, these studies are still insufficient, and the diagnostic value and safety of LUMEN apposing metal stent guided cholangioscopy and cystogastro-duodenoscopy are still unknown, particularly its application in patients with a high risk of postoperative complications.

Breasts that are biopsy-proven benign are typically followed to make sure that there is no cancer present. PET may be able to determine which women with benign breast disease are truly benign (i.e., no cancer) and which women will need more evaluation for breast cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nFor the preliminary study, women 18 years of age or older with biopsy-proven benign breast disease will be eligible to participate. They will undergo a breast MRI, contrast-enhanced mammogram, PET scan, and MRI-guided biopsy to measure the accuracy of these studies in terms of their ability to detect small areas of breast cancer. The results will indicate whether these methods can successfully replace PET alone. This screening portion of the study will only be about 3 to 4 weeks in duration. Based on the results, we will have sufficient data to justify the cost and time of a full-scale study. Once the preliminary study is complete, these results will be shared with breast cancer scientists around the world and will play a major role in the design of a larger multi-center study. For the full-scale study, women 25 years of age or older with biopsy-proven benign breast disease will be eligible to participate. They will undergo a breast MRI, contrast-enhanced mammogram, and PET scan to determine which modality (MRI, mammogram, or PET scan) might be the most effective method. If a subject is found to have a high degree of suspicion (75 to 100%) of having breast cancer, based on the results of an initial PET scan, then biopsy will be performed unless no lesions are detected.

            "For the third study arm, we could consider an active intervention that uses the NovoTTF-200T device in combination with standard treatment. What do you think about that? \nBackground\n-----------------\nBrain metastasis represents a serious condition and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer, especially for those with advanced breast cancer . The estimated overall mortality rate for patients with brain metastasis is approximately 70% during the first 1-2 yrs, with a median survival time of 8-12 months . Patients with brain metastasis are typically first managed with a combination of radiation therapy and surgery . There have been significant advances in tumor management in recent years, but limited treatment modalities are available to effectively treat brain metastases. Patients with leptomeningeal disease involving the spinal cord may have significant neurological deficits, reduced quality of life (QOL), functional impairment, and premature death . Although there is no standard of care for treating brain metastases, several studies have demonstrated the potential benefit of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) (or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) ) . NovoTTF-200T 1 (optune) is a tumor-treating fields (TTF) device that uses low-intensity alternating electric fields to disrupt mitosis, resulting in arrested cell division and cell death. NovoTTF-200T 1 is FDA-approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma , gliosarcoma , and malignant melanoma . Preliminary data suggest that NovoTTF-200T 1 may be an effective treatment for patients with leptomeningeal metastases of the spine. The present study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study that will include 15 patients who have previously received WBRT/SRS treatment but continue to have leptomeningeal metastases of the spine in patients with recurrent breast cancer. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NovoTTF-200T 1 in these patients.\n\nTrial design\nThe current study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm trial that will enroll 15 patients with le",

Secondary endpoints will be determined using TCD and transcranial near infrared spectroscopy (TNIRS). Other secondary outcomes will include clinical outcomes including duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.  Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) - to evaluate the effect of lowering cerebrospinal pressure in the management of refractory intracranial hypertension. Transcranial near infrared spectroscopy (TNIRS) - to detect the threshold of increased risk of cerebral hypoperfusion with reduced intracranial pressure. \n\nAbstract\n=================\n\nBackground\n-----------------\nIntracranial hypertension (ICH) is the most common cause of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). It occurs in 30-55% of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is associated with adverse patient outcomes including an increased risk of mortality and impaired neurologic outcomes. Raised ICP increases oxygen demand and decreases cerebral perfusion pressure, while increased cerebral oxygen demand may increase intracranial oxygen requirements. Although therapeutic interventions have been established for ICH, the ideal target ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure has not been adequately determined. Previous studies have proposed guidelines for the ICP, with different target ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure recommendations for various patient care scenarios.

            "Not a problem. Have a nice day!\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis proposal aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pro-biotics after liver surgery on ICU patients' outcome and microbiota. A Prospective, randomized, double blind clinical trial will be performed.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nRationale: The management of severe sepsis and intra-abdominal infections in patients after liver surgery requires the use of wide antibiotic spectrum antibiotics. Recent findings about human microbiota, especially the gut microbiota, and its strong interaction with various tissues and systems, are starting to shed new light on a potential pathogenetic pathway leading from intestinal epithelium damage to multiorgan dysfunction. The gut-liver axis is emerging as a major actor in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, and gut permeability and translocation to the liver and systemic circulation have been linked to clinical outcomes in patients with major hepatic or abdominal surgery. This suggests that strategies targeting modulation of the gut microbiota could represent a new approach to prevent sepsis. As yet, no RCTs have investigated the effect of orally administered probiotics on SIRS and sepsis induced by various surgical techniques. Moreover, the optimal moment to treat and the best period of treatment is still unknown. A Prospective, randomized, double blind clinical trial will be performed. The study outcomes are ICU length of stay, organ dysfunction, hospital length of stay and mortality. The investigators hypothesize that the probiotic therapy will reduce the incidence of gut permeability, SIRS, sepsis and organ dysfunction, with a consequent reduction in the ICU length of stay, and an improvement in clinical outcomes and mortality.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nProphylactic Treatment of Probiotics in Patients After Hepatectomy - RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE BLIND PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nLiver Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Probiotic\n* Other: Control group\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria"

Will it last for more than an hour? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe aim of this prospective, multi-site trial is to study the surgical characteristics of laparoscopic antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (LRAMPS) and laparoscopic en-bloc pancreatoduodenectomy (LEPC) and to compare the clinical outcomes after the two procedures in terms of hospital stay, complications and mortality in an Asian population.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nLRAMPS was first described by Rene Tome in Belgium in 2010. It is a technique of pancreatosplenectomy that allows pancreatic cancer or benign lesions that occur on the left (i.e., more than 75% of the pancreas) to be resected en-bloc. It is performed in three parts: the spleen (splenectomy), left pancreas followed by splenectomy and the posterior wall of the stomach and pancreatoduodenectomy (PDD)/pancreatectoduodenectomy (PD) is performed during the second part. The last and final step is the reconstruction with duodeno-gastrojejunostomy (DG) and gastroduodenostomy (GD). In contrast, for patients with right or central pancreatic lesions, we will perform LEP for en-bloc resection. In recent series, LEP has been shown to have better oncological outcomes than LP due to better lymph node resection. LRAMPS has been performed more than 3000 times worldwide, and the 5-year survival rate of low-risk pancreatic cancer patients (stage A/B) is about 72%, which is comparable to those of LP and LEP . There is some difference in operative time between the two groups, which may lead to faster postoperative recovery and more rapid mobilization. In this study, we will compare the surgical characteristics of LRAMPS and LEP in terms of tumor location and surgical outcomes in terms of operative time, length of stay, complications, and long-term survival.",

Now, let's discuss the secondary endpoints. What secondary endpoints will be evaluated in the study? \nSure. The secondary endpoints are as follows: \n1) R0 resection rate; \n2) Major complications rate; \n3) Disease-free survival; \n4) Postoperative hospital stay, number of inpatients with postoperative complications, etc. \nFor endpoint 1, we will evaluate this based on the presence or absence of tumor growth after surgery. \nFor endpoint 2, we will use Clavien-Dindo classification to determine complications. \nFor endpoint 3, we will adopt RECIST guidelines to evaluate the disease-free survival. \nWe will also evaluate other endpoint items, such as postoperative hospital stay, the number of inpatients with postoperative complications, etc. \nGreat, these details will help in the analysis of the study. \nNow, let's discuss the endpoint assessment process.

The study will be conducted at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging in a randomized, parallel, double-blind controlled study, including measurements of physiological markers (blood glucose, insulin, GLP-1, PYY, cholecystokinin, ghrelin, and leptin) at different time-points in a subgroup of subjects. The measurements will be performed during a three-hour test period and participants are asked to abstain from all food and beverage except for water. Participants will be served meals of 40%, 50%, 60%, or 70% fat and will be asked to rate their satiety.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nObesity is a common and multifactorial disease characterized by an increase in fat mass that is associated with decreased life expectancy and adversely affects the quality of life and health. Obesity often develops due to increased food intake, leading to weight gain and ultimately obesity. Increased energy intake due to larger portion sizes, unhealthy snacking, low levels of physical activity, increased consumption of sweet snacks or beverages are all factors that may contribute to the development of obesity in society. Increased fat consumption is considered as a risk factor for obesity and weight gain, however, little is known about how high-fat meals affect appetite and satiety and whether this is different in healthy lean and overweight or obese individuals. The purpose of this study is to examine if fat increases appetite or suppresses satiety to a different extent in healthy lean and overweight or obese older adults. By better understanding this relationship, we hope to improve dietary guidelines, thus increasing the overall health of older adults.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nFood Choice and Gastrointestinal Hormones in Older Adults\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nObesity\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: high-fat-meal",

            "That sounds like a well-planned placebo comparator arm. Now, let's add another arm to the study design: experimental: Colchicine + Tacrolimus Comparator: Control (Placebo + Tacrolimus)\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Dupilumab induces T\u2010cell differentiation in lymphoid tissue by blocking interleukin\u20104 receptor signaling, causing a reduction in type\u20102 biomarker levels. However, T\u2010cell\u2010triggered airway damage and tissue remodeling continue in spite of low serum levels of IL\u20104 and IL\u201013 despite suppression of their production. Thus, the authors designed this study to clarify whether combining dupilumab with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), tacrolimus, will be able to maintain lung homeostasis in the setting of eosinophil\u2010induced airway diseases. Methods: The authors studied C57BL/6\u2010background mice, treated with dupilumab alone or in combination with tacrolimus to compare the effect of the two groups. The expression of pulmonary cytokines and biomarkers was determined by PCR and ELISA. Transcriptome analysis was conducted on the lungs using RNA sequencing. For evaluation of T cells, CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells were isolated from the pulmonary tissue to test for changes in infiltration, activation, and expression of Th2\u2010related genes. The authors also evaluated the effect of the treatments on IL\u20109 secretion from Th2 cells in a Th2 cell\u2013induced lung\u2010nest lung homograft transplantation (LHTC) model with C57BL/6 (H\u20102b)\u2010background mice using a CBA/J (H\u20102k) lung as an allograft. Lung transplantation was performed in the presence of the anti\u2010interleukin (IL)\u201015 antibody, a stimulating cytokine for IL\u20109 expression in Th2 cells. Results: Dupilumab did not change the Th2 cells infiltration or the level of Th2\u2010related genes. The combination of tacrolimus and dupilumab blocked not only the release of eosinophilic and Th2\u2010"

            "Excellent. Now, let's move on to the criteria for participant inclusion and exclusion.",
            "Thank you for providing such detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Now, let's discuss the design details of your trial.",
            "That's a well-designed study. Now, let's focus on creating the study arms. We have two options: Experimental: Colchicine and Placebo Comparator: Control (Placebo). Let's start with the experimental arm.",
            "That sounds good. Now, let's move on to the placebo comparator arm. Can you provide the details for this arm?",
            "Excellent job! Here are the full study arms:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. Experimental: Colchicine\n- Participant Group/Arm: Experimental: Colchicine\n- Intervention/Treatment: Patients in this arm will receive colchicine starting from the evening before the surgical procedure until the third postoperative day, following a specific dosing schedule.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator: Control (Placebo)\n- Participant Group/Arm: Placebo Comparator: Control (Placebo)\n- Intervention/Treatment: Patients in this arm will undergo the same perioperative procedures and treatment as the experimental group, with the only difference being the administration of a placebo instead of colchicine. The dosing schedule of the placebo will mimic that of the colchicine group.\n\nIs there anything else I can assist you with?"
