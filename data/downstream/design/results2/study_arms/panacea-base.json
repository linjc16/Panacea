Goodbye!\n\n2023-05-17\n\nAbstract:\nRecent reports indicate that the incidence of peritonitis is relatively high with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Our aim was to determine risk factors for peritonitis in a randomized, controlled CAPSANA study. A total of 848 patients were prospectively randomized in order to receive either high\u2010volume or standard volume (HD and SD) CAPD. There were no significant differences in the incidence of peritonitis (38 and 42 episodes in the SD and high dialysate volume (HDV) groups, respectively) and mortality (9 and 12%, respectively) after a follow\u2010up period of 36 months. Of all patient records (n = 3,941), 348 episodes of peritonitis (incidence 79/1,000 catheter\u2010years) were registered. Independent predictors for peritonitis were type of fluid used (relative risk ratio [RRR] 5.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32\u201022.78, P = 0.02) and the use of systemic steroids (hazard ratio [HR] 2.85, 95% CI 1.39\u20105.84, P = 0.004). Risk of peritonitis was higher in female gender (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.98\u20101.54, P = 0.09), diabetes (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.88\u20101.54, P = 0.28), older (> or = 50 years) (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.82\u20101.45, P = 0.49) and HDV group. The risk ratio of peritonitis was also higher after the first 1,000 dialysate\u2010years (RRR 1.40 (CI 1.05\u20101.88), P = 0.02)."

            "Thank you very much for your reply. Could you please explain to me the primary objective of your study and research questions? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCognitive changes, depression and anxiety are very evident during stroke and recovery periods. They can increase mortality and morbidity of stroke. Many of them can be related to cerebral infarction which may be treated by thrombolysis. So, the purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a significant change in the clinical characteristics of stroke patients after thrombolysis. The data collection will continue over a period of 3 months (Jul - Nov). The researchers will record the severity of cognitive symptoms of patients receiving thrombolysis, the duration of time they are in the hospital, and the changes in the psychological wellbeing of patients during their stay at the hospital. In the case of patient death, the family will be asked to complete our questionnaire. The clinical scores of the patients before and after thrombolysis will be compared. According to research by Lee and others in Taiwan in 2009, anxiety symptoms of patients after thrombolysis were lower compared to symptom severity prior to treatment. Also, in a study by Kroenke et al in 1998, 1 in 6 people between the ages of 18 and 65 in the United States was depressed or had depression symptoms.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nStroke is a major cause of health care costs and medical disability, so the number of studies is increasing rapidly. In contrast to acute neurological symptoms such as acute motor paralysis in stroke survivors, most patients have sequelae from cognitive impairment and mood-related symptoms in particular. Therefore, there is a need to assess cognitive symptoms, mood and emotional changes of patients to improve their quality of life. Thrombolytic therapy should be carried out in the emergency room, but it is not commonly administered due to a lack of awareness or poor compliance. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of thrombolysis on the clinical characteristics of stroke patients. In the case of death, the family will be asked to complete our questionnaire. The clinical characteristics of patients before and after thrombolysis and the factors affecting the clinical characteristics were also explored. The data collection will be performed by a trained nurse on admission and discharge.",

Methods: A prospective study was conducted at a University Hospital over a 24 months period. The study population included the subacute and acute stroke patients, according to the guidelines of the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which were admitted from January 2018 to December 2019. These criteria included the age 18 to 85 years and the absence of a history of stroke. The NIHSS was done at admission. Also, the patient history and examination findings were recorded. The patients\u2019 files were reviewed 3 months after discharge to see what are the most common medical complications and the rate of favorable outcome. Result: The study included 107 patients, the first two months of observation are the acute stages, and the next 10 months are the subacute stages. It showed a great number of medical complications, including pneumonia (56%), urinary tract infection (34.4%), sepsis (25.2%) followed by cerebral edema (1.8%) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (1.8%) as the worst complication. Pneumonia and urinary tract infection represent (80.8%), a great percentage of total complications. The total number of favorable outcomes for the acute patients is 55%, and the ones for the subacute patients is 31%. The NIHSS score significantly correlates to the most common medical complications and the favorable outcome. Conclusion: Acute stroke is the most common neurological emergency. The NIHSS score correlates to medical complications and the percentage of a good outcome. It is a strong tool for stratifying the severity of stroke.",

Background Data: After a stroke, patients often suffer from mobility disorders such as poor posture and reduced postural stability. The goal of our study is to find out if there is a difference between exercise and manipulation in improving the stability and posture of individuals suffering from a stroke. Methods: This research is a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups. The trial participants are patients between the ages of 18 and 75 who have had a stroke at least six months ago, can walk without assistance for at least 10 meters, and have a minimum score of 15 on the Mini\u2010Mental Status Test. Each individual will be randomly assigned to either the control group or either the exercise group or the exercise/Manip group, depending on a randomization schedule. The exercise group will undergo an intervention consisting of stretching, strengthening, and functional exercises. The exercise and Manip group will undergo an intervention consisting of stretching, strengthening, functional and Manip exercises.

However, it is still a matter of debate as to whether such a mechanism exists and if it affects clinical outcomes. AIM: Evaluate the potential association between vitamin D status and PPI use with fracture occurrence in elderly men from the Prevention with FeO and tRobolx IbUPROfen Effectiveness (PREFORMA) trial. METHODS: An ancillary substudy from the randomised controlled PREFORMA trial was performed in a subset of male participants (n = 346) aged 50\u201069 years enrolled in primary care. 25\u2010hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum levels were measured at baseline and fractures were self\u2010reported at one year of follow\u2010up.RESULTS: Baseline vitamin D levels were normal in most men (97.7%); mean (SD) serum vitamin D was 66.2 \u00b1 20.9 nmol/L in men who used PPI (n = 100) and 69.7 \u00b1 24.8 nmol/L in men who did not (n = 250). Fractures (n = 25) occurred in both PPI users and non\u2010users in a comparable manner (RR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.48\u20101.70). Low vitamin D status at baseline was not associated with increased risk of fracture (RR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.40\u20101.73).CONCLUSION: Vitamin D levels were not associated with fracture occurrence, irrespective of PPI use. These findings refute the hypothesis of a potential mechanistic link between PPI use and vitamin D\u2010mediated fracture risk in elderly men.",

            "Virtual Tai Chi Easy, or VTCE, is based on the traditional mind-body exercise, Tai Chi Easy. VTCE was previously tested in people with opioid use disorder and chronic pain. Research suggests VTCE helps decrease opioid use in those managing chronic pain. In addition, practicing tai chi has been shown to decrease anxiety. The VTCE program focuses on 4 main movements that are designed to focus inward, so the benefits of tai chi are achieved in a short time. VTCE is designed to be accessible from any location with an internet connection and can be practiced from the comfort of one\u2019s environment at home. We believe the low cost and potential efficacy of this intervention for reducing opioid dose in the general population suggest that it would be beneficial for people experiencing opioid use disorder.

            "I see. How does the treatment work? \n\nAbstract:\nThirty to 40% of all lung cancers are peripheral, with a majority arising in the lower lobes. When diagnosed early, peripheral stage I non\u2010small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) have excellent long\u2010term survival after resection. Although surgical resection offers a curative approach in many patients, it is invasive and potentially morbid. Minimally invasive strategies such as robotic\u2010assisted bronchoscopic (RAB) laser ablation (LABA) of NSCLC lesions have been developed to reduce morbidity while achieving complete tumor ablation. However, the recurrence rates for minimally invasive ablation are higher than for surgery. Herein we report the results of a phase 1 clinical trial using Padeliporfin, a second\u2010generation photosensitizer with good uptake in solid tumors. After successful robotic access of peripheral lung lesions, intra\u2010tumoral injection of PadDelPorfin, followed by IV injection of PadDelPorfin and subsequent intraluminal laser ablation, 5 of 6 patients undergoing Padeliporfin vascular targeted photodynamic (VTP) ablation were disease\u2010free 10 months after treatment, with a single recurrence outside the ablated volume successfully treated. This promising approach for treatment of stage I peripheral NSCLC provides a high probability of local control while potentially sparing patients the morbidity and mortality of surgery.",

The operating time between using a conventional bimanual operating method and using the novel image stabiliser was recorded at different stages of the procedure. Twenty\u2010five VRS were randomly allocated to each group. The operating time for each stage of the scleral buckling procedure was calculated as a percentage of the total procedure time.RESULTS: The mean operating time was shorter in the image stabiliser group at each stage of the scleral buckling procedure (P=0.015). There was no learning effect on operating time for the VRS in the bimanual operating method group (P=0.451). However, there was a significant reduction in operating time from the beginning to the end of the procedure for the VRS in the image stabiliser group (r=\u20100.991, P=0.039).CONCLUSIONS: Use of the novel image stabiliser (iSorb, OCULUS) enables a reduction in surgery time, especially at the beginning of the procedure, compared to a conventional bimanual operating method."

Comparing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms treated with EVAR to those treated with a CT-Scan procedure will allow us to see if there are any differences in the outcomes, such as aneurysmal volume changes and graft migration. Now, I'd like to ask about the sample size. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The current guidelines recommend yearly CT\u2010scan examination of aortic stent\u2010grafts to detect graft\u2010migration and other complications. These examinations are time\u2010consuming and expose the patient to increased radiation dose. A non\u2010invasive device that allows reliable estimation of aneurysmal volume and graft migration without irradiation might contribute to decreasing surveillance protocols and could improve cost\u2010effectiveness. Purpose: To compare semi\u2010automated analysis by anatomical landmarks with a dedicated fully automated software in 400 infra\u2010renal aortic stent\u2010grafts over a 5\u2010year period versus a simple circumference measurement in 200 aortic stent\u2010grafts, to measure stent\u2010graft migration, to determine the feasibility and interobserver reproducibility. Methods: One hundred patients with an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm treated with an endovascular aortic repair in the past year were selected: Fifty of them with a dedicated fully automated analysis using a software that detects geometric landmarks of the stent\u2010graft (Vessel Navi; Volumetric S.r.l., Rome, Italy). For the other 50 patients we performed an external\u2010vessel reconstruction by an orthogonal segmentation without automatic detection of vascular wall and lumen contours (Medipix, Milano, Italy). A dedicated software (EVE) superimposes previous images and calculates the volume difference. Results: Analysis of both datasets was realized by an expert surgeon and a senior radiologist. In 18.5% our algorithm failed to detect the aneurysm and we had to resort to the segmentation, and in 21% of cases, the landmarks of the stent\u2010grafts were lost for both methods. The algorithm was able to correctly identify all anatomical landmarks of the stent\u2010graft but failed to reconstruct the vessel",

Thanks for your help!\n\n\nStudy\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nBackground and Scientific Rationale Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a life-threatening respiratory condition characterized by repetitive partial or complete airway obstruction that occurs during sleep and has serious implications for human health. Currently, OSA is the world's fastest-growing chronic disease but is understudied and underdiagnosed. It is estimated that up to 25% of adults over 30 years of age are affected worldwide. OSA often leads to impaired daytime functioning and impaired cognition. It is responsible for the increased risk of car accidents and is associated with obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment and stroke. Studies have shown that about 85% of people with OSA have obesity, which further exacerbates the condition. Obstructive sleep apnea is also associated with an increased risk of death. Current treatment options for OSA include lifestyle changes such as weight loss, the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, surgery to remove obstructions in the upper airway, and lifestyle interventions to prevent weight gain and obesity. However, adherence to these treatments is often low, and there is a need for more effective treatment options. Emerging technology and research have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to improve cognitive functioning and symptoms in individuals with OSA. tDCS is a form of neurostimulation that involves delivering a low-level electrical current to the brain to modulate brain activity and improve cognitive functioning. Previous studies have shown that tDCS improves cognitive functioning in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. In individuals with OSA, tDCS has been shown to improve measures of alertness, sleepiness, and cognitive functioning. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of tDCS in the treatment of OSA. Objectives The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation training (CRT) and tDCS as a treatment option for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Specifically, the study will examine the changes in cognitive functioning, quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and adherence to treatment,",

            "Abstract:\nBackground and Purpose: In response to increasing recognition of the importance of the intestinal microbiome in health and disease, human gut microbiota transplantation trials are increasingly being used to study human microbiome in health and disease. This study utilized prebiotic fibre, inulin, as a form of gut microbiota transplantation to investigate the effect of microbiome manipulation in chronic inflammatory disease. It aimed to identify microbiome signatures following gut microbiota transplantation, to examine whether such signatures affect disease outcomes, and to assess the effects of gut microbiota transplantation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Twelve patients with active disease (disease activity score (DAS28) >3.2) participated in a single centre randomised controlled trial. After a washout period, participants consumed one of two supplements for four weeks: inulin or a placebo. Faecal samples were collected at baseline, four weeks and at 12 weeks. The DAS28 score was assessed at week zero and 12. An intestinal microbiome was profiled by next\u2010generation sequencing using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing, and the data were statistically analysed. The impact of the transplanted microbial signatures on RA disease activity was determined using a probabilistic Bayesian approach. Results: There was a significant decrease in DAS28 at 12 weeks compared with baseline. The baseline gut microbiome composition of two patients who achieved remission differed from those patients who did not; one patient had an increased abundance of Enterococcacea family while another had a greater abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila. No differences in the gut microbiome composition at the end of four and 12 weeks were seen in those patients who achieved clinical improvement or not. Conclusion: Although the overall population demonstrated a trend towards clinical improvement, this change was not associated with a detectable change in the gut microbiome. Further investigation of the role of selected commensals in rheumatoid arthritis is warranted.\n\n1.

The third study arm will include participants with the HEXB2 gene who will take the placebo, and the fourth study arm will include participants with the HEXB2 variant who will also receive the placebo. Does this make sense? \nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis is an innovative clinical trial that tests the effects of diet, exercise, and other lifestyle factors on depression and metabolic syndrome by measuring the effects on molecular phenotypes (proteins) and metabolites. Patients will be randomized to one of two different lifestyle interventions for 12 weeks and then will return to usual care for another 6 months.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nLevels of the HEXB2 gene's product (FBP-26) are associated with major depressive disorder/unipolar depression (MDD/ UD) and also with metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is a cluster of disorders associated with both MDD and UD and involves high blood pressure, high and bad cholesterol, obesity, and insulin resistance. FBP-26 causes insulin resistance by inhibiting phosphofructokinase, one of the key enzymes involved in the metabolism of sugar into energy. We theorize that lowering FBP-26 concentrations with changes in lifestyle can improve the blood sugar-insulin system and potentially alleviate the negative effects of MetS. This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial will allow us to test for the first time the hypothesis that reduced FBP-26 levels due to a program of lifestyle changes improves blood sugar levels, weight, fat distribution, and depression in subjects at risk for MetS. MetS is increasingly recognized as a leading cause of depression in older adults and causes morbidity and mortality. The trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial of a diet and exercise intervention.

Forty biopsy\u2010proven chronic, HCV (HCV) antibody\u2010positive, HCV RNA\u2010positive patients who received standard\u2010of\u2010care therapy between February 1993 and February 1996 were included. Fifty\u2010one biopsy\u2010proven patients who received HCV treatment between November 2003 and October 2005 with or without concurrent anticirrhotic therapy were prospectively enrolled. Patients were followed up until December 31, 2006. The prevalence of HPH was higher in patients treated before 2000 (63.6%) than it was in patients treated after 2000 (25%; P = 0.0001). The development of HPH decreased with the introduction of peginterferon alfa\u20102a alone (25%) and therapy with peginterferon alfa\u20102a plus ribavirin (10%; P = 0.0008). HCV treatment with boceprevir\u2010containing triple therapy was also associated with decreased HPH development but was not significant (13%; P = 0.7). The HPH development rate was lower in patients with baseline alanine aminotransferase \u22645 times the upper limit of normal (UUN) (20%) than in those with liver dysfunction (HPH prevalence 83.3%; P < 0.0001). However, the presence of liver dysfunction at the time of treatment initiation was not associated with HPH development (P = 0.83).

The HCC patients received targeted drug therapy and immunotherapy followed by radical treatment of radical surgery or ablative therapy were included in the research. The results of the trials were encouraging and effective. This clinical study intends to apply the treatment of advanced unresectable HCC patients, including chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors for conversion treatment to transform the advanced unresectable HCC patients from unresectable to resectable, and finally perform radical resection or interventional treatment to prolong the survival time of HCC patients.

            "Alright. Thank you for providing the information. Now, let's move on to the endpoints. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground and Aims. Fibromyalgia is a complex syndrome that affects women more often than men. Previous studies showed that physical interventions such as aerobic or resistance training have no positive effect on fibromyalgia symptoms. We hypothesized that combined aerobic and strength training are feasible and effective in women with fibromyalgia. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of 12\u2010weeks of combined aerobic and strenght training in patients with fibromyalgia. Material and Methods. The study included 30 women with fibromyalgia, aged from 18 to 55 years. The participants performed 40\u2010minute training 2 times a week during 4 months. An aerobic session consisted of moderate\u2010intensity treadmill walking, elliptical training, or stationary bicycling, while a strength\u2010training session consisted of exercises performed on aerobics and step platforms, resistance bands, and free weight. Before and after the sessions, participants' perception of pain, health\u2010related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and physical abilities were evaluated. The pre and post\u2010sessions were compared using the unpaired t test. Results. We found significant improvement in the overall score of visual analog scale for pain and overall health scale score of Short\u2010Form 36, and significant reduction in the scores of Beck Depression Inventory\u2010II in the group of women with fibromyalgia following the sessions. Conclusion. Combined aerobic and resistance training improved women's perception of pain and mood and overall well\u2010being. Further research is indicated to verify the effects of this type of combined training program on symptoms of fibromyalgia among women.",

Now, how long do you expect the trial to last? \n\nStudy type\n=================\nObservational\n\nIntervention\n=================\nCurrent interventions as of 16 September 2022:\nThe Rapid Mood Screener (RMS) is an easy-to-use and practical algorithm for major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, and schizophrenia that healthcare providers can use to quickly and accurately diagnose and assess these conditions. It will be applied by the providers and the questionnaires will be collected from the participants.RMS data will be summarized and reviewed.\n\nBrief summary in scientific language\n=================\nThe screening process for depression that takes place in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics is time-consuming and relies on self-reporting by the patient, which may lead to a false diagnosis. If these problems can be overcome, it might lead to more timely and accurate treatment of mental health illnesses that require prompt attention to avoid complications.To address this concern, we developed the Rapid Mood Screener (RMS), a practical method to aid healthcare providers in diagnosing mental illnesses, including major depressive disorder, bipolar 1 depression, and schizophrenia through a single set of questions. Although this paper is specific to bipolar 1 depression, there are plans to develop it to accommodate other psychiatric conditions, and potentially generalizable it for use in primary care settings.In this project, we will apply the RMS to adult participants with a primary complaint of depressive symptoms in a community psychiatry clinic and compare its accuracy to self-reporting by the patient during the visit. To validate the RMS, we will compare its results to a gold standard diagnosis using an established diagnostic questionnaire, a clinical diagnostic interview, and a mood disorder diagnostic interview. We hypothesize that the RMS will be more accurate in diagnosing depression and other mental health illnesses than self-reporting by the patient.The application of the RMS can help healthcare providers quickly diagnose and accurately assess individuals with depression, bipolar depression, and schizophrenia using a set of easy-to-use questions. This approach can result in more timely and accurate treatment for mental health illnesses that require prompt attention to avoid complications.\n\nHealth condition or problem studied\n=================",

Because Hispanic women experience cultural, health literacy, language and socioeconomic barriers to navigating cancer care, they often face inequities in accessing high-quality care. The long-term goal of this project is to decrease barriers to navigating breast cancer care and improving the health outcomes and quality of life for Hispanic women. This goal will be achieved by addressing cancer care-related challenges and enhancing social and economic determinants of health (SEHDs) and health related quality of life (HRQOL) for Hispanic breast cancer patients. The program will implement linguistically and culturally appropriate interventions to meet SEHDs and provide social and emotional support.

Eligible patients with LES aged greater than 18 years were identified by the presence of LES in the Electronic Medical record (EMR) and/or using a self-reported language survey. The project was implemented in two phases, pilot followed by scale-up. Specific aims included 1) designing linguistically, culturally and functionally-specific materials of the patient encounter process, 2) evaluating the preliminary impact of the interventions on patients, providers and hospital staff, 3) establishing procedures for patient/family education regarding community and medical translation and interpretation services. In the pilot phase, the project was implemented in the emergency department and 2 non-procedural clinics within the HHS.

Methods: Twenty\u2010six patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) were randomized to use different walking assist devices and completed the same gait training program: 30\u2010minutes daily exercise. The patients used each device in a random order for 3 months on each limb. Ten healthy volunteers were also recruited as a baseline group. The 6\u2010Minute Walk Test, 30\u2010Second Sit\u2010to\u2010Stand Test, and Walking Ability Test\u201012 (WAT\u201012) were used in both SCI and healthy groups. Isokinetic muscle dynamometry (Nicholas Muscle Dynamometer, JTECH medical, CA, USA) was used to assess the maximum strength of both lower limbs in 4 protocols: concentric contractions with flexion of knee and hip joints, and eccentric contractions with hyperextension of knee and hip joints with a 10\u2010second interval for each item. The walking velocity and metabolic cost index were also assessed during the walking trial. Results: Maximum strength of the lower limbs in the 4 protocols was significantly higher in healthy volunteers than in the SCI groups. Maximum walking velocity and 6\u2010minute walking distance were significantly lower in the SCI groups than in the healthy volunteers. Conclusion: Lower\u2010limb strength is the major factor affecting gait ability in SCI patients. The ankle\u2010foot orthosis effectively assisted walking in the patient with SCI, but it was limited to a narrow walking path. The lower\u2010limb exoskeleton and robotic walker have the potential for assisting walking in patients with lower\u2010limb weakness",

The most recent American College of Emergency Physicians clinical policy statement on alcohol intoxication, published in 2015, includes management principles that focus on treating alcohol intoxication in a timely manner, determining intentionality, screening for suicide risk, and arranging for follow\u2010up care. There is growing interest in the use of the Benzodiazepine Agonist/Antagonist Lofexidine to reduce the risk of violence and alcohol\u2010related hospital admissions. The goal of this study is to determine the role of Lofexidine in the management of patients who present to the emergency department with alcohol intoxication. Our objective is to perform a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and conduct a meta\u2010analysis comparing the effect of Lofexidine therapy versus placebo or standard care in adult patients who present to the emergency department with alcohol intoxication. We plan to search PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE from the earliest date available to March 2022. Two researchers will independently screen the identified citations, abstracts, and full papers. All conflicts will be resolved by a third reviewer. Two researchers will independently extract data using a standardized form and perform a meta\u2010analysis using random\u2010effects models. The primary outcomes will be violence and police involvement, and the secondary outcomes will be alcohol\u2010related hospital admissions and time to resolution of alcohol intoxication. This study will help determine the role of Lofexidine therapy in the management of patients who present to the emergency department with alcohol intoxication, and whether this therapy can provide additional benefit in reducing the risk of violence and alcohol\u2010related hospital admissions. We believe this is an important area of research that can help improve the management of patients with alcohol intoxication and reduce emergency department resource utilization",
            "Yes, it is vital to have a control group for comparison purposes. We can move on to designing the study arms. The third arm, Active Comparator: Combined Museum intervention, includes participants who will undergo a combined museum intervention for six weeks. The combined intervention involves weekly museum visits in groups of 10 participants, with both a well-being museum mediator and a classic museum volunteer guide trained in art history. Do you think a multi-treatment approach would be beneficial for this study?",

The first arm, Experimental: Well-Being Museum intervention, includes participants who will undergo a well-being museum intervention for six weeks. The well-being intervention involves weekly museum visits in groups of 10 participants, with the support of a museum mediator. The mediator helps participants develop a personal and sensitive understanding of artworks by encouraging the expression of feelings, impressions, and interpretations. This approach aims to foster a more subjective engagement with the artwork. What do you think about this arm?",
            "That's a valid concern. A smaller group size might allow for more focused and individualized discussions. Perhaps we can consider reducing the group size to 5 participants in future studies. For this particular trial, we can keep the group size at 10 to maintain consistency with the classic intervention arm. Does that sound reasonable?",
            "Great. Now, let's move on to the second arm, Active Comparator: Classic Museum intervention. This arm includes participants who will undergo a classic museum intervention for six weeks. The classic intervention involves weekly museum visits in groups of 10 participants, guided by a volunteer guide trained in art history. The guide provides information about art pieces, the artist, and the historical context of the artwork without influencing the participants' discussions or interpretations. This arm serves as the control group to compare the effects of the well-being intervention. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "I agree. Having a control group will provide valuable insights into the unique benefits of engaging with art in a more personal and subjective manner.

In the first-in-human, Phase 1 open-label clinical study, REGN2810 (cemiplimab) monotherapy resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 15.4% (95% [CI]: 3, 30), in a population of PD-L1-positive, advanced NSCLC patients (n = 49). Although, the effect of REGN2810 was modest, it was well tolerated and there were no associated deaths. There is considerable evidence supporting the use of platinum-containing chemotherapy in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapies with a 1-year survival of 13.9% in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy alone. A subsequent trial with combination PD-1/PD-L1/platinum therapy resulted in a response rate of 56% (95% CI: 35, 75) in patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-L1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab, followed by maintenance pembrolizumab. The ORR for the approved anti-PD-L1 inhibitor nivolumab is 29% (95% CI: 24, 35).

Good luck with the trial!\n\n1.Introduction\nIn this paper, we propose a model that incorporates a linear-linear model and a linear-Emax model. First, we used a linear-linear model to investigate the dose-response relationship of the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawal events. Second, we used a linear-Emax model to investigate the dose-response relationship of the effect of the drug (or medication). The drug effect in many of the models is measured by log (HRs), which represents the probability of success. Therefore, we assumed that the effect of the drug is linearly proportional to the logarithm of HRs. Third, we fitted a linear-linear model with log (HRs) to investigate the dose-response relationship of drug toxicity. If the drug had no effect on the effect of the drug, the linear-linear model with log (HRs) would have been fitted to investigate the dose-response relationship of drug toxicity. This model was referred to as a linear-linear drug toxicity model. Furthermore, we investigated whether there was a relationship between the drug effect and the dose. In this paper, we investigated the dose-response relationship of drug toxicity by comparing a linear-linear drug toxicity model with a linear-Emax drug toxicity model. We performed a simulation study to evaluate the effect of confounding on both linear-linear drug toxicity and linear-Emax drug toxicity models. The main aim of this study was to compare the performance of the 2 models of the effect. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the same 2 models regarding their ability to detect an emerging safety signal.\nThe performance of the linear-Emax drug toxicity model was evaluated by comparing its effect estimate and 95% confidence interval with that of a linear-linear drug toxicity model. We used 100 simulation scenarios with 1000 replicates. To calculate the effect estimates and their associated 95% confidence intervals, we used the Bayesian approach in which the likelihood is a likelihood with overdispersion. To evaluate the ability of the linear-Emax drug toxicity model to detect an emerging safety signal, we calculated the power (%) to detect the effect in the Bayesian dose-response model with the linear-linear drug toxicity model and linear-Emax drug toxicity model"

Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in women, and most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. The diagnosis of peritoneal lesions is usually made through exploration surgery and intraoperative pathology diagnosis of cancer cells or peritoneal malignant tumors. The conventional treatment of peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer is the combination of chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery, but it has not been proven in clinical trials to prolong patients' overall survival. At present, there are no drugs that have been approved for treatment of this situation, and most peritoneal lesions recur after surgery. The number of deaths caused by this disease is increasing. At present, the standard treatment of patients with peritoneal metastasis is that patients with peritoneal metastasis should receive laparoscopy and peritoneal puncture of the greater omentum if there are signs of malignant peritonitis. In recent years, with the study of epigastric arterial lymph node biopsy, a new treatment method has been found to determine the existence and number of epigastric lymph node metastases and to detect peritoneal lesions. The researchers will design a study to determine whether patients with ovarian cancer and epigastric arterial lymph node metastasis who are not suitable for surgery can benefit from antiangiogenic treatment targeting the epigastric artery.\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nOvarian Cancer, Recurrent Ovarian Cancer, Stage I Ovarian Cancer, Stage II Ovarian Cancer, Stage III Ovarian Cancer, Stage IV Ovarian Cancer\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Procedure: Epigastric lymph node biopsy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients who have ovarian cancer and whose clinically assessed peritone",

            "Alright. Could you give us a more detailed description of the method? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCardiac remodeling is the main driver in the progression of heart failure (HF). One of the main hallmarks of HF pathology is the impairment of mitochondrial function. Sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and hospitalization in patients with HF by reducing the incidence of cardiac remodeling. Aside from its impact on glucose metabolism, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial function. The use of sGC agonists is associated with positive cardiac remodeling and reduction of oxidative stress. Phosmetasome has been shown to improve mitochondrial function and protect myocardial cells from oxidative stress, indicating beneficial role in reducing HF. To further enhance this, Solriamfetol is well studied ARNI, which has antioxidant effect and protects from adverse cardiac remodeling in preclinical models. In this study, the impact of combination therapy (two SGLT2 inhibitors with sGC stimulator, phosmetasome, and Solriamfetol; four drugs) on improving mitochondrial function compared to usual care will be assessed.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, two-stage study is to assess the impact of triple therapy in addition to standard therapy for heart failure (HF) that is already on standard medication in patients with moderate or severe reduction in ejection fraction (ejection fraction < 45%) compared to standard therapy alone on markers of mitochondrial metabolism such as glucose, fatty acid, keto acid, and lactate. We hypotheshize that combination therapy in addition to standard therapies will improve clinical and subclinical outcomes in HF patients. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, two-stage study (N=40) will be conducted for 12 weeks. For 6 weeks of the study, all patients will receive the standard dose of SGLT2",

And what are the objectives of the study? \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of providing a nurse\u2010led telephone intervention to patients and caregivers of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The intervention is intended to supplement care provided by an interdisciplinary ALS Clinic and was modeled after a previous study.DESIGN: Participants were enrolled at two academic ALS centers using standard inclusion and exclusion criteria. Caregivers and patients with documented ALS were eligible to enroll. In this feasibility study, an experienced nurse (interventionist) engaged patients and their caregivers by telephone with monthly communication. During these monthly phone calls, the nurse helped patients and caregivers identify and manage issues arising from the disease. Caregivers were encouraged to participate in telephone calls, but the patient was the primary focus of the calls. Patient enrollment was staggered to allow for continuous monitoring of patient and caregiver needs. The study was designed to enroll patients at each site who were either new to the ALS Clinic or who had been seen at the ALS Clinic for an extended period of time and were therefore more likely to experience symptom and functional deterioration. At the start of the intervention, patients and their caregivers were asked the following question on a scale of 1 (not important) to 10 (most important): How much do you believe that the nurse telephone calls will be helpful in assisting you to cope with issues that arise from your ALS? How would you rate your understanding of the medication currently being used to treat your ALS? The same question was repeated at 6\u2009months. The primary goals were to measure changes in disease symptoms and functioning at 6 months following baseline and explore the feasibility of providing telephone\u2010focused care to a sample of patients with ALS.SETTING: Study sites were the VA Tampa Healthcare System (Tampa, FL) and University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA), USA.PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen Veterans were recruited from the Tampa site and seven patients with ALS were recruited from the Philadelphia site, along with the caregivers of the patients.

In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study design, the investigators evaluated the acute and longer-term effects of cathodal ventromedial prefrontal cortex modulation on illness awareness in 30 inpatients or outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Clinical and functional imaging effects will be assessed across study visits.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe aim of this study is to determine the clinical and functional imaging effects of serial CVS on illness awareness. There is much interest in understanding how illness awareness and insight affect outcomes such as illness engagement, treatment adherence, and relapse prevention. Additionally, insight into the mechanisms of action that drive these outcomes would accelerate research into the neurobiology of illness awareness and potentially lead to the development of new interventions. In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we will evaluate the acute and longer-term effects of cathodal ventromedial prefrontal cortex modulation on illness awareness in 30 inpatients or outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, the current study is the first to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate the PFC in patients with schizophrenia, and it is the first to examine the impact of modulating ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity (vmPFC) on illness awareness. The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, crossover study to determine whether cathodal versus sham vmPFC electrical stimulation has a different impact on illness awareness and insight. Patients will consent to 8 study visits and randomized into one of two treatment conditions (cathodal ventromedial prefrontal cortex vs. sham ventromedial prefrontal cortex) in a block design.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether there is a difference between the effect of scaling and root planing in patients with obesity (BMI >30) and patients with normal BMI in reducing periodontal inflammation. METHODS: A randomized control trial with a parallel control group was conducted in 50 periodontitis patients. The patients were divided into 2 categories with a ratio of 1:1, in accordance to the inclusion criteria based on body mass index (BMI) (N=25 in each group; 20 normal weight patients and 5 patients with obesity). After 3 months from the baseline, scaling and root planing were conducted, and follow\u2010ups were done after 3 and 6 months. All the patients had their BMI recorded and underwent periodontal examination: gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), bleeding index (BI), and complete measurements of the clinical attachment level on the first molar. The scores were converted to the average and then compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: All the variables decreased significantly in the obesity group after 6 months. The results showed that BMI had a significant effect on periodontal inflammation (p=0.001). When the obese group was compared to the normal group after 3 months, there was a significant decrease in the average GI and BI (p<0.001). However, when the groups were compared after 6 months, no difference was shown among the 2 groups (p>0.05). There were significant decreases in the mean PD, CAL, and PI of both groups at 3 and 6 months (p<0.001), with no significant difference in mean PI between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Scaling and root planing had the same effect on reducing periodontal inflammation in patients with normal and abnormal BMI.",

Our primary outcomes will be objective assessments of sleep behavior through the use of wrist\u2010worn actigraph monitors that will capture night\u2010time movement and sleep cycles. Secondary outcome measures will be measures of sleep quality as well as other potential factors to be assessed, including demographic and other socio\u2010economic data, information on sleep hygiene behaviors, and self\u2010report of sleep quality. We hypothesize that the weekly SMS intervention will lead to a significant improvement in sleep patterns as reported via sleep actigraphy. Discussion: This novel intervention provides a unique opportunity to test non\u2010invasive, personalized, wearable devices to encourage individualized behavior change and address the large health disparities in breast cancer.

The lifetime chance of being alive with PCa is estimated at about 15% and as high as 25% for men age 80 and older. Recent data suggest, due in part to increasing screening, that prostate cancer mortality is significantly decreasing. However, PCa is the third most common cause of cancer death among men in the United States, indicating a need for better screening strategies and more accurate diagnostic tests. The goal of this research study is to determine if the combination of specific ultrasound measurements, called Transient Elastography (TE), and MRI can detect prostate cancer in patients referred for biopsy based on a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value less than 10ng/mL. Current standard of care requires men with a PSA level less than 3ng/mL not to receive a prostate biopsy, yet some prostate cancers will escape detection until they are at a more advanced stage when it is more difficult to cure. While biopsy is the current standard of care to assess the presence of prostate cancer, it is an invasive procedure and the results may be inaccurate, causing the need for repeat biopsies. A common reason for repeat biopsies is due to inflammation in the prostate that causes the prostate tissue to appear abnormal. While PSA testing has been instrumental to increasing early detection of prostate cancer, it is also associated with over-diagnosis whereby prostate cancers are found that ultimately are likely not to cause any harm during a patient's lifetime. Over the years, the threshold PSA cutoff value has been gradually lowering, however, a PSA value above the new cutoffs of 8 or 10 ng/mL is still associated with an approximately 25% to 30% likelihood of detecting prostate cancer on biopsy. The reason why PSA values are still elevated even when the cutoff value has been made extremely"

The common cold is a mild acute upper respiratory infection caused by a variety of viruses, which result in nasal congestion, runny nose, blocked nose, and sneezing. The symptoms occur from the day of infection with the virus to 7-14 days. Symptoms of the common cold are usually mild; however, they can be very disruptive to the daily lives of patients, particularly adolescents and young adults who may return to the study site or clinic for a nasal or throat culture taken up to 3 times per day. This may occur over a period of several days to a week in order to assess microbial cultures. A large portion of these patients develop an inflammatory response to the virus within the nasal cavity, known as \"rhinitis\". A study in patients in Japan suggests that up to six times more patients suffered from nasal congestion due to a blocked nasal cavity, than in adults. This inflammation is characterized by the presence of an inflammatory response in the blood, which includes an increase in an immune cell called a T cell, and T cells are activated after infection with the virus. The immune system is activated through the presence of specific proteins called cytokines. These cytokines (eg, interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma) cause an increase in the number of T cells which leads to inflammation of the nasal mucosa. In adults, the cytokines involved in this response are interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-5, IL-9, and other cytokines, including Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2). Inhibition of these various cytokines has been found effective as a treatment for various inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arth",

Sample Size: 100 participants in each group (study and control group) \n\nStudy Design Rationale:\n1. Study Type: Observational - This study design involves observing the participants and collecting data without intervention to examine the prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis among patients with a history of lumbar spinal stenosis. \n2. Study Duration: 5 years - This duration should be sufficient to recruit and enroll the required number of participants and to collect the necessary data for analysis. \n3. Sample Size: 100 participants in each group - The sample size is considered adequate to detect statistically significant differences between the study and control group. \n\nStudy Design Rationale:\n\nThe study design is appropriate for the investigation of the relationship between spinal stenosis and cardiac amyloidosis. By observing participants in each group and performing DPD scintigraphy, researchers can determine the prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis in individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis and whether it is different from individuals without lumbar spinal stenosis. \nThe study duration of 5 years is reasonable and allows for sufficient time to recruit and enroll the required number of participants. It also allows for adequate data collection and statistical analysis of the results.

Participation to the study will be limited to medical and/or non-medical files already entered in the national registry of people with heart failure. In order to improve detection of dementia and psychiatric illness, patients will be questioned using scales for patient self-report, informant or professional, the results of these scales being systematically linked to an available diagnosis of heart failure.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe results will allow assessment of the rate of neuropsychiatric illness in a contemporary cohort of people with heart failure. This study will focus on the association with clinical factors (comorbidity and treatment of heart failure), cognitive function, biomarkers possibly associated to increased risk of this type of cardiovascular disease in the general population. It will also help to assess the potential predictive role of biomarkers (blood levels of the biologically active hormone of angiotensin II) and the potential association of these biomarkers and neuropsychiatric illness in people with heart failure. The results of this study will be important for optimizing medical management of patients with heart failure. Study design: All patients included in the national registry of heart failure who have signed the consent will be invited to participate in this multicentric prospective study. Each patient will be asked to indicate another heart failure patient of a similar age category and sex. No new patient with cognitive impairment will be recruited.

            "Excellent! Let's move on to the goals and objectives of the study. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Myocardial protection during coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a leading topic in cardiac surgery. Indeed, although recent guidelines state that there is no difference between myocardial protection methods and cardiac preservation technologies, the European consensus proposes that cardioplegia should be the primary mode of myocardial protection during heart surgery. However, recent studies highlight a trend in favor of myocardial protection, mainly using extracorporeal circulation in patients undergoing heart surgery. Nevertheless, although promising, these results only concern a minority of hospitals and patients. AIMS: The purpose of this pilot study was to analyze the safety and feasibility of a pharmacological myocardial protection strategy compared to a cardioplegic strategy in patients undergoing heart surgery in a real\u2010life context.METHODS: This study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open\u2010label study including patients undergoing isolated or associated left heart surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass and extracorporeal circulation. Following randomization, the patients will receive a cardioplegic or pharmacological strategy. The primary endpoint is the rate of ischemic\u2010related arrhythmias (including atrial arrhythmias (AA), atrio\u2010ventricular block (AVB) > 2nd degree at discharge). Secondary endpoints include composite endpoints at 30 days post\u2010operative (Mace\u20103 score, echocardiographic evaluation of systolic and diastolic dysfunction), functional status (NYHA function score, 6\u2010MWD, LVEF evaluated by radionuclide ventriculography), and adverse events (myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, ventilation, and renal replacement therapy duration). Finally, an economic evaluation will be performed on the same inclusion population.CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to assess the feasibility of a pharmacological myocardial protection strategy compared to a cardioplegic strategy. If this study demonstrates its interest, the subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT) will allow us to assess the effect of pharmacological myocardial protection on clinical outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical\u00a0Trials\u00a0-",

Based on the preliminary study results, DSP-7888 for treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 (SAS) is selected as the most promising drug among DSP-7888 and three other anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs with the help of a machine learning model. In the phase 2 clinical trial, this is a randomized, double-blind controlled study in which DSP-7888 or placebo is administered once a day.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause lower respiratory tract infections such as viral pneumonia and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, the optimal drug treatment of COVID-19 has not been found. At the present stage of the COVID-19, the development of efficacious antiviral drugs is the most urgent need for patients with COVID\u201019. Due to its convenient method and simple operation, intravenous infusion has been extensively applied to the treatment of SAS. Therefore, investigators designed and conducted an exploratory study to screen effective drugs in a limited number of patients with COVID-19, and a multiphase clinical trial was carried out to further verify their efficacy while expanding the sample size. According to the results of preliminary research, DSP-7888 emerged as the most promising candidate. Based on the results, DSP-7888 for treatment of severe or critical COVID-19 (SAS) was selected as the most promising drug among DSP-7888 and three other anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs with the help of a machine learning model.

Where can I find more information? \n\nBrief summary\n=================\nPurpose and Overview: To assess the effect of the Decision Tool to improve knowledge and perceived risk compared to the conventional Spanish information in women receiving maintenance chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in the community setting. \n\nDesign and Approach: This is a cluster randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants will be invited to complete surveys at baseline and 3 months. Outcomes will be knowledge and perceived risk. Participants will also complete an acceptability survey.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAn estimated 22,530 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, 14,030 of whom will die from the disease (1,957-2016 National Cancer Institute Surveillance and Epidemiology and End Results Program). The overall five-year survival rate (SEER 10) is 47.6%. The most robust treatment approach for ovarian cancer is surgery followed by chemotherapy. Patients are recommended to receive at least six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence suggests that the administration of up to 12 additional maintenance cytotoxic chemotherapy cycles after completing the standard six cycles is associated with improved overall survival compared to observation alone. Nonetheless, in reality, approximately 50% of patients elect to receive maintenance chemotherapy. The decision to elect or not to elect additional chemotherapy is particularly relevant to women with ovarian cancer because chemotherapy can elicit significant toxicities, including myelosuppression, alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy. Moreover, many patients have received multiple medical treatments with significant side effects and may not have the desire to accept more therapy. Because maintenance chemotherapy is not universally available and is often provided only in academic medical centers, patients in community hospitals may not be informed about this treatment option. A Shared Decision Tool (SDT) consisting of a fact sheet in Spanish providing information about the benefits and risks of treatment has been created that allows women under treatment to obtain information, reflect on their preferences, discuss their options with their clinicians, and consider whether to accept or decline this treatment option. This Shared Decision Tool includes information and figures that are specific to women diagnosed with ovarian cancer and receiving maintenance chemotherapy in the ambul",

There are, however, limitations of the current denture design with a standard attachment system. Moreover, overdenture prosthetic construction with computer\u2010aided design and computer\u2010aided manufacturing (CAD/ CAM) is known to cause fabrication errors due to the limitations in intra\u2010oral scanners or CAD systems. Thus, the aim of this study was to introduce a new scanning and CAD/CAM method to fabricate a new overdenture prototype and determine its clinical applicability. Methods: A total of 24 patients with good oral, systemic health, and a bilateral full\u2010arch edentulous jaw with a minimum height of the residual alveolar ridge of 6\u00a0mm were selected. Two sets of complete denture (maxilla and mandible) were fabricated for each patient. After initial denture construction, impressions, surgical stents, and guide pins were fabricated for implant placement. Implants were inserted for both the maxillary and mandibular jaw at an average of 8\u00a0weeks after the surgical procedure. After the second stage surgery and occlusal adjustment, two sets of complete denture (maxilla and mandible) were fabricated. Then, the mandibular complete denture was fabricated at two different methods. One complete denture was fabricated with a conventional method, and the other complete denture was fabricated at a digitized method (3Shape Exocad software). Patients were followed at 2, 4, and 6\u00a0weeks after the implant placement for evaluation. A digital scanner (Bilbray 3D i500 Scanner; Carestream Dental, Atlanta, GA, USA) was used to scan the two maxillary complete dentures and two mandibular complete dentures over the first one\u2010year follow\u2010up. Patients were instructed to perform chewing of hard and soft textured food and evaluated by the Percival Occluzer (Percival Instrument Co., Inc., Mundelein, IL, USA)",

The mandibular condyle is crucial in TMD patients, and the conventional mandibular overdenture has been the conventional treatment option. Nevertheless, it is a challenge to achieve the ideal position for the mandibular overdenture. Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology offer precision in the mandibular overdenture position and is widely used in modern prosthodontics.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThere is a lack of clinical evidence regarding the effect of CAD/CAM milling on overdenture bases between CAD/CAM milled and conventional mandibular overdentures. This study aimed to explore the effect of CAD/CAM mandibular overdentures on temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function. It was hypothesized that the CAD/CAM mandibular overdenture is superior in restoring TMJ biomechanics and function. Patients with a maxillary complete conventional complete denture or a complete mandibular conventional complete denture were included. They were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. At first, patients in the experimental group were treated with CAD/CAM mandibular overdentures while patients in the control group received conventional mandibular overdentures. TMJ sounds, joint laxity, mouth opening, headache intensity, pain threshold, occlusal function, and oral quality of life were assessed during and after treatment.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nComparison Between Computer-Assisted Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing and Conventional Mandibular Overdenture in Patients With Complete Dentures\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nMissing Teeth\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) treatment\n* Other: conventional mandibular overdenture (control treatment)\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients with normal occlusion; Age ranging from 21 to 45; Patients had TMD with no inter-",

However, the surgical procedure itself can be painful and cause discomfort for patients. Research has suggested that injecting hyaluronic acid into the implant socket before implantation can reduce post-implantation pain and promote faster healing. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hyaluronic acid injection in reducing post-implantation pain and its impact on patient outcomes. [/CONTEXT] [/TITLE]\n\n[ABSTRACT] [EN] Implant dentures have become a popular choice for edentulous patients due to their numerous advantages such as high stability, comfort, and function while preserving oral health. However, the surgical procedure for implant placement can be painful and cause discomfort for patients. Research has shown that injecting hyaluronic acid into the implant socket before implantation can help reduce post-implantation pain and promote faster healing. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of hyaluronic acid injection in reducing post-implantation pain in 70 edentulous patients undergoing implant surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the experimental group received hyaluronic acid injection into the implant socket, while the control group did not receive any intervention. Pain intensity and duration, patient satisfaction, and complications were assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-surgery, and the data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The results showed that the patients in the experimental group had significantly lower pain intensity and duration compared to the control group, and had higher levels of satisfaction with their treatment. There were no serious complications in either group, and no significant differences in implant success and failure rates were observed. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that hyaluronic acid injection before implantation can effectively reduce post-implantation pain and improve patient outcomes, with no significant adverse effects or complications. This approach represents a novel",

Patients with a stroke or TIA in the context of small vessel disease participated in the study. The ataxia was evaluated using four subtests of the Movement Intention Test by a blinded assessor, both at pre-treatment and 6 weeks after first treatment session. The intensity of ataxia in the upper and lower extremities was analyzed regarding a different level of experience. The effect of treatment was compared to another group with small-vessel disease without ataxia and a third non-patient group with small-vessel disease based on their scores of depression and anxiety. The patients with ataxia and non-patients were analyzed based on their lesion distribution. We also analyzed how the intensity of depression and anxiety influenced the treatment response.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEfficacy of Physiotherapy for Upper and Lower Limb Ataxia in Patients With Small Vessel Lesions- a Randomized Controlled Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nStroke, Transient Ischemic Attack, Ataxia, Parkinson's Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Behavioral: Physiotherapy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: All inclusion criteria are assessed at the first contact with the patient.

Treatment-naive participants with symptomatic ATTR-PN/CM will be randomized (2:1) to receive intravenous infusions of NTLA-2001 at 55 mg, 2:1 randomization 3:1 or placebo. The primary hypothesis of the study is that NTLA-2001 treatment is sufficient to reduce the rate of decline in the composite primary endpoint of change from baseline to Weeks 96 and 144 in the NT-proBNP and 6-minute walking distance (6MWD). 55 mg is the maximum therapeutic dose for ATTR-PN/CM based on pre-clinical data and a dose-ranging clinical trial previously conducted. In these studies, 55 mg was found to significantly reduce TTR protein in the blood compared to placebo. Other doses have been evaluated in an ATTR-CM only study. In ATTR-CM only studies, higher doses of NTLA-2001 were associated with increased rate of hepatic dysfunction. These higher doses have been shown to be better tolerated in ATTR-PN/CM when combined with vitamin A supplementation, resulting in long-term stability of LDL cholesterol. The 55 mg dose has been shown to also be well tolerated and have better liver safety profile in ATTR-PN/CM. This dose is well supported based on the previous studies using biomarkers and biopsy assessments.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nMulticenter, Double-blind, Randomized Study to Assess the Safety, Efficacy and Tol",

Their levels of depression (based on the PHQ\u20109 and DTSQ) and glycemic control (based on HbA1c levels) were assessed using a questionnaire. Results: Significant differences in PHQ\u20109 scores, DTSQ scores, and HbA1c levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were found between the depressed and nondepressed patients. A statistically significant positive correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.782, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) was found between the patients' PHQ\u20109 and DTSQ scores, indicating that the higher the patient's PHQ\u20109 score, the weaker their treatment satisfaction. A positive correlation between DTSQ scores and HbA1c levels was also found (r\u00a0=\u00a00.291, p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), indicating that the better the treatment satisfaction, the better the patients' glycemic control. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that depression in pediatric patients with Type\u00a01 diabetes is negatively associated with their glycemic control, suggesting that healthcare providers should consider depression treatment as part of their treatment approach in improving glycemic control.",

The use of hot air balloons to deliver local anesthesia is a new, promising development in this field. Hot air balloon (HAB) anesthesia is an advanced technique that allows the delivery of high concentrations of local anesthetics into a small volume of space around the nerve, leading to effective anesthesia and a significant reduction in the risk of ChPOP. However, compared to the traditional saline injection, it is not clear exactly how using a hot air balloon affects pain levels and the amounts of postoperative pain medications used. This study will investigate whether using a hot air balloon for local anesthesia reduces postoperative pain and pain medication use compared to saline injection during total knee replacement (TKR). The study will include forty adult patients who are candidates for TKR with ChPOP. In this interventional study, 20 patients in each group will be randomly assigned to receive either a hot air balloon or a standard saline injection during surgery. Both treatment groups will receive standard postoperative care, including pain medication and physical therapy. The study will last for a total of twelve weeks and will involve multiple follow-up visits to assess pain levels, pain medication use, and the patients' overall recovery. The study is innovative because it uses HAB anesthesia in conjunction with local anesthetic injection to prevent postoperative pain. It is also innovative because it uses a patient survey to evaluate postoperative pain and patient satisfaction with the method of local anesthetic injection.

Of particular interest was the difference in the rate of neutropenia reported by the two treatment arms. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly lower (5.6% versus 30.8%, P\u2009<\u20090.05), as was the requirement for prophylactic colony stimulating factor (5/62 versus 14/65). The response rate in the bevacizumab biosimilar arm was similar to that with Avastin(\u00ae) (11/62 versus 10/65). Two patient deaths in the trial were considered by the investigator to be due to disease progression. In conclusion, this bevacizumab biosimilar is well tolerated, easy to administer and has a comparable response rate as compared to the reference product.\n\nIntroduction\nApproximately 1 million patients worldwide with the metastatic form of lung cancer will require anti",

Now, could you please provide me with some details about the interventions used in your clinical trial? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nBACKGROUND SUMMARY AND RATIONALE The prevalence of shoulder arthroscopy has been rising 300% during the past 20 years, which is one of the most common orthopaedic surgeries. Shoulder arthroscopy involves multiple irrigation and suction cycles, thus there is a significant fluid shift into the extravascular compartment with a consequent risk of postoperative fluid volume overload and pulmonary complications (PE). However, due to the absence of a standard fluid management strategy during shoulder arthroscopy, 30% of patients develop symptomatic pulmonary edema (PPE), and postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are the cause of increased length of hospital stay and costs, and increased readmissions and morbidity. Thus, there is a need for developing a standard fluid management strategy without increasing adverse outcomes to decrease PPCs and costs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of different intraoperative fluid management strategies on hemodynamics and pulmonary complications in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial will enroll 162 adult patients of either sex undergoing shoulder arthroscopy. Participants will be randomly assigned to either liberal or restrictive fluid management strategies: the 'liberal' strategy group will receive iso-oncotic crystalloid solution to maintain a fluid balance goal of 10% above preoperative body weight during surgery, and the 'restrictive' strategy group will be managed with a fluid balance goal of 0-3% above preoperative body weight during surgery. Cardiovascular instability will be managed with either vasoactive drugs, or packed red blood cells, or vasopressin, or both. The primary outcome measure will be the development of symptomatic PPE. Cardiac biomarkers of myocardial injury, lung injury, renal injury, and electrolyte imbalances will be also assessed. Discussion Trial results will show which of the two intraoperative fluid management strategies",

Specifically, we propose to treat patients with elevated baseline plasma yKL-40 with methotrexate, as compared to placebo, to prevent disease progression and the development of erosive disease in RA. We speculate that patients with elevated yKL-40 are at higher risk for disease progression and may be good candidates for rapid and aggressive treatment to improve long-term outcomes.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Outcome of Early Intervention in RA Study (the ORBIT Study)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nRheumatoid Arthritis\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Methotrexate\n* Drug: Placebo\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Diagnosis of early RA based on 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria On no disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or treatment with the exception of glucocorticoids for symptomatic treatment of disease (maximum dose 10 mg/day, prednisone equivalent) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for malaria prophylaxis Elevated baseline plasma yKL-40 Exclusion Criteria: Use of concurrent medications that are contraindicated to methotrexate, including penicillamine, allopurinol, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or TNF inhibitors Known or suspected hypersensitivity to drugs containing glutaraldehyde, phenol, or formaldehyde (methotrexate) Positive screening laboratory tests: Urine pregnancy test or pregnancy Platelet count <",

T\u00fcbingen, Germany). The precise, computer-assisted intraoperative targeting and the minimally invasive approach of this intracerebrally applied laser technique are intended to provide high ablative accuracy and good clinical results in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The FIRST design replicates our institutional pilot trial. The sample size of 30 patients (one additional patient is added after interim analysis) will evaluate both safety and efficacy of infratentorial NaviFUS (Tuberositas LITT with Sparrow) vs. conventional technique of radiofrequency (RF) coagulation. In this multi-center, non-comparative, prospective, observational study, the primary objectives are safety (adverse events, adverse drug reactions, serious adverse events), and efficacy (seizure freedom rate).

Could you describe intervention/treatment components, such as the type, dose, and route of administration, as well as the schedule, duration, and follow-up? \n\nStudy\n=================\n\nOverview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nAcute and chronic pain is highly prevalent among Veterans with recent battle-related war injuries. The most prevalent combat injuries are traumatic limb injuries or traumas to the head. Currently, medications are widely used to treat combat related pain, but they have many limitations. Veterans receiving narcotics through Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) suffer from under treatment of their chronic pain, as well as negative physical and mental health outcomes due to the misuse of opioids, including: tolerance (higher doses to effectively control pain), hyperalgesia (intense pain to mild stimuli), impaired immune function, and cognitive impairment. This lack of effective pain medication is particularly problematic because combat related injuries are often associated with chronic pain, limiting rehabilitation, physical recovery and the resumption of normal duties. There is a clear need to develop new medications that can provide analgesia without the side effects associated with current opioid based treatments. There has been tremendous interest in the medicinal potential of cannabinoids as they present an alternative and potentially more effective method for the management of pain. These compounds exist in the body's endocannabinoid system, a system that is activated by external cannabinoids through the activation of the CB1 and CB2 receptors. They elicit several anti-nociceptive effects, suggesting a possible role for these receptor mediators in the treatment of pain. Recent evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid anandamide is released following tissue injury from surgical and chronic inflammatory pain stimuli in humans. In addition, studies have shown that repeated daily administration of exogenous anandamide exerts anti-nociceptive effects when administered at low doses. Anandamide is rapidly degraded by the enzyme FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase). Inhibition of this enzyme, could extend the duration of pain relief following acute injury and would therefore serve as a rationale for the use of FAAH inhibitors. However, FAAH inhibition results in increases in brain",

            "Abstract:\nOBJECTIVE: To identify reasons for early termination (ET) or not continuing to trial intervention after the first 6\u2010month appointment in the PATHS randomized, open\u2010label clinical trial.METHODS: One hundred sixty clinicians were randomized to either the usual care (UC) or a care\u2010management (CM)\u2010plus\u2010guideline intervention. The intervention included care managers implementing individualized action plans to achieve goals. We conducted qualitative interviews with 39 parents who had not responded to the first 6\u2010month CM appointment, 30 parents who terminated during the first 6 months, 10 parents who terminated after the first 6 months, and 29 parent advocates who worked with parents in CM. We employed a phenomenological approach using constant comparison analysis to develop patterns among and between the different interview groups.RESULTS: We identified 5 key themes: (1) parent experiences of stress leading to EMs; (2) parent experiences of stress as a barrier to responding to CM; (3) issues related to timing of the trial; (4) issues related to the CM intervention; and (5) issues related to the UC intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Parents had varying levels of stress that increased the likelihood of ET or nonresponse. Timing was a key factor in parent EMs, with some parents preferring the first 6 months to be a trial of the intervention, whereas others did not want to wait. Among the issues related to the CM intervention, parents were reluctant to open up to someone new. For parents on the UC randomization arm, the intervention did not align well with their parenting experiences and therefore was not particularly relevant for them. Based on our findings, we identified a number of strategies to improve enrollment and retention in CM."

However, there were no significant differences between acuities. To avoid potential effects of the natural history of rehabilitation, it is important to focus on acute\u2010phase stroke patients. Objective: To establish the feasibility of conducting a phase III randomized, controlled trial comparing functional use and upper limb function in acute\u2010phase stroke patients who were treated using either a MCDS or conventional rehabilitation exercises (CTRL). Method: The study is a pilot study that will focus on acute stroke patients. The patient groups will be randomized to either the CTRL group or MCDS group. Both groups will receive the same amount of rehabilitation exercise sessions, but the MCDS group will use MCDS for their rehabilitation exercises, which consists of wrist/forearm movement, whereas the CTRL group will use physiotherapy\u2010led exercises. Participants will be assessed at three clinical sessions, and the outcome measures will be the Fugl\u2010Meyer Motor Assessment \u2013 upper limb (UE) score, Action Research Arm Test, and functional use tests such as Box andBlocks Test, and nine\u2010hole peg test. The outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 weeks. Both groups will receive the same amount of rehabilitation physical therapy.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of septic shock, occurring in up to 40% of patients, and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. Despite intensive care and treatment with sepsis bundles, the prognosis for such patients remains poor.  In this setting, the early identification of those patients at risk of progressing to AKI may help guide appropriate individualized therapy to prevent or limit its development. \n\nRationale for the study: In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the role of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis-related AKI.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a coconut water supplement combined with dietary dark chocolate in the management of menstrual pain compared to nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in adolescent women (N = 50; 15\u201017 y) with primary dysmenorrhea. Methods: Participants were randomized into three groups: dark chocolate and coconut water supplementation (DM), dark chocolate supplementation (MC), and a control group receiving NSAIDs (NSAID). The study design included a baseline questionnaire regarding demographics, medical history, smoking, and daily oral contraceptive use, followed by one week of supplementation with or without NSAIDs. Participants recorded their pain scores and evaluated their levels of satisfaction using a standardized online questionnaire. Analyses included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and the post hoc Tukey and Kruskal\u2010Wallis tests. Results: The participants' mean age was 17 and the majority were adolescent women. Adolescents in the DM group reported lower levels of pain than those in the NSAID group (p = 0.002). The highest satisfaction with treatment was reported by those in the DM group. There were no statistically significant differences in the use of the supplements between adolescent women. However, satisfaction was positively related to pain intensity. Conclusion: Our study suggests that dark chocolate and coconut water supplementation could be an effective strategy for managing menstrual pain due to dysmenorrhea in adolescent women. Although the satisfaction scores were satisfactory in all participants, more research is needed to determine whether there is a link between pain intensity and the use of supplements with a possible synergistic effect.",

If they are allocated to the observation group, they will undergo imaging evaluation after 48 hours and surgery will be performed if the imaging shows appendicitis. Clinical tests will be performed throughout the study to monitor the patient's health and response to treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the duration of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures will include the occurrence of complications, patient satisfaction, and the cost-effectiveness of the treatment regimen.

Who is eligible for this study? \n\nStudy population\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nTumours of the adrenal gland are rare with the annual incidence per 100,000 being estimated as 0.6 males and 0.3 females. The most common tumours are adrenal cortical tumours such as adenoma (40-70%), adenocortical carcinoma (ACC) (30-40%) and pheochromocytoma (PCC) (10-18%). Clinical symptoms are either very suggestive for an underlying adrenocortical tumour or the diagnosis is established by chance due to abnormal findings on cross sectional imaging examinations, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the abdomen performed in patients with a variety of other abdominal or extra abdominal clinical problems. Diagnosis is usually established by biopsy, either percutaneous or by surgical biopsy. If possible surgical exploration is still the gold standard. However, in many patients adrenal tumour cannot be proven by biopsy and imaging findings are often insufficient for a reliable diagnosis. The main reasons may be the absence of distinct clinical features, or a non specific biologic profile of the adenoma. This is particularly the case with cortical benign neoplasms, which are often smaller than 3 cm, the biopsy yield is low and the biologic profile is similar to non neoplastic cortical tissue. The distinction between nodular hyperplasia, ectopic cortisol secreting tumour and adenoma is often difficult to make. In such cases medical therapy or surgical treatment without preoperative diagnosis is a debated topic. Several prospective randomized studies are ongoing to investigate the risk of recurrence after medical treatment with Mitotane alone versus Mitotane plus surgery. To date no prospective randomized study has been published investigating the outcome of surgical therapy versus follow-up with medical treatment with Mitotane alone for patients with ACC. This study aims to evaluate and compare the clinical outcome after radical surgical adrenalectomy versus follow-up with mitotane mon",

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided cholangioscopy (EUS-C) and cystogastro-duodenoscopy (EUS-CD) are effective for the treatment of gallstones and gallbladder cancer. Lumen apposing metal stent (LAMS) is associated with less postoperative pain and fewer complications compared with endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting, but further studies are required to investigate EUS-C/EUS-CD guided LAMS in the treatment of gallbladder disease. However, these studies are still insufficient, and the diagnostic value and safety of LUMEN apposing metal stent guided cholangioscopy and cystogastro-duodenoscopy are still unknown, particularly its application in patients with a high risk of postoperative complications.

Breasts that are biopsy-proven benign are typically followed to make sure that there is no cancer present. PET may be able to determine which women with benign breast disease are truly benign (i.e., no cancer) and which women will need more evaluation for breast cancer.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nFor the preliminary study, women 18 years of age or older with biopsy-proven benign breast disease will be eligible to participate. They will undergo a breast MRI, contrast-enhanced mammogram, PET scan, and MRI-guided biopsy to measure the accuracy of these studies in terms of their ability to detect small areas of breast cancer. The results will indicate whether these methods can successfully replace PET alone. This screening portion of the study will only be about 3 to 4 weeks in duration. Based on the results, we will have sufficient data to justify the cost and time of a full-scale study. Once the preliminary study is complete, these results will be shared with breast cancer scientists around the world and will play a major role in the design of a larger multi-center study. For the full-scale study, women 25 years of age or older with biopsy-proven benign breast disease will be eligible to participate. They will undergo a breast MRI, contrast-enhanced mammogram, and PET scan to determine which modality (MRI, mammogram, or PET scan) might be the most effective method. If a subject is found to have a high degree of suspicion (75 to 100%) of having breast cancer, based on the results of an initial PET scan, then biopsy will be performed unless no lesions are detected.

            "For the third study arm, we could consider an active intervention that uses the NovoTTF-200T device in combination with standard treatment. What do you think about that? \nBackground\n-----------------\nBrain metastasis represents a serious condition and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer, especially for those with advanced breast cancer . The estimated overall mortality rate for patients with brain metastasis is approximately 70% during the first 1-2 yrs, with a median survival time of 8-12 months . Patients with brain metastasis are typically first managed with a combination of radiation therapy and surgery . There have been significant advances in tumor management in recent years, but limited treatment modalities are available to effectively treat brain metastases. Patients with leptomeningeal disease involving the spinal cord may have significant neurological deficits, reduced quality of life (QOL), functional impairment, and premature death . Although there is no standard of care for treating brain metastases, several studies have demonstrated the potential benefit of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) (or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) ) . NovoTTF-200T 1 (optune) is a tumor-treating fields (TTF) device that uses low-intensity alternating electric fields to disrupt mitosis, resulting in arrested cell division and cell death. NovoTTF-200T 1 is FDA-approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma , gliosarcoma , and malignant melanoma . Preliminary data suggest that NovoTTF-200T 1 may be an effective treatment for patients with leptomeningeal metastases of the spine. The present study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study that will include 15 patients who have previously received WBRT/SRS treatment but continue to have leptomeningeal metastases of the spine in patients with recurrent breast cancer. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NovoTTF-200T 1 in these patients.\n\nTrial design\nThe current study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm trial that will enroll 15 patients with le",

Secondary endpoints will be determined using TCD and transcranial near infrared spectroscopy (TNIRS). Other secondary outcomes will include clinical outcomes including duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.  Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) - to evaluate the effect of lowering cerebrospinal pressure in the management of refractory intracranial hypertension. Transcranial near infrared spectroscopy (TNIRS) - to detect the threshold of increased risk of cerebral hypoperfusion with reduced intracranial pressure. \n\nAbstract\n=================\n\nBackground\n-----------------\nIntracranial hypertension (ICH) is the most common cause of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). It occurs in 30-55% of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is associated with adverse patient outcomes including an increased risk of mortality and impaired neurologic outcomes. Raised ICP increases oxygen demand and decreases cerebral perfusion pressure, while increased cerebral oxygen demand may increase intracranial oxygen requirements. Although therapeutic interventions have been established for ICH, the ideal target ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure has not been adequately determined. Previous studies have proposed guidelines for the ICP, with different target ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure recommendations for various patient care scenarios.

            "Not a problem. Have a nice day!\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis proposal aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pro-biotics after liver surgery on ICU patients' outcome and microbiota. A Prospective, randomized, double blind clinical trial will be performed.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nRationale: The management of severe sepsis and intra-abdominal infections in patients after liver surgery requires the use of wide antibiotic spectrum antibiotics. Recent findings about human microbiota, especially the gut microbiota, and its strong interaction with various tissues and systems, are starting to shed new light on a potential pathogenetic pathway leading from intestinal epithelium damage to multiorgan dysfunction. The gut-liver axis is emerging as a major actor in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, and gut permeability and translocation to the liver and systemic circulation have been linked to clinical outcomes in patients with major hepatic or abdominal surgery. This suggests that strategies targeting modulation of the gut microbiota could represent a new approach to prevent sepsis. As yet, no RCTs have investigated the effect of orally administered probiotics on SIRS and sepsis induced by various surgical techniques. Moreover, the optimal moment to treat and the best period of treatment is still unknown. A Prospective, randomized, double blind clinical trial will be performed. The study outcomes are ICU length of stay, organ dysfunction, hospital length of stay and mortality. The investigators hypothesize that the probiotic therapy will reduce the incidence of gut permeability, SIRS, sepsis and organ dysfunction, with a consequent reduction in the ICU length of stay, and an improvement in clinical outcomes and mortality.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nProphylactic Treatment of Probiotics in Patients After Hepatectomy - RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE BLIND PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nLiver Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Probiotic\n* Other: Control group\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria"

Will it last for more than an hour? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe aim of this prospective, multi-site trial is to study the surgical characteristics of laparoscopic antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (LRAMPS) and laparoscopic en-bloc pancreatoduodenectomy (LEPC) and to compare the clinical outcomes after the two procedures in terms of hospital stay, complications and mortality in an Asian population.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nLRAMPS was first described by Rene Tome in Belgium in 2010. It is a technique of pancreatosplenectomy that allows pancreatic cancer or benign lesions that occur on the left (i.e., more than 75% of the pancreas) to be resected en-bloc. It is performed in three parts: the spleen (splenectomy), left pancreas followed by splenectomy and the posterior wall of the stomach and pancreatoduodenectomy (PDD)/pancreatectoduodenectomy (PD) is performed during the second part. The last and final step is the reconstruction with duodeno-gastrojejunostomy (DG) and gastroduodenostomy (GD). In contrast, for patients with right or central pancreatic lesions, we will perform LEP for en-bloc resection. In recent series, LEP has been shown to have better oncological outcomes than LP due to better lymph node resection. LRAMPS has been performed more than 3000 times worldwide, and the 5-year survival rate of low-risk pancreatic cancer patients (stage A/B) is about 72%, which is comparable to those of LP and LEP . There is some difference in operative time between the two groups, which may lead to faster postoperative recovery and more rapid mobilization. In this study, we will compare the surgical characteristics of LRAMPS and LEP in terms of tumor location and surgical outcomes in terms of operative time, length of stay, complications, and long-term survival.",

Now, let's discuss the secondary endpoints. What secondary endpoints will be evaluated in the study? \nSure. The secondary endpoints are as follows: \n1) R0 resection rate; \n2) Major complications rate; \n3) Disease-free survival; \n4) Postoperative hospital stay, number of inpatients with postoperative complications, etc. \nFor endpoint 1, we will evaluate this based on the presence or absence of tumor growth after surgery. \nFor endpoint 2, we will use Clavien-Dindo classification to determine complications. \nFor endpoint 3, we will adopt RECIST guidelines to evaluate the disease-free survival. \nWe will also evaluate other endpoint items, such as postoperative hospital stay, the number of inpatients with postoperative complications, etc. \nGreat, these details will help in the analysis of the study. \nNow, let's discuss the endpoint assessment process.

The study will be conducted at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging in a randomized, parallel, double-blind controlled study, including measurements of physiological markers (blood glucose, insulin, GLP-1, PYY, cholecystokinin, ghrelin, and leptin) at different time-points in a subgroup of subjects. The measurements will be performed during a three-hour test period and participants are asked to abstain from all food and beverage except for water. Participants will be served meals of 40%, 50%, 60%, or 70% fat and will be asked to rate their satiety.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nObesity is a common and multifactorial disease characterized by an increase in fat mass that is associated with decreased life expectancy and adversely affects the quality of life and health. Obesity often develops due to increased food intake, leading to weight gain and ultimately obesity. Increased energy intake due to larger portion sizes, unhealthy snacking, low levels of physical activity, increased consumption of sweet snacks or beverages are all factors that may contribute to the development of obesity in society. Increased fat consumption is considered as a risk factor for obesity and weight gain, however, little is known about how high-fat meals affect appetite and satiety and whether this is different in healthy lean and overweight or obese individuals. The purpose of this study is to examine if fat increases appetite or suppresses satiety to a different extent in healthy lean and overweight or obese older adults. By better understanding this relationship, we hope to improve dietary guidelines, thus increasing the overall health of older adults.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nFood Choice and Gastrointestinal Hormones in Older Adults\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nObesity\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: high-fat-meal",

Now, let's add another arm to the study design: experimental: Colchicine + Tacrolimus Comparator: Control (Placebo + Tacrolimus)\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Dupilumab induces T\u2010cell differentiation in lymphoid tissue by blocking interleukin\u20104 receptor signaling, causing a reduction in type\u20102 biomarker levels. However, T\u2010cell\u2010triggered airway damage and tissue remodeling continue in spite of low serum levels of IL\u20104 and IL\u201013 despite suppression of their production. Thus, the authors designed this study to clarify whether combining dupilumab with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), tacrolimus, will be able to maintain lung homeostasis in the setting of eosinophil\u2010induced airway diseases. Methods: The authors studied C57BL/6\u2010background mice, treated with dupilumab alone or in combination with tacrolimus to compare the effect of the two groups. The expression of pulmonary cytokines and biomarkers was determined by PCR and ELISA. Transcriptome analysis was conducted on the lungs using RNA sequencing. For evaluation of T cells, CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells were isolated from the pulmonary tissue to test for changes in infiltration, activation, and expression of Th2\u2010related genes. The authors also evaluated the effect of the treatments on IL\u20109 secretion from Th2 cells in a Th2 cell\u2013induced lung\u2010nest lung homograft transplantation (LHTC) model with C57BL/6 (H\u20102b)\u2010background mice using a CBA/J (H\u20102k) lung as an allograft. Lung transplantation was performed in the presence of the anti\u2010interleukin (IL)\u201015 antibody, a stimulating cytokine for IL\u20109 expression in Th2 cells. Results: Dupilumab did not change the Th2 cells infiltration or the level of Th2\u2010related genes.

The prevalence of GSM increases with age and reaches around 60% at menopausal age. One cause of GSM is the decreased amount of estrogen (a female sex hormone). Menopause is a natural process that usually occurs at around 45-55 years of age, and in many cases is followed by postmenopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness. When used as a gel applied twice a week for 12 weeks in the vagina, Zantogin\u00ae Gel (with the active ingredient lactobacillus) can reduce vaginal and dyspareunia symptoms. With the use of this drug in postmenopausal women, the microbiota and the vaginal pH were changed to premenopausal levels within 4 weeks, and the frequency of using pain-relieving drugs decreased. Based on these results, this study will evaluate the efficacy of Zantogin\u00ae Gel in long-term vaginal therapy and quality of life improvement in women with GSM.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is a 12-month multi-center prospective observational study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of vaginal Zantogin\u00ae Gel as a long-term vulvovaginal treatment in menopausal women with vaginal atrophy and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).

Serum hs\u2010CRP, PTX3 levels and NBS were measured 1 week prior to the intervention and 3 months after the commencement of the treatment protocol. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was also determined before the initiation of the study and 3 months after the intervention.RESULTS: Twenty male patients (mean age\u00b1SD years: 35.00\u00b11.69) were included in this trial. Mean clinical measurements were in the 3rd and 4th quartiles for all variables. At the baseline, there was no difference between the clinical and the placebo groups regarding the variables. The serum levels of hs\u2010CRP, PTX3, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u201012, and IL\u201017 decreased significantly in the clinical group and 3 months after the protocol, while there was no change in the placebo group except for IL\u20101\u03b2 that decreased significantly in the placebo group.

            "This seems to describe the target population of your study quite well. What about your primary endpoint? \n\n[The study has concluded. A more complete summary of the results can be found in the study report.] [Inst] Thank you for your study idea! We could not identify peer-reviewed studies on the benefits of peer education for burn patients. Considering the lack of studies on this topic, our research team decided to pursue a feasibility trial first before proceeding with a full-fledged multicenter blinded randomized controlled trial.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Burn injuries impact around 180,000 patients and 255,000 emergency visits across the world every year. It is the most common cause of hospitalization among children and the third most severe injury in the United States. Burn injuries can cause physical, psychological, and social problems, in addition to disfigurement, pain, and disability [1,2]. As the incidence of burn injuries appears to be increasing every year, the need for burn care is growing, but the development of burn care and support systems is inadequate. Peer education has been recognized as an effective and powerful alternative method for health behavior change. However, there are no peer education studies targeting patient\u2010centered health outcomes specific to burn patients. Therefore, we aimed to develop and implement a peer education program for burn patients and verify the effectiveness of the program. Methods: This feasibility study is being conducted as a prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of peer education on core health outcomes specific for burn patients. We used a sequential explanatory\u2010mixed methods design in this study. Fifty\u2010four recently admitted hemodynamically stable patients with burn injuries meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and randomly allocated to the intervention or intervention group. The peer educator was a male adult patient who participated in the program five years earlier. The peer educator provided interventions by making educational materials, having one\u2010on\u2010one consultations with patients, and holding group discussions. The control group will continue to receive routine care for burn patients in the department. Data were collected using a questionnaire before and after the intervention. The primary outcome was perceived peer support, and the secondary outcome was self\u2010efficacy. Outcome measurements were compared among the two groups using chi\u2010squared and Student's t\u2010tests. Results: Fifty\u2010four eligible patients were enrolled in the study,",
            "Ok, got it. Now, let's discuss the design details for intervention(s). For intervention, the patients will be trained by their own peer group, composed of old burn injury patients who are well enough to assist. The training program will be conducted on a one-on-one basis, and the training content will be discussed by the patient and the team members. The training will take place daily according to each individual's availability. In case of missing sessions, the patients can contact their team members for a makeup session. As for the duration, the training will be administered for approximately 30 days. If the patient achieves the core health outcomes, then the training will be stopped. For a minimum of 30 days from the start of training till the end of training the team members will stay in touch with each other by phone and text messages. They will arrange to meet and support the patient for a minimum of 30 days from the end of training.",

As the majority of migrants reside in Greater Barcelona, this study will focus on the intervention for the migrants living in Catalonia (Spain). We will focus on the impact that COVID-19 has on the mental health and well-being of migrants (low-to-middle income and middle-to-high income, men and women). A number of interventions in Europe have already been used to improve the health of migrants living in the Community of Madrid, Spain and Belgium through various channels, including psychotherapy, psychological coaching, nutrition coaching, and physical training. However, there is no study that has examined",

            "I agree. This intervention has potential to improve psychosocial outcomes, such as depressive symptoms and social support, and may help older surgical patients navigate the complex experience of undergoing major surgery. However, I recommend incorporating an active control group in the study to assess the effectiveness of the intervention, as well as a comparison arm.\n\nTo address these points, I suggest that we consider including an additional study arm that receives standard care and a control group that receives no intervention. This will help us understand the efficacy of the PST intervention and compare it to other alternatives. In addition, we can improve the study design by considering a randomized allocation and parallel assignment to ensure an unbiased comparison between the intervention and the control groups.\n\nFurthermore, we should consider the potential impact of the study design on the outcomes. The intervention arm may benefit from the fact that participants received 9 sessions of the intervention, whereas the control group may only receive standard care or no intervention at all. This may result in a higher level of outcome improvement in the intervention arm compared to the control group. To address this, we should consider measuring the outcomes at multiple time points in the intervention arm to better understand the effects of the PST intervention.\n\nOverall, I believe that the proposed intervention in conjunction with a control group can provide valuable insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of the PST intervention in older surgical patients.

MEC had significantly lower haematocrit and Fe2+ compared to RC (19.1% vs 22.9% p < 0.0001; 47 \u03bcg Fe2+/l vs 108 \u03bcg Fe2+/l, p < 0.0001). The median number of platelet transfusions was lower during MEC treatment than during RC treatment (p = 0.007), with significantly fewer days receiving any transfusions (p = 0.022). However, there were no differences in total MSH or the number of MSHs resulting in hospital admission.CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend towards less total MSH associated with MEC treatment, but the number of MSH requiring hospitalisation was unaffected when RC or MEC were used.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02673975. This randomised controlled study does not meet the criteria for reporting preferred reporting items for randomized trials (CONSORT).\n\nIntroduction\nRandomised controlled trials are the gold standard for determining if new technologies result in better patient outcomes. Methaemoglobin enriched red cell concentrates (MEC) have been tested in two randomised controlled trials in adults and children, showing significant reductions in total bleeding in thalassaemia patients in Thailand[1] and Bangladesh[2]. In addition, in these studies there were significantly longer survival free intervals between transfusions and lower levels of ferritin.

The study will evaluate the effectiveness of intrathecal use of rhIGF-1 for children under 5 years of age in Korea who have spastic cerebral palsy.\n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Purpose:: Treatment\nPhase:: Phase2/Phase3\nIntervention Model:: Parallel\nBlinding/Masking:: Open\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: Drug\nIntervention Description:: Cerebral Palsy is a neurologic disorder that permanently affects motor activity during the first year of the brain's development. The causes of cognitive disabilities caused by Cerebral Palsy include prenatal injury caused by physical stress on the fetus or hypoxic damage due to intrapartum asphyxia. When brain injury is severe, cognitive impairment may persist. It is a disease characterized by slow and gradual development of symptoms, inadequate physical growth, and low intelligence and cognition. It is classified into spastic spasticity, hypotonic spasticity, extrapyramidal spasticity, and mixed spasticity according to the degree of movement and posture. \nIntrathecal recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1999. It can be used for the treatment of infantile muscle spasticity caused by cerebral palsy in addition to muscle relaxants and botulinum toxin. IGF-1 is an anabolic hormone secreted from the liver with stimulatory effects on muscle growth, fat metabolism, and bone formation. \nSubjects were assigned at random to",
            "That is a very thorough list. Is there anything else you'd like to ask me? \n\nAbstract:\nObjectives: Although intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy with recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (r\u2010tPA) is commonly used in the treatment of parapneumonic complications, several aspects of the treatment require study. In addition, intrapleural DNase has been increasingly used to dissolve clotted pleural effusion. However, data regarding both the use of r\u2010tPA and DNase for pleural infections is limited in the literature. Methods and Results: A prospective, randomized trial was conducted and enrolled patients with parapneumonic effusions and/or pleural infection. We randomized patients to low\u2010dose intrapleural r\u2010tPA (N=23) or standard\u2010dose intrapleural tPA plus intrapleural DNase (N=23), according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were (a) hospitalization for pleural infection, (b) overall hospitalization and the need for mechanical ventilation as a function of predetermined clinical outcome, and (c) pleurodesis at 180 days. We noted a trend toward increased use of intrapleural antibiotic or fibrinolytics in the r\u2010tPA group as compared with the r\u2010tPA plus DNase group (55% versus 24%, P=0.07). The hospitalization rate (93% versus 81%, P=0.43), overall hospitalization (242+/\u201073 days versus 252+/\u201077 days, P=0.84), mechanical ventilation use (79% versus 70%, P=0.97), and pleurodesis (26% versus 27%, P=0.62) rates were comparable for low\u2010dose r\u2010tPA and r\u2010tPA plus DNase groups. Conclusion: Based on our study results, we can not recommend either the use of low\u2010dose r\u2010tPA or the combination of r\u2010tPA plus DNase as an effective therapy for parapneumonic effusion and/or pleural infection.",

In Australia and some other Western countries, there is a paradigm shift towards hospital\u2010in\u2010the\u2010home (HITH) for paediatric post cardiac surgery rehabilitation. An important component for paediatric patients to be discharged from hospital is effective medication administration techniques at home. The present clinical trial aimed to evaluate whether an electronic system for administration of oral medications was equally effective as the currently established administration methods: home nursing visits or hospital\u2010based medication administration by nursing staff. Methods: This was a multicentre, single\u2010blind, randomized and controlled trial of 132 children. Children from 23 cardiac intensive care units were allocated by block randomization (1:1:1) to receive medication via an electronic administration system (e\u2010track), a nurse\u2010administered oral medication in a hospital\u2010based inpatient setting (nursing\u2010track) or administering the medication at home as usual (regular\u2010track). The primary outcome was achievement of the medication target of >80% adherence. Results: The trial was terminated prematurely after four interim analyses indicated an increased risk of nonconcomitant drug intake in the two intervention groups (e\u2010track/nursing\u2010track), potentially leading to adverse health events. No significant differences were found between the three groups in achieving the medication target of >80% adherence. For medication adherence, there was a significant difference between 18 children who were \u22657\u00a0months of age or who had a pre\u2010operative diagnosis of heart disease vs. 114 who were <7\u00a0months of age or who had a post\u2010operative diagnosis of heart disease. For time to medication administration, there was a significant difference between 12 children with a ventricular septal defect and 40 children with other heart diseases. Conclusions: In this trial, a more robust assessment of potential risks associated with the use of electronic administration systems could not be performed.

BACKGROUND: IBS is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders, with an estimated prevalence of 10\u201015% in industrialized societies. The pathogenesis of IBS is still unclear, and various studies have shown that increased levels of neuroinflammation and dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota play important roles. Lumix Xenon contains extracts of traditional Chinese herbal medicines, which have demonstrated antioxidant, anti\u2010inflammatory, and intestinal health\u2010promoting effects. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Lumix Xenon in IBS patients.METHODS: A total of 96 patients with IBS were randomly assigned to receive Lumix Xenon capsules (2 capsules, 3 times/day, for 12 weeks) or placebo capsules. The efficacy and patient acceptance of Lumix Xenon were compared with those of placebo from the patient's acceptance, gastrointestinal function, inflammatory factor level, and fecal microbiota composition. The safety of Lumix Xenon was assessed based on the adverse events reported by the patients.RESULTS: The administration of Lumix Xenon resulted in significantly greater patient acceptance than the placebo group.

This study evaluated the use of near\u2010infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate risk factors for CHP after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), and the efficacy of neuraxial anesthesia. Methods: This was a prospective, double\u2010blind, and randomised trial. A total of 45 patients were assigned into three groups, including the neuraxial anesthesia group (n\u00a0=\u00a015), the general anesthesia group 1 (GAP1; n\u00a0=\u00a015), and the general anesthesia group 2 (GAP2; n\u00a0=\u00a015). The neuraxial anesthesia group received general anesthesia combined with thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) anesthesia, while GAP1 and GAP2 groups received general anesthesia only. We used the NIRS index as the primary outcome indicator. Furthermore, other indicators, such as the incidence of postoperative complications, and the incidence of new ischaemic brain injury within 24\u2009h after operation and within 28\u2009days postoperatively, were observed. Results: After 24\u00a0h, the cerebral oxygen saturation (StO2) of GAP1 was higher than that of GAP2 in both the left and right frontal lobe regions, while the cerebral oxygenated haemoglobin index (rSO2) and total haemoglobin index (tHb) of GAP2 were higher than that of GAP1 (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Further observation found that there was no significant difference in postoperative complications among the three groups (P\u2009>\u20090.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of new ischaemic brain injury within 24\u2009h after operation and within 28\u2009days"

And what's the rationale for selecting this particular population? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe investigators will recruit 40 adult patients with untreated periodontitis. Patients will be assigned to two groups after oral examination, clinical evaluation, and microbiological examination of the dental plaque. All patients will receive proper oral health advice and instruction on good oral hygiene; however, one group will receive a hydrogen peroxide fumigation after each caries treatment session. Oral hygiene will be performed by the study investigator. Both groups will undergo a microbial analysis of collected plaque and saliva samples. The microbial analysis will include the following parameters: total bacterial count, Candida, and fungal species. The duration of the study will be 12 weeks with biweekly follow-up visits.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBridging treatments, such as oral hygiene instruction and hydrogen peroxide treatment, aim to decrease the microbial burden of these opportunistic species, decrease periodontal pathogenicity, and reduce local inflammation. A recent controlled trial demonstrated that a local oral hygiene protocol employing a chloride dioxide gel improved mucosal health and resulted in a significant decrease in the numbers of biofilm species, including Candida, when compared with a routine oral hygiene and antimicrobial therapy, indicating that local antimicrobial therapy improves mucosal health. In contrast, no evidence of fungal colonization and infection was found; and fungus is thought to be an opportunistic pathogen. A review of the available literature revealed a lack of information on hydrogen peroxide treatment of oral mycobiota. No studies have evaluated the effect of dental health education and proper oral hygiene on Candida spp. and fungal communities, and there is no information on the effects of an office-level intervention using hydrogen peroxide fumigation. This study has the potential to provide new insights and information. Given the limited information available in the literature regarding this topic and the need to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 infections and mortality rates among patients with oral mycoses, it is important to explore the effects of oral hygiene and hydrogen per",

Study patients who met criteria for the first time in the previous study will be randomized into 2 groups: control group (intraocular injection of ranibizumab after 1 month) and experimental group (intravitreal injection of ranibizumab after 1 month and 20 injections of ranibizumab subretinal injection after 20 weeks)\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study was to establish the effects of intravitreal ranibizumab injections and its efficacy and safety, and 15 eyes of 15 patients with choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia (13 women; 2 men) were enrolled from July 19, 2017 to August 30, 2020. All patients received only a monthly injection of intravitreal ranibizumab. The results of this pilot study showed that there is a tendency for visual acuity to improve regardless of treatment with ranibizumab, but that improvement in visual acuity is more significant in the group that received more frequent intravitreal injections. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and adverse effects of intravitreal ranibizumab for choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia by comparing the two groups. We are conducting a prospective randomized controlled trial of 12 patients with unilateral choroidal neovascularization associated with pathologic myopia who met the clinical inclusion and exclusion criteria during a 16-month observation period from December 19, 2018 to December 17, 2019.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nComparison of the Efficacy and Safety",

I'm glad I could help. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPatients with severe burns may have delayed healing and are prone to serious complications due to the loss of the skin barrier and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and cellular stress responses associated with burn injuries. Recent studies found that topical allantoin administration can suppress cellular stress responses and promote re-epithelization in skin cell injury models. Moreover, topical allantoin significantly enhanced wound healing and survival rate in burned pigs. However, the current evidence is limited to animal models and the clinical evidence of allantoin's benefit as an agent for treating burn injuries remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and potential mechanism of action of topical allantoin treatment in patients with severe burn injuries. The researchers will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to investigate the wound healing effects of allantoin gel administration in patients with severe burns and will explore the underlying molecular mechanisms involved. The clinical trial will involve two intervention arms: allantoin gel and placebo gel. Patients in the allantoin group will be instructed to apply the allantoin gel to the burn area (one hour before and after grafting) until the 15th day after grafting. The placebo group will receive the placebo gel treatment in the same way. The investigators will monitor the progress of wound healing by taking clinical photographs and assessing the changes in wound size and the degree of re-epithelialization at regular intervals. The investigators will compare clinical parameters, including body temperature and hemoglobin, to evaluate the clinical efficacy of allantoin gel. In addition, the researchers will investigate the molecular mechanisms of burn wound healing, including the expression of stress response markers (SOD, CAT, and GPx) and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, iNOS, and PGE2). Blood samples will be collected to measure the levels of stress response markers and inflammatory mediators. Moreover, the researchers will assess the expression of stress response markers and inflammatory mediators in wound biopsy samples. The clinical trial will enroll 42 patients with severe burns, which is a sufficient sample size to detect significant differences",

            "Thank you for providing the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this trial. What are the primary and secondary outcomes being measured? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Perioperative hypoxia, defined as oxygen supplement <85%, is common in obese patients undergoing sedation endoscopy. High\u2010flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can be used interchangeably during general anesthesia. We hypothesized that compared to HFNC, CPAP would improve oxygenation and reduce the frequency of desaturations in obese high\u2010risk patients undergoing sedation endoscopy. Patients and Methods: A multicenter, randomized, unblinded clinical trial was carried out on adult and obese high\u2010risk patients (ASA class \u22653 and/or BMI \u226530 kg/m\u00b2) scheduled for elective gastrointestinal endoscopy with deep sedation. The interventions included two devices: a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine (SuperNO2VA\u2122 Et, Vyaire Medical, Haguenau, France) and a nasal oxygen cannula. The primary outcome, the frequency of desaturations, was compared to the standard procedure of using nasal oxygen cannula. The secondary outcomes were the number of apneas per hour and oxygen supplement requirements. Results: Thirty patients were included and randomized to a group using CPAP (n = 15) or nasal oxygen (n = 15). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of oxygen supplement requirements (CPAP 36.1%; nasal oxygen 41.5%; p = 0.684), the number of apneas per hour (CPAP 10.31 \u00b1 37.29; nasal oxygen 82.28 \u00b1 135.71; p = 0.645), or the frequency of desaturations (CPAP 0.07 \u00b1 0.48; nasal oxygen 0.31 \u00b1 0.60; p = 0.253).

In addition, what about the age, gender, and race of the participants? \n\nAbstract:\nTrial Description: The purpose of this study is to develop and validate diagnostic criteria for patients with primary hyperoxaluria (PH). The investigators will accomplish this by assessing the accuracy of the diagnostic criteria. Specifically, the investigators plan to perform a cross\u2010sectional study of PH patients through a centralized laboratory and a clinical team of metabolic\u2010genetic experts. The investigators hypothesize that the currently available diagnostic criteria are poorly performing because the diagnostic criteria are limited to two tests each of which has high sensitivity, but at the expense of low specificity. In addition, the current criteria are insufficiently able to differentiate between the four forms of PH: PH types 1, 2, 3, and 4. The four forms of PH are differentially treated and have varying phenotypes, and these differences are clinically important. By contrast, the investigators propose a new, streamlined panel of assays that have a high negative predictive value for PH and can therefore reduce the number of unnecessary kidney biopsies that are currently performed to confirm the diagnosis: liver magnesium chelation (LMC) and urnine glyoxylate levels. Together with a new criterion for genetic confirmation, the investigators will evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these diagnostic criteria. The investigators will recruit 1000 patients with oxalate stones that have been confirmed by LMC or kidney biopsy and 300 subjects undergoing screening evaluation for oxalate urolithiasis that have normal liver function. The investigators will compare test results from these patients to published criteria to evaluate and validate LMC cutoffs and to evaluate the combination of these novel diagnostic criteria with conventional tests to improve the current diagnostic criteria. By performing this research project, the investigators will better understand PH, which would facilitate early interventions with a goal of preventing end\u2010stage kidney disease. Study Population: There is a strong belief that PH is underdiagnosed due to underutilization of the currently used diagnostic criteria. This is due to the fact that these tests have high sensitivities but poor specificities. The investigators will recruit patients with recurrent calcium oxalate stones to see how many have PH versus no PH. The investigators also believe that there are probably subjects at risk to",

In terms of the specific steps, the patients will be monitored and observed for up to 24 months after the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors or combination therapy, including blood and urine collection at the specified time points for analyzing circulating exosomes. During this period, the investigators will also observe the treatment response and adverse events. Based on the results of this study, we expect to develop companion diagnostic biomarkers that can predict response to immunotherapy for advanced metastatic RCC. The investigators will also use the collected samples to explore new insights into the role of circulating exosomes in the progression and response to therapy of advanced metastatic RCC.

Could you please review the following draft study description with me?\n\nStudy Overview\n-----------------\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most prevalent types of kidney cancer in adults. Around 63,000 cases are diagnosed every year, and approximately 13,500 patients die from the disease in the US alone. There are a few standard therapies for metastatic renal cancer, including surgery, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. However, most patients suffer from recurrent diseases, and no standard of care remains effective for all patients. Metastatic disease is heterogeneous, and the treatment landscape is complex. Although recent advances in immunotherapy have improved outcomes for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, it is imperative to evaluate and monitor the response to therapy. Early identification of patients who will benefit from these therapies is critical. Circulating exosomes are potential biomarkers that can provide such information and help physicians to make informed treatment decisions. However, their biological significance and clinical utility remain unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the role of circulating exosomes in predicting treatment response in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors or combination therapy. The patients will be monitored and observed for up to 24 months after the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors or combination therapy, including blood and urine collection at the specified time points for analyzing circulating",

Currently, vascular bypass surgery or an endovascular approach is the standard of care for patients with PAD. Unfortunately, many patients who have PAD cannot have these surgical procedures due to a high surgical risk or disease progression .

In addition to ECoG, there are two other common interventions used in awake surgery: direct cortical stimulation (DCS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). \n\n1. Direct cortical stimulation (DCS): during the surgical procedure, a brief electric current is applied directly to the brain's cortical tissue. This usually results in the temporary disruption of brain function in the stimulated area, providing information about which regions are important for specific functions. \n\n2. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): a noninvasive technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to measure blood flow in the brain. Faster blood flow to specific areas of the brain suggests that those areas are involved in a specific function. \n\nBoth DCS and fMRI can be useful interventions in awake surgery, and they have been shown to reduce the risk of neurological deficits in patients who undergo surgery to remove brain tumors. \n\nIf you are still interested in using ECoG as the primary intervention, it is important to note that awake surgery under ECoG monitoring with titrated sedation is the least invasive method.

If you need anything else, let me know.\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nRationale: Fibroids are tumors that originate from the smooth muscle of the uterus. In some patients, these fibroids can cause bleeding and abdominal pain. Surgical removal (myomectomy) is the only effective treatment for many fibroids. A new technique called transvaginal hysteroscopic myomectomy or TVHM for short may be a less invasive option. Using 3D hysteroscopy, the investigators will be able to see the entire uterus and make sure that all fibroids are removed. Objectives: - To compare the efficacy of TVHM and the use of 3D hysteroscopy performed by a dedicated surgeon (group A) versus open abdominal myomectomy (Group B). Study Design: Prospective cohort study of patients scheduled for hysteroscopic myomectomy (group A) or open abdominal myomectomy (group B). In both groups, the same type of fibroids will be operated. Interventions: - All operations are carried out by the same surgeon, who is dedicated to the surgery to be performed. - Surgical techniques used: hysteroscopic myomectomy (group A) or laparotomy and total abdominal hysterectomy (group B).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nFibroids are a common benign tumor of the uterus. They are considered a leading cause of heavy bleeding and anemia due to their impact on menstrual flow. Myomectomy is indicated when the tumor interferes with menstrual function or causes significant bleeding. The use of laparotomy and total abdominal hysterectomy is the traditional option. Minimally invasive surgery is now widely used for myomectomy procedures and this type of surgery seems to have advantages for the patient in terms of postoperative recovery and decreased pain compared to open surgery. This procedure is also associated with less blood loss and faster recovery. However, traditional laparoscopic surgery has many limitations. One of the major problems is poor visibility and the need for increased movement by the surgeon; this can reduce"

This includes baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 26 weeks. Additionally, tumor tissue samples, commonly known as FFPE blocks from patient tumor biopsies prior to surgery, will be collected for central molecular analysis. The FFPE blocks are crucial for assessing histopathological characteristics of the NSCLC tumor and evaluating their response to treatment. \nApart from baseline, which includes all three tests - FFPE blocks, baseline plasma ctDNA and a blood sample for circulating cell free DNA analysis - the other visits only require liquid biopsy samples. Specifically, the 4 week visit requires plasma ctDNA and circulating cell free DNA tests, the 12 week visit involves only plasma ctDNA, the 20 week visit only involves circulating cell free DNA testing, and the 26 week visit includes follow-up plasma ctDNA and circulating cell free DNA testing. \nAt each visit, a blood sample for ctDNA analysis will be obtained, which typically involves collecting about 10 mL of blood. The blood sample will be used to extract ctDNA and circulating cell free DNA for further molecular analysis. These tests aim to detect EGFR mutations in the plasma ctDNA and circulating cell free DNA, respectively.

Experimental: Plasma ctDNA and FFPE blocks Control: Standard of Care\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The prognosis of non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the adjuvant setting is highly variable, making identifying patients at increased risk of recurrence crucial for tailoring treatment strategies and improving outcomes. Despite advances in genomic profiling, there is still a need for more sensitive and specific biomarkers to better predict the risk of recurrence and guide treatment decisions. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising biomarker for NSCLC, and its detection in the plasma of patients with EGFR mutations has been associated with a worse prognosis. However, the clinical utility of ctDNA as a prognostic marker in the adjuvant setting of NSCLC is unknown. In this study, we performed a nested case\u2010control study to investigate the prognostic value of ctDNA in the adjuvant setting of completely resected pIB\u2010IIIA non\u2010small cell lung cancer with common EGFRmutations. Methods: We randomly selected 100 patients from the GeparNRG\u2010JACCARO Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (ALTTO trial) who underwent complete resection for pIB\u2010IIIA non\u2010small cell lung cancer with common EGFR mutations (Del19 or L858R). The 100 patients were randomly divided into a case group (n = 25) and a control group (n = 75). Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 6 months after surgery. ctDNA was extracted from plasma and analyzed using a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assay for EGFR mutations. The primary outcome was progression\u2010free survival (PFS). Results: The median follow\u2010up duration was 42.7 months. In the case group, 29 patients (116%)progressed on/after adjuvant erlotinib compared to 29 patients (38.7%) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.12\u20100.68, P <.001).

In such settings, such as primary care clinic or child care institutions, there are few tools readily available for family caregivers to seek help from. In recent years, an increasing emphasis has been placed on mental health as an important contributor to disability, including cognitive decline, depressive symptoms and lower quality of life (Peskind & Potter, 2020; Peskind, Potter, & Schuster, 2020). Many children with visual impairments display a higher level of mental distress compared to those with normal vision  and this is likely be related to increased anxiety and depression (Obeid & Stothard, 2019). Therefore, supporting primary caregivers' mental health could in turn contribute to the enhancement of overall quality of life for these young children and their caregivers. \nThis study has an applied research design, focusing on the intervention development for caregivers of children with visual impairments aged 0-6 years. Participants will go through a five-week web-based intervention involving interactive sessions with a Registered Practical Nurse. The objectives of this intervention is to enhance caregivers' mental health and well-being. Caregivers will be trained to utilize the tools learned to practice self-care and effectively navigate through challenges arising from caring for children with visual impairments. Furthermore, the outcomes will be measured to examine the effectiveness of the intervention in improving the mental health and well-being of primary caregivers of children with visual impairments.\n\nHealth condition",

The phrases were chosen as it was the length of musical phrase that the participants used during self-reporting (i.e., using a scale from 1 to 10) to track their state anxiety levels. Participants assigned to 10 minutes of baseline were instructed to use a musical phrase of 10 measures and had no intervention protocol assigned as this was below their assigned baseline. Participants assigned to 12 minutes of baseline were instructed to use a musical phrase of 12 measures and had no intervention protocol assigned.

This study seeks to address anxiety levels specifically for participants who face systemic racism. It targets the emotional health impact of such issues on the well-being of marginalized communities.It utilizes behavioral intervention strategies in an innovative way by focusing on healing attempts within these systems through storytelling, music therapy, and guided meditations. The data collection will take place over a two-month window. The study will enroll 8 Black American adults aged 18 or older who participate in meditation and who are experiencing increased anxiety due to racism or discrimination. The study will employ a multiple baseline experimental design to assess changes in state anxiety over time. Qualitative interviews about participants' racial experiences and how the intervention impacted these experiences will also be included.

Are there any related studies I should be aware of? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Extracranial\u2010intracranial (ECIC) bypass is the mainstay of treatment in internal carotid stenosis (ICS). While the effect of intensive antiplatelet therapy (IPT) with ticagrelor and/or aspirin remains unclear in patients with ECIC bypass, the safety and efficacy of long\u2010term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with ECIC bypass after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unknown. This study aimed to assess the optimal timing of IPT cessation after ECIC bypass following ICH. Methods: This was a retrospective, data\u2010linkage study using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. We screened 158 patients with ICH and ECIC bypass from 2003 to 2015. Subsequent IPT after ICH and ICS was classified based on the 2017 European Stroke Organization (ESO) guidelines. ICH volume and the functional prognosis were evaluated. Results: Of the 158 patients, 36 were treated with DAPT after ECIC bypass. The mean duration of DAPT ranged from six weeks to four weeks. The most common reason for DAPT cessation was scheduled surgery. The mean ICH volume was significantly lower in the DAPT group than in the anticoagulant group. ICH volumes were comparable between the six\u2010week DAPT group and the four\u2010week DAPT group (P = 0.757). Moreover, the six\u2010week DAPT group showed better functional prognosis and higher rates of ICH and ICS recurrences than the other groups (P = 0.031 and P = 0.041). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the optimal duration of DAPT in patients with ICH and ECIC bypass remains uncertain and may need to be individualized based on factors such as ICT recurrences and risk of stroke recurrences.",

In addition, studies have shown that there is a close relationship between blood fibrinogen (FIB) and ICH, and abnormal changes in plasma FIB level are associated with the severity of ICH. FIB is a marker of myocardial injury, thrombotic myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis. In some studies of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction, FIB levels are related to the degree of injury and prognosis, and in the process of spontaneous fibrinolysis, fibrinogen increases first and then decreases, and fibrinogen deficiency is a predictor of a bad prognosis after stroke. When fibrinogen increases or decreases significantly, the prognosis of patients is affected. Therefore, the mechanism of abnormal plasma FIB in ICH patients is still unclear. This study focuses on the mechanism of pathophysiological increase of plasma FIB in ICH patients, the effects of intravenous fibrinogen reduction on the pathophysiological process of ICH and the improvement of the prognosis of ICH patients, and to assess the value of fibrinogen reduction as a new prognostic target for ICH. Based on the above, this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled controlled study of intravenous administration of fibrinogen-inhibiting drug, 3% of plasma FIB increased patients with intracranial hemorrhage, the intervention of intravenous administration of fibrinogen-reducing agent within 6 to 12 hours after onset may reduce intrahemorrhage",

Therapies that can safely address the causes of a patient's ITP refractory to glucocorticoids are needed. A clinical trial is currently underway in which patients with refractory ITP will receive CM313 injection, an antibody that depletes abnormal B cells.METHODS AND RESULTS: This interventional, blinded (double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled), multi\u2010center clinical trial of an anti\u2010CD38 antibody (CM313 injection) aims to recruit patients with primary ITP who have received previous glucocorticoid therapy and then failed such therapy. The primary objective will be to assess CM313 injections for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. Efficacy will be assessed by platelet count (measured in milligrams per deciliter of fluid; mg/dL) on day 28 and day 56 of treatment. Secondary objectives include safety assessments and evaluating the use of CM313 antibody therapy to promote an ongoing platelet response. The investigators plan to enroll up to 42 patients in the study and anticipate a total of 4\u20108 treatment cycles, depending on the response to treatment. The study is expected to enroll 5\u201010 new patients every month throughout 2022 and 2023.CONCLUSION: The CM313 injection clinical trial offers a potential treatment option for patients with refractory immune thrombocytopenia who have failed glucocorticoid therapy, and it will likely be completed in 2023.",

Could you please start a new session before moving on to other studies? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nHyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technique that provides qualitative and quantitative information on a wide range of materials and is a technique that has been developed to study cancer and other diseases. Our study evaluates the feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and imaging software to image breast lesions and predict which ones are benign and which are cancerous. The system used is the 109-channel hyperspectral camera system developed by the team at the Nanjing University of Science and Technology. This is a feasibility study based on a single center. A total of 260 patients will be recruited in three phases to collect images: the first 50 are to determine the detection parameters used in the imaging system; the next 150 patients are to train the imaging system to establish the accuracy of disease prediction; and the final 60 patients are to validate the performance of the imaging system (verification model).\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHyperspectral imaging (HSI) is based on the idea of using a wide band of wavelengths to obtain information about the optical properties of material, such as molecule size and refractive index, to form an image, which provides quantitative and classification information on a wide range of materials and is an emerging imaging technology of practicality. Our study evaluates the feasibility of using imaging systems and related imaging software to classify breast health and disease status. This study is a prospective multicenter single-arm study based on a single center. A total of 250 patients will be enrolled and divided into three consecutive phases: the first 50 are used to determine the detection parameters used in the imaging system; the next 150 patients are used to train the imaging system to establish the accuracy of disease prediction; and the final 60 patients are used to validate the performance of the imaging system (verification model).

Experimental Arm (CM313 Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 30 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive CM313.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of CM313 injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: This arm is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of CM313 in treating immune thrombocytopenia. By administering CM313 to a subset of patients, researchers can evaluate the drug's effectiveness in improving platelet counts and reducing symptoms. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design ensures unbiased results and allows for comparison with the placebo arm.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator Arm (Placebo Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 15 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive placebo.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of placebo injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: The placebo comparator arm is essential to establish the baseline for comparison with the CM313 intervention arm. By including a placebo group, researchers can assess the true effects of CM313 beyond any placebo effects. This arm helps to control for confounding variables and provides a more accurate assessment of the drug's efficacy and safety.",

Patients will be divided into two cohorts each, one for right-side cardiac catheterization (femoral approach) and the other for left-side (radial approach). If 26 patients cannot be found in the population of each institution, more patients will be recruited from the other study centers. In each center (up to 6 interventions), a consecutive sampling will be used and no interim analysis will be performed. All interventions will be performed by at least two different operators. The use of other devices by the operator is not recommended during both procedures (intervention/control). The safety of the procedure will be assessed during the intervention at the time of cannulation and before removal. If pain occurs at any moment prior to cannulation, pain management will be performed by the physician as usual. At the end of the procedure, the patients will report if they felt any pain during the intervention.

How many groups are there in your trial? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to establish whether there is a difference in the efficacy and safety of the combination of intravenous low-dose hydrocortisone and dexmedetomidine on post-concussion symptoms among the concussed patients in the early treatment compared with standard therapy.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nDexamethasone (Dex) is approved for severe head injury, which may be caused by trauma or stroke. Concussion is a mild brain injury caused by trauma, which is milder than stroke. Concussion commonly presents as headache, memory loss, dizziness, and reduced consciousness after head injury. Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) is a set of symptoms that often occur one to several weeks after concussion and last for weeks or even months. The symptoms cause considerable loss of productivity and economic burden for the individual and the society. In recent years, a clinical guideline recommends that low-dose dexamethasone (0.1-0.5 mg/kg) is widely used to treat PCS, and the efficacy should be evaluated in randomized controlled studies. The main adverse reaction of dex is postural hypotension, which may lead to a decline of blood pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Previous studies have shown that exogenous administration of corticosteroid can relieve inflammatory responses of brain injury, increase the expression of heat shock protein 72 (HSP72), and enhance the neurocognitive function. However, its effect on PCS is unclear. This study aimed to establish whether combining low-dose hydrocortisone (Hydro) (1 mg/kg/d) and dex is beneficial for treating PCS after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). The investigators hypothesized that administering low-dose Hydro combined with dex in the early treatment of post-TBI improved clinical outcomes, CPP and CBF, and reduced biomarkers levels of systemic and CNS inflammation and intracranial pressure in patients with concussion.\n\nOfficial Title",

Our study was aimed to examine the effect of pancreas and kidney transplantation (PKT) in patients with CKD G3\u20104 on long\u2010term clinical outcomes.METHODS: A total of 212 consecutive patients who underwent simultaneous or sequential pancreas and kidney transplantation between May of 2008 and July of 2021 were included. We analyzed patients with non\u2010diabetic kidney (NDKD), diabetic kidney (DKD) and diabetes\u2010independent kidney disease (DIKD) and the incidence of major renal adverse events (MAKE) and metabolic adverse events (METAKE).RESULTS: Twenty\u2010two patients (n = 22, 10.4%) had NDKD, 128 (n = 128, 60.3%) had DKD, and 62 (n = 62, 29.2%) had DIKD. There were no differences in patient survival or graft survival. NDKD patients had a higher incidence of pre\u2010transplant diabetic retinopathy and hepatitis C virus infection. Post\u2010transplant, DIKD patients had a greater rate of graft failure, cardiovascular complication, METAKE, and MAKE. Although there was no difference in long\u2010term graft survival, NDKD patients had a lower rate of pancreas loss than DKD or DIKD patients. DKD patients were more likely to have C\u2010reactive protein > 10 mg/L on day 1 and day 3 after surgery.CONCLUSION: PT for end\u2010stage kidney disease patients with a better prognosis is recommended. Patients with NDKD could achieve better insulin sensitivity and lower graft loss than DKD patients. However, patients with DKD had better",

So, let me ask you what are you trying to evaluate or what are the objectives of your study? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Mood disorders frequently contribute to treatment\u2010resistant psychosis, with patients often being burdened by comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms during episodes and beyond. In this study, we tested the efficacy of cognitive enhancement and acceptance\u2010based therapy (CEAT; Witt et al., 2014) in patients with recurrent depressive disorder (DD; ICD\u201010 F32.0\u201039.2) and psychosis with a long\u2010term history who met diagnostic criteria for psychotic features (PF; Diener, et al., 2020). Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized into a standard clinical condition or standard clinical care plus CEAT. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks post\u2010randomization in the German Language Assessment and Treatment in Schizophrenia (GLATESS), including scores for cognitive ability, insight, and quality of life. Results: In 62 patients undergoing a mean length of 26 weeks of CEAT, a significant main effect of CEAT was found across time, with significant improvements in quality of life and in insight into the presence of psychosis, whereas cognitive symptoms remained overall stable over all measurement periods. A significant interaction effect indicated that treatment gains were significant only among patients with psychosis. In patients without psychosis, CEAT was as effective as standard clinical care overall. Finally, a significant main effect for sex showed that women displayed greater improvements in quality of life in the CEAT condition, compared to men. Conclusions: The findings indicate that CEAT can be a valuable adjunct for treatment\u2010resistant patients, particularly those with psychosis. Overall, a trend towards better outcomes was found for women. In conclusion, we argue that the incorporation of CEAT into evidence\u2010based clinical care might be a useful adjunct in the treatment of comorbid psychotic disorders.\n\nIntroduction\nPsychosis commonly coexists with depressive and manic symptoms. This comorbidity often manifests as psychotic features and has been shown to significantly contribute to a worse clinical outcome .

            "Great! Who is funding or supporting the study? For example, University of Texas - Southwestern? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of the study is to learn more about a new technique for relieving chronic pain in post-heart transplant patients on long-term immunosuppressant therapy. In this study, patients are randomized to receive either a sham procedure (placebo treatment) or the new technique, which is called transcranial random noxious stimulation (RNS). RNS involves a small, hand-held device that is held lightly against the scalp at the area of chronic pain for ten minutes. Sham treatment is a pretend procedure. The purpose of the sham procedure is to ensure that neither the doctors nor patients know which procedure is being utilized. This is important because research has shown that positive and negative expectations about treatment can influence its effectiveness (a concept called conditioning). The sham treatment is designed so that patients do not detect which treatment they are receiving. To help ensure that patients in both groups have a positive study experience, all patients also receive an educational session about pain management and lifestyle issues. There are 30 study participants for this study.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHeart transplantation has saved thousands of lives in the past 50 years. However, it has caused chronic pain, sleep disruption, fatigue and other symptoms in some patients. These symptoms are often challenging to treat. Although heart transplant recipients are given powerful medications to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ, these medications may worsen these symptoms. Chronic pain that occurs in these patients is multifactorial and poorly understood. In some individuals, it may be related to medication toxicity. In others, it may be caused by post-operative pain that is no longer treated with conventional therapies. An alternative technique to treat chronic pain is to stimulate the brain. This is done using a small hand-held device. This procedure, known as transcranial random noxious stimulation (RNS), is applied to the scalp for 10 minutes per day. In patients undergoing heart transplantation, we hope to determine if this technique helps to reduce chronic pain. We will recruit 15 heart transplant patients who have persistent chronic pain from a variety of causes. All participants will be interviewed and will complete questionnaires before, during",

The same timeline and treatment duration apply as the experimental group. \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: Epidural transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is an accepted method of postoperative pain relief following lower abdominal surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether preoperative pre\u2010emptive TAP block compared with conventional multimodal analgesia effectively reduces postoperative opioid requirements for analgesia in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery. Materials and Methods: Thirty American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery were included in the study and randomly divided into two groups: The experimental and control groups. Patients in the experimental group received pre\u2010emptive bilateral pre\u2010TAP blocks, and patients in the control group were given conventional multimodal analgesia. Postoperative analgesia was provided by patient\u2010controlled intravenous administration of fentanyl and acetaminophen. The primary outcome was opioid consumption within 24 hours during the intra and postoperative period, secondary outcomes were the numerical rating scale (NRS) recorded in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and 12 hours after surgery and NRS scores for pain intensity and sensory and motor functions at regular intervals for the first 36 hours postoperatively. Analgesia consumption and side effects were also recorded. The results were analyzed using Student's t\u2010test. Results: The postoperative fentanyl consumption (p<0.007) as well as acetaminophen consumption (p<0.001) 24 hours postoperatively was significantly decreased in the TAP group compared with the control group. The postoperative pain scores 12 hours after surgery were also significantly lower in the TAP group at rest (p=0.001) and during coughing (p=0.001). In addition, the time between arrival at the PACU and the patients' first demand for IV fentanyl injection was significantly higher (p=0.001) in the TAP group. The total",
            "I am pleased to report that the trial has been successfully completed and the results have been published in a reputable medical journal. We found that hamstring stretching alongside conventional therapy resulted in greater improvements in pain and function compared to conventional therapy alone after 12 weeks. We concluded that hamstring stretching is a valuable addition to conventional therapy for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Overall, the trial was a great success, and we were able to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of hamstring stretching in the management of this common foot condition."

In this placebo\u2010controlled phase 2 study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TGRX326 in patients with ALK\u2010positive, non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer.METHODS: Patients with previously treated ALK\u2010positive, non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either TGRX326 at 60 mg once daily (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30). Tumour assessments using RECIST and PFS were evaluated by an independent review committee. All patients received the study medication until they experienced disease progression or study drug\u2010related adverse events.RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 62 years (range 37\u201079), and 61.1% of patients were male. The disease status of patients was stage IV (50.0%), locally advanced, or metastatic at inclusion. Baseline blood ALK levels and tumour histology were similar between the two groups, with adenocarcinoma being most common (87.5% and 90.0%, TGRX326 and placebo groups, respectively).

The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019) is growing rapidly in China, especially outside of Wuhan now. However, no specific treatment has yet been found for this disease. The current study was designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03b12b combined with ribavirin (RBV) therapy in COVID\u201019 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, China.METHODS/DESIGN: Eligible patients will be randomly sequenced into an IFN\u2010\u03b12b + RBV group and a control group at a ratio of 1:1. IFN\u2010\u03b12b (400,000 U intramuscular injection [IM], once daily for three doses) combined with RBV (400 mg twice per day, orally) for 3 days will be administered to patients in the IFN\u2010\u03b12b + RBV group. Only RBV (400 mg twice per day, orally) for 3 days will be administered to patients in the control group. The clinical efficacy of the two groups will be compared.DISCUSSION: Previous studies have shown that IFN\u2010\u03b12b and ribavirin have the potential to be effective drugs in the treatment of COVID\u201019 patients with mild symptoms. This study aims to further evaluate the efficacy of the combined therapy in treating patients with mild symptoms of COVID\u201019.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2200069832; Registered 11 July 2022.\n\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic. \n This virus, which causes an acute respiratory disease, first appeared in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and quickly spread across the world.

Video laryngoscopy (VL) has been proposed because of the anticipated decrease in oropharyngeal secretions and better glottic view. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of VL in children aged 0\u201036 months in routine anaesthetic practice. Methods: A prospective, observational study was performed on a single centre with a two\u2010group design. During a 4\u2010month period, a total of 600 children underwent routine general anaesthesia for elective surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with VL in 300 children (VG) and with direct laryngoscopy in a straight blade (DB) in the other 300 children (DG). The primary objective was the glottic view after the second intubation attempt. The secondary objectives were the rate of successful VL, the view grade, the time to successful endotracheal intubation and overall success rate, adverse events and number of attempts with each laryngoscopic technique. Results: The median age in VG (35 months) and DG (40 months) groups were comparable (P = 0.610). The percentage of successful VL on the first attempt was significantly higher in VG (88%) than DG (72%) (P < 0.001). The overall success rate in the VG and DG groups was 100% and 99.7%, respectively. The overall success rate in the first three attempts was higher in the VG group. The glottic view on the second attempt was significantly better in the VG group (2.6 vs 1.0, P < 0.001). A more favourable glottic view for both groups decreased the odds of repeated attempts at laryngoscopy. The number of laryngoscopic trials before successful intubation was lower in the VG group",

This arm will help determine if 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT can provide additional information or improve diagnostic accuracy compared to standard imaging.\n\n3. Participant Group/Arm: Healthy Control Group\n   Intervention/Treatment: Participants in this arm will serve as healthy controls to provide baseline data for comparison with renal tumor patients undergoing 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT imaging. This arm is important to establish normal ranges and patterns of 18F-FAPI-RGD uptake in healthy individuals, which can aid in interpreting the results of the imaging studies in renal tumor patients. This arm will help differentiate normal physiological uptake from pathological uptake in renal tumors, enhancing the diagnostic utility of 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT in this patient population."

Could you please provide some details on the measures and what they aim to assess?\n\n[S]\nSure! The outcomes of this trial revolve around knowledge, attitudes, and practice. To assess knowledge, we will be asking respondents about their understanding of breath testing technology, its applications, and its limitations.\n\nTo measure attitude towards breath testing, we will use the Attitudes Towards Breath Testing for Disease Scale. This scale comprises items that capture the respondents' attitudes towards the use of breath testing for various diseases.\n\nNext, to evaluate practice, we will ask respondents about their intention to use breath testing for themselves or their family members. This will allow us to assess how willing they are to adopt breath testing as a tool for health surveillance or disease detection.\n\n[B] Fantastic! By using these measures, we will get a comprehensive understanding of the public's perception of breath testing. \n\nNow, can you tell me a little bit about the duration of participation for the participants in this study?\n\n[S]\n\nYes, the duration of participation will depend on the respondents' availability. The survey will only take about 15-20 minutes to complete, so it should not take up too much of their time.\n\n[B] That sounds like an acceptable time commitment for the participants.

[/CONS]\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The purpose of the study was to analyse the effects of different preoperative exercise intensities on functional recovery of patients undergoing major surgery. Methods: A total of 86 patients undergoing major urethral surgery (retropubic prostatectomy) were included in the study and distributed into four groups: rest, low and moderate intensities of physical exercise. The following clinical variables were assessed: age, Body Mass Index (BMI), American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA I\u2010II), functional exercise capacity (VO2max), postoperative recovery \u2010 time to first flatus, time to oral food intake, time to hospital discharge, time to convalescence and hospital stay. Results: Patients of group 1, 2 and 4 did not differ for any variable analyzed. However, the group 3 (moderate\u2010intensity physical exercise) showed a negative correlation between VO2max, time to first flatus and time to hospital discharge when compared to the group 1 (rest). There were no differences in postoperative recovery \u2010 time to food intake, time to convalescence and hospital stay. In a multivariable regression analysis, time to food and hospital discharge were associated with lower VO2max (\u20104.02 and \u20103.82, respectively, p<0.05). Conclusion: Low and moderate exercise intensity did not improve postoperative recovery parameters of patients undergoing major urethral surgery. Further studies are necessary to determine whether exercise intervention with higher intensities positively impacts the postoperative recovery process."

The aim of this study is to assess the effect of metformin in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Methods: Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance and patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who do not present advanced liver disease, not on anti-viral therapy (NAF) and with fasting plasma glucose \u2264 200 mg/dl will be recruited. Patients will be randomly allocated to the two groups; the control group (group A) will receive NAF therapy only and treatment with metformin will be left according to clinical criteria. The experimental group will receive the same therapy as the control group but plus treatment with metformin. In both groups, metabolic parameters will be evaluated at baseline and in each visit, and changes in insulin resistance will be evaluated with the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). A biopsy of the liver will be performed at the beginning and at six months, in order to find changes in the fibrosis score (Ishak fibrosis score). All patients will undergo three-dimensional ultrasound at the beginning and at the end of the study to assess possible alterations in the amount of fat, volume and echogenicity, and to follow up on the change of hepatic function (FibroScan\u00ae).

Patients in this arm will be further subdivided based on the presence or absence of specific conditions. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nIntrauterine insemination (IUI) is a common assisted reproductive technologies (ART) procedure for couples with unexplained infertility. This study will help in identifying the factors that contribute to successful outcomes in patients undergoing IUI through a post-wash total motile sperm count (TMSC) over 5x10^5 .\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAlthough intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a common treatment for infertile couples, the success rate is still modest. To improve the success rate of IUI, it is important to identify factors that are associated with positive outcomes. One of the most important factors is the post-wash total motile sperm count (TMSC). Previous studies have shown that there may be a link between the post-wash TMSC and the success rate of IUI. However, these studies have had limited sample sizes and have not been conducted in a randomized controlled setting. In the current study, we aim to investigate the relationship between the post-wash TMSC and the success rate of IUI. We will recruit 120 infertile couples who will undergo IUI using fresh semen in our hospital. The couples will be divided into two groups based on the post-wash TMSC: Group 1 (high-quality sperm) will have a post-wash TMSC of \u2265 5 million/ml, and Group 2 (low-quality sperm) will have a post-wash TMSC of < 5 million/ml. All couples who do not undergo any other treatment or use any other assisted reproductive technologies (ART).

What would be the participant group/arm and intervention/treatment for this arm? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nInvestigators will compare a new intra-oral local anesthetic (lidocaine with added clonidine) to the standard intra-oral local anesthetic (lidocaine) to determine if the new intra-oral local anesthetic provides equivalent dental care for patients with special health care needs. Investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled, blinded, 3-arm clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of dental anesthesia for children using two different types of intra-oral local anesthetics (Lidocaine with added clonidine and Lidocaine) and a normal saline placebo to determine which type of anesthesia is most effective in the dental clinical setting.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAn intra-oral soft tissue injection of local anesthetic will be administered for participants randomized to the control (Lidocaine with Normal Saline), treatment (Lidocaine with Clonidine) or the placebo (Normsaline) group. Local anesthetic injections will be administered by a pediatric dentist trained in the administration of local anesthetic. A research team member will observe the injection and participants. Participants will have completed the pre-treatment survey and the Child Behavior Inventory with parents prior to enrollment. Participants will have completed the pain scale and the child-administered dental anxiety questionnaire immediately after the procedure. Investigators will have an initial screening procedure that will involve verifying the eligibility of the participant and parent and obtaining consent and assent (if applicable). Investigators will obtain data for the pre-treatment survey and administer the 11-item Beck's Anxiety Inventory for anxiety. Investigators will use a standardized pain assessment technique, the Wong Baker pain scale for pain. Investigators will use a child-administered dental anxiety questionnaire (CHADIS) for anxiety evaluation. Children above six years of age participate in the study with their own self-administered evaluation of anxiety and will also be evaluated by the Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS",

After a stroke, patients often require long-term hospitalization or outpatient care. Because of the high treatment cost and the difficulty of finding care facilities that accept patients with stroke, many patients remain in a state of dependence for a long time in Turkey. Moreover, people in rural areas and those with no access to specialized rehabilitation centers are disproportionately affected. To provide sustainable services to a wide range of patients, it is essential to expand access to treatment centers and train more physiotherapists in stroke rehabilitation. To this end, our clinic, with its experienced staff and its state-of-the-art facilities, began to expand its capacity by opening a specialized physical therapy department. Currently, people with limited mobility from different geographic locations seek services at our clinic from physiotherapy practitioners with knowledge and experience in stroke rehabilitation.

The standard treatment for localized PCa is surgical management with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Despite the efficacy of treatment, relapses and local and/or distant recurrences still represent a problem for most patients. In this regard, new diagnostic modalities could contribute to improving patients' survival and life expectancy. The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of choline positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a diagnostic test for metastatic PCa. Methods and results: This study is a retrospective review based on medical records of a tertiary center with more than 1328 patients affected by PCa. Medical records of a total of 85 PCa patients who underwent choline 11 C PET/CT examination between 2020 and 2021 were included. Overall, 56 patients had pathological lesions (group 1) and 29 had a negative scan at the time (group 2). Results: The mean interval from the date of surgery and/or radiotherapy was 5.87 years (range 0.9\u201015.4 years). Overall, 22 patients (26.1%) had relapses of disease (6 non\u2010castrated and 16 castrated). The median PSA level at time of exam was 4.6 ng/mL (range 0.12\u201024.12 ng/mL), and among the patients affected by biochemical recurrence, the median PSA value was 4.6 ng/mL (range 0.1\u201014.5 ng/mL). Overall, a total of 17 patients (20.0%) had a positive scan, which showed 4 positive bone metastases, 2 positive lymph nodes, and 5 positive lymph nodes with bone involvement.

In terms of interventions, for the experimental arm, stopping sedation and targeted temperature management (TTM) early after identifying a favorable EEG pattern is our primary intervention. Additionally, we can wean patients from mechanical ventilation if appropriate. However, there are certain interventions that we should avoid using in the experimental arm. Can you provide me with a list of the interventions that should be excluded for this study? \n\nStudy type\n=================\nInterventional\n\nStudy design\n=================\nParallel\n\nDescription\n=================\nIn this study, we aim to evaluate the feasibility and safety of early weaning from ICU treatment in patients with a favourable EEG pattern after successful targeted temperature management (TTM). We will conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study involving 29 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) after a successful cardiac arrest.\nWe will randomly assign patients into 2 groups: the experimental arm and the control arm.\nThe experimental arm will consist of 15 patients who will receive early weaning from sedation and TTM within 12 hours after the initiation of targeted temperature management (TTM). The intervention in the experimental arm will involve the cessation of sedative medications as soon as the patient is stable and has a favourable EEG pattern. The temperature will be decreased to a target temperature of 34\u00b0C for 24 hours. Neuroimaging studies (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) will be performed to assess the neurological status of the patient, and if the neuroimaging results are within acceptable ranges, the patient will be allowed to wean off sedation and TTM within 12 hours. The experimental intervention will end when the patient is fully weaned off sedation and TTM. We expect the duration of ICU stay to be about a week.\nThe control arm will consist of 14 patients who will receive standard care as per the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines for the management of comatose patients. The intervention in the control arm will involve the cessation of sedative medications as soon as the patient is stable and has a favourable EEG pattern.",

However, the purpose of this study arm will be therapeutic, and the biomolecular metrics gathered from the diagnostic tests will be used to develop targeted therapies for melanoma. \n\nThe focus shifts from diagnostic tests and biomarker discovery to developing precision medicine approaches for individualized patient treatment. \n\nThis study arm will build on the data collected in the diagnostic study arm and leverage it to advance melanoma treatment. It's a logical progression that allows us to harness the power of the data and develop treatments tailored to specific patients. \n\nIn terms of the study type, we would consider it interventional, as it involves the application or implementation of a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention. The phase would also be similar to the first study arm, as it focuses on diagnostic and therapeutic applications of the biopsies. \n\nThe sample size and power calculations will depend on the specific objectives and hypothesis of the study.

People with a history of melanoma are at an elevated risk of developing new non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancers in the future. This is partly due to the lack of awareness and knowledge among patients about skin cancer risks and prevention. Furthermore, as a result of pandemic, patients are reluctant to visit doctors for a skin examination. The impact of the lockdown and a low number of dermatology consultations could have adverse long-term health effects on dermatology patients. It may also increase the number of melanomas and non-melanoma skin cancers discovered at advanced stages when their treatment is typically more costly and less curable. The study uses an innovative approach in clinical research to combine the benefits of in-person clinical care and teledermatology consultations. Patients at higher risk of developing skin cancer will attend either a virtual or in-person appointment with a dermatologist or nurse. Participants will be assigned to one of the three research groups in this study to better analyze the impact of virtual consultations on the management of high-risk patients. The research groups are: A group of patients undergoing routine follow-up visits with a dermatologist will continue to receive standard clinical care during their appointment. B group of patients who attend a virtual consultation with a dermatologist or nurse practitioner during the appointment, which will be followed by an in-person skin examination. C group of patients who attend an in-person consultation with a dermatologist or nurse practitioner during the appointment. The group that participates in virtual consultations, as well as the group that attends a face-to-face telehealth consultation, will continue to receive standard care from their dermatologist or nurse practitioner.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is a single-center study involving both a retrospective and prospective aspect.

Primary Objective of study: To investigate the effectiveness of a 7-week lifestyle and diet intervention with a special focus on food label on improving the quality of nutrient intake as measured by the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) in a group of older adults with low physical and mental activity.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe study is a mixed-method single-blind experimental study conducted in the primary care health centre (PCP) of Villanueva de la Serena (Spain) in the province of Ciudad Real (Spain). The study includes 21 subjects of 65 years or older who were selected from the electronic register of the Primary Care Center with no contraindication to participate in physical exercise or physical training, without any dietary or supplementary restriction, and who meet the study's eligibility criteria. Subjects are being recruited from June 3, 2022 until December 14, 2022. Subjects are divided into two experimental groups with 11 subjects each receiving a lifestyle, nutritional and cognitive intervention with a special focus on food label and a control group of 10 subjects without intervention. For this work, food labels are used to inform consumers or the public about what is contained in pre-packaged foods and to help make simple and informed choices about them, facilitating the proper nutritional quality of food, particularly in healthy Mediterranean diets. The intervention is based on a lifestyle modification program in which participants are encouraged to become physically active, consume healthy foods and beverages, stop smoking, avoid drinking alcohol excessively and cope with stress. Nutritional intervention is also based on the Mediterranean Diet model. The educational intervention will be carried out exclusively through group physical training sessions aimed at improving the level of physical activity, and group cognitive sessions aimed at improving executive functions and nutrition, with a final objective of improving diet",

Evidences indicated that NMDA receptor activity could be regulated by local endocannabinoids (eCBs) endogenously released during needling. This study aimed to explore the possible neurobiological mechanisms by which endocannabinoids released during acupuncture at two different target sites (Acu and Lung\u201010, LU10) modulate pain by modulating the brain's activity via NMDA receptors.METHODS: Twenty\u2010two healthy participants underwent an electroacupuncture stimulation (EA) session involving either LU10 (the control stimulation point, n\u2009=\u200911) or Acu (the target stimulation point, n\u2009=\u200911) for 30\u00a0minutes on one day, and the experimental condition was switched to the opposing condition the next day to explore the possible neurobiological mechanisms, followed by a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiment.

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nProstate cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers in men worldwide. It accounts for more than 1.1 million new cases and nearly 308,000 deaths each year, and prognosis remains poor in advanced disease stages. Although several therapies have shown great efficacy in treating prostate cancer, there is still a need for new therapeutic approaches to better manage its treatment. A subpopulation of aggressive prostate cancers harboring DNA damage response deficiencies (DDR) is emerging as an attractive therapeutic target. Tumors with DDR deficiencies are sensitive to platinum-based therapies (e.g. cisplatin), but the majority of patients develop drug resistance. Intratumoral heterogeneity is the main cause of drug resistance and may be exacerbated if tumors acquire DDR deficiencies. To counter this resistance, we propose that dual targeting of DDR pathways using a combination therapy that includes cisplatin will provide higher survival. In order for this combination therapy to be successful and minimize off-target effects, it is necessary to determine which DDR genes are most involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and to understand their effects when targeted. Using a combination of genome-wide CRISPR screens and high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics analysis, our preliminary data suggested that multiple DDR-related genes (e.g. BRCA2, RAD51C, and MRE11A) are involved in the development of prostate cancer (PC). Here, we hypothesize that inhibiting these genes will be more effective in prolonging survival in PC. To validate our findings on an individual basis, we will use a panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models that recapitulate the tumor's heterogeneity. This combination will allow us to assess the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in combination with drugs targeting specific DDR genes in models that better reflect the patient's tumor heterogeneity. We will also determine how the combination of cisplatin and specific DDR gene inhibitors changes the response of PC to chemotherapy by measuring changes in various cellular features,",

It is projected that 55,440 people will have been diagnosed with new cases of pancreatic cancer and 44,330 individuals will have died from the disease in 2019. It is one of the most difficult cancers to detect until it has reached an advanced state. At that point, fewer than 20% of patients survive 5 years, and even for those, there is often intolerable disease progression. If it is possible to diagnose pancreatic cancer in its pre-symptomatic phase or even in its early, yet asymptomatic phase, it is possible that pancreatic cancer could be treated with organ-preserving treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. We have recently found in our laboratory that changes in salivary amylase could be used to diagnose pancreatic cancer at this early stage (15-20 days before the onset of the first pancreatic cancer symptoms). Moreover, in our laboratory we have also found that there are changes in the levels of certain proteins in other types of cancer, including colon and breast cancer, as well as in certain benign cancer mimickers, in the days and months before the onset of the first symptoms of cancer. We have developed a technology that uses a biochemical chip in conjunction with a microarray reader that allows us to measure the levels of two proteins in saliva, Alpha-amylase and IL-1beta. We propose to use this technology to measure these two proteins in saliva samples collected from patients who are being evaluated for possible pancreatic cancer. We hope that the data obtained from this project will lead to the development of a rapid, non-invasive, low-cost diagnostic test for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, that will be available within months of first symptoms.

In addition, patients with food-specific IgG4-induced allergic disorders often do not respond to traditional food-specific IgE elimination diets. However, research on food-specific IgG4-mediated allergies is limited, and it is unclear whether food-specific IgG4 can be used as a new marker of food allergy.

Additionally, it might also be possible to decrease the required number of anti-VEGF injections by decreasing the need for frequent dosing when combined with an anti-VEGF agent.4,10,11 Preliminary research has shown that both high drug concentrations and/or low drug concentrations have potential to benefit proliferative diabetic retinopathy, including neovascularization reduction and macular edema control.12 Clinically, zot"

The Mediterranean diet is associated with several clinical benefits, including the maintenance of healthy body weight, as well as reduced risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, neuropsychiatric diseases, and some types of cancer . These benefits are attributed to the dietary approach of the traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD), which includes a high consumption of plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, olives, nuts, and whole grains. These foods are rich in antioxidants and other substances with functional benefits. On the other hand, the TMD has a moderate to high consumption of fish and seafood, poultry, and eggs. These foods supply essential minerals and high-quality animal protein.\nIn the case of the Spanish population, a diet rich in fruit (two servings per day), vegetables (four servings), and extra virgin olive oil as the main fat is commonly recommended. However, most people have",
            "What are the main differences between this arm and the standard program? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nSmoking rates among rural communities are approximately double that of urban communities. To better understand how smoking is tied to poverty, lack of social support, and low employment, the investigators hypothesize that the relationship between mental illness and smoking will be more closely tied to negative financial circumstances than positive social relationships in the context of living in low-resourced environments. The investigators will determine the role of each of these circumstances in smoking initiation and maintenance. To test this, they are going to perform a randomized community intervention trial in the rural community of Dixon, California using community paramedics and other service provider as interventionists. The community paramedicine model has been used successfully to improve health outcomes and health literacy in rural communities. The investigators are adding a novel component to the existing program by randomizing participants to either a standard intervention (standardized assessment/evaluation followed by counseling and referral) or a standard intervention + additional behavioral health and social support interventions (a behavioral economist-based intervention tailored to the specific challenges facing participants in the Dixon community. This intervention will include providing participants with rewards to provide a strong incentive to quit and improve financial outcomes; increasing social support by linking these participants with job placement and resources for improved employment. The investigators will use the Take a Break (TAB) mobile health intervention as a motivational tool. This novel tool will be used to increase motivation for positive behavior changes in response to financial rewards by increasing self-awareness of negative behaviors that are financially costly and to build social support by connecting rural smokers with peers for support and rewarding healthy behaviors. The investigators will test whether this intervention will lead to a reduction in smoking in Dixon. The investigators will assess the impact of the interventions on short-term and long-term smoking cessation as well as other risk behaviors.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nMany rural communities in the United States lack access to primary and specialty care. The consequences of this are dire and well-documented. Individuals in rural communities tend to have higher rates of smoking, cardiovascular disease, mental health disorders, and death than their urban counterparts. To make this worse, communities with higher poverty rates have less resources to support residents who are ill. One such resource is community param",

To investigate the relationship between spasticity and daily life difficulty and changes in the gait pattern.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between spasticity and gait in spinocerebellar ataxia. The investigators will investigate whether the walking stability is associated with plantar flexor spasticity of the ankle. They will measure the electromyography (EMG) of the bilateral soleus and gastrocnemius muscles during walking. They will then measure the ankle joint torque when a voluntary torque is applied to the ankle. These tasks will assess spasticity, which is defined as the excessive resistance to passive stretching of a muscle by hyperactive stretch reflexes. Ataxia is assessed by the timed up and go test and the Berg Balance Scale, which are commonly used assessments of balance. The investigators will then administer a questionnaire on walking disability to assess the relationship between walking disability and the ankle plantar flexor spasticity, as well as the amount of joint torque. Finally, the changes in plantar flexor spasticity of ankle during walking are examined using a step-by-step gait analysis technique. In order to carry out these analyses, the investigators will take a step-by-step gait measurement with the participant wearing a pair of shoes that do not allow movement during walking. During the exercise, the participants will be asked to walk at a comfortable pace while maintaining good body balance.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Relationship Between Spasticity and Gait in Subjects With Spinal Cord Injury\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nSpasticity\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients with tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury (SCI group) Outpatients who are being treated and discharged from the outpatient department of Hanyoung rehabilitation hospital outpatients who can walk at a speed of less than 5km/h Exclusion criteria: Cognitive or sens",

It is often associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and can contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. Effective treatment is critical for improving the prognosis and quality of life for those with this condition. In addition, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a common reason for hospitalization and increases the overall burden on healthcare systems. Therefore, designing a clinical trial to investigate safe and effective treatments for diabetic cardiomyopathy is of great medical need.\nThe treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy often involves a combination of lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and, in some cases, surgical procedures. \n(Table present) Lifestyle modification, such as weight loss, regular exercise, and a healthy diet, is important for reducing the risk of heart failure and improving cardiovascular health. Pharmacological treatment strategies for diabetic cardiomyopathy include the use of medications that can help to improve blood sugar levels, such as insulin and metformin. Surgical procedures, such as coronary artery bypass grafting, left ventricular assist devices, and heart transplantation, may be considered in severe cases. \n(Table present)\nHowever, there is a need for more effective and safe treatments for diabetic cardiomyopathy, and research into new therapeutic strategies and interventions is ongoing. Clinical trials play a critical role in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of new therapies and ensuring that they meet the standards for regulatory approval and widespread adoption.\n\n2. Objectives\n2.1. Main Objective\nThe purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new therapeutic intervention for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The study aims to examine whether the intervention can help improve cardiac function, reduce heart failure symptoms, and improve overall quality of life for patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy.\n2.2. Secondary Objectives\nThe secondary objectives of this clinical trial include:\n-  To evaluate the impact of the intervention on blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and other cardiometabolic parameters.\n-  To investigate the effects of the intervention on cardiac",

The objective of this study was to compare respiratory health indicators between young children of parents who use HEPA filtration systems in their residences to those of children whose parents do not use such systems. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was conducted from November 1999 to June 2001 in 96 residential apartments in Hanoi, Vietnam. Of these, 45 were provided with an electro\u2010mechanical HEPA filter (HEPA) and 51 received no intervention (Control). All children enrolled in the RCT (n = 232) were exposed to filter or control air 24 h per day. Respiratory health indicators investigated included respiratory symptoms, nasal secretions, and pulmonary function. We found no statistically significant differences between the HEPA and Control groups in the incidence rates of cough, cold\u2010associated symptoms, or wheeze, or in the levels of nasal secretion. There was also no significant difference in pulmonary function between participants in the HEPA and Control groups. In conclusion, home filtration of air in high\u2010rise apartments in a tropical environment did not prevent respiratory illness in young children in a controlled environment. The results suggest that the benefit of HEPA filtration for children should be reconsidered.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Home filter systems have been recommended as a preventive measure against respiratory illness for many years, and their use is increasing in high\u2010rise apartment buildings in East Asia's megacities. However, the few studies showing their efficacy had limitations regarding their study design and methods, as well as in the definition of the target population and study duration. Moreover, little is known regarding the benefit of HEPA filtration for children.

This study aimed to compare the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and hand\u2010assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a minimally invasive surgery technique, with laparotomy with or without nerve block, as the gold standard operation in relieving postoperative pain, with less postoperative discomfort. METHODS: This randomized, active\u2010controlled, blinded, comparative clinical trial recruited ninety patients from April 2013 to March 2015, with the aim of comparing pain scores, analgesic use, surgical complications and postoperative length of stay following bilateral vagotomy in patients undergoing LC, laparotomy and hand\u2010 assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy. RESULTS: There was no signi\ufb01cant difference in the pain scale values within the first 24 postoperative hours in patients receiving bilateral vagotomy during hand\u2010assisted laparoscopic cholecystectomy, LC, or laparotomy. Also, no signi\ufb01cant difference was revealed in the use of analgesics among patients who underwent LC or laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

I'm glad to have assisted you. \n\nStudy Summary\n=================\nBackground: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects about 10-15% population and can accelerate cardiovascular disease progression. Despite this, CKD patients have long-term poor follow-up and management of cardiovascular disease with many patients not reaching target treatment. The current study will develop and pilot an intensive, structured cardiovascular disease management program for CKD patients to optimize management of blood pressure, lipid, and glycemic control targeting 10-year CKD patients (eGFR >60 ml/min) with cardiovascular disease. Methods and design: The REDCAPS study (REnal disease Cardiovascular prevention Adjunct for Patients with stable hemodialysis) involves a 12-month prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) for CKD patients receiving dialysis at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). Participants will be randomized to either an intervention group (IG) that will receive additional assistance for medication compliance, cardiovascular monitoring, education, and other aspects of cardiovascular health, or the control group (CG) that will receive usual care. The primary outcomes of interest will include the proportion of participants meeting each of the target cardiovascular medications and targets. Secondary outcomes of interest will evaluate cardiovascular disease outcomes including death, hospitalization, new coronary disease, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, stroke, or coronary revascularization. Discussion: The REDCAPS trial aims to evaluate the impact of an intensive cardiovascular management program on medication adherence and other established clinical cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients. Successful completion of this short-term RCT will enable development of a protocol for a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing CKD management with cardiovascular care to usual care alone.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nRenal Disease Cardiovascular prevention Adjunct for Patients With Hemodialysis Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nEnd-stage Renal Disease, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Renal Disease, Diabetes Mellitus, Type II, Cardiovascular Diseases, Chronic Kidney Disease"

            "What is the purpose of this intervention or treatment? \n\nAbstract:\nTo investigate the impact of a Vitamin Energy Shot on resting energy expenditure (REE) in young and middle\u2010aged adults. To compare the energy expenditure of caffeine and amino acids provided by a commercially available Vitamin Energy Shot with those provided by caffeine and amino acids provided by dietary supplements. 1 Methods Seventy adult subjects completed all 4 experimental conditions (Vitamin Energy Shot, Placebo Shot, Placebo Capsule, Placebo Drink; n\u00a0=\u00a06 per condition) in a randomized, crossover study. Data was collected at baseline and 30, 60, 90, and 180 minutes after consumption in each treatment condition. REE (kcal/day, measured in kcal/min) was estimated from indirect calorimetry measurements during the final 20\u00a0min of each 30 minute testing period in the laboratory (Freedom\u00ae \u00ae Body Composition Analysis, Cosmed). 2 Results Dietary supplements containing caffeine with or without amino acids stimulated REE in a manner similar to the Vitamin Energy Shot. The total amount of metabolized energy in kcal following consumption of the Vitamin Energy Shot was 171 \u00b1 32, which is slightly lower (p < 0.02) than the 188 \u00b1 20 kcal following consumption of the caffeine\u2010only supplement. REE was significantly increased from baseline immediately following consumption, with effects peaking at 60\u00a0minutes, before gradually returning to baseline levels by 120\u00a0minutes. 3 Conclusion The energy expenditure of a typical Vitamin Energy Shot is comparable to the energy expenditure produced by other dietary supplements containing caffeine and amino acids, indicating that the energy expenditure does not depend on the delivery mechanism. REE can be elevated for 60 minutes after consumption of a Vitamin Energy Shot, providing a significant thermogenic effect.",

Surgery-associated inflammation, as well as an unavoidable rise of rejection medication, both impede tissue healing and encourage progressive fibrosis in patients with biliary strictures. With the development of endoscopy, balloon dilation and biliary stents have become important techniques for treating biliary strictures. They are minimally invasive, cause minimal trauma to the tract, and are capable of relieving jaundice. A randomized controlled study in Taiwan, which focused on biliary strictures not related to liver transplantation, found that more than 90 percent of strictures were manageable with ERCP, with 84.8 percent needing only balloon dilation and 13.7 percent requiring stenting. ERCP is safe and effective for the treatment of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in patients who have undergone liver transplantation. However",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Communication Bridge\u2122 team consists of an interventionist, a neurologist, and a neuropsychologist. In a randomized, single\u2010group, single\u2010 and multi\u2010case experimental design, participants with primary progressive aphasia received 10 sessions of Communication Bridge\u2122 and were assessed at baseline and post assessment using the Aphasia Quality of Life Scale and the Communicative Behavior Rating Scale for Family Members. RESULTS: We identified 4 participant dyads to participate in the study. Three completed the study, with another pending completion. Preliminary results showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful increases in participants' quality of life and care partners' satisfaction with communication.

Patients in the first group will receive pulsed radiofrequency ablation in addition to the antispasmodic medicine, while this is not provided to patients in the second group, and they will only receive placebo. For the patients in the first group (treatment group), antispasmodic medicines, consisting of Baclofen 5-10 mg, Tizanidine 2-4 mg, and  Oxybutynin 5-10 mg will be prescribed and the treatment protocol will be adhered to. Before the radiological procedure, patients who need antispasmodic medications are given the necessary oral premedication, and in the case of lack of sedation, they are prescribed Diazepam 5 mg. To induce sedation and achieve the necessary analgesia, 1-3 mg Propofol diluted with normal saline with a volume of 20-25 cc per kg is given to all patients at the desired rate. An assistant monitors the patient's vital signs (heart rate, pulse oximeter, and capnogram) throughout the study. All patients are placed in the prone position on the operating table, and following this placement, the lumbar spine is washed with 25-100 ml normal saline. In the treatment group, two needles are inserted from L3 and L4 3mm below the laminae on the right and left sides and are visualized on fluoroscopy. Following the successful insertion of the needles, the superselective injection of 1 mL of contrast medium is performed bilaterally to ensure needle placement. After two minutes of contrast injection, the needle positions are fixed in 10mL of normal saline at a temperature of +37\u00b0C.

Little is known about the time course of pain and muscle damage markers after intermittent running. Purpose: To compare the kinetic and the kinematic differences between vertical sprinting and intermittent sprinting as measures of vertical and horizontal jumping abilities. Methods: 64 male soccer athletes (age 22.67\u00b13.39 years, 174.00\u00b16.02 cm, 76.38\u00b19.92 kg, mean\u00b1 SD) participated in the study. Participants who had history of injury and a low score on the AIS questionnaire were excluded. Participants performed 2 vertical jumps and 6 horizontal jumps before and after 90s of downhill running on different gradients (\u22121%, \u22123%, \u22125%), downhill repeated sprints with 10m shuttle runs (\u22122%, \u22124%, \u22126%) and control condition. Maximum jump height and jump time was calculated for vertical and horizontal jumps respectively. Vertical Jump height reduced immediately after downhill running at all downhill gradients (P<0,05). However, there were no changes in jump height reduction after the different downhill running gradients and control condition. Horizontal jump time significantly improved for 10m vertical jumps in all groups (P<0,05). Similarly, there was a significant improvement in horizontal jump time for 5m horizontal jumps in all downhill running conditions and control conditions, whereas vertical jump time improved only immediately after the intermittent sprinting. Conclusions: Exercise caused significant changes in vertical and horizontal jump parameters. The greatest changes were seen for intermittent sprinting. However, the differences were not associated with EIMD, and the exact mechanisms of change are yet to be clarified.",

Previous studies on the efficacy of PCB as a tool for cervical cancer patients were not available; its effect on the time of the onset of anesthesia, the need for supplementary analgesics, and quality of recovery have not been studied. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of ultrasound-guided paracervical block on the onset of pain relief after cervical or abdominal hysterectomy.\n\nScientific Summary\nTo date, no study has systematically assessed",

            "That seems like an interesting approach. The cold compressing group will receive cold compress interventions on their hands and feet. The temperature will be lowered to around 12-18 degrees Celsius. The application of cold compresses is conducted before and after Oxaliplatin administration. I'm interested in why this temperature range was chosen for the cold compressing intervention.",
            "Study Arm #1: Control Group\nNo specific interventions will be applied to the hands and feet. Patients will receive the standard care model in terms of treatment. The effect of interventions on the hands and feet in reducing peripheral neuropathy symptoms and improving the quality of life of patients undergoing chemotherapy will not be assessed in this study arm.\n\nStudy Arm #2: Hot Compress Group\nThe hands and feet of patients will be subjected to hot compress interventions. The temperature control will be maintained within the range of 37-38 degrees Celsius. The interventions will start 15 minutes before the administration of Oxaliplatin and last for 15 minutes after the injection. Monitoring for adverse reactions is crucial to ensure patient safety.\n\nStudy Arm #3: Cold Compress Group\nThe hands and feet of patients will be subjected to cold compress interventions.

            "Perfect! Now that we have all the necessary information, let's start designing the study arms. We have three study arms: the control group, the hot compressing group, and the cold compressing group. The control group will not receive any specific interventions on their hands and feet. For the hot compressing group, temperature control will be maintained within the range of 37-38 degrees Celsius. The application will start 15 minutes before the administration of Oxaliplatin and conclude 15 minutes after the injection. As for the cold compressing group, temperature control will be maintained within the range of 12-18 degrees Celsius.

            "Certainly! Let's start with the control group. In the control group, no interventions are applied to the hands and feet. This allows us to compare the effects of hot and cold compress interventions with the standard care model. By having a control group, researchers can determine the baseline level of peripheral neuropathy and quality of life in the absence of any additional interventions.",
            "In the hot compressing group, patients will receive hot compress interventions on their hands and feet. The temperature control will be maintained within the range of 37-38 degrees Celsius. By applying hot compresses before and after Oxaliplatin administration, the goal is to potentially alleviate peripheral neuropathy symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Monitoring for adverse reactions is crucial to ensure patient safety.",
