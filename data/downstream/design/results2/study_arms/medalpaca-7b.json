Sham Comparator: Attention control\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will receive attention control in the form of static stretching.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Participants in this arm will undergo static stretching of eight major muscle groups.\n   - Reasoning: The attention control arm is necessary to compare the effects of aerobic exercise with a non-aerobic intervention. By including this arm, researchers can determine if any observed effects are specific to aerobic exercise or simply the result of increased physical activity.\n\n2. Experimental: 75 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 75 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is designed to test the effects of a low dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity in colon cancer survivors.

Experimental: 150 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 150 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm aims to evaluate the effects of a moderate dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity.

Experimental: 225 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 225 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is designed to test the effects of a high dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity. By including a higher dose arm, researchers can assess whether increasing the duration of exercise further improves outcomes compared to the lower dose arms.\n\n5. Experimental: 300 min/wk aerobic exercise\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will engage in aerobic exercise for 300 minutes per week.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention will involve moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is included to evaluate the effects of a very high dose of aerobic exercise on chemotherapy relative dose intensity.

The mediator helps participants develop a personal and sensitive understanding of artworks by encouraging the expression of feelings, impressions, and interpretations. This approach aims to foster a more subjective engagement with the artwork. What do you think about this arm?",
            "That's a valid concern. A smaller group size might allow for more focused and individualized discussions. Perhaps we can consider reducing the group size to 5 participants in future studies. For this particular trial, we can keep the group size at 10 to maintain consistency with the classic intervention arm. Does that sound reasonable?",
            "Great. Now, let's move on to the second arm, Active Comparator: Classic Museum intervention. This arm includes participants who will undergo a classic museum intervention for six weeks. The classic intervention involves weekly museum visits in groups of 10 participants, guided by a volunteer guide trained in art history. The guide provides information about art pieces, the artist, and the historical context of the artwork without influencing the participants' discussions or interpretations. This arm serves as the control group to compare the effects of the well-being intervention. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "I agree. Having a control group will provide valuable insights into the unique benefits of engaging with art in a more personal and subjective manner. Now that we have designed both study arms, here are the full study arms:\n\n1. Experimental: Well-Being Museum intervention\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants who will undergo a well-being museum intervention for six weeks.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Weekly museum visits in groups of 10 participants, with the support of a museum mediator.

In the second arm, participants will receive the unprocessed starch product first (it's the first intervention), followed by the modified starch product. The purpose of the design is to examine if the modified starch product has different effects when consumed after or before the unprocessed starch food. The starch products used are both food-grade starches, and the puddings that are used as food sources of the starches are formulated to be low in ash, fiber, and other components that could affect digestion and absorption of the starch.\n[note this would be the full description of the study]\nI'm happy with the design of the study arms, but wondering about two things:\n\nI see a concern or potential confusion of the general public/readers about why the study arms are called \"Processed Starch, then Native Starch\" and \"Native Starch, then Processed Starch.\" The words \"then\" and \"after\" could be confusing for individuals who are not familiar with scientific research. Is there a way to more clearly label the two arms without using the words \"then\" and \"after\" in both titles in a way that would still keep the order of the starch consumption the same as I described in my design?\nThere are a lot of people in the starch community who use a non-standard definition for \"native starch\" that only includes starches like potato starch and cornstarch, but not rice starch. My working definition of \"native starch\" includes all starches that would be typically found in their natural state in the \"grain,\" like rice, wheat, corn, potato, etc. (i.e., without food processing and extraction; the term \"native\" in my usage does not mean that it's found in its natural environment; it's referring to the original starch found in the harvested, intact \"grain\").

Experimental: Standardized After Visit Instructions Only\n- Participant Group/Arm: Standardized After Visit Instructions Only\n- Intervention/Treatment: Behavioral: Standardized After Visit Instructions Only\n- The intervention took a standardized approach to after visit instructions which included a customizable template that would review patients' conditions, changes in any medications, and any future labs, imaging, or referrals.\nReasoning: This arm allows researchers to evaluate the impact of standardized after visit instructions alone on patient comprehension. By providing patients with a structured and consistent format for post-visit instructions, the researchers can assess whether this approach improves patient understanding of their health information.\n\n3. Active Comparator: Standardized After Visit Instructions & Teach Back\n- Participant Group/Arm: Standardized After Visit Instructions & Teach Back\n- Intervention/Treatment: Behavioral: Standardized After Visit Instructions & Teach Back\n- This intervention included the Standardized After Visit Instructions and included teach back, a process by which patients restate in their own words their understanding of their condition, what was discussed in the visit, and what potential changes were made\nReasoning: This arm allows researchers to evaluate the impact of combining standardized after visit instructions with the teach-back method on patient comprehension. By incorporating a feedback mechanism where patients repeat back the information discussed during the visit, researchers can assess whether this interactive approach further enhances patient understanding compared to standardized instructions alone.",

Patients without complications after LSG:\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients who undergo Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy without developing any complications in the perioperative period.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention involves performing Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on patients without any complications.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is necessary to establish a baseline for comparison. By including patients who do not experience complications after LSG, we can analyze the normal physiological responses and values of NLR, PLR, and PIV in these patients. This arm will help in identifying any significant changes in these parameters that may indicate complications in other study arms.\n\n2. Patients with complications after LSG:\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients who undergo Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy and develop complications in the perioperative period.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The intervention involves performing Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on patients who experience complications.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is crucial for assessing the diagnostic importance of changes in NLR, PLR, and PIV values in detecting complications. By comparing the blood parameters of patients with complications to those without complications, we can identify any significant variations that may serve as early indicators of perioperative complications. This arm will help in understanding the predictive value of these parameters in identifying at-risk patients.\n\n3. Control Group:\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Healthy individuals with normal BMI values who do not undergo LSG.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: No specific intervention or treatment mentioned.\n   - Reasoning: The control group is essential for comparison and establishing a reference point for the study. By including individuals with normal BMI values and no comorbidities, we can compare the blood parameters of these individuals to those undergoing LSG. This comparison will help in determining the impact of LSG on inflammatory markers and identifying any significant differences that may be attributed to the surgery.",

Continuous variables will be summarized summarized as mean and standard deviation (SD), median and Interquartile range, or percentiles, as appropriate. Categorical variables will be summarized as counts and percentages. Normality of distribution will be determined using a non-parametric measure of data such as the Shapiro-Wilk Test (for data normally distributed) or the \u03c72 test (for data not normally distributed).\nThe primary endpoint is the change in CA 125 level from baseline between two time points within specific time windows following primary treatment (procedure 1) and surgical debulking (procedure 2), as well as following relapse (procedure 3). We will use linear mixed modeling to measure change for the primary endpoint based on procedure 1 and procedure 2, and survival analysis for the primary endpoint based on procedure 3. These models will account for clustering of measurements within patients within the groups.\nFor the planned biomarker - response table, we will use the following test for trend and the Higgins-Mantel chi-square test to assess the association between CA 125 level and change in CA 125 level over time, and between CA 125 level at baseline and CA 125 level at follow up, respectively.\nWhen the CA 125 change or CA 125 level at time X minus CA 125 level at time 0 is normally distributed, we will treat the change in CA 125 level at time 1 and the CA 125 level at time 0 as continuous variables and will compare those CA 125 levels among groups using two-sample t-tests.

This intervention aims to address hopelessness, death anxiety, and caregiver burden in the relatives of patients receiving palliative care.\n\n2. No Intervention: control caregiver group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: The control caregiver group consists of 33 participants who will not receive any intervention during the study period.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Participants in this group will not receive any psychoeducation intervention and will serve as a comparison group for the experimental caregiver group.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!"

By administering CM313 to a subset of patients, researchers can evaluate the drug's effectiveness in improving platelet counts and reducing symptoms. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design ensures unbiased results and allows for comparison with the placebo arm.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator Arm (Placebo Intervention):\n- Participant Group/Arm: 15 out of 45 enrolled subjects receive placebo.\n- Intervention/Treatment: Intravenous administration of placebo injection once a week for 8 doses.\n- Reasoning: The placebo comparator arm is essential to establish the baseline for comparison with the CM313 intervention arm. By including a placebo group, researchers can assess the true effects of CM313 beyond any placebo effects. This arm helps to control for confounding variables and provides a more accurate assessment of the drug's efficacy and safety.",

It will introduce organizational structure to support delivery of transitional care processes, including the use of electronic health record (EHR) templates, Connect-Home Plus Toolkit, and staff training. The intervention will consist of two steps. In Step 1, SNF nurses, therapists, and social workers will develop a Transition Plan of Care and prepare the patient and caregiver to manage the illness and functional needs. In Step 2, a dementia caregiving specialist will make three calls to the patient's home within 30 days of discharge. The intervention will focus on key care needs such as home safety, symptom management, medication reconciliation, function and activity, and coordination of follow-up medical care.",

The experimental arm, labeled as the Intervention arm, aims to test the effectiveness of the Connect-Home Plus program in improving transitional care for patients with Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias and their caregivers. By introducing new organizational structures and processes, we aim to enhance the delivery of transitional care in skilled nursing facilities and after discharge. This arm includes the development of a Transition Plan of Care, preparation of patients and caregivers, and follow-up calls by a dementia caregiving specialist. The intervention focuses on key care needs, such as home safety, symptom management, medication reconciliation, function and activity, and coordination of follow-up medical care. This study arm is crucial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of the Connect-Home Plus program on patient and caregiver outcomes.",
            "Indeed. The inclusion of structured processes and follow-up support plays a vital role in improving patient outcomes, reducing caregiver burden, and enhancing the overall quality of care during the transition from SNF to home. The two-step intervention approach ensures comprehensive addressing of key care needs, and the use of technology and training tools further enhances transitional care delivery. By evaluating the impact of the Connect-Home Plus program, this study arm will provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of tailored transitional care for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and other dementias.",

Participant Group/Arm: Control Group - Renal Tumor Patients Undergoing Standard Imaging (e.g., CT/MRI)\n   Intervention/Treatment: Participants in this arm will undergo standard imaging techniques such as CT or MRI to compare the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT with standard imaging modalities in detecting renal tumors. This arm is essential to provide a comparison group to evaluate the potential added value of 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT over conventional imaging techniques. This arm will help determine if 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT can provide additional information or improve diagnostic accuracy compared to standard imaging.\n\n3. Participant Group/Arm: Healthy Control Group\n   Intervention/Treatment: Participants in this arm will serve as healthy controls to provide baseline data for comparison with renal tumor patients undergoing 18F-FAPI-RGD PET/CT imaging. This arm is important to establish normal ranges and patterns of 18F-FAPI-RGD uptake in healthy individuals, which can aid in interpreting the results of the imaging studies in renal tumor patients.

The rationale behind the choice of active comparator is that the MINST approach is minimally invasive and minimizes the pain, so the patient recovery will be fast, and patients will choose to continue using the experimental therapy. The efficacy and safety of MINST versus SRP is still unknown and needs to be evaluated by a formal RCT. Furthermore, MINST approach requires less training for the operator and results in less stress to the teeth and gingival tissues. MINST also has less chair time, making it more acceptable to patients and more cost-effective.  The primary hypothesis of the study is that the level of CRP, a sign of inflammation, will be significantly reduced post-treatment in the MINST arm compared to the placebo comparator.
