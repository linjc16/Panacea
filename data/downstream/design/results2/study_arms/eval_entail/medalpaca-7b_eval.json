Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor commonly used as a targeted therapy for advanced solid tumors and has previously been shown to have synergistic effects with TTFields in preclinical models.27 The primary endpoint of this arm would be progression-free survival, with a secondary endpoint of overall survival. The optimal duration and dose of treatment with the combination of TTFields and Everolimus will depend on the specific objectives of the study and on the tolerability and safety profile of the combination. Other combinations of treatments could be explored, depending on the research question and therapeutic goals, potentially including immunotherapies or other targeted treatments. The final study design, including the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, study population, dose and duration of treatment, endpoints, and assessments, would need to be developed according to the patient population and disease context. As with all clinical studies, appropriate discussions with regulatory authorities would be required prior to any prospective clinical study.\nTTFields are a promising therapeutic modality for a variety of central nervous system (CNS) conditions, including leptomeningeal metastases. In this approach, weak alternating electric fields are delivered to the brain and spinal cord via an implanted device, targeting cancer cells that have spread to the CNS. The combination of TTFields with other treatments provides a promising approach for improved outcomes for patients with leptomeningeal metastases.\nDr. Olatidoye has received a research grant from and serves as a consultant for Novocure.",

Active post-market surveillance of devices Active post-market surveillance of devices is a surveillance system, performed post-market, that seeks to monitor the safety, effectiveness, and economic aspects of medical devices in order to improve health outcomes, to assure safety and to provide information to improve health policy. Multi-omics approach to precision medicine Multi-omics approach to precision medicine is a systematic analysis of multiple molecular data types including genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data to identify molecular sub-types and targets for individualized medicine. The prescription pattern analysis Prescription pattern analysis is an analysis of prescriptions written for each patient during a set period. It may encompass all medications or specific classes (most commonly opioids, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, etc.) Prescription Pattern Analysis is to optimize medication use and to guide decisions about over-prescribing, under-treating, duplicative prescribing and adherence. \nThe risk allocation table is structured as follows:\n\nGroup/ Arm Intervention Explanation/ rationale Behavioral Cardiac rehabilitation Cardiac rehabilitation is a structured program of exercise, education, counselling and support designed to help people return to the fullest possible level of physical and social functioning after cardiac illness or surgery.

Then, the methods of the study should be described in detail, including the study population, any interventions or procedures, any data collection methods, and how the data was analyzed.

That was a lot of work, but we now have a well-designed clinical trial protocol with five distinct study arms. 435\n38 Clinical Trials in Orthopaedic Implant Design and Evaluation Is this protocol a realistic plan for a clinical trial? 436\n39 Clinical Trials in Orthopaedic Implant Design and Evaluation No, this plan is not realistic because there are too many study arms. 437\n5.3.2 Alternate Designs for a Clinical Trial 437\nOnce we have designed the study protocol, we need to select an appropriate study design. The three most common study designs are parallel-group studies, crossover studies, and adequate -group studies. In a parallel-group study, each patient or group of patients is assigned to one treatment group or arm and follows the intervention for the entire study period. 438 In a crossover study, patients or groups of patients are randomly allocated to receive two or more treatments in a predefined sequence but are unable to cross over from one group to another. In an adequate-group study, two or more treatments are compared using a randomised, single-blind crossover design, that is, each patient or group of patients is randomly allocated to one of the treatments and stays on that treatment for at least the entire study period. 439\nCrossover studies are often used when there are only two or three treatment groups, and the duration of the studies is short. Adequate-group studies are necessary when there are more treatment groups because the results from parallel-group studies can be confounded by the order of randomisation. As mentioned previously, we had a parallel-group cohort study of the Revision LR stem. It would have been more informative if the results had been analysed according to an adequate-group model. 440\nAfter we have developed the clinical trial protocol and selected the study design, we must identify the outcome measures. These outcome measures should be able to assess the effectiveness of the new device under study. As explained previously, a clinical trial for an implant should assess the safety, efficacy, and efficiency of the device. As discussed in Chapter 2, we"

The FTB is a well-studied and commonly performed nerve block, utilized in many orthopedic procedures. The intervention is simple in nature, requiring just a single local infiltration of bupivacaine, along with a popliteal nerve stimulator to identify the optimal intra-peritoneal placement. During a later study, when performing FTB, the popliteal nerve stimulator will also identify the optimal interaneural contact, which the operator uses to confirm satisfactory nerve mapping. The IPACK block is an enhanced FTB, utilizing 0.25% ropivacaine instead of the more commonly used 0.5%, with inclusion of the addition of the popliteal nerve stimulator to optimize the block. The injection volume is also greater, with a total volume of 2 ml injected of 0.25% ropivacaine.

Participants will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: 1) currently seeking treatment for a mood or anxiety disorder 2) have a current or past history of a psychotic disorder 3) any clinical co morbidity that may affect their ability to complete the study measures 4) a history of major medical illness (excluding mild acne and seasonal allergies).\n\nTiming of Measures: The participants will complete screening measures and baseline self-report measures in a face-to-face assessment at the time of consent. They will complete pre-writing writing assignment, post-writing writing assignment and a 5-minute writing check-in every week for the next 5 weeks.\nIntervention Procedures: Participants will be randomized into either writing about an external (e.g., discrimination) or internal (e.g., shame) target. Following randomization, participants will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group. Prior to each writing session, participants will be emailed a writing prompt (e.g., write about an important discrimination experience) and will be instructed to write for 30 minutes. Participants in the treatment group will then be emailed a brief affirming letter that includes facts about the target group and information about the personal negative experiences of a member of the group following the writing task. Following the writing task, participants will indicate the extent to which they experienced the feelings of the member who wrote the letter, and any insights they gained about their own experiences after writing about the target as compared to before. Following the post-writing writing task and the 5-minute check-in, participants will be asked to complete the Week 5 follow-up measures. Participants in the control group will complete the post-writing writing task and the 5-minute check-in as described above, but will not receive any affirming letter.\nMeasurements: Primary outcomes include self-report measures of internalized stigma, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and well-being. Secondary outcomes include measures",

            "Here is my rationale: Exposure to increased levels of non-tailpipe PM has previously been shown to exacerbate asthma symptoms in children and adults, especially in those living in urban areas. However, studies have not been able to definitively prove that the increased non-tailpipe PM is the cause of these exacerbations. This is due to the difficulty in isolating the impact of non-tailpipe PM from other factors that may also contribute to airway inflammation and impairment of lung function. By exposing participants to different levels of non-tailpipe PM in controlled, clinical settings, the researchers can better determine the effect of non-tailpipe pollutants on respiratory function. It is expected that the exposure to increased levels of non-tailpipe PM will lead to a decrease in lung function, as indicated by decreased FEV1 and an increase in peripheral inflammatory markers.\nStudy Arm: Other: Placebo exercise exposure\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants with mild-moderate asthma\nIntervention/Treatment: Participants will be exposed to the same levels of non-tailpipe PM as those in the experimental group, but without changing their medications or other asthma control measures. This is necessary to assess the impact of non-tailpipe PM exposure on lung function in individuals who are well-controlled on their asthma medications. It is expected that the exposure to increased non-tailpipe PM will have no significant effect on lung function as the participants are already adept at managing their asthma symptoms.",

Active Comparator Arm The treatment being studied is compared to the standard of care (or best supportive care). 2. Crossover Arm Some patients are randomized to the intervention being studied, and some are randomized to the placebo. After a set period of time, the treatment groups are crossed-over so that all patients receive the active treatment. 3.

Double Blind Study design in Parallel Groups Both treatment groups receive the intervention being studied but the blind is removed after a certain time point. 5. Open-Label Study design in Parallel Groups (aka Crossover Over Time) Both treatment groups receive the intervention being studied throughout the course of the study. If the treatment has a very well established safety and efficacy profile, this may be a fair and ethical approach, because side effects can be monitored. 6. Open-Label Study design in Crossover Groups Some patients are cross over to the active treatment after an agreed upon time period. In addition, a placebo group receives the intervention throughout the study. Side effects can be monitored in both the intervention and placebo group. 7. Open-Label Study design in Parallel Groups Some patients are crossed over to the active treatment after an agreed upon time period. In addition, a placebo group receives the intervention throughout the study. This design assures that at the end of the study all patients receive the treatment being studied, but the efficacy can only be assessed in the group that has been receiving the intervention through the study period. 8.

Since you do not have a phase 0 or phase I component to your trial, I will assume your trial will be a phase II or III study with one arm/group receiving the recruitment maneuver, and the other(s) not receiving it. Phase II studies typically evaluate the safety and efficacy of a treatment compared to the current standard of care while phase III trials compare a new treatment to a placebo or existing standard of care.  Phase I studies are usually small, have a few participants, and test for safety, dosage, and how the body absorbs and eliminates the new intervention.

[/Body]\nHypersensitivity to dasatinib or quercetin\nIn addition to the general risks of therapeutic studies, participants taking this arm will have the risk of experiencing the known risks and side effects of dasatinib and quercetin.\nDasatinib is associated with reversible cutaneous lupus erythematosus, epidermal reactions, myelosuppression, reversible gastrointestinal and urogenital toxicities, hepatotoxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity.  It can also be associated with an increased risk of bleeding, as well as elevated transaminases.  Participants on this arm will have to be monitored for these risks and side effects.\nQuercetin has also been associated with a risk of side effects, including gastric upset, headache/dizziness, joint discomfort, skin reactions, and dyspnea.  It also has anti-platelet effects which will need to be monitored during the trial.  Finally, it may also lead to increased serum alanine transaminase (ALT), as well as increased bilirubin and/or creatinine levels.  Given these risks, patients on this arm will need to be monitored closely for these symptoms.\nHow will participants be monitored for these risks? [/Body]\nParticipants on the experimental arm will be seen regularly for safety monitoring, which may include blood counts, ECG, and urinalysis at baseline, as well as once a month while receiving treatment, and monthly for up to three months after their last dose.  They will also have a weekly phone call for the first month after their last dose.  If they experience any side effects, they will have more frequent monitoring.\nWill there be a placebo arm? [/Body]\nYes, this study will have a parallel placebo arm for comparison (active control).\nSafety and efficacy of the dasatinib/quercetin combination in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression and schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder in older adults - a double blind randomized controlled trial.",
            "Of course. We could consider a control arm in which placebo is used as a treatment. This could help confirm the efficacy of the combination therapy when compared with an inert treatment. Additionally, this approach could be useful if you're looking to minimize the risk of mistreatment or manipulation by participants who may suspect the true purpose of the study.",
            "That depends on the stage of the agents' development. Dasatinib is a medication for the treatment of certain types of cancer. At this point, it has already been approved by the FDA and so further dosage strengths may not be necessary. As for quercetin, it is a supplement that has been studied in various conditions but at this time has not been approved by the FDA. In a pilot study with a small number of participants, we could attempt a 1:1 ratio while still remaining within a reasonable dose range and limiting risk. If we were interested in studying a higher dosage, we would need to determine what levels are safe and appropriate without increasing the risk of side effects too greatly. As for comparing the combination therapy to single agent therapy, we could first confirm single or small group pilot studies in each disease type with a 1:1 ratio. If both show potential, then a larger group could be compared to see if the combination therapy improves upon single therapy.",
            "As shown above, by considering different dosages of dasatinib and quercetin, we can explore the dose-response relationship and determine the optimal combination for addressing accelerated aging in mental disorders. Exploring the possibility of comparing this combination therapy to individual drugs would require additional information regarding the efficacy and safety of these drugs in treating mental disorders. \n[Drugs & Drug Treatments]",

            "A great technique you can use to generate other study arms is the factorial design. A factorial design is a type of masking design where you create several arms based on different factors with possible combinations. You can then evaluate the effects of each factor on the response variable of interest. Let's see an example. Suppose in our study we want to investigate the effects of time and serum concentration of the topical serum on the efficacy of the anti-aging serum. We can create a two-way factorial design with time and serum concentration as factors. This will have two sets of treatments: 0 days - Control group T0 1 day - control group + serum concentration 2 days - control group T0, 1 day only T3 - control group T0, 2 days only T6 - control group T0, 3 days only T9 - control group T0, 4 days only T12 - control group T0, 5 days only T15 - control group T0, 6 days only T18 - control group T0, 7 days only T21 - control group T0, 8 days only Let's assume that we run a 21-day study, so we will have 8 treatment groups. The final effect will be evaluated at day 21 and the response variable will be the efficacy of the anti-aging serum. What do you think?",
            "One option is to make it a vehicle arm. Participants in this arm will apply a placebo (or vehicle) solution instead of the investigational serum. They will be asked to use the placebo twice daily for the same duration of time as the study arm using the investigational product. What do you think?",
            "Sure! I'd be happy to.\nStudy Arms\nExperimental: Topical serum\nIntervention: Participants will use the investigational topical serum twice daily as instructed\nControl: No topical serum\nInterventions: Participants will follow the same procedure as the experimental group but will not use the intervention.\nEfficacy: Primary Assessments\nEffect on fine lines and wrinkles\nSecondary Assessments\nSkin hydration\nThe following example shows the arm structure of the study in a 2-arm, parallel-group, single-blind, efficacy-only clinical trial design:\nArm A Experimental: topical serum Arm B Control: no topical serum\n(n = 100) (n = 100)\nIn this example, both groups receive all their assessments and interventions, but participants in the experimental arm receive the investigational intervention while those in the control arm receive a sham. All participants are followed up at the same time points and assessments are conducted appropriately; any side effects are tracked and recorded across both groups.  This design is commonly used when evaluating a new cream, ointment, or similar topical product.\nIf this format isn't suitable, different designs include:\nSingle-arm, parallel-group, single-blind: just one arm of the study receives the treatment while the other receives a sham treatment; single-blind: the investigator is blinded to which treatment group the participants are in, double-blind: neither the participants nor the investigators know which group is receiving the treatment and which is receiving the sham; crossover studies: some participants receive the treatment first, then a washout period occurs before they are randomly allocated to one of two groups, one receives the treatment and the other does not."

It is a novel, lightweight, implantable device which uses nerve stimulation to adjust the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance in the heart, resulting in modulation of the baroreceptor reflex.  It is intended to increase blood pressure and reduce symptoms of fainting.  It consists of a pair of stimulation electrodes implanted in the cervical vagus nerve at T6-8, and an antenna which is attached by an extension cord to an encoder/power source which sits outside the body. The device can deliver periodic biphasic stimulation pulses at either C5/C6, C7/C8, or T6/T7.  With the ISO-101 activated, the cuff inflates at the detection of the postural stimulus such as standing or coughing. The ISO-101 provides temporary relief of lightheadedness or fainting by increasing heart rate and contractility, slowing heart rate and contractility, and reducing baroreceptor reflex activity. The ISO-101 delivers therapy only when postural stimuli are detected. The stimulus-delivery mode for the ISO-101 is set during implant and can be either on demand or set to detect postural events. The on-demand mode allows the patient to pre-program the times of the day to deliver stimulus when needed and the postural events to suppress the device during periods when therapy is not needed, as in sleeping or periods when naps occur. The postural events are cued by the patient using a remote patient programmer. The ISO-101 unit can be programmed for either off, on or as needed therapy by the patient using the off/on/on/off programming wand. The on/off/on feature can be set to ensure that stimulus is delivered during on/off periods without interruption for up to 72 hours. The postural events feature will suppress therapy for periods designated by the patient. The battery life is approximately 12 months and programming can be modified during the off/on period.",

            "Sure. In the experimental arm, the intervention is the placement of Rex implants with a machined transcortical portion. The control arm will receive Rex implants with a roughened transcortical portion.  Each arm will undergo the same bone consumption protocol, which will remove up to a 2-mm thickness of bone in the buccal and facial aspects of the jaw.  They will then undergo a bone expansion procedure in which a mechanical distractor is placed on each implant. This will be used to slowly expand the bone in the coronal dimension until the bone crest reaches the desired level. Once the desired bony crest height is achieved, the expansion device will be removed, and provisional restorations will be established.  Once healing is complete, the abutments will be replaced with final Restorative prostheses.",

Sample arm descriptions: 1) Experimental arm: Participants randomized to online workshops of behavioral skills to manage chronic cough during a period of 6 weeks. Sham (control) arm: Participants will receive a brief sham educational intervention of education on cough control (45 min) and will not be asked to do any home practicum, with no further communication with participants once they have completed the training. 2) Intervention & control groups crossed over so that the intervention group (whole protocol) receives their \"sham\" intervention first and then the whole behavioral skills training program.  For the experimental group, the training program consists of five weekly 60-minute group sessions over a 5-week period in the form of interactive online workshops delivered via a secure website. The online system has been used successfully to train chronic pain, insomnia, fatigue, dizziness/vestibular disorders, fibromyalgia, and hot flashes and is being used for irritable bowel syndrome. It is currently in pre-clinical trials for anxiety. The basic format is the same for each session, including 1) CBT based cognitive restructuring around cough as well as anxiety and catastrophic thoughts about cough 2) Relaxation exercises to reduce sympathetic arousal and pain 3) Psychoeducation about the nature of chronic cough, triggers, and medication information 4) Modeling of diaphragmatic and external control techniques using a model of \"tension/pain and discomfort as a muscle cramp\" 5) Homework assignments to consolidate the day's work and to reinforce homepractices 6) Daily reminder emails.

Maitland mobilization involves the use of a single-handed high -frequency (4000 Hz), short-duration stimulation (10 ms), of agonist muscle spindles while passive tension is used to stretch the joint through its full range of motion. Interferential therapy, which is carried out simultaneously, uses alternating high-frequency (20,000 Hz) current of differing intensities delivered on an electrode at one point in the muscle and the reference electrode at a point across the joint to produce a strong muscle response at the reference point while relaxation is induced at the working point. Maintaining full joint range of motion throughout the procedure, the procedure is repeated as necessary. Active comparator arm: Mulligan mobilization and interferential therapy. Mulligan mobilization involves the same technique and procedures as maitland mobilization, however, the high-frequency is doubled (i.e., 8000 Hz). Interferential therapy is the same as maitland.

Specific Aim 2: To investigate the changes in cardiac structure and function following arteriovenous fistula establishment in a 3-year follow-up study in patients with end stage renal disease. Specific Aim 3: To investigate the impact of arteriovenous fistula in the mechanism of heart failure 3.2.5 Study Significance The specific aims we have outlined describe the goals of our current proposal. Our clinical trial addresses an important question in the clinical care of CKD patients. We want to know whether hemodialysis access type has an impact on the structure and function of the heart. We also want to be able to assess whether our hemodialysis patients who undergo AVF have a better outcome than hemodialysis patients assigned to an arteriovenous graft. Importance extends beyond a single center with a specific clinical question in mind but encompasses questions of the generalizable importance with larger implications for the treatment of the general dialysis population. Our clinical trial is not only important because it will provide answers to the questions we posed and answer, but it will also provide an opportunity to educate others about the possible implications surrounding long-term arteriovenous fistula use in hemod"

If the study is not randomized, subjects randomly assigned to receive an intervention are referred to as treated subjects, and subjects not so assigned are referred to as control subjects, the latter observing closely matched to the former for comparative purposes.  To make inferences about the intervention, both treated and unaffected subjects must be followed in an observational study of the same disease or medical condition in the same setting, and the design must minimize other factors that might affect outcome.  Patients with a given disease or condition under study must be \"quasi-randomized\" into the two (or more) groups, so that observational differences that might otherwise bias the results, can be adjusted or excluded.  Ideally, the effects of other factors confounding causal inference are separated from those of the therapy.  \nObservational studies are less expensive than randomized clinical trials, but, on the other hand, are subject to greater misclassification of exposure and effect. This can be ameliorated by long-term follow-up of treated and control groups after crossover, that is, after the subjects' exposure status is determined.\nIf you plan to conduct an observational study, be sure to ask your advisor:  \nHow long to observe the subjects if the intervention is an intervention,\nTo discuss possible prospective funding sources, and\nTo ensure that he or she is not currently serving as a consultant to or otherwise under contract with a company that might be developing the product or device under study.\nExample of Observational Studies\nThe following is a brief example of a research design used for observational studies\nTrial purpose:\nTrial name:\nThe effects of different doses of a new drug A on side effects of post-operative recovery in patients undergoing heart-valve surgery.\nIntervention: Patients will be randomly assigned to one of four different doses of the new drug; untreated patients not so assigned will be considered controls.\nSample size:\nn",

Based on the details you've provided, I suggest the following endpoints:\nPrimary: Accuracy of score interpretation\nSecondary: Overall compliance with the score\nAlternate: Endoscopist-level compliance with the score\nEndpoints 1 and 3 are common for most studies like this. Although endpoint 2 isn't usually seen, it's actually useful in that it allows us to identify endoscopists who are extremely resistant to the change and don't adhere to the new practice. Are there any other endpoints you would like to add or modify?  As you have a very specific time period in mind, I suggest setting a time frame of 1 year to assess the endpoints. Do you think that's too long or too short?  So it's important to note that the time frame may change after discussion with the investigators and committees as they will take into account factors such as the novelty of the procedure and their experience in similar studies. Also, in general, studies involving endoscopists are known for long timelines due to their training process. Are there any regulatory or funding concerns you are aware of that we need to consider at this time?  Based on your information, I suggest the following eligibility criteria for the study arm:\nInclusion: Endoscopists over 18 years old\nExclusion: Any other medical condition that may affect the ability to understand or follow the video instruction, such as visual impairment or severe illness.\nDo you have any other specific details to add? Also, do you have the budget for a team of statisticians to ensure the accuracy of the data?  The Institution Review Board or Ethics Committee must approve the protocol before the study start.

            "Resin-modified glass ionomers have been used widely in Class II posterior restorations due to their fluoride-releasing properties, acid-etch ability and bond strength to the tooth. Although their use with deep caries lesions that are more challenging to excavate may be limited by the reduced depth of conversion as opposed to self-adhesive resin cements, they have the potential to create wide margins for caries removal in occlusal regions depending on the extent of sound tooth structure. Resin-modified glass ionomers may be an interesting option when esthetics of resin bonded restorations are not compromised. Glass ionomer-based cements have the benefits of fluoride release and modest antibacterial properties that may favor a caries resistance, but there is a higher possibility of secondary caries of the margins due to the lack of clinical data backing up long-term marginal integrity. Bulk fill flowable resins provide adequate mechanical properties to hold deeper cavity preparations due to the presence of fillers such as quartz and glass fibers. However, marginal adaptation is still of concern and the clinical management should be performed with extreme care if close proximity to natural tissue exists.  What about esthetics? Are these materials good alternatives to G-nial Universal Injectable?",

            "Certainly. The treatment arms for the study include the experimental arm with the combination of NALIRIFOX plus AD-XRT and capecitabine and the control arm with AD-XRT plus capecitabine. Both arms will receive 3-week cycles of treatment, with the option of continuation to 6 cycles of therapy for subjects who do not progress. I can send you the full description of the study arms if you'd like."

However, the groundtruth study arm table does not contain any information about these exclusion criteria. The groundtruth table only describes the intervention/treatment for the study arm, which is NALIRIFOX + AD-XRT and capecitabine.
