            "A feasibility assessment is indeed important to ensure that the intervention is appropriate and can be effectively implemented in the target population. Here are some suggestions for assessing the feasibility of the digital patient group-education:\n\n1. Patient acceptability: Conduct a qualitative evaluation during and at the end of the 8-week program to assess the acceptability and satisfaction of patients with the digital patient group-education. You could use interviews, focus groups, or questionnaires to gather feedback from the patients.\n\n2. Technology acceptability: Evaluate whether the technology used for the program (Zoom\u00ae video meetings) is acceptable to patients. This can be done by assessing the patients' ease of use, internet access, and access to equipment required for the program.\n\n3. Feasibility of the intervention: Assess how well patients adhere to the program and the quality of the information provided. This can be done by tracking attendance at the video meetings, completion of home assignments, adherence to the activity plan, and any changes in kinesiophobic beliefs and behavior.\n\n4. Practicality: Assess the practicality of implementing the program in primary care settings. This can be done by evaluating the time spent by healthcare professionals on the program and the resource requirements.\n\n5. Cost-effectiveness: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the program compared to standard care methods. This can be done by comparing the costs associated with the program (such as healthcare professionals' time, video-conferencing platforms, study materials) with the costs of other intervention methods.\n\nBy incorporating these assessments, you can gather valuable information on the feasibility and effectiveness of the digital patient group-education, which will help you make informed decisions about the intervention's implementation and further improvement."

By including patients who are already taking statins, we can evaluate the potential benefits of these medications in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nStudy Arm 2:\n- Participant Group/Arm: Patients assigned to the Group II\n- Intervention/Treatment: Atorvastatin and Rosuvastatin (statins)\n- Reasoning: Similar to Study Arm 1, this arm includes patients who will be prescribed statin medication (either Atorvastatin or Rosuvastatin) during their hospital stay. The reasoning behind this arm is to compare the efficacy and safety of statins in patients who have not been taking these medications before (Group I). By including a group of patients who are new to taking statins, we can assess the potential benefits of initiating statin therapy in this specific population.\n\nStudy Arm 3:\n- Participant Group/Arm: Patients who will not receive any statin medications\n- Intervention/Treatment: No statins\n- Reasoning: This arm serves as a control group to compare the outcomes of patients who do not receive statin medication with those who do. By including a group of patients who do not receive statins, we can evaluate the potential benefits of statin therapy in comparison to patients who do not receive these medications. This arm helps to establish the efficacy and safety of statins in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nWhat do you think of these study arms?",
            "The second arm, Group II, consists of patients who were taking statins for at least 6 months and have spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. They will continue to take the statin (rosuvastatin or atorvastatin) as part of the intervention. This arm will help evaluate the impact of statin therapy specifically in patients who were already taking statins before the onset of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.",
            "Good question. In the third arm, Group III, we will include patients without dyslipidemia who are not treated with statins prior to the occurrence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. They will also not receive any drugs as part of the intervention in this trial. This arm serves as a reference group to compare the outcomes of patients with and without dyslipidemia who were not previously treated with statins.",
            "Yes, here are the full study arms:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. Group I: Control group - patients who were not taking statins prior to the occurrence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. They will receive no drugs.\n2. Group II: Treatment group - patients who were taking statins prior to the occurrence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. They will continue taking the statin and will receive up to 10 mg/d of rosuvastatin and up to 20 mg/d of atorvastatin. The statin will be recommended to be taken for 90 days since the occurrence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.\n3. Subgroup Ia: patients who were not diagnosed with dyslipidemia prior to the occurrence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. They will not receive any drugs.\n4. Subgroup Ib: patients with dyslipidemia diagnosed after the occurrence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. They will receive up to 10 mg/d of rosuvastatin and up to 20 mg/d of atorvastatin and will be recommended to take the statin for 90 days since the occurrence of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nThese study arms will help us assess the impact of statin treatment on patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.",

Here they are:\n\nStudy Arms:\n- No Intervention: Control Group\n  - Intervention/Treatment: The control group will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (standard of care).\n- Experimental: Experimental Group\n  - Intervention/Treatment: The experimental group will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy in conjunction with an exercise intervention. The exercise intervention will be implemented concurrently for the full duration of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment.\n  - Behavioral: Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise\n    - Apart from the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (standard of care), participants allocated to the experimental group will additionally participate in a supervised physical exercise program that comprises 3 weekly sessions during the months that the patient is undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Each 75-minute session will comprise a 10-minute warm up, 30 minutes of strength training involving exercise for the major muscle groups, 30 minutes of aerobic training at 40-89% of heart rate reserve, and a 5-minute cool down.",

Please review and let me know if any changes are needed:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. Experimental: Hyaluronic acid injection\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants in this group will receive hyaluronic acid injected into the implant socket before implantation.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Biological: Hyaluronic Acid\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of hyaluronic acid in reducing post-implantation pain. By injecting hyaluronic acid into the implant socket before implantation, the researchers can assess if this method is more effective in pain reduction compared to traditional treatment. This arm allows for a direct comparison between the use of hyaluronic acid and no intervention.\n\n2. No Intervention: Traditional treatment\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants in this group will undergo traditional treatment without any additional intervention such as hyaluronic acid injection.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: N/A\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as the control group to compare the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid injection. By not injecting any material into the implant socket, researchers can evaluate the natural course of post-implantation pain and compare it to the experimental group.

Now, let's summarize the study arms we have designed:\n\nStudy Arms:\n1. Experimental: Intervention\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants in the intervention arm\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Participants will receive Problem Solving Therapy (PST) through videoconferencing or phone sessions. The sessions will occur at a frequency of 1 time every week for 2-3 sessions before surgery and 6-7 sessions after surgery, totaling 9 sessions. The essential components of PST include defining the nature of the problem, generating possible solutions, evaluating and selecting the optimal solutions, and monitoring the outcome.\n\n2. No Intervention: Enhanced Usual Care\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants in the control arm\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Participants will receive enhanced usual care, including additional mental health education in the form of educational handouts mailed or emailed to them.\n\nThese study arms will allow us to assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering PST to older surgical patients and compare its effects with enhanced usual care.",

This arm is important to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 177Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 as a single treatment for patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. What are your thoughts on this arm design?",
            "That's an interesting idea! Considering the goals of the trial and the nature of the first study arm, adding another radioligand therapy could be a useful approach. How about including Flotufolastat F-18 as the second treatment option? This could allow for a comparison between different radioligand therapies in the same patient population. Additionally, including Flotufolastat F-18 could provide more comprehensive data on the effectiveness of various treatment options for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. What do you think?",

Patients should have adenocarcinoma of the prostate, post radical prostatectomy with detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and clinical PSMA PET/CT findings of pelvic uptake only (prostate bed, pelvic lymph node uptake, or both). Their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/Zubrod performance status should be between 0-2, and they should be over 18 years of age. As for the exclusion criteria, patients with contraindications to radiotherapy (including active inflammatory bowel disease or prior pelvic radiotherapy or prior radioligand therapy), risk factors for Lu-rhPSMA radioligand therapy (baseline >= grade 2 myelosuppression, renal insufficiency, or xerostomia), definitive findings of systemic metastasis, unacceptable medical or radiation safety risk, unmanageable urinary tract obstruction or hydronephrosis, or severe acute co-morbidities should be excluded.

Based on the reasons provided earlier, it seems like the liver resection arm is necessary to assess the efficacy and safety of liver resection in patients with impaired liver function. On the other hand, the transarterial chemoembolisation arm is important to compare the efficacy of TACE with liver resection, considering its less invasive nature. This arm may be more suitable for patients with compromised liver function. By comparing the two arms, we can determine if TACE can provide comparable survival benefits to liver resection in this patient population.",

Experimental: SSNB and FNB\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients undergoing TKA.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The combination of SSNB, an injection around the saphenous nerve, and FNB, an injection along the femoral nerve after dividing the musculotendinous plane of the adductor canal.\n   - Reasoning: This arm allows for the direct comparison of the two regional anesthesia techniques in a single session, reducing the influence of confounding factors. It will help evaluate the efficacy of both methods in pain control.\n\n2. No Intervention: Control Group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients undergoing TKA.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: No specific intervention will be performed.\n   - Reasoning: By not providing any regional anesthesia, this arm serves as a baseline for comparison with the experimental group. The decision to not perform any regional anesthesia allows for the assessment of the specific contribution of regional anesthesia to pain management. This arm is necessary to determine the effectiveness of the regional anesthesia techniques being evaluated.\n\n3. Experimental: Reverse Sequence of Nerv Blocks\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients undergoing TKA.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The combination of FNB and SSNB, an injection along the femoral nerve after dividing the musculotendinous plane of the adductor canal, followed by an injection around the saphenous nerve.\n   - Reasoning: This arm investigates the impact of performing the nerve blocks in a different order compared to the standard sequence. By reversing the sequence, the researchers can evaluate the potential influence of the temporal relationship between the two block techniques on pain control. This arm provides additional insights on the optimized sequence of nerve blocks."

            "Certainly! The first arm, the experimental arm, is necessary to assess the effectiveness of AHCC in improving survival outcomes in ovarian cancer patients on adjuvant chemotherapy. AHCC has been shown to enhance immune response by activating NK cells and various cytokines, which could potentially aid in targeted anti-tumor activity. By providing AHCC as the intervention in this arm, we can evaluate its effectiveness in improving survival outcomes in the target population. On the other hand, the second arm, the placebo comparator arm, is essential to establish a baseline for comparison. The placebo will help control for any potential placebo effects or bias in the study. It will also allow us to differentiate the impact of AHCC compared to no treatment, providing more robust and reliable results. The inclusion of standard chemotherapy in this arm ensures that each participant receives the standard treatment for their condition. By comparing the outcomes of both arms, we can determine the true effect of AHCC on survival outcomes in ovarian cancer patients.",

Experimental: AHCC\n- Participant Group/Arm: Participants will receive the standardized extract of cultured Lentinula edodes mycelia (AHCC) 3g orally daily in addition to standard chemotherapy.\n- Intervention/Treatment: AHCC 3g daily is administered orally with water in the morning and evening.\n\n2.

Additionally, a pre-treatment tumor biopsy would be collected prior to treatment. During the trial, samples of blood, stool and urine would be collected periodically. Following the initial T cell infusion, patients would be evaluated for adverse events for the first month but would remain in the trial for up to 5 years, or until a decision was made by the physician to discontinue treatment."

By exposing participants to different air quality environments, we can observe the changes in lung function and other health parameters in response to PM. This arm is designed to test the hypothesis that a two-hour exercise exposure to higher levels of non-tailpipe ambient particulate matter may cause significant respiratory effects among subjects with asthma. Exposing participants to PM at different levels will help us understand the potential risks associated with exposure to higher levels of non-tailpipe traffic emissions in the London urban environment.",

Participant Group/Arm: Laparoscopic Peritoneal Lavage\n   Intervention/Treatment: Laparoscopic peritoneal lavage for perforated diverticulitis\n   Reasoning: This study arm is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of laparoscopic peritoneal lavage as a surgical treatment for perforated diverticulitis. This intervention is commonly used in clinical practice and comparing its outcomes with other surgical methods will provide valuable information for the study's goals.\n\n2. Participant Group/Arm: Primary Resection with Anastomosis\n   Intervention/Treatment: Primary resection with anastomosis for perforated diverticulitis\n   Reasoning: This study arm is important to assess the outcomes and effectiveness of primary resection with anastomosis as a surgical treatment for perforated diverticulitis. Comparing this method with laparoscopic peritoneal lavage and other surgical methods will help determine the preferred surgical method for acute diverticular disease.\n\n3. Participant Group/Arm: Hartmann's Procedure\n   Intervention/Treatment: Hartmann's procedure for perforated diverticulitis\n   Reasoning: Including Hartmann's procedure as a study arm is essential to evaluate its outcomes and effectiveness in treating perforated diverticulitis. Comparing this method with laparoscopic peritoneal lavage, primary resection with anastomosis, and other surgical methods will provide comprehensive data on the different surgical options available for acute diverticular disease.",

            "Perfect! Now that we have all the necessary details, let's design the study arms. Based on the information you've provided, I suggest the following study arms:\n\nStudy Arm 1: Experimental Group\nParticipant Group/Arm: The experimental group will consist of patients with sepsis who will be administered vitamin B6.\nIntervention/Treatment: The patients in this group will be injected with vitamin B6.\n\nStudy Arm 2: Control Group\nParticipant Group/Arm: The control group will consist of patients with sepsis who will receive a placebo.\nIntervention/Treatment: The patients in this group will be injected with 0.9% sodium chloride solution.",
            "Excellent! Moving on to the control group. The participants in this group will receive a placebo treatment with 0.9% sodium chloride solution. This treatment will also continue for one week or until the patient's death. Any changes or suggestions for this arm?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now that we have designed both study arms, let me summarize them for you:\n\n1. Experimental Group: Vitamin B6\n- Participant Group/Arm: This group consists of patients who will receive vitamin B6 treatment.\n- Intervention/Treatment: The participants in this group will receive intravenous injection of vitamin B6 with 300mg/d dosage. The treatment will continue for one week or until the patient's death.\n- Reasoning: This arm is necessary to assess the renal protective effects of vitamin B6 in patients with sepsis. Vitamin B6 has been suggested to have antioxidant properties that may improve renal function in septic patients. By comparing the effects of vitamin B6 with the control group, the researchers can determine the potential benefits of this treatment.\n\n2. Placebo Comparator: 0.9% sodium chloride solution\n- Participant Group/Arm: This group serves as the control arm.\n- Intervention/Treatment: The participants in this group will receive a placebo treatment of intravenous injection of 0.9% sodium chloride solution with no specific dosage.\n- Reasoning: The placebo arm is important to establish a baseline for comparison. The use of a placebo control group helps to control for any potential placebo effects and ensures that any observed differences between the experimental and control groups are due to the active treatment of vitamin B6. It also helps to control for confounding factors that may influence the study results.",

Based on the information you've provided so far, I suggest the following study arm:\n\nStudy Arm 1:\nParticipant Group/Arm: Patients with aortic valve stenosis\nIntervention/Treatment: Intensified follow-up\n\nThis study arm is necessary to assess the re-hospitalization rate in patients with aortic valve stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and receive intensified follow-up. By including this group of patients, we can evaluate the impact of more frequent follow-ups on their outcomes, including re-intervention, quality of life, and overall health status. Additionally, this arm allows for comparison with the standard follow-up group, providing valuable insights into the benefits of intensified follow-up for patients after TAVI.",
            "Alright. The purpose of this arm is to provide comparison data to evaluate the effectiveness of the intensified follow-up approach. By having a standard follow-up group, researchers can compare outcomes and assess whether the intensified follow-up results in better patient management, lower costs, or reduced re-hospitalizations in patients referred for pre-planned elective TAVI. The reasoning behind this arm is that it establishes a baseline for evaluation and helps determine the benefits or superiority of the intensified follow-up approach. Additionally, the standard follow-up arm allows for external validation of the results and ensures the generalizability of the findings. How does that sound?",
            "Absolutely. In the intensified follow-up arm, patients will receive early, intensified follow-up after discharge from the TAVI procedure, including telephone consults and an additional visit to the outpatient clinic. This intervention aims to provide proactive support and monitoring to prevent re-hospitalization among TAVI patients. By intensifying the follow-up care, we can assess whether this intervention is more effective than standard follow-up alone in reducing the risk of readmission and improving patient outcomes. Do you have any questions or suggestions regarding this arm?",

Which arm would you like to discuss first?",
            "Sure. In the standard follow-up arm, patients will receive no specific intervention or treatment beyond the standard follow-up protocol. This arm will serve as the control group to compare the outcomes of patients receiving intensified follow-up with those receiving standard follow-up. It is necessary to have a baseline to assess the effectiveness of the intensified follow-up intervention. Does that make sense?",
            "In the intensified follow-up arm, patients will receive early, intensified follow-up after discharge from the TAVI procedure. This includes telephone consults and an additional visit to the outpatient clinic. The goal of this arm is to test the hypothesis that patient-tailored follow-up can reduce re-hospitalization rates and improve quality of life. The additional support and monitoring provided through intensified follow-up may help in detecting and addressing any issues early, potentially preventing re-hospitalization. The telephone consults and extra clinic visit allow for closer monitoring and communication with healthcare providers, which could lead to better outcomes for the patients.",
            "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. Here are the final study arms we've designed:\n\n1. No Intervention: Standard follow-up\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Patients who will receive standard follow-up care after the TAVI procedure.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: No specific intervention or treatment beyond the standard follow-up protocol.\n\n2.

Experimental: Intervention Group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Intervention group\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Well-Being Promotion Program\n   - Reasoning: This arm is necessary as it is the main focus of the study, aiming to examine the efficacy of the Well-being Promotion Program in enhancing subjective well-being, positive affect, life satisfaction, and reducing emotional/behavioral problems among adolescents. The intervention is designed to improve subjective well-being and is expected to assist in managing emotional and behavioral problems among the participants.\n\n2. No Intervention: Control Group\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Control group\n   - Intervention/Treatment: None\n   - Reasoning: This arm is essential to compare the outcomes of the intervention group with a group that does not receive any intervention. By having a control group, researchers can assess the effectiveness of the Well-being Promotion Program in comparison to no intervention. This helps to determine the impact of the program and establish its efficacy in managing emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents.",

This design is efficient and allows us to evaluate the impact of the intervention with a manageable number of participants. However, if you have any other suggestions or reasons for a different ratio, I'm open to discussing it further.",

How about an experimental arm called \"Sub Dose Level 1\"? For this arm, we can administer REGN7544 orally and parenterally. The participant group/arm will be randomized 2:2 for a single ascending oral dose or parenteral/subcutaneous dose. The intervention/treatment will involve REGN7544 and a matching placebo. What are your thoughts?",

For the control group, participants will receive basic information about COVID-19 prevention behaviors without any persuasive appeal. The intervention will involve reading a flyer with general information on preventing the spread of COVID-19, including actions like avoiding social gatherings, wearing masks, social distancing, and handwashing. This arm will serve as the control group to compare the effectiveness of the other persuasive appeals. By providing participants with only factual information, we can assess the impact of adding persuasive elements to the messages. What are your thoughts on this design?",

Based on the information you've given me so far, I suggest the following study arms:\n\n1. Experimental: VR-TrAC\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the VR-TrAC group will follow the Virtual Reality Training for Aggression.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The VR-TRAC group will undergo a 16-session training program focused on aggression control using virtual reality technology. The training is based on the Virtual Reality Aggression Prevention Training (VRAPT) protocol developed by Klein Tuente et al. The sessions are structured to target different stages of information processing related to aggressive behavior, including early and late stages. Participants will practice handling aggressive-inducing situations in virtual reality scenarios.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is essential to assess the effectiveness of the VR-TRAC intervention in reducing aggression among the prison-based population. The structured training program using virtual reality technology allows for a controlled and immersive environment to practice aggression control strategies. By comparing the outcomes of this group with the control group, researchers can evaluate the impact of VR-TRAC on aggression regulation.\n\n2. Other: Care as Usual\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the Care as Usual group will receive standard care provided in the prison setting.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Care as Usual (CAU) in prison consists of treatments aimed at stabilizing psychological states, such as pharmacological treatment, supportive contact, or transfer to a Penitentiary Psychiatric Centre for necessary interventions.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as the control group for comparison with the VR-TRAC intervention group. By including a group that receives standard care practices in the prison environment, researchers can evaluate the additional benefits of the VR-TRAC program in reducing aggression beyond what is typically provided. This arm helps assess the incremental value of the VR-TRAC intervention in improving aggression control outcomes compared to standard care practices.",

Experimental: early resection\n- Participant Group/Arm: Patients with acute complicated left-sided diverticulitis\n- Intervention/Treatment: Sigmoid resection + antibiosis treatment\nThe reasoning behind this arm is that early resection may be more beneficial in terms of reducing symptoms and complications associated with acute diverticulitis. This arm will help assess the effectiveness of early intervention and its impact on the quality of life for patients.\n\n2. Other: delayed resection\n- Participant Group/Arm: Patients with relapsing diverticulitis\n- Intervention/Treatment: Sigmoid resection + antibiosis treatment\nThe reasoning behind this arm is that early resection may be unnecessary for some patients with relapsing diverticulitis who do not experience acute complications. This arm will help evaluate the outcomes and quality of life in patients with a different disease presentation.\n\n3. Other: conservative treatment\n- Participant Group/Arm: Patients with acute complicated left-sided diverticulitis\n- Intervention/Treatment: Conventional conservative treatment only\nThe reasoning behind this arm is to compare the effectiveness of conservative treatment alone against the combination of conservative treatment and early intervention with resection.

This arm serves as the control group to compare the effects of receiving meals only with the other study arms. It is important to have a baseline comparison group to assess the additional benefits of adding registered dietitian and occupational therapy services. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Exactly! Now let's move on to Arm 2: Meals + registered dietitian services. This arm aims to evaluate the impact of adding registered dietitian services to home-delivered meals. The focus on personalized nutrition counseling can help improve dietary choices and overall health outcomes for participants with cardiovascular disease or diabetes. What do you think about this arm?",

This arm combines the interventions from Arms 2 and 3 to evaluate the synergistic effects of receiving both registered dietitian and occupational therapy services. By assessing the combined impact of these services, the study aims to determine the most effective service model for improving health outcomes in home-delivered meal clients with cardiovascular disease or diabetes. What are your thoughts on this final arm?",

The intervention for this arm is the diagnostic test of multimodal ultrasound, specifically dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound and shear wave elastography performed on the target intestinal loop. This arm will help evaluate the diagnostic agreement between elastographic parameters and the degree of intestinal fibrosis.",
            "That's an excellent point. Including a control or comparison group without any intervention would indeed strengthen the study design. It would provide a baseline for comparison and allow for a more robust evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of shear-wave elastography. I recommend considering the addition of a control arm to your study.",
            "For the control arm, I recommend selecting a group of patients with Crohn's disease who are not scheduled for any surgical intervention. This group can undergo the same diagnostic tests, such as multimodal ultrasound, to assess the degree of intestinal fibrosis. By comparing the results of the control arm with the experimental arm, you can further evaluate the effectiveness of shear-wave elastography in predicting fibrosis.",
            "Certainly! Here are the full study arms:\n\n1. Experimental Arm: Patients with Crohn's disease scheduled for ileo-colonic resection. Intervention involves multimodal ultrasound, specifically dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound and shear wave elastography performed on the target intestinal loop.\n\n2. Control Arm: Patients with Crohn's disease not scheduled for any surgical intervention. They will also undergo multimodal ultrasound to assess the degree of intestinal fibrosis.",

Based on the information you provided, I suggest the following study arm:\n\nStudy Arm: Myocardial Ischemia Stress Test \nParticipants in this arm are patients with suspected hemodynamically relevant myocardial ischemia with or without known CAD.\nIntervention/Treatment: Patients in this arm will undergo an exercise combined with biomarker test, then a pharmacological stress CMR test. The exercise combined with biomarker test involves a pharmacological stress CMR test followed by the injection of a small amount of intravenous gadolinium after a brief period of exercise to evaluate the coronary flow reserve. The second part of the protocol is a pharmacological stress CMR test done with intravenous dobutamine to stimulate the heart muscle. The CMR evaluation involves a detailed heart evaluation with blood pressure measurements and the assessment of myocardial perfusion, function, and viability.\n\nReasoning: This study arm is essential as it is the main focus of the trial. By combining a pharmacological stress CMR test with biomarkers, the study aims to detect myocardial ischemia demand. The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of this novel approach in patients with suspected hemodynamically relevant myocardial ischemia. This arm will compare the diagnostic performance of the combination of biomarkers with the more established invasive fractional flow reserve, which is considered the gold standard. By including this arm, the study can determine if the combination of biomarkers and CMR stress testing can become a new standard of care in cardiac imaging.",
