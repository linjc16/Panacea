            "Great. The third criterion is that the participants should have been seeing a provider within Henry Ford Health System for non-specific low back pain within one year of the initial assessment for the study. This ensures that the participants have been recently diagnosed and should be familiar with their pain and its current status, which will allow them to accurately report their pain and assess its responsiveness to the intervention provided in the trial. What are your thoughts?",
            "Great. For the fourth criterion, we want to include patients with a minimum of three months of low back pain and significant disability, as measured by ODI score of 20 or more. This criterion is based on the consensus criteria proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), which defines chronic pain as pain lasting for more than 12 weeks. We also want to include patients who have significant disability, as measured by ODI score of 20 or more. This criterion allows us to target the individuals with chronic low back pain with significant disability and assess the effectiveness of our intervention in reducing their disability. Any thoughts on or problems with this criterion?",
            "Alright. Regarding the fifth criterion, the participants should not have an active spinal pathology (i.e., discitis, spondylodiscitis, spinal cancer etc.). This is necessary to ensure that the study population consists of individuals with a diagnosis of chronic low back pain and not with an active physical condition contributing to their pain. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The sixth criterion is that the participants should have engaged in physical activity less than four times per month over the previous three months, with a time duration of less than 30 minutes per time. This is important to ensure that we include individuals with a certain level of physical inactivity, which is associated with low back pain and disability. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

To summarize, participants who are adults, 18 or older, have been seen by a healthcare professional for non-specific low back pain, have chronic back pain (at least 3 months), have at least a 4 out of 10 score on the worst back pain scale, have an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of at least 24%, and are fluent in English are eligible for the trial.",
            "Terrific. For the first exclusion criterion, we want to exclude individuals who have medical conditions that require surgery or could require future surgery for low back pain. This ensures that any improvements seen in this study would not be attributable to any future surgeries for low back pain. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The second criterion is the presence of progressive neurological, pulmonary or cardiac disease or history of substance abuse. This excludes individuals with non-back-related medical or psychiatric disorders that could confound the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! The third exclusion criterion is a body mass index of 40 kg/m2 or higher. This excludes participants who may be severely obese and have more complex low back pain issues that may require additional attention. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Definitely. Moving on to the fourth exclusion criterion, we want to exclude participants who have been participating in another behavioral or pharmacologic clinical trial in the past year. This exclusion criteria reduces the risk of bias and ensures the accuracy of the study results. What do you think?",
            "Great. The fifth exclusion criterion is the presence of a history of moderate to severe psychiatric disorder. This criterion excludes participants with serious mental illnesses and ensures that their physical health and well-being are the primary focus of the study.

Any deviation of eosinophil counts from 15/hpf is included, for example, 13/hpf. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Okay, moving on to the third criterion: participants must have at least one gastrointestinal bleeding event (e.g., GI hemorrhage, upper GI bleeding, duodenal bleeding, or gastric bleeding) due to EoG in less than a year before screening to evaluate the efficacy of the drug based on previous evidence that Dupilumab is effective for EoE (Eosinophilic Esophagitis). What do you think?",
            "I agree. Finally, the last criterion is that baseline endoscopic biopsies must also demonstrate active gastritis defined by the protocol. The presence of gastritis is related to the condition being studied, which is necessary for evaluating the drug's effectiveness. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"Brain metastases (unless there is <10% radiographic leak of contrast into the ventricles).\" This criterion ensures that patients with significant metastasized cancer in the brain are excluded from the trial. This is essential to avoid the potential risk of brain metastases and complications during the study. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Indeed, it is. Excluding patients with a history of severe immune-related adverse events helps in ensuring the safety and well-being of trial participants. Moving on, the next criterion is: \"Elective surgery within one month of Cycle 1 Day 1.\" This criterion ensures that patients do not undergo significant surgeries close to their scheduled appointments for evaluations and the administration of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "That's a great point. Excluding patients with recent or active malignancies ensures that the evaluation of the investigational treatment remains focused on the study population. Now, let's move on to the final criterion: \"Clinically significant liver disease (active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, abnormal liver transaminases of grade \u2265 3).\" This criterion ensures that patients who are prone to liver toxicity or with liver dysfunction are excluded from the trial to better assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational treatment. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Understood. Excluding patients with central nervous system involvement helps ensure accurate interpretation of the study results. Now, we have covered all key inclusion and exclusion criteria. We can proceed to the next step, which is formulating the eligibility assessment table. Do you agree to move forward with that?",
            "I agree. Ensuring patient safety and minimizing the risk of adverse events are key objectives in this study. Now, let's discuss the last criterion: \u201cIn the absence of other clinical or laboratory abnormalities interfering with anticancer therapy, any of the following: AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN) for male patients; \u2264 2.0 \u00d7 ULN for female patients.\u201d \u201cTotal bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN.\u201d \u201cWhite blood cell count (WBC) \u2265 4, \u00d7 109/L and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 2.0 \u00d7 109/L.\u201d These criteria are necessary to ensure that patients have adequate laboratory parameters to support the safe administration of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions regarding these criteria?",
            "I agree. Excluding pregnant and breastfeeding women helps maintain patient safety and ensures that potential treatment effects are attributed to the investigational therapy when relevant. Now that we have discussed the key inclusion and exclusion criteria, let's move on to the trial procedures. Are there particular procedures that you would like me to describe in detail?",

            "That's a valid point. Including patients with early-stage solid tumors could expand the patient population and potentially provide valuable insights. However, for this particular trial, the focus is on advanced solid tumors to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SNS-101 in patients who have exhausted standard treatment options. Including early-stage tumors might dilute the outcomes and make it challenging to assess the specific benefits of the investigational therapy. Does that clarify the rationale behind this criterion?",
            "Great. The next criterion is: \"Having received and failed or was intolerant to standard of care for advanced disease or not eligible for standard of care therapy.\" This criterion ensures that the patients included in the trial have exhausted all standard treatment options available to them. This helps in evaluating the potential benefit of the investigational treatment in patients who have limited or no other treatment options. Any thoughts or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "That's a valid consideration. Including patients who are not eligible for standard care therapy could provide valuable insights into the potential benefit of the investigational treatment in a broader patient population. We can certainly include them as a separate subgroup or cohort in the trial, to further explore the efficacy of SNS-101 in patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria for standard care. Does that sound reasonable to you?",
            "The next criterion is: \"Measurable disease.\" This criterion is essential as it allows for accurate assessment of the response to treatment by providing measurable endpoints for evaluating the efficacy of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I agree. Measurable disease is crucial for evaluating treatment response objectively. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\" This criterion ensures that the patients included in the trial have good performance status, indicating that they are able to carry out daily activities without any significant limitations. This helps in ensuring that the patients are fit enough to participate in the trial and potentially benefit from the treatment. Do you have any suggestions or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "Understood. Moving on, the next criterion is: \"Adequate organ function.\" This criterion is necessary to ensure that the patients included in the trial have adequate organ function to tolerate the investigational treatment and undergo the necessary assessments required during the study. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Adequate organ function is essential for patient safety and reliable evaluation of treatment outcomes. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\" This criterion is important as it allows for the collection of tumor samples for biomarker analysis and assessment of treatment response. It helps in understanding the mechanism of action of the investigational therapy and identifying potential predictive biomarkers. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "That's a valid concern. While it's ideal to have tumor samples from all participants, we can provide an option for patients who are unable or unwilling to provide pre-treatment or on-treatment tumor biopsy samples. We can include them in a separate subgroup or cohort, as long as the majority of participants consent to providing the necessary samples. This approach will still allow us to gather valuable data while accommodating the preferences and limitations of individual patients. Does that address your concern?",
            "I'm glad you find it reasonable. Now, we have discussed all the key inclusion criteria. Shall we move on to the key exclusion criteria?",
            "Great. The first criterion is: \"Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\" This criterion is important to avoid potential interactions or confounding effects of prior treatments on the safety and efficacy evaluation of the investigational therapy. Do you have any suggestions or questions regarding this criterion?",
            "I agree. Excluding patients who have recently received other therapies helps in isolating the effects of the investigational treatment. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\" This criterion ensures that patients with unresolved toxicities from prior treatments are excluded from the trial to prevent exacerbation of side effects and ensure patient safety. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our primary concern. Now, the next criterion is: \"Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients who may be at higher risk of severe immune-related adverse events with the investigational therapy based on their prior treatment history. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Minimizing the risk of severe adverse events is of utmost importance. Let's move on to the next criterion: \"Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\" This criterion is important to exclude patients with active or recent history of other malignancies that may confound the assessment of the efficacy of the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I agree. Maintaining the focus on the specific types of cancer under study is crucial for meaningful evaluation. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\" This criterion is necessary to exclude patients with brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease, as these patients may require specific treatment approaches and have different prognosis compared to patients without central nervous system involvement. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Excluding patients with central nervous system involvement helps maintain the homogeneity of the patient population and facilitates accurate evaluation of the investigational therapy. Now, let's move on to the next criterion: \"History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\" This criterion is important to ensure patient safety and avoid potential severe allergic reactions to the investigational therapy. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is our top priority. Now, we have reached the final criterion: \"Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\" This criterion is essential to protect the safety of pregnant women and unborn children, as well as to prevent potential exposure of infants to the investigational therapy through breastfeeding. Any thoughts or questions on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Protecting the safety of vulnerable populations is paramount. Based on our discussion, here are the full criteria for the clinical trial:\n\nKey Inclusion Criteria:\n- Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid tumor.\n- Having received and failed or was intolerant to standard of care for advanced disease or not eligible for standard of care therapy.\n- Measurable disease.\n- ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n- Adequate organ function.\n- Willing to provide pre-treatment (archival or fresh) and on-treatment tumor biopsy samples.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n- Use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 targeting monoclonal antibody therapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, investigational, or radiotherapy within 2 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1.\n- Clinically significant unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.\n- Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event on prior PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or prior agents targeting stimulatory or co-inhibitory T cell receptor.\n- Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within \u2264 2 years except for limited disease treated with curative intent.\n- Known asymptomatic or symptomatic brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease.\n- History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.\n- Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

            "Fantastic! Now, regarding the exclusion criteria, patients who have undergone chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery will not be suitable for inclusion in the study. This is because such patients' biliary systems are more likely to be abnormal, and their diagnoses may be confounded by the presence of cancer cells shed into the bile. In addition, the diagnostic performance of bile cfDNA assays in such patients may be reduced. Would this be a potential exclusion criterion?",
            "Agreed! Here's another criterion for your consideration. To limit enrollment to patients who are likely to benefit from the study, we should include patients with BTC that have a tumor size of at least 1 cm and are not candidates for surgical resection. This criterion may help us to recruit participants who are eligible for the study and gain more insights into the diagnostic potential of bile cfDNA. What are your thoughts?",

            "Excellent! I'll add it to the inclusion criteria. Moving on, we should consider participants who have a moderately active to active form of axSPA with a basic BASDAI score greater than 3. This criterion ensures that the participants have a certain level of disease activity, which allows for potential improvement to be observed with the interventions being tested. What do you think?",
            "Perfect! I'll include it in the inclusion criteria. Now, we should consider the stability of the disease. It would be ideal to have participants with stable disease, meaning no recent or foreseeable introduction of drug treatments for axSPA (excluding analgesics) within the next six months. This criterion will minimize confounding factors that could affect the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! I'll add it to the inclusion criteria. Another important criterion to consider is the absence of disabling stress urinary incontinence. This ensures that participants do not have a condition that could interfere with their ability to participate in the interventions or affect the outcomes being measured. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Agreed! I'll add it to the inclusion criteria. Moving forward, we should consider the geographical or organizational possibility of undergoing the study. This criterion ensures that participants are able to physically attend the study locations and adhere to the study protocol. What are your thoughts on including this criterion?",

Based on the information you provided, we can start by including pregnancy or breastfeeding as an exclusion criterion. This ensures the safety of participants and potential unborn or breastfeeding children, as the interventions may not be suitable during these periods. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Agreed! I'll add it to the exclusion criteria. Another criterion to consider is recent childbirth within the last six months.

            "Agreed! I'll include it in the exclusion criteria. We're making great progress. Next, we should consider excluding participants with motor neurological deficit and sphincter deficit. These criteria ensure that participants do not have conditions that could affect their ability to participate in the interventions or potentially increase risks during the study. What are your thoughts on these criteria?",
            "Absolutely! I'll add them to the exclusion criteria. Moving forward, we should consider excluding participants with any other somatic pathology that prevents the practice of physiotherapy or yogatherapy according to the opinion of the evaluating clinician. This criterion ensures that participants are physically able to engage in the interventions without posing additional risks to their health. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Agreed! I'll include it in the exclusion criteria. Furthermore, we should consider excluding participants with a depressive syndrome requiring specific treatment. This criterion ensures that participants with significant mental health issues receive appropriate care and support outside of the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! I'll add it to the exclusion criteria. Lastly, we should consider participants who are non-affiliated to a social security scheme or another social protection scheme. This criterion may be related to ensuring that participants have access to necessary healthcare services and support during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Agreed! I'll include it in the exclusion criteria. Lastly, we should exclude participants who are deprived of liberty by judicial or administrative decision or under legal protection (guardianship, safeguard of justice). This criterion ensures that participants have the autonomy to make decisions about their participation in the study. What do you think about this criterion?",

What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Certainly. Here are a few suggestions:Criteria 8: For frail older adults already involved in a care management plan prior to attending the ED, there are many possible sources of these care plans. It could be beneficial to include a criterion to confirm that the care plan was made by a health professional who had physical interaction with the participant.Criteria 9: The intervention is expected to impact process outcomes such as rates of referral to relevant CSTs and follow-up by a relevant team member. Including a criterion to confirm that this process is already in place could be beneficial so that the study can look for these outcomes. For example, having a referral in place means that, even if the outcome is not changed by the intervention, the study can still conclude that it worked as intended, and collect the necessary outcome metrics.Criteria 10: Existing guidelines are available to support frail older adults at different care levels. It could be beneficial to include a criterion that ensures the participant is not currently enrolled in or following guideline-based care related to frailty, especially if the person is part of a structured care plan. This criterion is essential, as it aligns with the focus of the study on frail older adults not receiving standard care.",

Now, let's discuss the next inclusion criterion: \"Must not have received any prior systemic treatment or radiation.\" This criterion is necessary to ensure that the study evaluates the safety and efficacy of cemiplimab and cemiplimab/fianlimab in treatment-naive patients. Previous treatments could confound the results and impact the interpretation of the study outcomes. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Moving on to the next criterion: \"Must be agreeable to endoscopic and CT surveillance for a total of 24 months.\" This criterion is important as it ensures that patients are willing to undergo the necessary monitoring procedures for the duration of the study. Regular surveillance is essential to assess treatment response and disease progression accurately. Any suggestions or concerns regarding this criterion?",
            "Great! Let's proceed to the next criterion: \"Patient's acceptance to have a tumor biopsy.\" This criterion is crucial as it allows for the collection of tumor tissue samples for molecular analysis. Biopsies help determine the tumor's genetic profile and guide treatment decisions, including the selection of immunotherapy agents. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful! Now, let's discuss the next criterion: \"Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function.\" This criterion ensures that patients have sufficient organ function to tolerate the study drugs and procedures safely. Assessing organ and marrow function helps prevent potential treatment-related complications. Do you have any suggestions or concerns about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Moving on to the next criterion: \"Must use an acceptable form of birth control while on study.\" This criterion is necessary to prevent potential risks of pregnancy during the study, as the effects of the study drugs on fetal development are unknown. Using birth control helps ensure patient safety and compliance with study requirements. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Finally, let's discuss the last inclusion criterion: \"Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\" This criterion is essential to ensure that patients are fully informed about the study's purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits. Obtaining informed consent is a fundamental ethical requirement in clinical research. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Now that we have discussed all the inclusion criteria, let's move on to the exclusion criteria.

            "Excellent. Next, let's move to exclusion criteria. Based on our previous experience and the nature of the study, we can assume that not all participants will be able to comply with all the study requirements. For example, some patients may experience adverse effects from the study devices or drop out of the study for personal reasons. Therefore, we need to ensure that the study includes patients who are able to comply with the requirements and complete the study. How about the following as the first exclusion criterion: \"Patients with the following exclusion criteria at the baseline period: 1. Patients diagnosed with depression or who were taking a depressive disorder medication during the observation period.\" This criterion aims to exclude patients who exhibit signs of depression from the study. Depression can significantly affect subjective and objective masticatory performance and quality of life. Therefore, we believe it is crucial to exclude these patients to minimize their confounding effects on the outcomes. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely. Finally, let's consider the fourth inclusion criterion: \"Patients without comorbidities, including psychological disorders.\" This criterion is important because psychological conditions such as depression or anxiety can impact a patient's quality of life and their ability to eat, potentially confounding the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. Now let's move on to the second exclusion criterion: \"Subjects who have not completed or are currently undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer.\" Patients who have not yet completed or are still undergoing a head and neck cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery, may have oral sensitivity, as well as swallowing, articulation, and dietary issues, which may impede safe and effective dental prosthesis use. Thus, patients must have completed a head and neck cancer treatment. Insisting participants have completed cancer treatment ensures that the participants do not have any other medical and/or physical issues that could potentially impact the assessment of masticatory performance and quality of life. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. Now let's move on to the third exclusion criterion: \"Pregnant and breastfeeding women.\" Excluding pregnant and breastfeeding women from the study ensures that the intervention will not have any unintended effects on the fetus or infant. Any other thoughts or comments on this criterion?",
            "Completely agree. Now let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion: \"Females in the menstrual period or in pregnancy/lactation.\" Excluding pregnant or lactating women reduces confounding factors that could potentially affect the study results, ensuring a more accurate assessment of the treatment effect. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now let's move on to the fifth exclusion criterion: \"Scores above 8 in the 6-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-6), as this indicates a serious risk of malnutrition.\" Excluding patients who are at risk of malnutrition ensures that the primary impact of prosthetic rehabilitation on masticatory performance is not overridden by potential effects of malnutrition that could confound the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said. Now that we have established the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study population, let's discuss the eligibility criteria for the different outcomes. First, for masticatory performance, we propose the following: \"Patients who present with or demonstrate maladaptive occlusion.\" Excluding patients without maladaptive occlusion ensures that the study focus is on patients whose prosthetic rehabilitation could improve their masticatory performance.

What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I completely agree with you. Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is: \"Subjects under 18 years of age and/or who do not accept the conditions of the study.\" Excluding individuals under 18 years of age ensures that the participants are adults who can provide informed consent. Excluding those who do not accept the conditions of the study ensures that only willing participants are included. Any thoughts on this?",
            "Absolutely. Now let's discuss the second exclusion criterion: \"Diagnosis of cancer in regions other than those mentioned in the inclusion criteria.\" This criterion ensures that the study focuses specifically on patients treated for head and neck cancer. What are your thoughts on this?",

Now let's move on to the third exclusion criterion: \"Present a tumor recurrence at the time of the study, undefined oncologic evolutionary situation, or under oncologic treatment.\" Excluding patients with tumor recurrence or ongoing oncologic treatment ensures that the study population is stable and not undergoing active cancer treatment that could confound the results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Well said. Now let's discuss the fourth exclusion criterion: \"Presence of orofacial pain or craniomandibular dysfunction hindering mandibular movement and/or participation in the study.\" Excluding patients with orofacial pain or dysfunction ensures that the study can accurately assess the impact of prosthetic rehabilitation on masticatory performance without the interference of other factors. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now let's move on to the final exclusion criterion: \"Present a disability to complete the different records.\" Excluding patients with disabilities that prevent them from completing the study records ensures that the data collection process is feasible and reliable.

This criterion is important to ensure that PD patients enrolled in the study are not affected by any concomitant treatment that could potentially impact the efficacy of the interventions being tested. Since the study is investigating PD, it is important to control for any impact of antiparkinsonian medication. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Now, for the fourth criterion, PD patients must be diagnosed with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease. Setting this criterion ensures that the study population represents patients in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. This is important, as the goal of the study is to assess the activity of candidate therapies and develop new biomarkers for Parkinson's disease. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "You're absolutely right. Now, let's move on to the fifth criterion. For both PD patients and healthy volunteers, the participants must be able to follow the regulations of the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

This criterion is similar to the inclusion criterion and is also for the safety of potential newborns. While this criterion is relatively straightforward, it may require careful screening and monitoring of women in the childbearing period. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The second exclusion criterion is women with child-bearing potential who are not using reliable contraceptive methods. This criterion can help to prevent unintended pregnancy and ensure the safety of any pregnant women unintentionally enrolled in the study. However, it's important to note that using contraception is the responsibility of the individual. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, for the third exclusion criterion, individuals with a history of severe drug use including but not limited to narcotics and alcohol in the past three years, except for medications to treat PD. This criterion is important to prevent any possible influence of substance abuse on study outcomes. Including individuals with a history of substance use can introduce confounding effects that make it difficult to interpret the study results accurately. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, for the fourth exclusion criterion, individuals who are currently on anticoagulant therapy or are using antiplatelet agents should be excluded. This criterion is important to ensure the safety of individuals receiving blood draws, as anticoagulant therapy can increase the risk of bleeding. Excluding individuals on anticoagulant therapy can help minimize any potential risks associated with blood collection. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Including only patients who are at least 40 years old ensures that the study population is representative of the target population for Parkinson's disease research. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, for the third criterion, healthy volunteers must be at least 30 years old. This criterion ensures that the healthy volunteers are adults and potentially at lower risk for any complications related to the blood sample collection. Additionally, including healthy volunteers who are at least 30 years old helps to minimize any confounding factors related to age. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "An interventional study is a study designed to evaluate the effects and outcomes of a treatment or intervention. In this case, since the study is interventional, it would usually be a comparison between the current treatment being studied (Zygomaticomaxillary fracture repair) and a control treatment. However, if this study is a comparison between the treatment (Zygomaticomaxillary fracture repair) and a treatment that is not being studied (the control condition), it is known as non-inferiority trial.",
            "Great, now that I have a better understanding of the title of the trial \"Finite Element and One Point Fixation\" for a clinical trial dealing with Zygomaticomaxillary Complex Fracture, I can move on to designing the criteria.",
            "Certainly. The criterion \"Fit to general anesthesia (GA)\" is essential because patients who are not suitable for GA present with significant medical comorbidities. General anesthesia is considered high risk in such patients due to decreased cardiac reserve. These patients require special precautions, and hence, only patients who are fit to GA will be included in this clinical trial.",

            "This criterion is necessary as the procedure for zygomaticomaxillary fracture repair typically requires the patient to be under general anesthesia. Patients who are not fit for general anesthesia may not be suitable candidates for the procedure. Including this criterion ensures the safety and suitability of the participants. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. Moving on to the second inclusion criterion. It is \"Isolated minimally displaced zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fracture\". This criterion ensures that the study focuses on a specific type of fracture, which allows for more consistent and accurate results in evaluating the effectiveness of finite element analysis for selecting single point fixation. Excluding complex or severely displaced fractures helps us assess the impact of the intervention on a specific type of fracture. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is \"Absence of other facial trauma\". Excluding patients with other facial trauma ensures that we specifically evaluate the impact of finite element analysis for zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures without confounding factors from additional injuries. This criterion helps us isolate the effects of the intervention on the specific condition being studied. Do you have any objections or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "Great. Lastly, we have the criterion \"Mandibular condylar fracture\". Excluding patients with mandibular condylar fractures is important as these fractures involve a different anatomical region and may require different treatment approaches. By focusing on isolated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures, the study can provide more targeted and relevant results for the specific condition under investigation. What do you think about this criterion?",

Phase 2 trials are typically larger in size than phase 1 trials and they are conducted after phase 1 trials demonstrate some encouraging results. This phase of a trial helps generate data on effectiveness (how well the treatment works in a group of patients) and safety (possible negative effects in a moderate-size group of people). It allows investigators to determine if a treatment has the potential to be effective and safe, or if it might be improved by changing the dose, the way it is given, or some other aspect of the treatment. Typically, phase 2 trials include from 100 to 400 participants, with some trials including over 1000 participants.

Lastly, since the clinical investigation aims to evaluate the prevention of complete sternotomy scar dehiscence through the application of the PREVENA\u00ae and PICO\u00ae dressings, patients with a high risk of scar dehiscence (grade III or above according to Paul and Camargo) should be excluded to avoid selection bias. I think this exclusion criterion is important. What about you?",

This means that participants should be willing to engage in the program and learn about palliative care. We'll recruit participants from the palliative care clinic, and the ones who have been in the clinic for at least one week and show their willingness to participate will be included in the study. This criterion emphasizes the importance of participants' motivation and positive attitude towards learning about palliative care. Finally, we'll exclude participants with severe mental illness or terminal disease.

The next exclusion criterion is caring for a patient with acute conditions and actively receiving active physical and/or psychotherapy in addition to palliative care. This criterion is essential as the study aims to assess the effectiveness of the psychoeducation program in specific contexts. Participants caring for patients with acute conditions may be dealing with highly stressful situations unrelated to the caregiver burden inherent in palliative care. Furthermore, additional physical or psychotherapies may significantly influence the participants' perceptions of caregiver burden, which could confound our results. Any thoughts on these exclusion criteria?",

            "Alright. The first inclusion criterion is adult patients (\u2265 18 years) admitted to the University Hospital of Antwerp (UZA), Belgium. This criterion ensures that the study population consists of adults who are receiving care at a specific hospital, allowing for standardized treatment and monitoring. Do you agree with this criterion?",

It states that written informed consent must be obtained from the patient or their legal representative if the patient is unable to provide consent due to encephalopathy (> grade 2). Obtaining informed consent is crucial to ensure that participants understand the study procedures and risks involved. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Let's proceed to the third criterion. It specifies that participants must have acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) grade \u2265 2. This ensures that the study focuses on patients with significant liver dysfunction. What do you think about this criterion?",

This helps to ensure that participants have a clear cause for their liver failure, allowing for more targeted treatment and analysis. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on to the fifth criterion. It states that participants must have hepatic encephalopathy grade \u2265 2. The presence of hepatic encephalopathy at a certain severity level ensures that participants have significant neurological symptoms related to their liver failure, which may impact treatment outcomes. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great. Let's move on to the sixth criterion. It specifies that participants must have acute kidney injury (AKI) according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria stage 3. AKI is a common complication of ACLF, and using standardized criteria helps to ensure consistency in diagnosing and monitoring kidney function in participants. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Elevated bilirubin levels are a marker of liver dysfunction, and this criterion ensures that participants have significant liver impairment. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. We're almost done with the inclusion criteria. The last criterion is that participants must have hemodynamic instability with vasopressor support. This means that participants requiring vasopressor support for hemodynamic instability have severe circulatory issues that may impact treatment response, making them appropriate for the study.

It states that a decision made prior to inclusion to stop further treatment of the patient within the next 24 hours excludes them from the study. Participants who are not expected to continue treatment for at least 24 hours may not benefit from the study intervention, making them unsuitable for inclusion. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. Let's proceed to the third criterion. It states that participants with no complete remission of malignancy, including hepatocellular carcinoma, within the past 12 months, should be excluded. This criterion ensures that participants with active malignancies that may confound the study results or impact their overall prognosis are excluded. What do you think about this criterion?",

            "Excellent. The second inclusion criterion is that participants should have at least four natural teeth (excluding the third molars), two natural teeth on each side of the mandible. This is to ensure that there are adequate remaining bone and soft tissue to support the placement of at least two implants, which are necessary to fabricate a four-implant overdenture. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Great. We can also add a third one, which is that all participants should have a partially edentulous mandible, with teeth 17 to 21 in the mandible. This will help us ensure that the overdentures being tested are being compared to a consistent baseline, preventing variations caused by different tooth loss patterns from confounding the experimental results.

The reason for this is that it can lead to the use of inappropriate antibiotics, which can mask infection. Additionally, it can confound the results as this could be the reason why patients would not respond or survive the intervention.",
            "Excellent catch! I completely forgot to include another important exclusion criterion. What about \"Known allergy or inadequate tolerance to any of the study medications\"? Excluding patients with allergies or reactions from one of the study drugs will increase study validity. In our case study, the primary study drug is antibiotics, but antibiotics are also widely used to treat comorbid conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to exclude patients who have a known allergy or insufficient tolerance to antibiotics.",
            "Perfect! Now let's discuss the fourth exclusion criterion. I propose we exclude \"Patients with any contraindication to the use of the proposed antibiotics (as per labels)\". This criteria will ensure that any effects seen in the study results are related to the antibiotic provided rather than any other factor, such as a contraindication to a specific medication. What are your thoughts?",
            "Perfect! Lastly, let's discuss the fifth exclusion criterion - \"Known prior or concurrent participation in other studies\". This ensures that we collect data from patients who are eligible and willing to participate in the study, while protecting them from unnecessary treatments or interventions. What are your thoughts?",

            "Excellent! Now, let's discuss the eighth exclusion criterion. I suggest excluding \"Patients with a history of previous or planned anti-bacterial and/or anti-microbial use within the 4 weeks prior to admission\". By excluding patients with previous or planned use of antibacterial and antimicrobial agents, we can control for previous exposure to antibiotics and ensure that the study results are not influenced by this factor. What do you think?",

Informed consent is crucial for ethical reasons and ensures the protection of participant rights. What do you think?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion we can consider is \"Patients who have clear evidence of infection, as defined by criteria for the study\". Excluding patients with clear evidence of infection helps maintain the homogeneity of the study population. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Perfect! The second exclusion criterion could be \"Patients who have received antibiotics within the last 1 week prior to admission\". By excluding patients who have recently received antibiotics, we can evaluate the specific impact of early antibiotics without interference from previous antibiotic use. What do you think?",

Similar to patients with immunocompromised states, patients on these agents may have altered immune responses and susceptibility to infections. What do you think?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's discuss the seventh exclusion criterion. I suggest excluding \"Patients considered brain-dead or in a vegetative state\". Patients in such states may have limited capacity to respond to treatment and may not be representative of the study population. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Now, let's move on to the eighth exclusion criterion. How about \"Patients transferred from another hospital, long-term care facility, or institution\"? Excluding patients transferred from other healthcare settings helps ensure that the study population consists of patients who present directly to the study site after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. What do you think?",
            "Great! Now, let's discuss the ninth and final exclusion criterion. I suggest excluding \"Neutropenia (total WBC <1,500/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count of <1,000/mm3)\". Neutropenia is a condition characterized by low levels of neutrophils, which are important immune cells for fighting infections. Excluding these patients will help control for this factor and ensure that the study results are not confounded by the presence of neutropenia. What are your thoughts?",

Now, let me summarize the full criteria we've discussed:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. English or Spanish speaking: To ensure clear communication between participants and healthcare providers.\n2. Screened as at risk for malnutrition (Malnutrition Screening Tool): To target individuals who would benefit most from the intervention.\n3. Meet the definition for food insecure per the Food Security Risk tool: To address the root cause of malnutrition in older adults.\n4. Referred to an RDN: To ensure participants receive proper nutrition care and support.\n5. Diagnosed with malnutrition using AAIM: To accurately identify participants with the targeted condition.\n6. Plan for discharge to home: To facilitate continuity of care and monitoring.\n7. Eligible to receive Title III-C1 or Title III-C2 nutrition services: To provide access to necessary nutrition services and standardize care.",

We can also include the following criteria: patients aged 18 to 85 years old and have a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score equal to or greater than six immediately following EVT. In addition, the patient's last recorded NIHSS score cannot have been more than 24 hours earlier than the baseline assessment. Let me know if you agree with these criteria.",
            "One final criterion I would suggest is that we include patients with an NIHSS score of 4-24, as NIHSS scores outside of this range may have different prognoses, and we want to ensure that all patients have a high probability of survival. What do you think of this criterion?",
            "Great, I'm glad you agree. Lastly, we should also include the criterion that participants who have participated or are participating in any other studies within the last 180 days. This is because these participants may still be in a recovery phase from a previous stroke, which could affect the results of our study. What do you think of this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Lastly, we should consider the fact that this trial will take place in several countries across different regions. Due to this, we need to impose one final criterion, which is that all participants must be able to speak a country-specific language (e.g., English for US, France, Greek for Greece, etc.). This is to ensure that they are able to consent to participating in the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Great! The fourth criterion is that all included participants must have been admitted to the department of rehabilitation medicine due to post-stroke dysphagia within less than 12 months. This criterion is important as it ensures that participants have been recently diagnosed with dysphagia, therefore, the intervention is more likely to provide benefits. How does this criterion sound to you?",

The second criterion is that the women cannot have a history of gynecological or urogenital surgery, other than genital hypospadias or episotomy, at least 12 months prior to the enrollment. This is a reasonable criterion as the surgery may affect the results of the study and confound the results. Furthermore, since the study is focused on urinary incontinence caused by urethral or vaginal hypermobility, it is important to exclude the possibility of any other cause of incontinence. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Alright. The third and final inclusion criterion is having no other medical conditions affecting bladder function or pelvic floor dysfunctions. This criterion is added as the study population will be older women (over 25), and at this age, it is possible that they are suffering from other pelvic floor conditions.

This is reasonable as the study is focused on women with urinary incontinence, and it is important to have a consistent study population to draw meaningful conclusions. Do you agree with this criterion?",

Previous or current history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), or active PDR in the study eye (including previous or current retinal neovascularization or macular scarring). PDR is a common complication of retinal pathologies, such as diabetic retinopathy, and there are specific treatments available for this condition. Therefore, participants with PDR may have different prognoses and treatment outcomes than those with nAMD. Including participants with PDR would affect the interpretation of study results, which is why they are excluded. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Excellent choice! I have another inclusion criterion I would like to propose, namely \"participants are living with health conditions and chronic illness.\" This criterion is significant because this study focuses on developing an advance care planning program for individuals living with health conditions and chronic illness. Participants living with these conditions are more likely to have experienced multiple hospitalizations and will benefit the most from implementing the intervention. What do you think about this?",
            "Great! Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. Based on your study, I suggest including \"age 65 years and older\" as a criterion. The ACP intervention that you are planning to test is tailored towards older adults. The age group of specific interest is typically retired, and they may encounter a range of difficulties or changes related to their health, functional status, psychological adaptation, and social roles. What is your perspective?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion. Based on your study, I suggest excluding individuals with \"severe psychiatric illness or cognitive conditions that preclude their capacity to participate in sessions.\" This criterion is critical as it ensures the ability of participants to engage in the ACP interventions. By excluding individuals with severe psychiatric illness or cognitive conditions, we can minimize potential limitations or challenges arising from these conditions and provide a more effective and personalized intervention. What do you think?",
            "Great! Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion. Based on the interventions of \"ACP group sessions\" and \"ACP one-on-one visits\" in your study, I recommend excluding individuals who \"are considered medically unstable.\" This criterion is relevant as individuals with medical instability may require acute care and treatment at the time of ACP interventions. It is not clear how medical instability screening will be conducted, but the investigators are in the best position to determine if screening for this criterion is necessary. The medical team of each potential participant could be asked to provide information about a participant's current medical status, or self-reports using a survey instrument could be employed.

            "Thank you for your agreement. Here is the third criterion: patients must have a kyphosis angle of more than 6\u00b0 in the X-ray image. This criterion helps to ensure that patients included in the study have vertebral kyphosis, which is the condition being treated with kyphoplasty. I would add that the reason why we specify a minimum of 6\u00b0 is not just because of the diagnostic criteria for kyphosis but also because kyphoplasty would not usually be given a patient with a smaller degree of kyphosis. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

The first criterion is the exclusion of patients with vertebral fractures resulting from high impact trauma and patients with spinal fractures due to tumor or infection. This ensures that the study population only includes patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! The second criterion is the presence of vertebrae destruction, including bone resorption, collapse, erosion, or kyphosis. Excluding patients with bone destruction minimizes confounding factors that may affect the implantation sites and minimizes the likelihood of implant migration. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great point! The third criterion is a complete recent spine RX, including CT scan or MRI, within six weeks of preoperative evaluation. The most recent diagnostic evaluation at the time of preoperative evaluation helps to ensure that the timing of the vertebral fracture and the date of preoperative evaluation are not too far apart. This helps to standardize the study population and ensure consistent information about the time frame of the fracture occurrence. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Okay. In that case, for our exclusion criteria, we can exclude patients with a history or diagnosis of pneumonia, and we can also exclude those who are currently receiving any other treatments or interventions that may affect their lung function. We can also exclude patients who are unable to participate in study procedures or complete the questionnaires. Is that correct?",
            "Great. The second inclusion criterion would be the following: The participant should be hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) at a participating hospital due to a confirmed diagnosis of mechanical ventilation, stroke, COPD, acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pneumonia. This is to ensure that the patients who enroll in the study would benefit the most from the intervention being tested. What are your thoughts on this inclusion criterion?",
            "Alright, moving on to the third inclusion criterion. As the study is also focused on mechanical ventilation, it would be appropriate to include patients in the ICU who are currently mechanically ventilated via an intubated, single-lumen endotracheal tube. This will ensure that the participants are on mechanical ventilation and have a clear airway to be ventilated. What do you think?",
            "Got it. Moving on to the fourth inclusion criterion, it's crucial to ensure that any additional device being used for monitoring purposes does not impede the participant's regular medical care. For this particular trial, we want to establish that the VQm Pulmonary Health Monitor\u2122 does not cause any added complications or burdens to the participant. Therefore, I would suggest including participants who have received permission or authorization for use of the VQm Pulmonary Health Monitor\u2122. What are your thoughts on that?",

We can set this to be the fourth exclusion criterion. What do you think?",
            "Alright. For the fifth exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients exhibiting tracheostomy to ensure that the device is placed correctly and for proper monitoring. Patients with tracheostomy may have a higher risk of complications related to tube placement or maintenance, so it is important to exclude these patients to ensure the safety and validity of the study. Can we include \"patients exhibiting tracheostomy\" as the fifth exclusion criterion?",

Based on the details you've given me, here's what I suggest for the inclusion criteria: Firstly, the participants should be male or female who are 18 years old or above at the time of inclusion. This is to ensure that they are legally able to provide informed consent. What do you think?",
            "Great! Now, moving on to the second inclusion criterion. Since the trial is focused on pulmonary health parameters and cardiac output monitoring, it would be appropriate to include patients currently admitted in the ICU who are indicated for cardiac output monitoring using a pulmonary artery catheter. Additionally, they should require pressure or volume controlled mechanical ventilation using an ETT. This will ensure that the participants have the specific medical conditions and treatment requirements necessary for the study. What do you think?",
            "Perfect. Now, for the third inclusion criterion, it's important to obtain signed and dated informed consent from the participants. This ensures that they fully understand the study procedures, risks, and benefits before agreeing to participate. Can we include \"provision of signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) by the patient or a trusted person\" as the third inclusion criterion?",

Based on the information provided, we can establish the first exclusion criterion as \"male or female under the age of 18 years old at the time of screening.\" This is to protect minors who may not fully understand the risks and benefits of participating in the study. What are your thoughts?",
            "Alright. For the second exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients who are under guardianship. Since patients under guardianship may not be able to provide informed consent for themselves, it's important to ensure that all participants are able to make their own decisions about participation. Can we include \"patient under guardianship\" as the second exclusion criterion?",
            "Good. Now, for the third exclusion criterion, it is suggested to exclude patients who require tidal volumes of less than 250cc. This is to ensure that the participants have similar baseline characteristics and are receiving standard mechanical ventilation settings. Patients requiring very low tidal volumes may have different physiological responses that could confound the study results. Shall we include \"patient who requires tidal volumes of less than 250cc\" as the third exclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on, for the fourth exclusion criterion, it would be appropriate to exclude pregnant patients. Pregnancy can affect pulmonary health parameters and introduce confounding variables, so excluding pregnant patients helps to ensure that the study results are not influenced by this factor. Can we include \"pregnancy\" as the fourth exclusion criterion?",
            "Very well. Now, for the fifth exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients whose care requires the use of an anesthetic conserving device.

The first exclusion criterion is \"Patients post-abdominal surgery.\" This criterion is reasonable as patients post-abdominal surgery may have altered gastrointestinal function, which could confound the results of the study. By excluding these patients, we can ensure that the results are not influenced by recent surgical procedures. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The second exclusion criterion is \"Patients admitted to the intensive care unit due to gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel obstruction).\" This criterion is necessary as patients with gastrointestinal disorders may have altered gastric motility or function, which could impact the results of the study. By excluding these patients, we can focus on the effects of different GRV thresholds on patients without underlying gastrointestinal conditions. Thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The final exclusion criterion is \"Patients receiving palliative care with reduced enteral nutrition.\" This criterion is important as patients receiving palliative care may have different nutritional requirements and goals compared to other critically ill patients.

The first criterion should be \"Creatinine clearance (eGFR) < 30mls/min.\" This is necessary to exclude individuals with severe kidney impairment, as they may be at increased risk of complications from the interventions being studied. Would you like to include this criterion?",

The second exclusion criterion I suggest is \"Contraindication or unable to take anticoagulation.\" Anticoagulation therapy is often necessary for patients with AF to prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of stroke. Excluding individuals who are unable to take anticoagulants ensures the safety of the participants. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Excellent. The third exclusion criterion should be \"Uncontrolled hypertension.\" Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of complications during the interventions being studied. Managing hypertension is crucial for the safety of the participants. Would you like to include this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The fourth exclusion criterion I suggest is \"Contraindication for catheter ablation.\" This criterion is necessary to ensure that participants are suitable candidates for the ablation procedure, as contraindications may increase the risk of complications. What do you think?",
            "Great choice. The fifth exclusion criterion I propose is \"BMI > 40.\" This criterion is likely included to exclude individuals who are severely obese, as they may be at increased risk of complications during the interventions being studied. Would you like to include this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. The sixth exclusion criterion should be \"Patients in Persistent AF who have had more than one previous cardioversion.\" Excluding patients who have had multiple previous cardioversions helps to ensure that the study participants have not already been exposed to this intervention multiple times, which could impact the results of the study. What are your thoughts?",
            "Excellent choice. Lastly, the seventh exclusion criterion should be \"Established diagnosis of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\" Individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may have unique considerations and risks related to AF treatment, which could impact the outcomes of the study.

            "Got it! Now, could you tell me the age group that will be participating in your clinical trial? Please provide me with the minimum and maximum ages.",
            "Alright. The second criterion is \"Age at least 18 years and less than 80 years\". This criterion helps to ensure that the study is conducted within the range of the population where the effect of immunonutrition can be examined. We also need to set a minimum age to ensure that the intervention is suitable for the included patients. This criterion helps us understand the generalizability of the findings. Do you have any questions or comments about this criterion?",
            "Great, our next inclusion criterion is \"ECOG score 0-3\". This criterion indicates that individuals with severe systemic comorbidities (ECOG score of 4 or 5) will be excluded from the study. Do you agree with this? If not, please let me know why.",
            "Fantastic! Let's move on to the fourth inclusion criterion which is \"Patient with a planned treatment modality of open radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for all indications\". This criterion will assist in ensuring that participants meet the specific surgical requirements for open radical cystectomy, minimizing bias in the study results. In addition, it focuses the interventions on only a specific type of surgical procedure, which is more feasible for the study. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! Now, the second exclusion criterion is \"Pre- or post-operative non-bladder-related bowel obstruction\". This criterion ensures that the bowel obstruction does not compromise intestinal absorption of the immunonutrition. Do you have any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Definitely. Alright, moving on to \"Non-functional, indwelling urinary or rectal catheter\". This criterion is being included because we want to ensure that the participants have the ability to absorb nutrients. Do you have any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! Now, here's the next criterion. It is \"Current treatment with antibiotic therapy lasting >2 weeks before surgery\". Excluding individuals with prolonged antibiotic use helps eliminate potential confounding of outcomes by residual antibiotic effect. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! Now, let's move on to the fifth exclusion criterion. It is \"Pregnancy or lactation\". Pregnant or lactating individuals should be excluded to prevent any potential risks associated with the use of immunonutrition to the fetus or infant. Additionally, this criterion helps ensure the integrity of the study results by avoiding heterogeneity in the control and treatment groups. Any questions or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "Alright, now we're nearing the end of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion. It is \"Pregnant or breastfeeding\". Excluding pregnant or breastfeeding individuals is important to minimize potential risks to the fetus and to ensure that their hormonal and metabolic changes during pregnancy or lactation do not affect the study outcomes. What do you make of this criterion?",
            "Now, let's discuss the seventh exclusion criterion. It is \"Body mass index (BMI) \u226535 kg/m2\". Including very obese individuals can introduce confounding variables and significantly affect study outcomes. However, the criterion can be revised to read \"BMI >35 kg/m2\". This will include individuals with BMI in the range of 30-35 kg/m2 as well. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! Now, let's move on to the ninth exclusion criterion. It is \"Previous enrollment in the sister study\". This study is a sister study, as you mentioned earlier, so participants must not be enrolled in both studies to maintain the study's integrity and prevent contamination (influence of one group on another). Any questions of suggestions?",
            "Great to hear that. Now, we've reached the ninth exclusion criterion. It is \"Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to affect eligibility for the study or patient safety or ability to adhere to the study protocol\". Including individuals who could be unsafe or unable to adhere to the protocol due to other existing conditions may confound the study outcomes. Excluding them makes the study recruitment process more precise and helps ensure participant safety. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Good point. Now, let's move on to the tenth exclusion criterion. It is \"Active involvement in the study of other investigational drugs or devices within 30 days preceding and during the present study\". Including individuals who are currently participating or previously participated in another clinical study assessing an investigational drug or device could introduce confounding variables or bias. Excluding them ensures that the study results are not influenced by prior study participation. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! I think we've covered all the inclusion and exclusion criteria for your clinical trial. I hope this helps you move forward with your trial. If you have any more questions in the future, don't hesitate to let me know. Good luck with your trial!"

The first criterion is \"Patient undergoing open cystectomy (for all reasons)\". This criterion ensures that the study focuses on the impact of preoperative immunonutrition specifically on patients undergoing a cystectomy. Do you have any questions or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "Alright. The next inclusion criterion is \"Age \u226518 years\". This criterion is reasonable as individuals under the age of 18 may have different physiological responses to immunonutrition compared to adults. Additionally, including only adults ensures that participants can provide informed consent. Do you have any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! Now, we'll move on to the third inclusion criterion. It is \"Ability and willingness to provide informed consent documented by signature\". Obtaining informed consent is essential in research involving human subjects to ensure that participants understand the study's purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits. This criterion protects the rights and autonomy of participants. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is \"Contraindications to IN, e.g. known hypersensitivity or allergy to lactose, fish oil, or soy lecithin\". Excluding individuals with known allergies or hypersensitivities to components of immunonutrition is important to prevent adverse reactions and ensure participant safety. Any questions or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. It is \"Severe diarrhea requiring medical attention\". Severe diarrhea can impact the absorption and efficacy of immunonutrition, so excluding individuals with this condition helps maintain the integrity of the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, we'll move on to the third exclusion criterion. It is \"Current treatment with any immunosuppressive drug\". Including individuals on immunosuppressive drugs could confound the results of the study by affecting immune response outcomes. Excluding them ensures that the study can accurately assess the impact of immunonutrition. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.",
            "Great to hear that. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion. It is \"Other clinically significant concomitant disease affecting immunity, such as severe renal failure, HIV, SLE, or being a transplant recipient\". These conditions can influence immune response and complicate the interpretation of study results. Excluding individuals with these conditions helps ensure the study's focus remains on the impact of immunonutrition on immune response after cystectomy. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad we're on the same page. Now, let's discuss the fifth exclusion criterion. It is \"Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to psychological disorders, dementia, etc.\". Individuals with psychological disorders, dementia, or other conditions that may impair their ability to follow study procedures may not be able to adhere to the intervention or data collection requirements. Excluding them helps maintain the study's internal validity. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion. It is \"Participation in another study with an investigational drug within the 30 days preceding and during the present study\". Including individuals who are concurrently participating in another study with an investigational drug could introduce confounding variables that may impact the study outcomes. Excluding them helps minimize potential biases. Any questions or suggestions regarding this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, let's discuss the seventh exclusion criterion. It is \"Previous enrollment into the current study\". Excluding individuals who have previously participated in the study helps prevent duplicate data collection and ensures that the study results are based on unique participants. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, we'll move on to the eighth exclusion criterion. It is \"Use of IN independently of the study\". Individuals who are already using immunonutrition outside of the study may not be representative of the study population or may have different responses to the intervention. Excluding them helps control for this potential confounding factor. Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.",
            "I'm glad you understand. Now, let's discuss the ninth exclusion criterion. It is \"Enrollment of the investigator, his/her family members, employees, and other dependent persons\". Including individuals with close personal or professional relationships to the investigator could introduce bias or conflicts of interest. Excluding them helps maintain the study's objectivity and integrity. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm happy to hear that. Lastly, we'll discuss the tenth exclusion criterion. It is \"Emergency procedure (less than 7 days between screening and surgery)\". Emergency procedures may involve different preoperative and postoperative care protocols that could impact the study outcomes. Excluding individuals who undergo emergency procedures helps ensure that the study results are based on planned surgeries with consistent protocols. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you understand the rationale behind this criterion. Now that we have discussed all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, let me provide you with the full criteria for your clinical trial:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n- Patient undergoing open cystectomy (for all reasons)\n- Age \u226518 years\n- Ability and willingness to provide informed consent documented by signature\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n- Contraindications to IN, e.g. known hypersensitivity or allergy to lactose, fish oil or soy lecithin\n- Severe diarrhea requiring medical attention\n- Current treatment with any immunosuppressive drug\n- Other clinically significant concomitant disease affecting immunity (e.g., severe renal failure, HIV, SLE, transplant recipient, ...)\n- Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due psychological disorders, dementia, etc.\n- Participation in another study with investigational drug within the 30 days preceding and during the present study\n- Previous enrollment into the current study\n- Use of IN independently of the study\n- Enrolment of the investigator, his/her family members, employees, and other dependent persons\n- Emergency procedure (less than 7 days between screening and surgery)\n\nPlease make sure to include these criteria in your clinical trial design.

BMI is a commonly used indicator for assessing obesity, and it has gained widespread acceptance as an effective method for screening and monitoring obesity. A BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater is generally accepted as obese. Including this criterion will allow the results of your study to be easily comparable to previous studies that have evaluated similar populations. What are your thoughts?",
            "The third inclusion criterion is that the patients should have follow-up measures of body height, weight, bodyweight change, body mass index (BMI), and the dosage of Saxenda\u00ae throughout the course of the study. These follow-up measures are necessary for assessing the safety and effectiveness of the treatment at various time points during the study. What do you think?",
            "Alright. The fourth inclusion criterion is that the patients have received at least one dose of Saxenda\u00ae and should have a follow-up visit at Month 2, which is the first assessment point of the study. This criterion is important because it guarantees that all patients who enter the study have started their Saxenda\u00ae treatment and are at a sufficient follow-up period to provide a meaningful contribution to the study. This makes the results more reliable. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Certainly. Here are some suggested exclusion criteria: Participants should not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing age must use adequate contraception for at least 1 week, including those who are participating in a mating avoidance period. Participants who are being treated for another indication of Saxenda\u00ae should be excluded. For example, patients with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, diabetic foot ulcers, and pernicious anemia were excluded due to safety concerns raised by the manufacturer of Saxenda\u00ae. Participants who have a history or are currently suffering from renal disease, gastrointestinal disorders, neoplasms, or psychiatric disorders. This exclusion criterion is important because these health issues may impact the outcomes of the study. As a result, a large variation in the effects of the treatments may occur, making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about their effectiveness and safety. Also, Saxenda\u00ae was mainly developed and intended for use in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of \u226530 kg/m2 or \u226527 kg/m2 with existing type 2 diabetes, so participants who do not meet this requirement should be excluded. What are your thoughts about these criteria?",

This criterion helps to ensure the safety of the participants and to obtain reliable study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion? Are there any other specific diseases that you would like to add to the criteria?",
            "The last exclusion criterion is a history of malignancy, or a disease that may progress to malignancy or an endocrine condition that may increase a predisposition to develop a malignancy that may require high-dose liraglutide. This criterion is important because Saxenda\u00ae is contraindicated in some cancers and endocrine conditions because of the increased risks associated with its use. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Ensuring that females of childbearing potential are using reliable contraception methods is essential to assess the efficacy of the treatment and to protect the participants' reproductive capacity. What do you think about this criterion?",

            "Great. For the next criterion, I suggest \"Patients diagnosed with left colonic obstruction within the previous 30 days.\" This criterion helps ensure that the condition is recent and that patients have not been living with the obstruction for an extended period. This is important because symptoms may change over time, and prolonged obstruction may lead to complications or other health issues that may affect the patients' health outcomes and quality of life. What are your thoughts?",
            "Now, I have one more possible additional criterion for you: \"Absence of history of obstruction (bowel obstruction, intestinal perforation, or other digestive complications).\" This criterion aims to ensure that patients included in the study have had no prior colonic obstruction or other digestive complications. While this is not entirely feasible, as medical practitioners usually diagnose these conditions early and intervene promptly, it might help in producing a more uniform group of patients for our analysis. Let me know what you think, I can add this to the list of criteria (or remove it).",
            "Alright. The final inclusion criterion I suggest is \"Patients with no contraindications for proctological maneuver, left colonoscopy, or colectomy.\" This criterion ensures that patients with potential contraindications for relevant medical procedures are excluded, which is important for ensuring the safety of all participants. What do you think about adding this criterion to the list?",
            "Perfect. The next inclusion criterion is \"Patients able to provide informed consent.\" This criterion is essential for the participation of patients in the study in an informed and voluntary manner. Do you agree that we include this criterion?",
            "One additional criterion I suggest is \"Life expectancy of \u2265 3 months due to good general health condition,\" which ensures patients can undergo a successful recovery without immediate risk of death due to factors unrelated to the primary colon cancer. What do you think?",
            "Fabulous. The first exclusion criterion I propose is \"Pregnant women.\" Excluding pregnant women ensures the safety of any intervention being administered during the study and can help avoid confounding factors in the analysis of the results. What do you think?",
            "Great. Moving forward, I propose the second exclusion criterion as \"Metastatic cancer on abdominal and chest CT scans at the time of stent placement or surgery.\" Excluding patients with metastatic cancers at the time of primary treatment helps in differentiating the outcomes of patients with localized obstructive left colonic cancer. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Alright. Moving on, the next exclusion criterion I propose is \"Previous CRC surgery.\" By excluding patients with a history of CRC surgery, we eliminate the potential confounding effects of previous surgeries, which could affect the study's outcomes. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Fantastic. The next exclusion criterion I propose is \"Synchronous cancers for other organs.\" Excluding patients with synchronous cancers for other organs ensures that we focus on obstructive left colonic cancer, which is important for our study's objectives. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Moving on, the next exclusion criterion I suggest is \"Pregnant or breastfeeding women and women of childbearing age not using adequate contraceptive methods.\" Excluding pregnant or breastfeeding women ensures that the interventions will not pose risks to the fetus. Excluding women of childbearing age who are not using adequate contraception methods helps to avoid unintended pregnancy and protects the well-being of the fetus in the event that they might become pregnant during participation in the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Now let's move on to the next exclusion criterion, which is \"History of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with stenosis.\" Excluding patients with pre-existing conditions involving bowel stenosis ensures that we only evaluate conditions caused by primary colonic cancer. What do you think about this criterion?",

Moving on to the next criterion, I propose \"Patients with abdominal CT scan diagnosis of colonic obstruction due to obstructive left colonic cancer (sigmoid or descending colon).\" This criterion ensures that only patients with a confirmed diagnosis of obstructive left colonic cancer are included in the study, which is essential for our focus on this specific condition. What are your thoughts?",
            "Perfect. The next inclusion criterion I suggest is \"Absence of distant metastases on abdominal and chest CT scan.\" Excluding patients with distant metastases ensures that we focus on patients with localized obstructive left colonic cancer, which is important for our study's objectives. How do you feel about this criterion?",

            "Alright. The first exclusion criterion I suggest is \"Right-side or transverse colon cancer.\" Excluding patients with cancer in the right side or transverse colon ensures that we focus specifically on obstructive left colonic cancer, which is the primary condition of interest. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great. The next exclusion criterion I propose is \"Surgical or endoscopic palliation in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, locally advanced Colorectal cancer (CRC) (T4 sec. TNM), M1 disease.\" Excluding patients with advanced disease or those who have undergone palliative treatments ensures that we focus on patients with localized obstructive left colonic cancer, which is important for our study's objectives. How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Excellent. The next exclusion criterion I suggest is \"Bowel obstruction determined by other tumors or benign inflammatory stenosis.\" Excluding patients with bowel obstruction due to other causes ensures that we specifically investigate obstructive left colonic cancer, which is essential for our study's focus. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Moving on, the next exclusion criterion is \"Concomitant bowel abscess, perforation, or fistula.\" Excluding patients with these complications ensures that we focus on patients with uncomplicated obstructive left colonic cancer, which is important for our study's objectives. Should we include this criterion too?",
            "I completely agree. The next exclusion criterion I propose is \"Elective procedures.\" Excluding patients undergoing elective procedures ensures that we focus on patients presenting with obstructive left colonic cancer as an emergency, which is important for our study's design. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Moving on to the last exclusion criterion, I suggest \"Pregnancy or lactation.\" Excluding pregnant or lactating patients ensures the safety of the participants and potential fetuses or infants, which is important for the ethical conduct of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Definitely! The third inclusion criterion is a self-reported history of atrial fibrillation without a history of hospitalization. It's essential to exclude participants with a history of hospitalization because it may indicate they have developed severe or life-threatening atrial fibrillation, requiring urgent medical intervention. This exclusion criterion will help standardize the severity of atrial fibrillation among participants and ensure that we focus on the target population of this clinical trial.

This criterion is essential as the study specifically targets people who inject drugs. By including only those who have recently injected drugs, we can ensure that the intervention is relevant to the target population. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect! We're making progress. Now, let's discuss the final inclusion criterion. It's important to ensure that participants provide free and informed consent to participate. Informed consent is a fundamental ethical requirement in clinical research. Ensuring that participants provide free and informed consent protects their autonomy and ensures their understanding of the study procedures and potential risks. What are your thoughts on including this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is excluding individuals who do not regularly go to the participating harm reduction center in the relevant city. This criterion ensures that participants are consistent in their engagement with the intervention and study procedures. It helps maintain the integrity of the study results. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Precisely. Now, for the second exclusion criterion, we should exclude individuals who have an alcohol and/or alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) excipient intolerance/allergy. This is necessary to prevent any adverse reactions or allergic responses to the intervention. It ensures the safety of participants and minimizes potential harm. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great! Let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. We should exclude individuals who are under legal protection, such as those under guardianship or judicial protection. This is because such individuals may have limitations on their ability to provide informed consent or participate autonomously in the study. By excluding them, we can protect their rights and ensure that participation is voluntary. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Finally, for the last exclusion criterion, we should exclude individuals who are currently pregnant. Pregnancy can introduce confounding variables and potential risks to both the pregnant individual and the fetus.

The next criterion is: \"Healthy liver function and no evidence of biliary obstruction in imaging findings.\" This condition ensures that potential liver complications do not influence the patient's eligibility for the trial. By including only patients with healthy liver function and no evidence of biliary obstruction, we can minimize the influence of pre-existing conditions on the trial outcomes. What do you think about this condition?",
            "Fantastic! The fourth criterion is \"Adequate liver function.\" To assess liver function in potential candidates for the study, we recommend examining the total bilirubin, transaminases, and coagulation factors. This will ensure that only patients with adequate liver function are enrolled in the trial. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Now let's move on to the fifth criterion: \"Surgical margins are negative.\" Negative surgical margins are important in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, as positive margins have been associated with worse outcomes. By including only patients with negative surgical margins, we can compare pancreatic cancer outcomes in those most likely to benefit from the surgical procedures being studied. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Agreed! Moving on to the second exclusion criterion: \"Cognitive or physical impairment that would prevent the understanding or compliance of the research protocol.\" Cognitive impairment may impede a patient's ability to provide informed consent and comply with the research protocol, while physical impairment may prevent the patient from being able to complete the trial procedures. For the purposes of this trial, the research protocol involves being randomized to either the LRAMPS or LDP surgical procedure and completing follow-up assessments after surgery. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! The third criterion addresses \"Dilated biliary stent or drainage tube at the time of diagnosis.\" Excluding patients with biliary stents and drainage tubes minimizes a confounding factor in interpreting the results. These factors may have affected the pathology results, given that they could have prompted an early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in some patients. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Completely agree! The fourth criterion is \"Other ineligible for participation in clinical trial.\" Here, by excluding patients who are ineligible for participation in the clinical trial due to other reasons, we can ensure that a uniform and standardized group of patients is included. This helps maintain the integrity and validity of the study. What is your opinion on this criterion?",

By including only patients with tumors located at least 1cm away from the celiac trunk, we can compare outcomes in a more standardized manner. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now let's move on to the fourth criterion: \"Tumor didn't invade the fascial layer behind the pancreas.\" This criterion ensures that patients with tumors that have not invaded surrounding structures beyond a certain point are included. This helps ensure that the surgical procedures being compared are appropriate for the stage of cancer being studied. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly!

Now let's discuss the final inclusion criterion: \"Voluntary participation and signed informed consent.\" Obtaining voluntary participation and informed consent from patients is essential for ethical reasons. Patients must understand the risks and benefits of participating in the trial and provide their consent willingly. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is \"Received neoadjuvant therapy.\" Excluding patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy helps ensure that the study focuses on comparing the outcomes of the two surgical procedures without the confounding factor of prior treatment affecting the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! The second exclusion criterion is \"Presence of liver or other distant metastasis.\" Excluding patients with distant metastasis ensures that the study focuses on early-stage left-sided pancreatic cancer. Including patients with metastasis would introduce a different disease stage and prognosis, which could impact the study results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the third exclusion criterion: \"Multifocal or recurrent disease.\" Excluding patients with multifocal or recurrent disease helps ensure that the study population consists of patients with early-stage cancer who are undergoing surgery for the first time. This helps maintain consistency in the study population. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Moving on to the fourth exclusion criterion: \"History of other malignancies.\" Excluding patients with a history of other malignancies ensures that the study focuses specifically on left-sided pancreatic cancer and its treatment outcomes. Prior malignancies may introduce additional variables that could impact the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Now let's discuss the final exclusion criterion: \"Simultaneously participating in other clinical trials.\" Excluding patients who are simultaneously participating in other clinical trials helps prevent potential confounding factors that could affect the study outcomes. Patients involved in multiple trials may have different interventions or treatments that could influence the results of this trial. What do you think about this criterion?",

            "Great! The first exclusion criterion is that the participant needs to be unresponsive or partially unresponsive to current treatments based on the investigator's opinion. This criterion is in place to ensure that only participants who are eligible for the proposed treatment regimen are enrolled in the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The second exclusion criterion is that a participant must have a smoking history within the past 10 years or a current smoking diagnosis. The research focuses on participants with asthma and excluding those with smoking history ensures the study findings apply specifically to asthma patients. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you see that. Moving on, the third exclusion criterion is that participants who participated in another Propease study in the past 30 days will be excluded. This criterion helps avoid duplicate study participants and potential biases. What are your thoughts?",
            "I'm glad you recognize the value in this criterion. It's important to remember that, while study drugs are used in some cases to manage severe asthma, they're not always necessary or even the first-line treatment option, and controlling asthma symptoms with non-drug interventions may sometimes be equally effective for some patients. Including biologic therapy patients would introduce a potential confounding factor because the treatment group would not be homogenous, as some participants could be receiving drug therapy instead of OCS. This potentially creates two groups of patients with different rates of OCS use.",

            "Understood. Now, let's discuss the criteria for this clinical trial. We have both inclusion and exclusion criteria. Which one would you like to start with?",
            "Alright. The first inclusion criterion is that the participant must be a male or female aged 18 years or older by the time of study entry. This is to ensure that the participants are adults who can provide informed consent and have a stable medical history. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Moving on to the second inclusion criterion, the participant needs to be visiting a participating center for a routine clinical appointment. This ensures that we capture data from patients actively managing their severe asthma. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The third inclusion criterion states that the participant must be willing and able to provide a blood sample for IgE and eosinophil levels determination as part of their routine clinical visit. This is necessary to assess eosinophil levels, which is crucial for severe asthma management. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you see the importance. Moving on, the fourth inclusion criterion is that the participant must have a diagnosis of severe asthma for at least one year, as defined by treatment with guidelines-suggested medications for Global Initiative for Asthma (3) steps 4-5 asthma. This ensures that we include participants with confirmed severe asthma who have been receiving appropriate medical treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Lastly, the fifth inclusion criterion is that the participant (or their legal guardian) must voluntarily sign and date the informed consent form prior to study entry. Informed consent is crucial for ethical research conduct to ensure participants understand the study's purpose, risks, and benefits. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you recognize the importance of informed consent. Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Are you ready to discuss those?",
            "Great. The first exclusion criterion is that participants with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other chronic respiratory conditions beyond severe asthma will be excluded from the study. This helps maintain the focus on severe asthma patients and reduces confounding factors. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I agree. The second exclusion criterion states that participants with an acute or chronic condition that, by the investigator's decision, would limit their ability to participate in the study will be excluded. This criterion ensures that participants are medically stable and able to actively participate, minimizing risks and ensuring data quality. What do you think?",
            "Precisely. Lastly, the third exclusion criterion is that participants who are currently under biologic therapy to treat their severe asthma will be excluded. This prevents potential treatment-related confounders in the study results, allowing for a clearer understanding of the prevalence of oral corticosteroid (OCS) use among severe asthma patients not on biologic therapy. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you understand the rationale behind this criterion. Now, let me summarize the full criteria for you:\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Male or female patient, aged 18 years or older by the time of study entry.\n2. Patient visiting a participating center for a routine clinical appointment.\n3. The patient is willing and able to provide a blood sample for IgE and eosinophil levels determination as part of their routine clinical visit.\n4. Patients with a diagnosis of severe asthma for at least one year as defined by treatment with guidelines-suggested medications for Global Initiative for Asthma (3) steps 4-5 asthma.\n5.

            "Great. I also suggest including patients who will undergo non-cardiac surgery. This inclusion criterion is necessary as the study is focused on perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction, which usually occurs in patients who undergo non-cardiac surgery. Therefore, we need to specify the types of surgery that will be included in the trial. What do you think?",
            "Great. Moving on to the final inclusion criterion, I suggest including patients who are scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgery. Since the study aims to examine the risk factors and biomarkers for perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction, including patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgery is logical as they are more likely to require general anesthesia and experience perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction. What do you think?",
            "Perfect! Next, I suggest excluding patients with a history of Diabetes Mellitus. Patients with diabetes may have cognitive impairments due to low blood sugar levels or diabetic ketoacidosis. Excluding this patient population will ensure that cognitive impairments measured in the study are only due to perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction. What are your thoughts?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, for the last inclusion and exclusion criteria, I suggest including patients who have scheduled elective surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation as this minimizes the impact of the surgery itself on the preoperative screening tests and the risk of postoperative complications. Additionally, it ensures a uniform study population. On the other hand, I suggest excluding patients with a history of central nervous system disease, those who have undergone non-surgical treatment within 1 year, and those with chronic kidney disease because these criteria may introduce bias to the study results. The patients with central nervous system diseases have an impairment in cognitive function even before undergoing any surgery due to the presence of the disease. Therefore, evaluating and comparing the effects of surgery on cognitive dysfunction and neurocognitive behavior are not feasible. The patients with non-surgical treatments within 1 year might affect the evaluation of neurocognitive dysfunction. In addition, the patients with a history of chronic kidney disease may also affect the evaluation and analysis of psychological function and symptoms. What are your thoughts on these inclusion and exclusion criteria?",

With that, we have established the following inclusion/exclusion criteria for the clinical trial: study participants will be elderly patients between the ages of 65\u201375 with ASA classification \u2160~\u2162 grade. The participants considered for the study are those who do not have a medical history of craniocerebral surgery, craniocerebral trauma, severe speech sound hearing impairment, comprehension and articulation disorders that prevent effective communication, and completion of preoperative psychological function tests."

Based on the title and the condition being studied, I suggest including patients who are over the age of 65. This criterion is reasonable as the study focuses on elderly patients who are at a higher risk for perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction. What do you think?",
            "Exactly. Now, for the next inclusion criterion, I propose including patients with ASA classification \u2160~\u2162 grade. The ASA classification system assesses a patient's overall health status and helps determine the risk of complications during surgery. Including patients with ASA classification \u2160~\u2162 ensures that the study participants are in relatively good health and can safely undergo the diagnostic tests and cognitive function assessments. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Firstly, I suggest excluding patients with a history of previous Craniocerebral surgery or Craniocerebral trauma. Patients with such history may have pre-existing cognitive impairments that could confound the results of the study. What do you think?",
            "Exactly. Now, for the next exclusion criterion, I propose excluding patients who are unable to successfully complete preoperative psychological function tests. This is important as we need reliable data for the study, and patients who cannot complete these tests may not provide accurate information. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Absolutely. Lastly, I suggest excluding patients who are severely deaf, speech impaired, or otherwise unable to communicate effectively. This is crucial as effective communication is necessary for participating in cognitive function assessments and providing accurate information. What do you think?",

The first one I would suggest we include is \"Any other known diagnosis that could cause thrombocytopenia,\" such as ITP or SLE. This is important since HIT may be challenging to diagnose, and other diagnoses could interfere with the platelet/leukocyte aggregates measurements in patients with HIT. What are your thoughts?",

Now, moving on to exclude criteria, the first one is \"Pregnancy or lactation.\" Since the study involves collecting blood samples from patients, this criterion is necessary to avoid any potential harm to the baby. The second one is \"History of bleeding diathesis syndrome or active bleeding.\" The study focuses on HIT, an adverse reaction to heparin, and it involves analyzing platelet aggregates. However, we need to exclude patients with a history of bleeding diathesis or active bleeding, as their platelet aggregation profiles could be affected by this, resulting in misleading results. This is the third exclusion criterion. What do you think thus far?",

We exclude patients who undergo emergency surgery because they may have different characteristics and outcomes compared to elective surgery patients. Including them could introduce bias. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. The second exclusion criterion is open surgery. We exclude patients who undergo open surgery because the study specifically focuses on laparoscopic total hysterectomy. Including patients who undergo open surgery could introduce variability in techniques and outcomes, making it difficult to compare the suture materials. Your thoughts?",
            "Exactly. Moving on, the third exclusion criterion is patients who have undergone immunosuppressive drug treatment within the prior 6 months. These patients may have altered immune responses and healing processes that could affect the study outcomes. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said. The fourth exclusion criterion is patients with hypersensitivity or allergy to the suture material. Excluding them is crucial to prevent complications or adverse reactions during the study. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. The fifth exclusion criterion is participation in another clinical study. We exclude patients who are already participating in another study to prevent potential interactions between interventions and ensure that the results are not influenced by concurrent participation. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you understand. Lastly, the sixth exclusion criterion is non-compliance of the patient. We exclude patients who are non-compliant with study procedures or follow-up requirements to ensure the validity and reliability of the results. Your thoughts?",

            "The first inclusion criterion is \"Diagnostic criteria for autism according to the DSM-5.\" So, the individuals being recruited for the study are meeting the diagnostic criteria for autism as outlined in DSM-5. Why is this inclusion criterion important?",
            "Another criterion could be having a caregiver who is willing to participate in the intervention. This could include parents, caregivers, family members, legal guardians, or other individuals who take care of the infant. Having caregivers as participants could increase their understanding of the intervention, help them learn better ways to care for the infant, and improve the caregiver-infant relationship. It could also increase the infant's social interaction and stimulation, which could have a positive impact on their social development. This could be particularly relevant for interventions like Snoezelen, which involve both the infant and their caregiver in a joint experience. What are your thoughts on that?",
            "Great idea! Then the next inclusion criterion on the list is \"ages two to thirty-six months.\" This criterion has two main reasons. First, autism can be diagnosed as early as 24 months of age, therefore it's important to capture children as young as possible. Second, by age thirty-six months, it's evident that infants have not developed certain developmental milestones, warranting further evaluation for potential developmental delays. How does this criteria align with other studies?",
            "Sure! The second criterion is \"Age below one year old.\" This criterion is important as it has been shown that infants have greater neuroplasticity compared to older individuals (e.g., children, adolescents, and adults). By targeting this age group, we can ensure that the intervention is optimized for maximum benefits and long-term effects. In addition, it is important to note that early intervention for infants has been shown to reduce symptoms and improve developmental outcomes. Lastly, previous research has demonstrated that the age group of 6 to 24 months has an increased susceptibility to stress factors, such as sleep disturbances, which can impact their vulnerability and resiliency to stress in later life.",
            "Yes, considering prematurity is an important criterion for inclusion. The study should specify a minimum gestational age that allows for similar neurodevelopment among infants. These infants may demonstrate a higher risk for developmental delay, and thus, it's important to include them in the study. Premature infants should be provided with extra support within the study, such as specific training and monitoring to ensure their safety and well-being throughout the intervention period. Thank you for this contribution.",

It helps to exclude participants who do not meet the diagnostic criteria to avoid potential confounding effects that may impact the results of the study. Since participants who are eligible for the study will have been diagnosed with ASD, it would be helpful to include the criterion \"Parental consent for participation in the study and completion of all assessments\". This criterion ensures that parents are aware of the study and agree to participate, and they understand the importance of completing all assessments, including baseline and follow-up assessment. This helps in maintaining participants' engagement and reducing potential attrition throughout the study. Let's discuss the fourth criterion next.",

The penultimate exclusion criterion is: \"History of any systematic or local complications after periodontal treatment.\" This criterion excludes participants with previous history of complications after periodontal treatment, as this could impact the results of the study or pose additional risks to the participant. Should we include this criterion?",
            "Alright. The final exclusion criterion is: \"Smoking of more than five cigarettes per day.\" The number of cigarettes per day (five or more) is an important indicator to consider. The literature suggests that smoking five cigarettes per day can have negative effects on periodontal health and healing. On the other hand, smoking less than five cigarettes per day may be within the threshold for causing damage to one's periodontal health. Including this criterion will help control for the impact of smoking status on the study results. How about we include this criterion as well?",

Informed consent is a critical component of clinical research, and including patients who are unable to provide consent due to cognitive impairment would violate ethical guidelines. Excluding these patients helps protect their rights and ensures that only individuals who can fully understand the risks and benefits of participating in the study are included. Additionally, we should exclude patients with known but untreated heart disease, such as persistent foramen ovale (PFO) or recent congestive heart failure, as it could complicate comparability within the groups. Patients with untreated heart disease may have underlying conditions that could impact their oxygenation and airway management, potentially confounding the results of the study.

So, the waitlist treatment condition will serve as a control group, and there will be two experimental interventions: cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for smoking and CBT + DiMeSALUD2 protocol. DiMeSALUD2 protocol, by the way, is an interactive electronic health intervention for smoking cessation and lifestyle improvement. Is that correct?",

This criterion takes into account that diabetic patients may suffer from other chronic diseases that could make them more vulnerable to adverse effects of the treatments used in your clinical trial. Additionally, it sets clear boundaries for the study population.",

The second criterion is that all patients meeting the inclusion criteria must have a distal radius fracture, based on the American College of Radiology (ACR) wrist hand classification , confirmed by CT scan and X-rays. It's important to have a homogeneous group of patients so that we can evaluate the effectiveness of 3D printed implants. Do you agree?",
            "That's correct! The next inclusion criteria are that patients must provide informed consent and must have a full bone conduction, good osteoarticular, and articular conditions before surgery. This criterion ensures that the patient is fully aware of the surgery and the expected outcomes and the patient's consent has been obtained before surgery. It also includes other health conditions, including bone conduction and osteoarticular conditions, which need to be present before and after surgery. However, it seems that the patient population is limited. Please tell me if you agree with me.",
            "Completely agree. The fourth inclusion criterion is fracture reduction, with a maximum displacement of less than 15 mm. This criterion ensures that only patients with an acceptable degree of bone displacement after a distal radius fracture are included in the study. This inclusion criterion helps in ensuring that the baseline characteristics of the study population are consistent across the two treatment arms. Do you have any questions or thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Now that we've covered the inclusion criteria, it's time to talk about exclusion criteria. Are you up for that?",
            "Great! Let's start with the first exclusion criterion, which is the presence of a pathological fracture. The presence of a pathological fracture may indicate underlying bone disease or have different causes not related to the radius fracture itself. Therefore, this group of patients would have to be excluded to ensure a more accurate analysis of the effects of the 3D printing intervention on distal intra-articular radius fractures. What are your thoughts?",
            "You're right. The second exclusion criterion is previous surgery with implants, plates, or screws at the fracture side of the wrist. This criterion excludes patients from the study who have undergone previous surgery on the affected side, which could impact the fracture reduction. Do you agree?",

This aims to ensure that the results of the study are not affected by concomitant conditions in the participants. Any thoughts?",
            "Absolutely! The final exclusion criterion is having a bone deformity on CAT-scan, except for osteoarthritis of the radiocarpal joint. This criterion is important because it aims to ensure that the fracture being assessed in the study is as uniform and comparable as possible. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I like the way you put it. Lastly, we have the exclusion criterion of other languages that the patient does not understand. As it can be challenging to adequately translate research information into many languages, this criterion is being used to limit the impact of language barriers on the informed consent process.

This ensures that the study population is homogenous and that the effects of 3D printing on the distal radius fracture can be accurately assessed without interference from other injuries. What do you think?",

While I understand the motivation behind excluding participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding, I believe that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not be ruled out. Instead, researchers could offer them the opportunity to participate in the study after they've completed their pregnancy, considering that pregnancy can significantly impact the severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, researchers could develop a separate category to examine the effects of the intervention on pregnant mothers. Regarding the exclusion of participants who have undergone stem cell transplantation, I would recommend reviewing the clinical characteristics of potential participants in each study group. If a potential participant has a reasonable probability of not experiencing any long-term adverse effects, they could be eligible for the study despite the transplant. However, if they are excluded based on the severe neurotoxicity that may occur during transplantation, I would agree to exclude them.",

The first criterion is individuals aged 20 and above, inclusive, who can autonomously decide to participate in this study and complete the Participant Consent Form. This ensures that participants are of legal age and have the capacity to provide informed consent. What do you think?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, let's move on to the second inclusion criterion. It states that patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, receiving chemotherapy for the first time, and being prescribed the standard FOLFOX regimen with Oxaliplatin as the primary agent are eligible. This criterion allows for a more controlled and consistent sample population. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's discuss the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is excluding individuals with an undiagnosed medical condition. This ensures that the participants have a clear understanding of their health status. What do you think about this criterion?",

Moving on, the second exclusion criterion includes individuals with specific medical conditions such as thyroid disorders, diabetes, undergoing dialysis, pregnant women, alcohol abusers, and those with immune-related diseases like lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Excluding these individuals helps minimize confounding variables that could affect the study results. What are your thoughts?",

            "Absolutely. The second inclusion criterion is \"BMI \u226530 kg/m2.\" this criterion ensures that participants are severely overweight or obese. While mild and moderate obesity may contribute to cardiovascular disease risk, people with severe obesity have the highest risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This criterion is a logical choice for a study on obesity and CVD. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Good point. Now, we can move on to the third criterion. \"Body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 kg/m2.\" This criterion ensures that individuals who are overweight or obese can participate in the trial. Given that we are studying a weight loss intervention, this is a necessary criterion. How do you feel?",
            "Great! Alright, let's move on to the fourth criterion: \"No history of significant cardiovascular disease (CVD) (e.g. documented acute coronary syndrome, documented history of myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy [echocardiography], documented history of coronary revascularization, angina or non-laboratory defined unstable or uncontrolled angina, New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class \u2265III, documented history of cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension with BP \u2265160 mmHg systolic or \u226595 mmHg diastolic, or clinical disease stage III chronic kidney disease or defined as end-stage renal disease).\" This criterion ensures that participants do not have any underlying heart conditions, which may predispose them to cardiovascular events. What do you think about it?",
            "Agreed. Based on the above criteria, we can identify eligible participants who meet certain inclusion criteria and are therefore likely to benefit from the study medication. Next, we move on to the exclusion criteria. The fifth exclusion criterion is \"Active DFUs\". This criterion is important to exclude participants with diabetic foot ulcers since the purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of naltrexone-bupropion combination drug therapy in preventing major adverse cardiovascular events. What do you see with this exclusion criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, the second exclusion criterion is \"Active smoking status.\" This criterion is included because of the potential interactions between nicotine and the study drugs. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fully agreed. Moving on to criterion number 3, \"Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \u2265110 mmHg).\" This criterion ensures that participants will be eligible for the trial regardless of their blood pressure, which is one of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Agreed. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion, which is \"Unstable or uncontrolled CAD, cerebrovascular disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, or any other potentially unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease.\" Participants with unstable cardiovascular disease may be not only at higher risk for cardiovascular events but also likely to need different treatment strategies. What do you think?",

Pain is a key criterion for diagnosing dentin hypersensitivity because it is what the patients subjectively experience. This criterion ensures that all participants have a similar level of pain at baseline, thereby making subsequent comparisons more reliable. Do you agree with this criterion?",

            "Great! The third criterion: no other forms of treatment (eg, fluoride toothpaste, antibacterial mouthwash) or restorative treatment within study duration. This criterion is important as it ensures that participants have not undergone other forms of treatment that could affect the results of the study. Also, it helps in ensuring that the effects that occur in patients are due to either of the two interventions and not the additional treatments. What do you think about this criterion?",

            "Great. Now that we have all the basic information, let's start designing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Shall we begin with the inclusion criteria?",
            "Alright. Based on the goal of the clinical trial, it would be appropriate to include only low-risk pregnant mothers. This means we should exclude pregnant mothers with conditions such as hypertension, headache, bleeding, and infection. Does that make sense?",
            "Exactly. Including only low-risk pregnant mothers helps us assess the effect of perineal warm compress techniques in a controlled population. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Shall we?",
            "Alright. One of the exclusion criteria should be pregnancy with any health problems such as preeclampsia. Preeclampsia can lead to complications during labor and delivery, so it's important to exclude pregnant women with this condition. Does that make sense?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's continue with the exclusion criteria. Another criterion should be the exclusion of pregnant women with bleeding. Pregnancy-related bleeding can be a sign of underlying health issues that could affect the trial's outcomes. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Perfect. Let's move on to the next exclusion criterion. We should exclude pregnant women with obstructed labor. Obstructed labor can lead to complications for both the mother and the baby. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Lastly, we should exclude pregnant women who have had a previous cesarean section. Women with a history of cesarean section may have different perineal outcomes compared to those who haven't. This helps us assess the effect of perineal warm compress techniques in a homogenous population. Does that sound reasonable?",
            "Fantastic! We have now completed the design of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Here is the full criteria:\n\nInclusion Criteria: Low-risk pregnant mothers (excluding those with hypertension, headache, bleeding, and infection).\n\nExclusion Criteria: Pregnancy with any health problems such as preeclampsia, bleeding, obstructed labor, and previous cesarean section.\n\nIs there anything else I can assist you with?"

            "Excellent criterion! In addition, we should include patients who have been prescribed topical wound care medications (for example, saline, iodine or mafenide acetate). This is because it allows the imaging of the target microvessels, and the study of the effects of the medications on wound healing.",
            "Great! Another criterion could be patients who have infections in the wound or a gangrenous wound. Infection will affect the healing process, so we want to exclude this as a bias. We should also exclude other conditions that might affect microvascular function, such as neuropathy, vascular disease, or autoimmune disease.",
            "Yes, it certainly can. In addition, we should exclude patients with deformities caused by neurogenic or vascular impairment below the knee as this can affect wound healing. It would also be beneficial to exclude patients who have received non-routine non-ulcerative care for their ulcer in the last 30 days because non-routine non-ulcerative care could interfere with the natural progression of healing. What do you think about these exclusion criteria?",
            "To sum up, here are the inclusion criteria for your clinical trial:The wound surface should be not less than 2 sq cm and not greater than 15 sq cm.The wound duration should be at least 6 weeks.Patients should not be on antibiotics.The wound should be located on either the lower extremity or foot.",
            "Alright. Another exclusion criterion could be a history of major amputation or amputation. This is because having a major amputation or amputation may suggest a more impaired vascular state due to tissue necrosis and a higher risk of infection, and it would be desirable to enroll individuals who have a more intact physiological state.",
            "I agree. Another inclusion criterion could be that there is a clinical indication of a wound being considered for treatment involving either negative pressure wound therapy or a combination of standard wound therapy and negative pressure wound therapy. This will allow us to evaluate the use of these methods in combination with microvessel imaging.",
            "Great. One more inclusion criterion we could consider is having follow-up visits for repeated examinations. The first ultrasound examination should be done at the time of enrollment. Subsequent examinations should be conducted monthly until complete healing or at the end of the study, whichever comes first. What do you think?",
            "Exactly. Finally, for the exclusion criteria, we could add diabetes patients who do not have optimal blood glucose control as per the previous criterion. This will help ensure that any confounding factors related to diabetes are excluded.",
            "Fantastic. Now, another inclusion criteria could be that there is no limitation on the medications the participant is taking. This will allow us to examine the safety of the microvessel ultrasound examination without limitations in the medication taken to treat the chronic wound.",
            "Exactly. Conversely, another exclusion criterion could be bad tissue oxygen supply to the wound, with a TCPO2 measurement below 30mmHg in patients with neuropathic etiology of diabetic foot syndrome. This will help us exclude patients with poor blood supply to the wound, which could negatively affect wound healing and introduce confounding factors.",
            "Well done. So far, we have discussed including chronic ulcers with a duration of at least 6 weeks and a range of wound sizes and excluding acute ulcers, active infection or antibiotic use, smokers, chronic venous ulcers with venous reflux less than 0.5 seconds, patients with unsatisfactory blood glucose control, and patients with poor blood supply to the wound. Great job making it this far!",

            "Correct. Lastly, we should exclude smokers. Smoking is known to impair wound healing and microvessel circulation, so excluding smokers will help control for this factor.",
            "Excellent. So far, we have discussed the inclusion criteria of chronic wounds with specific durations and sizes, and the exclusion criteria of acute wounds, active infection or antibiotic use, and smokers. Shall we continue discussing the remaining criteria?",
            "Alright. One inclusion criterion could be that for chronic venous ulcers, ultrasound should demonstrate venous reflux greater than 0.5 seconds. This will help us include patients with specific types of chronic wounds that might have different underlying pathophysiology affecting wound healing and microvessel circulation. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now, as for the exclusion criteria, we should exclude patients with venous ulcers who have inadequate venous reflux, demonstrated by ultrasound showing less than 0.5 seconds. This will help us focus on a specific subgroup of patients who might benefit more from the microvessel ultrasound examination.",
            "Great. Moving on, another inclusion criterion could be satisfactory blood glucose control, with fasting blood glucose levels not exceeding 110 mg% and HbA1c levels below 6.5%. This will ensure that patients with diabetes have well-controlled blood glucose levels, which is crucial for wound healing and accurate assessment of microvessel circulation. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely. On the other hand, we should exclude patients with unsatisfactory blood glucose control, where fasting blood glucose levels exceed 110 mg% and HbA1c levels are below 6.5%. This will help ensure that the study focuses on patients with optimal conditions for wound healing and accurate assessment of microvessel circulation.",
            "Precisely. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. One inclusion criterion could be satisfactory blood supply to the wound, verified by the measurement of the oxygen level of the foot tissue (TCPO2) greater than 30mmHg in patients with neuropathic etiology of diabetic foot syndrome. This will ensure that patients have adequate blood supply to the wound, which is essential for wound healing and accurate assessment of microvessel circulation. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now, for the exclusion criteria, we should exclude patients with poor blood supply to the wound, verified by the measurement of TCPO2 less than 30mmHg in patients with neuropathic etiology of diabetic foot syndrome. This will help ensure that the study can accurately assess the effects of the microvessel ultrasound examination on wound healing in patients with adequate blood flow.",
            "Absolutely. We're almost done. One more inclusion criterion could be a clinical improvement of the limb's blood supply as a result of a revascularization procedure documented by ultrasound for patients with wounds of ischemic component. This ensures that patients with ischemic wounds have undergone appropriate interventions to improve blood supply before participating in the study, which is crucial for accurate evaluation of wound healing and microvessel circulation. What do you think?",
            "Precisely. Lastly, we should exclude patients with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.8. This criterion ensures that patients have adequate arterial blood flow to the lower extremities, which is important for wound healing and accurate assessment of microvessel circulation.",

This is essential as we will be comparing the PET imaging results to other methods such as MRI or CT scans. If the participants have previously undergone imaging, the results could affect the PET scans. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Do you have any requirements regarding the presence or absence of metastases?",

If we proceed with the trial without ensuring that they have exhausted other treatment options, there is a risk of including a large number of subjects who could have been treated with other therapies without the need for the HistoSonics Edison System. This may raise ethical concerns about subjecting subjects to unnecessary procedures and risks in case the system shows adverse events. We must also ensure that we have an adequate number of subjects who have exhausted their treatment options.",

It specifies that the tumor should be 2-4 cm in longest diameter and located at least 1.0 cm away from any portion of the duodenum, small intestine, stomach, or colon as visualized on ultrasound, CT, or MR imaging. These criteria ensure that the trial focuses on tumors that are suitable for treatment with the HistoSonics Edison System. What do you think about these criteria?",

The study follows a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) design, which simply means that participants will receive one of the different dose levels of the study drug. Participants will also receive 15 mg of rhuMH-RA1 subcutaneous injections for Days 1 and 6. The investigational drug (TUR03 or Soliris) will be administered as an intravenous infusion for 90 minutes on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

This is done to avoid bias in the results because these treatments would affect the results being measured. I think this is a crucial criterion given the invasiveness of the treatment. What do you make of this criterion?",
            "Next, participants who have used fillers within 6 months of the treatment must be excluded. The fillers can impact the study results because they change the skin structure and may still be present during the study period. Excluding participants who have used fillers within 6 months ensures a fair evaluation of the treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "That's great to hear! The next criterion is having already received an injectable filler within the last 12 months. To avoid interference or bias in the results of the treatment being studied, individuals should not have undergone previous similar treatments before participating in a clinical trial. This ensures that the desired results can be attributed to the treatment being evaluated. What are your thoughts on that criterion?",
            "Great! The last exclusion criterion is being treated with immunosuppressants. Immunosuppressive medications can increase the risk of skin infection by reducing tissue oxygen tension. They also affect collagen and elastic tissue synthesis, increasing the risk of treatment complications. Excluding individuals on immunosuppressive medications ensures a consistent outcome to the treatment and reduces potential risks. Do you agree with excluding individuals who are taking immunosuppressive medications?",

            "Got it. By excluding participants with prior bladder cancer within the last five years, we can focus on the effects of SI after URS on primary UTUC. The third criterion is lymphovascular invasion and tumor stage. What are the exclusion criteria regarding these?",
            "Great. Excluding participants who have undergone a prior radical cystectomy helps to focus on those who have not received standard treatment for noninvasive UTUC and has more prognostic information. Lastly, let's discuss the exclusion criterion for anatomical location. What anatomical location of the primary lesion should exclude participants?",
            "Indeed. Excluding participants with concomitant bladder cancer ensures that the study focuses on the target population and potential complications due to concurrent bladder cancer can be avoided. The fifth criterion concerns the site of the tumor. Should the study include participants with noninvasive, low-grade, or high-grade UTUC?",
            "Yes, that's correct. Including participants with bilateral UTUC could make it difficult to interpret the results since bilateral UTUC is a significant clinical event, and it would be challenging to separate the outcomes from the intervention. The sixth criterion involves urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS). What should be done with participants who have CIS?",

This will help us to identify potential trends and differences in vaccination attitudes and behaviors across different regions. What are your thoughts on this standard?",
            "Fantastic! Can you also provide your input on the recruitment criteria? The recruitment criteria state that 20 participants will be recruited from each of the four clinics: 10 participants for each of the intervention group and the control group.

This is crucial to ensure that we have motivated and engaged participants, which can lead to more reliable data collection and better outcomes for the intervention. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is excluding individuals with terminal diseases. This is reasonable as individuals with terminal illnesses may have unique healthcare needs and priorities that could impact their vaccination decisions. Additionally, their health condition may prevent them from fully participating in the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Let's proceed to the second exclusion criterion, which is excluding individuals with cognitive impairment. By excluding individuals with cognitive impairments, we ensure that participants can provide informed consent and accurately report their vaccination attitudes and behaviors. This criterion is necessary to maintain the validity of the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said! Now, let's discuss the last exclusion criterion. It states that individuals with main immune deficiency conditions should be excluded.

It suggests using stratified random allocation within the pediatric or adult stratum to decide which sites will receive the intervention. This approach ensures that the intervention is evenly distributed among different patient populations within the selected clinics. What are your thoughts on this standard?",
            "Well said! Lastly, we have the third quantitative study standard. It states that blinding will be impractical in this study since the intervention is at the facility level (group intervention) rather than the patient level.

            "Also, the second criterion is that the participant must have not had the disease progression of hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer within 1 year before signing the informed consent form. The reason for this is that we want to enroll participants who have not been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in the past year, and who do not have metastatic disease. Do you agree with these two inclusion criteria?",
            "Great. The third criterion is that the participant must have stage IIA, IIB, or IIIA (lymph node-positive) breast cancer. Stage IIA and IIB represent higher stages of the disease, thus making it more likely to progress. Stage IIIA disease presents with lymph node involvement, which is more advanced than stage IIB. Is that correct?",
            "Great! The fourth key inclusion criterion is that based on pre-defined tumor and nodal staging, the participant must be considered either high risk for recurrence, as defined by St. Gallen I (stage IIA HR+ HER2-), St. Gallen II (N1a and stage IIB HR+ HER2-), St. Gallen III (stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC HR+ HER2-), or be considered as having a potential for high risk of recurrence of breast cancer as defined by St. Gallen IV (stage IA, IB, and IIA HR+ HER2-, N1b HR+). This criterion describes the type and stage of breast cancer that the potential participant must have in order to be eligible for enrollment. In summary, participants must have HR+ HER2- early breast cancer, stage IIA and above, or stage IA, IB, and IIA HR+ HER2- and N1B to be eligible for enrollment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Alright. Moving on to exclusion criteria. The first criterion is that the participant must have previously received a systemic antibiotic within the 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study therapy and/or a systemic QT interval corrected at the upper limit of normal (QTc4, Fridericia\u2019s correction) on screening electrocardiogram (ECG; baseline ECG performed prior to the 1st on-treatment dose), as the safety of ribociclib is being evaluated in subjects at increased risk for QT interval prolongation (i.e., receiving systemic antibiotics and/or having a QTc4 of 450ms or greater). Do you agree?",
            "Alright. For the sixth criterion, participants in the Anatomic Stage Group II (subset) and Stage Group I (high-risk subset as exploratory cohort) should have a high tumor burden, confirmed by the central lab or local lab review. This criterion is to ensure that participants have a sufficient tumor burden to allow the study to evaluate the efficacy of the adjuvant treatment. Do you have any concerns with this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on to the seventh criterion, it states that the participant should have no history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer, except as described in Sect. 8. Any administration of any type of investigational drug within 4 weeks of initiation of adjuvant ET, within the study, is prohibited because these drugs may interfere with the pharmacokinetics of the study treatment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Now, let's move on to the key exclusion criteria. The first one is that the participant is experiencing locally advanced, active, or progressive breast cancer. This is important as the study is specifically focused on early breast cancer. The second criterion states that a primary adjuvant tumor-directed systemic therapy or prior cytotoxic systemic therapy for the breast cancer has been administered. If the participant has previously been treated with hormone or cytotoxic systemic therapy, it can potentially confound the results of the study treatment. If the participant has received some types of adjuvant systemic therapy (e.g. trastuzumab), they may still be eligible. The third exclusion criterion is that the participant has concurrent medical conditions that would render participation in this particular study unsafe or interfere with the study objectives, including symptomatic brain metastases, congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy, or history of QT interference-inducing cardiac arrhythmias. This is to ensure the safety of the participants and to limit any potential interference with the study objectives. Do you have any questions about these exclusion criteria?",
            "Perfect. The first exclusion criterion states that female participants should not be postmenopausal. This criterion is necessary to avoid confounding the assessment of the study treatment's effectiveness, as premenopausal patients would continue to menstruate and have cyclic changes, which could affect their response to the treatment. Is this clear as the first exclusion criterion?",
            "Great. Moving on to criterion number two, persons with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status greater than 2 would be excluded from participating in this study. This ensures that participants are able to tolerate the study treatment and accurately assess its effectiveness. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Moving on to the third criterion, it states that participants with a history of noncompliance to therapy or evidence of current noncompliance to adjuvant ET is a reason for exclusion. This helps to ensure that participants who are excluded based on this criterion are not at risk of invalidating the study results. Would you agree with that reasoning?",
            "Perfect. Moving on to the fourth criterion, it state that women of childbearing potential should not participate in this study. This criterion helps to ensure the safety of participants and to prevent long-term effects on any potential unborn fetus in the case that pregnant women were enrolled. Is that correct?",

            "Perfect. Now let's start designing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We'll begin with the inclusion criteria. Based on the information you've provided, I can suggest the first criterion: \"Adult patients indicated for elective intubation.\" This is important because patients who require intubation are likely to have more severe smoke inhalation injury and are at a higher risk for developing acute lung injury. What do you think?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's move on to the second criterion. How about \"History of being trapped in a house or industrial fire\"? This ensures that patients have a clear history of smoke inhalation injury, which is the target population for the study.",
            "Precisely. The next criterion is \"Production of carbonaceous sputum.\" Carbonaceous sputum is a common finding in patients with smoke inhalation injury and indicates exposure to toxic substances. This criterion helps to identify patients with significant inhalational trauma. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Great. Moving on, we have \"Perioral facial burns affecting nose, lips, mouth, or throat.\" Perioral facial burns are indicative of exposure to smoke and hot gases, increasing the likelihood of inhalational injury. This criterion helps to identify patients with a higher risk of acute lung injury. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's discuss the next criterion. How about \"Altered level of consciousness at any time after the incident and including confusion\"? Altered mental status is a sign of systemic toxicity and can indicate severe smoke inhalation injury.",
            "That's correct. Moving on, we have \"Symptoms of respiratory distress including a sense of suffocation, choking, breathlessness, and wheezing or discomfort affecting the eyes or throat, including irritation of the mucosal membranes.\" Respiratory distress is a common symptom of smoke inhalation injury and is associated with acute lung injury. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The next criterion is \"Signs of respiratory distress including stertorous or labored breathing, and tachypnea or auscultatory abnormalities, including crepitations or rhonchi.\" These signs are indicative of airway compromise and lung injury, which are important factors in the development of acute lung injury.",
            "Exactly. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. How about \"Hoarseness or loss of voice\"? Hoarseness or loss of voice can indicate injury to the upper airway, which is a common finding in patients with smoke inhalation injury.",
            "Great. Now, let's discuss the last inclusion criterion. How about \"Evidence of bronchial burn by bronchoscopy to assess the severity of inhalational trauma\"? Bronchoscopy is a direct method of assessing the extent of airway injury in patients with smoke inhalation injury.",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. We'll start with the first one. How about \"Burn injury > 24 hours\"? Patients with burn injuries that are more than 24 hours old may have already developed complications that could confound the results of the study.",
            "Precisely. The next exclusion criterion is \"History of pulmonary diseases.\" Pre-existing pulmonary diseases may influence the development of acute lung injury and could affect the response to the intervention. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "That's correct. Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion. How about \"Pregnancy or breastfeeding\"? Pregnancy and breastfeeding can introduce additional risks for both the mother and the fetus/infant.",

Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. Participants who have initiated an exercise program for cardiopulmonary rehabilitation within 90 days prior to the screening visit are excluded. Why do you think this is necessary?",

            "Great! The third exclusion criterion is having any abnormalities in salivary flow. Abnormalities in salivary flow may affect periodontal health and can potentially impact iodine levels. Excluding individuals with these conditions helps to maintain the clarity and accuracy of the study results. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! The final exclusion criterion is undergoing treatment for thyroid disease or using antithyroid drugs. Individuals requiring thyroid disease treatment or using antithyroid drugs are being excluded to eliminate possible confounding variables related to the thyroid gland. We know that both the thyroid and the salivary glands are derived from the same embryonic structures, and an altered thyroid function can affect the salivary glands leading to decrease in saliva production. By excluding individuals receiving treatment for thyroid disease or taking antithyroid drugs, we can more accurately analyze the relationship between iodine deficiency and periodontitis. Any questions regarding this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. The fifth exclusion criterion is being a student or employed by the university of any of the researchers. This criterion helps to combat potential issues of conflict of interest associated with conducting research at the same institution as one is employed or enrolled. Excluding individuals in these positions ensures an objective assessment of the experimental results. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! The sixth exclusion criterion is participating in other research studies. Ensuring that participants do not take part in other research studies helps to maintain the integrity of the study results. Any involvement in other research could impact the outcomes of the study, so excluding individuals participating in other studies guarantees accurate analysis. Thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! I hope this exercise has been helpful in clarifying inclusion and exclusion criteria for you.

            "Exactly! The second inclusion criterion is that individuals should not have been continuously treated with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or similar drugs in the last 6 months. Continuous use of these medications could affect the outcomes of the study, so excluding individuals who have been on such medications ensures that the results are not skewed. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! Moving on to the third inclusion criterion, individuals should not have received periodontal treatment until 6 months ago. This helps to ensure that the study results are not influenced by recent interventions that could affect periodontitis status. By establishing a baseline for periodontal health in participants, we can accurately assess the relationship between iodine deficiency and periodontitis. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Precisely! The fourth inclusion criterion is that individuals must have at least 14 teeth. Having a minimum number of teeth is important for an accurate assessment of periodontal health. Participants with fewer teeth may not provide a representative sample of periodontitis severity. Ensuring a reliable sample will help us analyze the relationship between iodine deficiency and advanced periodontitis. Any questions or comments about this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Moving on to the final inclusion criterion, patients diagnosed with stage 3 periodontitis are eligible to participate. Including patients with this specific stage helps us target individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease. This criterion allows for a more focused analysis of the relationship between iodine deficiency and advanced periodontitis. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Now let's discuss the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is having a systemic disease such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, thyroid organ pathologies, or chronic kidney failure. Excluding individuals with these conditions helps to control for potential confounding variables that could impact the study outcomes. By doing so, we can more accurately assess the relationship between iodine deficiency and periodontitis. Any questions about this criterion?",
            "Perfect! The second exclusion criterion is being pregnant or breastfeeding. Both pregnancy and breastfeeding can affect iodine levels and periodontal health. Excluding individuals in these conditions helps to maintain the integrity of the study results by eliminating additional variables that may complicate the analysis. Thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! The third exclusion criterion is being on medication for any reason. This helps to eliminate the potential impact of drugs on periodontitis and iodine levels. Medications can influence the outcomes of the study, so excluding participants on medication ensures that the results are not confounded by this factor. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! Moving on to the fourth exclusion criterion, being a smoker or tobacco user. Smoking and tobacco use are known risk factors for periodontal disease and can also affect iodine levels. Excluding smokers and tobacco users helps to control for these factors and ensures that the study results are not influenced by these variables. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect! The fifth exclusion criterion is having another periodontal disease other than periodontitis. This criterion helps maintain the focus of the study specifically on periodontitis. Including participants with other periodontal diseases could introduce additional variables that may complicate the analysis of the relationship between iodine deficiency and periodontitis. Any questions or comments about this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Lastly, the sixth exclusion criterion is having a chronic inflammatory disease such as COPD or asthma. These conditions can impact periodontal health and may also affect iodine levels. By excluding individuals with these conditions, we can control for potential confounding variables and ensure that the study results are not influenced by other inflammatory diseases. Thoughts on this criterion?",

The first exclusion criterion is \"Documented diagnosis of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or other acute leukemia based on Reviewer 2 interpretation of cytology/morphology and/or flow cytometry.\" This criterion helps to ensure that the investigational drug is evaluated in a more homogenous patient population. It helps to rule out patients with promyelocytic leukemia. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "The first exclusion criterion is a \"platelet count < 25 \u00d7 10^9 /L or ongoing active hemorrhage or history of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).\" Platelets play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the vascular system and promoting wound healing. As a consequence of their essential function, thrombocytopenia can lead to hemorrhage and an increased risk of bleeding. Also, a history of DVT or PE may contraindicate the use of certain anti-cancer drugs, including some investigational drugs. This criterion ensures that participants have a similar risk of bleeding and thrombosis and can help maintain participant safety during the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great! The next exclusion criterion is \"Any other condition in the opinion of the investigator would preclude the participant from receiving study therapy based on any medical, psychological or social reason (unrelated to study treatment).\" This criterion helps to ensure participant safety during the study by excluding patients who may have clinical characteristics or co-existing conditions that may place them at risk. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! The next exclusion criterion is \"Documented cerebral (seizure; status epilepticus; cerebrovascular event) or thrombotic event that is active and not controlled with anticonvulsive therapy or anticoagulation therapy, respectively.\" Ensuring that participants do not have active/uncontrolled cerebrovascular events helps to prevent potential drug interactions or increased risk of toxicities when administering the investigational drug. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! The last exclusion criterion is \"Have a medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the subject at risk, would confound the study results, or would interfere with the subject's participation in the study.\" This criterion allows the investigator to exclude patients who have other confounding disease or condition that may interfere with study outcomes. The investigator, who has intimate knowledge of the patient, is in the best position to make such judgement. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Great! Moving on to the next exclusion criterion, we have \"Pregnancy or nursing.\" Excluding pregnant or nursing patients helps to avoid potential risks of exposure to the investigational drug. This criterion also helps to maintain the integrity of the study by minimizing confounding factors that could affect the safety or efficacy of the investigational drug. What do you think about this criterion?",

How about adding that participants who are undergoing shoulder arthroplasty with preoperative and postoperative electrocardiograms (EKG) available? This criterion ensures that we have a way to measure the impact of the interventions on the phrenic nerve. By including this criterion, we can potentially discover any electrical changes that may result from the combined anterior suprascapular nerve block and superficial cervical plexus block. What do you think of the third inclusion criterion?",
            "Great. I've included the third criterion (i.e. population is restricted age of 18 to 80 years). In terms of exclusion criteria, I see that you have added one. Please describe the interventions and settings.",

How about including participants with a history of phrenic nerve damage, such as phrenic nerve injury related to prior surgeries or preexisting phrenic nerve pathology? In these cases, the interventions may not have a significant impact on pain symptoms as the phrenic nerve damage may be irreversible.",
            "For the exclusion criteria, how about excluding participants with hypersensitivity to local anesthetics or pre-existing axillary neurological deficits? This is important to avoid potential adverse reactions or mask the neurological effects of the interventions. The criterion ensures that the results can be attributed to the specific interventions used.",

What are your thoughts on excluding participants who have uncontrolled systemic comorbidities that could warrant the use of central neuraxial blockade? Comorbidities that can warrant the use of central neuraxial blockade can pose significant risk to patients and would most likely require monitoring during and after the procedures. By excluding these individuals, we can ensure the safety of participants, while maintaining the consistency of the study data by excluding patients who are likely to require additional monitoring. What are your thoughts on this?",

Since our study aims to investigate the effects of the interventions on phrenic nerve function, including participants with pre-existing diaphragmatic paralysis could skew the results and make it difficult to assess the true impact of the interventions.",
            "Excellent. That criterion has been included. Now, let's discuss excluding individuals who have an allergy or toxicity to local anesthetic agents. This is essential for participant safety, as using local anesthetics in participants with known allergies could lead to severe adverse reactions.",
            "Perfect. The criterion regarding allergies or toxicity to local anesthetic agents is now included. Lastly, what do you think about excluding individuals with an opioid drug allergy? Since opioids are commonly used for pain management in surgical procedures, including participants with opioid allergies could limit the treatment options available and potentially compromise pain management strategies during the study.",

This means that the CSU symptoms must be at least moderate in severity and should persist for at least one year. This criterion can be objectively confirmed by the eligibility criteria, such as the UAS7 or UAS7-3 scores greater than 18 or 10, or self-reported moderate symptoms (for example, self-reported distress with CSU symptoms, such as waking up at night or having trouble concentrating or falling asleep due to CSU). What are your thoughts on this inclusion criterion?",
            "Perfect! Next, we have another criterion that states participants should have at least 6 wheals per day during the 2 weeks prior to randomization. The rationale for this criterion is that participants who experience more wheals are more likely to benefit from the treatment. How does this criterion sound to you?",
            "Now this next inclusion criterion is a little different because it states that participants should have a wheal size of either greater than or equal to 7.5 mm at the time of randomization. The rationale for this criterion is that it addresses the severity of the condition, specifically taking into account the size of the lesions, which is a defining characteristic of CSU. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

It states that participants should be willing to comply with the study procedures, defined follow-up, and administration of the study drug or placebo for the duration of the study. Compliance with clinical trials is essential for reliable outcomes, so this criterion ensures that the participants can cooperate with the researchers and follow the study rules appropriately. What do you think?",
            "Great deal! The next criterion is an FVIIa level of more than 60% of normal at the time of screening. The reason for this criterion is that patients with normal or increased levels of FVIIa have a lower likelihood of responding to anti-IgE treatment. Including this criterion helps ensure that the trial recruits the right group of patients. What do you think?",

Our aim is to have participants with similar characteristics and medical conditions as much as possible in order to provide more reliable results. Now, let's start with the first exclusion criterion. Is it sufficient for me to state that it is a criterion \"to ensure a consistent urticaria course\"?",

It states that participants with a history of QTcF of greater than 480 msec or a family history of QT syndrome, congenital long QT syndrome, or an abnormal family history of prolonged QT should be excluded. This criterion is another safety measure to ensure a low risk of cardiovascular adverse events during the trial. What's your opinion on this criterion?",

As the trial aims to evaluate the use of Raphamin, we should exclude patients currently taking medications that may interfere with the trial. This includes antibiotics and antimicrobial medications such as nitrofurantoin, nalidixic acid, fosfomycin, and fluoroquinolones within the last three days. Additionally, we should exclude patients who were administered an antimuscarinic agent (e.g., anticholinergic agent) or on a course of a local vaginal treatment for urinary tract infection within the last month. The exclusions of patients taking medications that may interfere with the results would help ensure that we get accurate and reliable results from the trial. What are your thoughts?",

We should exclude patients with malignant neoplasms of the urinary tract, ureter stone, more than 50 ml of residual urine in the bladder, and suspicion of bladder tuberculosis. Excluding these patients is important to avoid potential confounding factors and ensure the reliability of the study results. What do you think?",
            "Exactly. Let's proceed to the next exclusion criterion. We should exclude patients with indications for hospitalization due to a serious condition, macrohematuria, and complicated cystitis. This is necessary to prioritize the safety of participants and avoid potential complications during the trial. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",

Perventricular TAVI is a relatively novel approach involving punctures of the ventricular septum to facilitate implantation. The procedure may result in a more substantial degree of ventricular septal defects compared to standard transfemoral implantation.

Docetaxel is chemotherapy and an androgen receptor-targeted agent is a drug that inhibits or blocks the receptor that is known to have a role in prostate cancer. The starting dose of this drug will be at least 10% greater than its pharmaceutical-specific dose-limiting concentration (DLC10). Patients will need to take this drug every 14 days.

Patients' attitude and motivation towards receiving physiotherapy interventions can greatly affect their participation and adherence to the intervention, which can influence the study outcomes. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "Great, I'm glad you agree with this criterion. Regarding the exclusion criteria, here are some suggestions. We should exclude individuals with a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. Using the National Institutes of Health definition of interstitial cystitis, patients with interstitial cystitis exhibit significant pelvic pain mapped to the bladder, associated with increased bladder urothelial cytology, increased bladder tissue mast cells, and lack of typical causes of the pain. Including participants with interstitial cystitis may introduce confounding variables and affect the interpretation of study results. Do you agree?",
            "Great! Another exclusion criterion could be patients with any type or severity of hypersensitivity to the components of the study devices. This is to avoid any potential adverse effects that may occur as a result of using any of the study devices. Previous adverse events associated with some of the study devices have occurred, and the severity of the adverse events ranges from mild to severe. What do you think?",
            "Great! Lastly, patients who are currently participating in a clinical trial should be excluded. This is important to prevent contamination between clinical trials and ensure that the results remain unbiased. It is also important to protect the rights of patients to ensure that they are not being exploited for research purposes and to maintain ethical standards in research. Do you agree?",
            "Excellent. Lastly, we should consider pain that is localized to the bladder or the urethra. This is to ensure that patients have true bladder pain syndrome, as opposed to other types of pelvic pain. Specifically, patients who are candidates for this study should have pain that is localized to the bladder or the urethra (as confirmed by medical diagnosis). Including patients who have other types of pain may introduce confounding factors that affect the study results. What do you think?",
            "Great! The last criterion could be unplanned conception. We don't want to end up treating a man in case there is cross-over with the intervention. This criterion can be waived if no suitable alternatives are available. Do you agree with that?",
            "Great. Moving on, another exclusion criterion should be uncontrolled psychiatric, psychological, or severe cognitive disorders, as these may interfere with the evaluation of the study's outcome. Only patients with a confirmed, diagnosed psychiatric, psychological, or cognitive disorder and those who are actively engaging in treatment for these disorders should be excluded. Patients with severe cognitive impairment may not be able to complete study questionnaires and follow the instructions for the procedure being studied.",
            "Great! One final exclusion criterion should be an inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent. This is important to ensure that participants are aware of the risks and benefits of the study, and provide informed consent for their participation. Does that sound reasonable?",
            "Well said. The last exclusion criterion could be prior pelvic floor therapies with no improvement or pelvic floor physical therapy in the past. Participants who have previously undergone physical therapy may have unresolved pelvic floor problems that could confound or complicate the study results. Excluding such participants can help to minimize bias in the study. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Great! Now that we have the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we can now start work on other protocol sections. The eligibility criteria section should include a detailed list of the information participants will receive about the study. They should be informed about the purpose of the study, procedure for the study, risks and benefits of participating, and what the study will require of them in terms of time commitment.",
            "You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that you found the criteria comprehensive and inclusive of all relevant factors. Keep in mind that clinical trials are a rigorous process, and a detailed and thorough design is essential for the accuracy and reliability of the results. If you have any other questions about the trial or the patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, feel free to ask. Good luck with the trial!"

            "Excellent. Moving on, another criterion could be a diagnosis of Bladder Pain Syndrome as evidenced by a score greater than or equal to six on O'Leary-Sant Voiding and Pain Indices. This will ensure that participants have a confirmed diagnosis of bladder pain syndrome. Using a validated scoring system like the O'Leary-Sant Indices helps to standardize the diagnosis and ensure consistency among participants. How does that sound?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Lastly, we can include DEERS-eligible health care beneficiaries. This may be important for logistical reasons, as participants who are DEERS-eligible may have easier access to healthcare services and follow-up appointments. This can help ensure compliance and continuity of care throughout the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the information provided, one criterion should be patients with current enabled implantable neurostimulation. This is to avoid confounding factors that could affect the study results. Patients with existing neurostimulation devices may already be receiving treatment for their bladder pain syndrome, which could interfere with the evaluation of the new treatment being studied. What do you think?",

This is important to ensure the safety of participants, as patients with active malignancies may have compromised immune systems and may not be suitable candidates for the procedure being studied. Does that sound reasonable?",

This is important to ensure the safety of participants during the procedure, as patients with decompensated cardiac or hemodynamic disorders may be at higher risk of complications. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Another criterion could be neurogenic bladder and patients with spinal cord injury. Patients with these conditions may have different underlying causes of bladder pain syndrome that could affect the study results. It is important to focus on a specific population to ensure the validity of the study results. What do you think?",
            "Precisely. Another exclusion criterion should be current pregnancy. This is essential to protect the health of the fetus and ensure the safety of the pregnant participant. Pregnancy can also affect pain perception and response to treatment, so it is important to exclude pregnant individuals from the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Lastly, we can include a criterion of structural abnormalities of the spine that prevent the performance of the procedure. This is necessary to ensure that the procedure can be safely and effectively performed on participants. Structural abnormalities of the spine may increase the risk of complications during the procedure. How does that sound?",

Now that we have agreed on the inclusion criteria, let's move on to defining the exclusion criteria. I will provide some possible exclusion criteria, and you can let me know if you would like to add or remove any. Let's start with excluding patients with a BMI greater than 40, as morbidly obese patients may require higher doses of caffeine and sodium benzoate, and including them could confound the study results.",
            "Very well. The next exclusion criteria are: personal or family history of maternal or fetal complications (seizures, psychosis, congenital anomalies), and substance abuse or addiction. These exclusion criteria are recommended due to potential confounding factors that could affect the study outcome. Specifically, maternal or fetal complications could lead to premature labor or affect the progression of labor. Additionally, substance abuse or addiction could affect the progression of labor and neonatal outcomes. By excluding these conditions, the trial can better evaluate the effect of the intervention on the second stage of labor. What are your thoughts about including these criteria?",
            "Great. Now, let's check the next exclusion criterion. How about diabetes, pre-eclampsia, or eclampsia? These conditions could impact the outcomes of the trial, and specifically, the intervention being studied. Excluding patients with these conditions helps ensure the validity of the study results. What are your thoughts on including this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's consider the next exclusion criterion: a positive urine toxicology screen. Similar to the previous exclusion criterion, excluding patients with a positive toxicology screen is important as these substances could interact with the intervention or affect the outcomes of the trial. What are your thoughts on including this criterion?",
            "Great. And now let's look at the last exclusion criterion: prolonged second stage of labor longer than six hours. Excluding patients with a prolonged second stage of labor is important as this could increase the risk of complications and affect the outcomes of the trial. It is necessary to have a clear baseline health status to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the second stage of labor. What do you think about this criterion?",

            "Thank you for providing the necessary information. Now let's move on to designing the inclusion criteria. We'll start with nulliparous pregnant mothers at term (37 weeks gestation and above). This criterion is necessary as the trial is specifically focused on low-risk nulliparous mothers at term. Including only nulliparous mothers ensures that the study population is homogenous and reduces confounding variables that may arise from previous childbirth experiences. Additionally, focusing on term pregnancies ensures that the results are applicable to a specific stage of pregnancy. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now let's move on to the next criterion. How about including an age range of 18-45 years? This range is likely chosen to ensure that the participants are within a reproductive age range and to minimize potential risks associated with pregnancy in younger or older individuals.",
            "Excellent. Now, let's consider the next criterion: intravenous access.

Excluding patients with hypertensive disorders is important as these conditions may impact the outcomes of the trial and could potentially interact with the intervention being studied. It is necessary to have a clear baseline health status to evaluate the effect of caffeine and sodium benzoate on the second stage of labor. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion: significant cardiac history. Patients with significant cardiac history may have underlying conditions that could be exacerbated by the intervention or may confound the results of the trial. Excluding these patients helps ensure the safety of participants and the validity of the study results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion: a positive drug screen for cocaine or amphetamines. Excluding patients with positive drug screens is important as these substances could interact with the intervention or affect the outcomes of the trial. Ensuring a drug-free population helps maintain the integrity of the study results. What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's consider the next exclusion criterion: fetal malpresentation.

Excluding patients with hepatic impairment is important as these conditions may affect the metabolism and clearance of the intervention drugs, potentially leading to safety concerns or confounding results. Ensuring a healthy liver function helps maintain the safety and validity of the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Now, let's discuss the final exclusion criterion: lack of prenatal care. Excluding patients who have not received prenatal care is necessary as these individuals may have unknown health conditions or risk factors that could impact the outcomes of the trial.

            "The fourth criterion could be \"Patients should have a life expectancy of at least 3 months.\" This criterion ensures that we focus on patients who are likely to benefit from the study intervention. By including patients with a relatively long life expectancy, we can observe the impact of ND-003 on treatment outcomes and overall survival.",
            "Indeed, that is essential. I recommend \"Subjects have a performance status of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2 within 14 days prior to registration and randomization.\" This ensures that we include patients who can tolerate the trial's safety profile and complete the study procedures. What do you think?",
            "Moving on, the next criterion is \"Have adequate organ function as indicated by laboratory test results, vital signs, and electrocardiography (if available) within 7 days (14 days for serum creatinine assessment), including: hemoglobin \u2265 12 g/dL; neutrophil count \u2265 1,000/mm3; platelet count \u2265 75,000/mm3; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u2264 2.5 X upper limit of normal; alkaline phosphatase \u2264 2.5 X upper limit of normal; and creatinine clearance of \u226550 mL/min by Cockroft\u2013Gault equations (or corresponding normal values for local laboratory reference).\" These tests assess major organ function and ensure that participants can tolerate the treatment. How do you feel about including this exclusion criterion?",
            "We definitely need to include that. I propose \"Subjects have normal organ or bone marrow function as defined by laboratory values (except for patients with hematologic malignancies where normal values are defined by leukocyte count of < 12.0 \u00d7 109/L, leukopenic with absolute leukocyte count of > 4.0 \u00d7 109/L, anemia with hemoglobin \u2265 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count of \u2265 100 \u00d7 109/L).\" This criterion aims to ensure the safety of the treatment. What are your thoughts?",
            "For the eighth criterion, I recommend \"Subjects have no severe acute or chronic disease that precludes their participation in the study.\" This criterion helps to eliminate potential confounding factors, such as underlying medical conditions that could impact study results. It is essential to maintain the integrity of the study. What do you think?",

How do you feel about this criterion?",
            "Finally, I suggest including the criterion \"Not participating in any other clinical trials within 30 days of enrolment into the present study (from the time of informed consent) or if currently enrolled in another clinical trial, have an observational period at least 1 month prior to first dose and 28 days following last dose of study treatment.\" This criterion helps ensure that participants are not exposing themselves to additional risks or undergoing confounding interventions. What do you think about this?",

Here are some exclusion criteria that I can suggest based on the information you've provided: \"Patients with significant liver function test abnormalities\" or \"Patients with other known significant comorbidities\" could be added as general exclusion criteria to exclude those patients that are not eligible for the study. What are your thoughts on these?",
            "Perfect. The first exclusion criterion could be \"Subjects with any condition, including other primary malignancies, which may interfere with the goal of the study, as determined by the Investigator.\" This criterion ensures that participants do not have any underlying conditions that could interfere with the study's aims.

I suggest the exclusion criterion \"Scheduled to undergo major surgical procedures during the study.\" This criterion aims to rule out potential complications from the administered drug that may result in postoperative morbidity or even mortality. What do you think?",
            "For participants with uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system metastasis, I suggest the exclusion criterion \"Ascites or pleural effusion from the original cancer, and any degree of intracranial hypertension suspected to be related to cancer or from the original cancer.\" This criterion ensures that the investigational drug is tested on participants with minimal risk of exposure to symptoms from central nervous system metastasis. What do you think on this?",
            "The next criterion could be \"Active or serious infection; severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical conditions; history of HIV infection.\" This criterion ensures that participants do not have active infections or other serious conditions that may confound the study results. What are your thoughts?",
            "The next exclusion criterion could be \"Long QT syndrome or history of an unexplained episode of syncope or QT interval of over 480 ms on baseline ECG on electrocardiographic examination.\" This criterion prevents severe and even life-threatening adverse events in participants with a predisposition to long QT syndrome. What do you think?",
            "In terms of pregnancy, I suggest the criterion \"Women who are childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks before the first dose of investigational drug or be surgically sterilized or practice effective contraception methods for at least 2 weeks before taking the first dose and for at least 6 months after the study drug administration.\" This criterion ensures that participants are not pregnant and can safely receive the investigational drug without potential harm to the fetus. What are your thoughts?",
            "For participants with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, I propose the exclusion criterion \"Currently have alcohol, narcotic and/or cocaine abuse within the past 2 years.\" This criterion excludes individuals with a history of substance abuse and aims to identify a safe and reliable population. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Regarding the criterion \"Positive HIV, syphilis, active tuberculosis, hepatitis C, or active hepatitis B,\" let me explain. These criteria are commonly excluded to avoid the interference of infectious diseases on the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug. In this case, including these exclusion criteria aims to exclude participants with these conditions.",

The first exclusion criterion mentions that participants diagnosed with cancer are not eligible for study participation. This criterion is consistent with the standard of care for older adults receiving psychosocial support interventions and recognizes that the emotional needs of cancer patients require specialized interventions. However, it is worth noting that older adults with cancer face unique psychosocial needs and challenges. Including this group could widen the scope of the study and provide valuable insights into the applicability of PST in this context. Can you please expand on the rationale for this exclusion criterion?",
            "Great! The fifth and final inclusion criterion is that the study participants should have psychological distress, as assessed by the PDS questionnaire, with a score of 20 or higher. This criterion is used to identify individuals who are experiencing high levels of psychological distress and may benefit from interventions such as PST to help manage their psychological challenges. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Fantastic! The second exclusion criterion is severe psychiatric illness, as indicated by a score of 14 or higher on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Individuals with current severe mental health conditions may require a higher level of care that exceeds the scope of this study. Excluding participants with severe psychiatric illness helps ensure the safety and well-being of those involved in the trial. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Lastly, the third exclusion criterion is that participants who are currently receiving other psychological treatments cannot be included in the study. This is necessary to avoid potential conflicts in results due to an individual receiving two different types of interventions at the same time. If the PST intervention were to interact with the other psychological treatment, it may be difficult to discern which outcomes are associated with which intervention. This could lead to inaccurate conclusions about the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effects of delivering PST to older adults undergoing surgery. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Thank you for confirming all the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the \"PST in Surgery: Feasibility and Acceptability Pilot\" clinical trial. Now, let's move on to designing the intervention. The first step is to understand the context of the intervention. In this case, the context is a major surgery with an anticipated hospital stay of 3 or more days. Can you please describe the characteristics of this patient population?"

            "Perfect! Lastly, could you let me know the study type and phase of this trial?",
            "Thank you for providing all the necessary information. Now let's move on to designing the criteria for this trial. We'll start with the inclusion criteria. The first criterion is age. The study requires participants to be 65 years of age or older on the day of surgery. This is important because the intervention is specifically targeting older adults who may have unique psychosocial needs and challenges when facing major surgery. Studying this age group will provide valuable insights into the feasibility and acceptability of delivering PST in this context. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Great! Moving on to the second inclusion criterion. Participants should be scheduled for major surgery with an anticipated hospital stay of 3 or more days. This criterion ensures that participants are undergoing significant surgical procedures that may have a substantial impact on their psychosocial functioning and postoperative outcomes. Including participants with longer hospital stays allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the intervention's effects. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Excellent! The third inclusion criterion is that participants should be undergoing major operations, specifically orthopedic, thoracic, abdominal, or cardiac procedures. Limiting the study to specific types of major surgeries helps to ensure that participants have similar experiences in terms of the surgical procedure and potential postoperative challenges. This can help control for confounding variables and provide more accurate results regarding the feasibility and acceptability of PST in this context. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Now, let's move on to the fourth inclusion criterion. Participants should have depressive symptoms, as screened by the PHQ-9 questionnaire, with a score of 6 or higher. This criterion ensures that the intervention is targeted towards individuals who may benefit the most from PST. Screening for depressive symptoms also helps to identify those who may be at higher risk for poor postoperative outcomes and who may require additional support during the surgical process. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion is severe cognitive impairment. Individuals with a score of 5 or higher on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) will be excluded from the study. This is necessary to ensure that participants can actively engage in and benefit from the PST intervention. Severe cognitive impairment may limit the individual's ability to participate in therapy sessions, understand the intervention, and provide meaningful feedback on its feasibility and acceptability. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Great! The second exclusion criterion is that participants should be able to read, speak, and understand English. This is important for ensuring effective communication between the participants and the research team delivering the intervention. Language barriers can hinder the delivery of the intervention and the collection of accurate data, potentially impacting the study's outcomes and conclusions. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Perfect! Lastly, the third exclusion criterion is current alcohol or other substance abuse. Individuals with current substance abuse issues will be excluded from the study. This is important as these individuals may have unique psychosocial needs that could confound the results of the study. Substance abuse can also impact the individual's ability to engage in therapy and may require additional support and resources that are beyond the scope of the study. Can you please confirm this criterion?",
            "Excellent! We have now finalized the full criteria for this clinical trial. Here is the summary:\n\nInclusion criteria:\n1. Age \u2265 65 years\n2. Scheduled major surgery with an anticipated hospital stay of 3+ days\n3. Major operations include orthopedic, thoracic, abdominal, and cardiac procedures\n4. Depressive symptoms - PHQ-9 screening with a score of 6+\n\nExclusion criteria:\n1. Severe cognitive impairment\n2. Unable to read, speak, and understand English\n3.

            "Fantastic! Now let's refine the third criterion into two subcriteria. The first subcriterion will be \"EF measured within 3 months of study enrollment\". This will ensure that the patient's condition remains stable for the duration of the study and that the ejection fraction value is accurately representative of their current state. The second subcriteria will be \"EF < 55%\". This will further ensure consistency in analyzing patients with mildly impaired ejection fraction. Would you like to discuss the fourth criterion?",
            "Fantastic! Now let's move onto the fifth criterion. We can say \"Excluded patients with acute conditions or acute exacerbations\". Occurrence of acute conditions or acute exacerbations of HFpEF can confound the interpretation of results, as the clinical characteristics and predictors would change significantly, thereby making it difficult to determine the true values of the clinical characteristics.",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now moving to the exclusion criteria, I suggest we include \"Symptoms solely due to noncardiac etiology\". This will help us ensure that the identified clinical characteristics and predictors of adverse outcomes are truly due to cardiac dysfunction and not other underlying medical conditions.",
            "Great! The second criterion I think should be \"Diagnosed with non-cardiac disease causing heart failure\". Excluding patients with non-cardiac causes of heart failure ensures that patients included in the study have heart failure that is likely due to cardiac causes. This will help to focus the analysis on the characteristics and predictors of adverse outcomes specific to those with HFpEF.",
            "Fantastic! Now for the third exclusion criterion, I suggest adding \"Patients with unstable or uncontrolled comorbidities\". This will eliminate confounding factors and help ensure that the reported clinical characteristics and predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with HFpEF are associated specifically with HFpEF and not other comorbidities.",
            "Great! Now let's continue with the fourth exclusion criterion. I propose adding \"Patients with infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 or any other active infection\". This is important as infectious diseases can impact cardiac function and affect clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with HFpEF.",
            "Perfect. Now for the fifth exclusion criterion let's add \"Unstable angina or acute coronary syndrome within 3 months of enrolment\". Excluding patients in this period ensures that we focus on the patients' stable comorbidities and not the recent acute heart conditions, which may significantly impact their outcome.",
            "Exactly. Moving on, the sixth exclusion criterion could be \"Other forms of cardiomyopathy or heart disease\". Excluding patients with other forms of cardiomyopathy or heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, will help us better understand the prevalence and characteristics of HFpEF, which is the primary focus of the study.",
            "Absolutely! Moving on to the seventh exclusion criterion, I propose including \"Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)\". Excluding patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy allows for a more specific focus on HFpEF and its impact on patients.",

            "Perfect! Moving on to the fourth criterion, I propose including \"BNP\u226535 pg/mL and/or NTproBNP\u2265125 pg/mL\". Elevated levels of BNP and NTproBNP are commonly used biomarkers for heart failure and indicate increased cardiac stress. Including patients with elevated levels of these biomarkers will help us identify individuals at higher risk for adverse outcomes. What do you think?",
            "Great! Now for the final inclusion criterion, I suggest adding \"At least one additional criteria: presence of cardiac functional and structural abnormalities or diastolic dysfunction\". This will ensure that patients included in the study have additional evidence of cardiac abnormalities beyond just the diagnosis of HFpEF, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of predictors of adverse outcomes.",
            "Excellent! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Based on the reasons provided, the first criterion should be \"Age >18 years old\". Excluding patients under 18 years old ensures that the study focuses on adult patients who are more likely to have HFpEF and relevant clinical characteristics and predictors of adverse outcomes. What are your thoughts?",

Excluding patients with significant coronary artery disease ensures that the study focuses on patients with HFpEF and not those with coronary artery disease as the primary cause of their symptoms.",
            "Perfect. Lastly, the eighth exclusion criterion should be \"History of myocardial infarction\". Excluding patients with a history of myocardial infarction helps ensure that the study focuses on patients with HFpEF and not those with a history of acute coronary events that may impact the outcomes being analyzed.",

We want to include patients who are experiencing relapse or who have been previously treated but are still experiencing minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow. Do you consider these patients to be part of the populations that the study is targeting?",
            "Excellent. We have to make sure that participants fully understand what they are participating in and are able and willing to provide consent. Next, are there any additional exclusion criteria to be aware of?",
            "Great. Limiting participants to those with an ECOG status of 3 or less is definitely important, as you mentioned. And this criterion will also help you narrow down your participant pool. Now, let's move on to the fourth criterion, which is patients with any cytogenetic abnormalities are not eligible to participate in the trial. This criterion is included to ensure that the trial is focused on patients with AML who are likely to respond to the treatment, excluding those with certain genetic abnormalities that make them less likely to respond. Have you considered or do you have any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great point. This criterion will ensure that participants have failed to respond to the initial VENETOCLAX-AZACITIDINE therapy and are thus more likely to respond to DASATINIB monotherapy. Next, let's move on to the fifth criterion, which is previous HMAs and/or MDSA. This criterion is an inclusion criterion which ensures that participants have previously been treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) and/or MDSA, regardless of their response to those treatments. Including these patients is important because it ensures that the target population being studied is one that is likely to have failed conventional treatments. This will allow us to evaluate DASATINIB monotherapy in a population that is refractory to traditional treatments. Do you have any suggestions or questions about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. A signed informed consent form is essential in clinical trials. Now, the final criterion is the one you brought up earlier, which is no previous history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational product. This is important because any possible intolerance or hypersensitivity would interfere with the patient's ability to take the drug and, therefore, would affect the results of the trial. Do you agree with this or would you recommend any changes to this criterion?",

Participants\u2019 access to healthcare resources and support throughout the trial is certainly important to ensure their well-being and successful study completion. Now, let's move on to the final inclusion criterion, which is availability of caregiver. This criterion ensures that participants are able to participate in the study without being inundated with too many requirements, and that they have someone to support them throughout the trial. Any thoughts on including the availability of caregiver?",
            "Great. The first exclusion criterion is an ECOG score > 3. This criterion ensures that the participants are not experiencing advanced or life-threatening health conditions, which may interfere with the study outcomes. Do you have any suggestions regarding this criterion?",

By excluding patients who are eligible for other targeted therapies with a market authorization, we can ensure that the study results are not influenced by other alternative treatments. Now, let's discuss the second exclusion criterion, which is participation in any other clinical trial at the time of enrollment or within 30 days. This criterion helps maintain the integrity of the study data and ensures that participants are not being simultaneously assessed for different treatments. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Including only patients without central nervous system involvement will help us to evaluate the efficacy of DASATINIB monotherapy more accurately and to draw conclusions that are not confounded by differences in treatment response in this patient population. Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion, which is grade > 1 thrombocytopenia at screening. This criterion ensures that the participants do not currently have grade 1 thrombocytopenia at the time of enrollment. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Excluding patients with pre-existing organ failures can help us maintain a more homogenous study population and ensure that any drug metabolism or response to treatment differences are due to the DASATINIB treatment and not pre-existing conditions. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion, which is pregnancy. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Excluding patients with contraindications to DASATINIB is important for patient safety and to minimize any potential adverse drug-related events. We have discussed all the exclusion criteria. How did you find this process?",
            "A great point. Being positive for HIV, Hepatitis B, or C can compromise immune systems, which can interact with the study drug. Excluding participants with these infections helps maintain patient safety and the efficacy of the trial. Now let's discuss the sixth exclusion criterion, which is unwillingness to receive the study treatment. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Excluding pregnant or breastfeeding women and those without efficient contraception will help prevent harm to the fetus and maintain a more controlled study population. Now, let's move on to the seventh exclusion criterion, which is history of chronic inflammatory bowel disease requiring systemic treatment. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Yes, that's correct. By excluding those who are unable to express informed consent or those under legal protection measures, we can maintain the autonomy of the participants by ensuring that they have the full capacity to provide informed consent, which is essential for ethical clinical trial conduct. To ensure that accurate data is collected, excluding those who cannot undergo clinical trial medical follow-up for various reasons will maintain a more uniform study population. Now that all the criteria are set, it's important to address the participants who fail to complete the treatment course within the 28 days of study period. Do you have any thoughts for handling these patients?",

The first criterion mentioned is a confirmed diagnosis of AML except Philadelphia chromosome-positive AML (Ph+) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML M3). This is to ensure that the participants have the specific type of acute myeloid leukemia that the study is targeting. Do you have any suggestions or ideas regarding this criterion?",
            "That's a valid point. By excluding Ph+ AML and AML M3, we can focus on evaluating the efficacy of DASATINIB monotherapy in a more homogeneous group. Now, let's move on to the second criterion, which is age \u2265 18 years. This criterion ensures that the participants are adults who can provide informed consent and are likely to have similar responses to the treatment. Any thoughts on this?",
            "Exactly. Age is an important factor when it comes to informed consent and treatment response. Now, let's discuss the third criterion, which is ECOG \u22643. The ECOG performance status measures how well a patient is able to perform daily activities. Limiting participants to those with an ECOG score of 3 or less ensures that they are physically capable of participating in the trial and are likely to have better outcomes. Do you have any suggestions for this criterion?",
            "That's a good point. Including patients with ECOG scores of 3 or less will ensure that they are physically capable of participating and are more likely to have better outcomes. Now, let's move on to the fourth criterion, which is VEN-AZA refractory defined as no response after two cycles of VEN-AZA whatever the dose and the treatment duration. This criterion ensures that the participants have truly failed to respond to the VENETOCLAX-AZACITIDINE therapy, which is essential for evaluating the efficacy of DASATINIB monotherapy in this specific patient population. Any ideas for this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Including only patients who have failed to respond to VENETOCLAX-AZACITIDINE therapy will allow us to assess the efficacy of DASATINIB monotherapy in this specific patient population.

This criterion helps to ensure that the study results are not confounded by the use of alternative treatments. Do you have any suggestions or thoughts regarding this criterion?",
            "That's a valid point. By excluding patients eligible for other targeted therapies, we can focus on evaluating the specific efficacy of DASATINIB monotherapy without any confounding factors. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion, which is central nervous system involvement. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Patients with central nervous system involvement may have different treatment responses and outcomes, so excluding them will help us maintain a more homogeneous study population. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion, which includes heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Any ideas for this criterion?",
            "That's correct. Patients with pre-existing organ failures may have altered drug metabolism and treatment responses, so excluding them will help us maintain a more consistent study population. Now, let's discuss the fourth exclusion criterion, which is contraindication to DASATINIB. Any suggestions for this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Patient safety is of utmost importance, and excluding those with contraindications to DASATINIB will help minimize the risk of adverse events and ensure the well-being of the participants. Now, let's move on to the fifth exclusion criterion, which includes being positive for HIV, Hepatitis B or C. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "That's correct. Patients with these infections may have compromised immune systems and potential interactions with the study drug, so excluding them is necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of the trial.

Any ideas for this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. By excluding pregnant or breastfeeding women and those without efficient contraception, we can minimize potential harm to the fetus and ensure that the study results are not confounded by pregnancy-related factors. Now, let's discuss the last two exclusion criteria, which include emergency situation individuals, those unable to express informed consent, and patients under legal protection measures, as well as those unable to undergo the clinical trial medical follow-up for geographical, social, or psychological reasons. Any thoughts on these criteria?",

            "Completely agree. Excluding participants with uncontrolled chronic illnesses is a valid criterion to ensure accurate evaluation of the on-body injector's adherence performance. Another criterion we should consider is excluding participants with severe sensitivity or allergic reaction to adhesives. These participants may not be able to tolerate the adhesive used on the on-body injector, and this condition could potentially interfere with the study results. What do you think?",
            "Great! Now let's consider excluding participants who are receiving therapy that affects body sites of administration or interferes with the drug-injector system. For example, participants who have undergone a major surgical procedure involving the axillary or deltoid area or are receiving subcutaneous therapy. What are your thoughts about these criteria?",
            "Exactly. Before any clinical trials, researchers need to establish a sample size with statistical power to collect a sufficient amount of data for analysis. Based on this study's objective, what do you suggest we take into consideration to determine the sample size?",
            "As discussed earlier, we need to exclude participants who have used EpiPen\u00ae, Tegaderm\u2122, or similar devices for a significant period prior to study entry. This will help us avoid potential confusion or bias in participants' responses due to their recent experience with similar devices. What do you think?",
            "Now, let's move on to the last exclusion criterion. This one is somewhat related to the age criteria I mentioned earlier. Participants who are under 18 years of age or undergo regular dialysis should be excluded as well. These age categories and dialysis could impact the blood flow and skin, potentially affecting the adherence performance. What are your thoughts on excluding participants based on age or dialysis?",
            "Excellent! Now let's move on to the last exclusion criteria. We need to exclude participants who have taken investigational or non-approved drugs within 30 days before the start of the study. This ensures that the data obtained during the study are reliable and valid. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

We need to ensure that all instructions are understood to accurately evaluate the on-body injector. What are your insights on excluding participants on this basis?",
            "Well said. I believe we covered all the necessary exclusion criteria. We need to ensure that we exclude participants who may not be suitable for evaluating the adherence performance of the on-body injector but are willing and able to provide accurate data and follow the study procedures.",

Additionally, participants should be willing to wear a loose-fitting, short-sleeved shirt during each of the two study visits. What are your thoughts on these criteria?",
            "I completely agree with you. It's important for participants to be fully committed to the study and willing to follow all procedures. Another criterion we should consider is the willingness to have hair clipped at the application site if necessary. This ensures that participants are willing to comply with any necessary preparations for the application of the device on the arm. What do you think?",

            "Absolutely. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Participants who are undergoing treatments that interfere with the coagulation system, decrease platelet function, or reduce platelet count should be excluded. These treatments might impact the skin and blood clotting, potentially affecting the study results. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Well stated. We should also exclude participants who have undergone peeling, laser treatment, or dermabrasion on their arms. These treatments could potentially affect the skin's integrity and adherence of the on-body injector. What are your insights on this criterion?",

These conditions, such as ulceration, inflammation, or swelling, may interfere with the application or adherence of the on-body injector. What do you think about this exclusion criterion?",
            "Excellent point. Participants with a history of skin sensitivity or allergic reactions to adhesives, particularly acrylic adhesive, should be excluded as well. Allergic reactions could affect the adherence performance of the on-body injector. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

            "You're absolutely right. Another criterion we should consider is excluding participants who are not willing to shave long hairs from their arm before the application of the on-body injector. This ensures proper adherence and avoids any interference caused by long hairs. What do you think about this exclusion criterion?",

            "Understood. The third criterion could be patients who suffer a unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. This excludes patients who may have bilateral proprioceptive deficits, caused for instance by infarcts in the contralateral thalami due to the initial event, which may yield erroneous results. The fourth criterion could be patients that experience proprioceptive deficits. This excludes patients with intact proprioception, which would not allow for the proper testing of the intervention under investigation. What do you think?",
            "Agreed! The fourth criterion we can consider is the lesion type. It seems reasonable that ischemic stroke lesions can affect the entire territory of the arteries they are located in and possibly involve brain structures responsible for proprioception. However, non-ischemic strokes are caused by different mechanisms, such as brain trauma, tumors affecting the brain parenchyma, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. This may lead to different outcomes, as some functional areas of the brain may not be severely affected, which might hinder the measurement of the main variables of interest: reaction time, balance, gait, and proprioception. Do you agree that lesion type can be included as a criterion as well?",
            "Great! I'll add time from stroke to 3 months as the fourth criterion. Moving on, the fifth criterion will focus on age. Specifically, we may want to consider age 18 years and older as this captures adults and accounts for common age of onset of stroke in a way that is not too restrictive. Let me know if you would like to add or modify anything within this criterion.",
            "Great! I'll adjust the criterion accordingly. Our sixth criterion will include only patients with mild to moderate impairment on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). This allows us to assess the relationship between proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance parameters at a range of impairment levels. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent! I'll add that grad 3-5 in the Functional Ambulation Category as the sixth criterion. The seventh criterion we need to consider is proficiency in English. This is to ensure that participants can understand the instructions and follow the interventions. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Fantastic! I'm impressed that we completed the inclusion criteria for this clinical trial, and we did it quite quickly, considering our discussion involved many email exchanges. It's important to have a well-defined and clear set of inclusion criteria to ensure that the study includes the optimal population for understanding the effects of proprioception after stroke.",
            "Perfect. Here's the first exclusion criterion: history of neurological disorders and neurological conditions (such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polyneuropathy), and severe orthopedic conditions in lower limbs. Excluding individuals with these conditions will help eliminate potential confounding factors and ensure that the study focuses on the impact of proprioception on gait, balance, and reaction time in individuals with specific neurological deficits associated with post-stroke syndrome. What do you think about this first exclusion criterion?",
            "Absolutely! I'm so glad you agree with the first exclusion criterion. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion. I suggest adding the criterion of any musculoskeletal or orthopedic impairments unrelated to stroke. This criterion ensures that participants do not have any pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions that may confound the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Correct! Including people with multiple strokes would indeed introduce confounding variables. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion: cognitive aphasia. Excluding cognitively impaired individuals ensures that all participants are able to understand task instructions and participate in the study properly. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Got it! This criterion will allow us to isolate the effects of proprioception deficits from those of strokes in specific brain regions. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion: diagnosis of cognitive disorders. Participants with cognitive disorders may not understand or remember how to perform the study\u2019s functional assessments. Thus, this criterion will help to increase study validity and reliability. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "That's a great point. Several factors can affect proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance. Ensuring that the study excludes participants with epilepsy will allow us to isolate the specific effects of proprioception deficits on gait and balance parameters without potential confounding variables. Now, let's move on to the fifth exclusion criterion: cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, severe cognitive deficits, Parkinson's disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Excluding participants with these conditions will help to control for variables that can affect proprioception and balance. What are your thoughts on excluding these conditions from the study?",
            "Great! Excluding participants with cognitive impairments will help ensure that assessments related to proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance are not confounded. Now, let's discuss the sixth exclusion criterion: aphasia.

What do you think about including this criterion?",
            "Perfect! I'll include hemiparesis as the third criterion. Now, let's discuss the fourth criterion: time from stroke to 3 months. Limiting the time frame to 3 months helps to capture the acute phase of stroke recovery when proprioception deficits may have a significant impact on gait and balance. What are your thoughts on this?",

Excluding participants who do not provide informed consent maintains ethical standards and ensures that all participants are fully aware of the study and its implications. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Prioritizing informed consent is crucial for maintaining ethical standards. Now, let's move on to the second exclusion criterion: second or subsequent stroke. Excluding participants with multiple strokes helps to control for potential confounding variables that may arise from recurrent strokes. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Exactly! By excluding participants with multiple strokes, we can focus on the effects of proprioception deficits in individuals experiencing their first stroke. Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion: stroke of the brainstem and cerebellum. Excluding participants with strokes in specific brain regions helps to focus on the impact of proprioception deficits on gait and balance parameters in stroke patients. What is your opinion on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. By excluding participants with strokes in the brainstem and cerebellum, we can isolate the effects of proprioception deficits on gait and balance in other brain regions. Now, let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion: epilepsy. Excluding participants with epilepsy helps to control for potential confounding factors that may affect proprioception, reaction time, and gait and balance parameters. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely! Excluding participants with epilepsy will help us control for potential confounding factors and isolate the effects of proprioception on gait and balance. Now, let's discuss the fifth exclusion criterion: disorders of higher mental functions. Excluding participants with cognitive impairments helps to ensure that participants can accurately complete assessments related to proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Precisely! By excluding participants with cognitive impairments, we can ensure that the study's assessments related to proprioception, reaction time, gait, and balance are completed accurately. Now, let's move on to the sixth exclusion criterion: coexisting neurological, rheumatological, orthopedic diseases. Excluding participants with other conditions helps to isolate the effects of stroke and proprioception deficits on gait and balance. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Researchers need to consider the feasibility of language barriers that may arise during the conduction of the study, as well as the accuracy of data collection. Including participants with different language preferences beyond English or Spanish might pose challenges for proper communication. Now that we have two exclusion criteria, should we base the wording in the criteria on common exclusion criteria standards?"

First, let's exclude participants with cognitive impairment or intellectual disabilities. Providing the intervention for participants with cognitive impairment or intellectual disabilities may be challenging given the complexity of the intervention. Furthermore, providing the intervention to these participants would present ethical concerns given the participants' inability to fully understand the study and give informed consent.

            "Moving on to the fourth inclusion criterion: \"Cervical os dilatation > 0\". The cervical os dilatation is the distance between the external os of the cervix and the plane of the internal os. Ideally, the cervix should be fully open for induction of labor. However, studies have suggested that the success rate for induction of labor increases when the cervical os is already dilated.

While it is important to reach people with cancer across language barriers, there are limitations to available resources. It may not be possible for us to provide the prehabilitation programme if it is not available in a language other than English. In this study, the prehabilitation programme is delivered in English only. For patients who are not fluent in English, an interpreter may be needed. Would you like to add or modify this criterion?",
            "Great. Now, for the final exclusion criterion, it is \"on oral chemotherapy.\" Previous research has shown that prehabilitation programmes may not be effective for patients on oral chemotherapy . Therefore, excluding participants on oral chemotherapy will ensure more accurate study results. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent, then let's move on to the fourth exclusion criterion. It is \"cognitive impairment from conditions such as dementia or cognitive decline.\" This criterion ensures that participants understand the study materials and follow instructions. Participants with cognitive impairments may be unable to provide informed consent or to follow the instructions provided in the prehabilitation programme. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Alright. Moving on to the fifth exclusion criterion, participants with \"cognitive impairment\" may have difficulty understanding and adhering to the prehabilitation programme. Is there anything you'd like to add or modify about this criterion?",

Participants who are medically unstable may not be able to safely participate in the prehabilitation programme. Do you have any suggestions or modifications for this criterion?",
            "I agree. Moving on to the second exclusion criterion, it is \"diagnosis of metastatic cancer.\" This criterion is important as the study aims to assess the feasibility and impact of the prehabilitation programme specifically for patients awaiting surgery for oesophago-gastric cancer. Including participants with metastatic cancer could introduce confounding variables. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now, let's discuss the third exclusion criterion.

            "Fantastic. The third inclusion criterion is \"American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical status I to III\". This criterion helps select patients who are likely to be able to tolerate the intervention and associated procedures. Including only patients who are in good physical health will ensure that any observed changes in the outcome measures can be attributed to the intervention and not to different baseline characteristics of the study population. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Good. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is \"Patients with history of chronic pain\". This exclusion criterion is necessary as it ensures that patients in the study population have not previously experienced chronic pain, which could mask the potential effects of the intervention. This will also help in reducing the variability in the patient population. Do you approve of this exclusion criterion?",
            "Great. Now moving on to the exclusion criteria, the first one is: \"Unstable hemodynamics\". This criterion is important as it ensures that participants included in the study have stable vital signs, which reduces variability in the study population and improves the validity of the results. Therefore, we can use this information to exclude participants with unstable hemodynamics. How do you feel about that?",
            "Fantastic. The next exclusion criterion is \"Neuraxial block required\". Excluding patients who require neuraxial block helps in isolating the effects of the intervention of interest (parasternal block) from other blocks used during surgery. Including patients who require neuraxial block could confound the results and make it difficult to draw conclusions specifically about the parasternal block. Do you agree with excluding patients who require neuraxial block?",
            "Well done. For the next exclusion criterion, it is \"Non-cardiac medical conditions\". Excluding patients with non-cardiac medical conditions is beneficial as it helps to reduce potential confounders and allows the researchers to focus on studying the effects of the intervention specifically related to heart disease and cardiac surgery. Including patients with non-cardiac medical conditions may lead to additional complications and could confound the results of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Now, the last exclusion criterion is \"Uncontrolled diabetes, infection at the site of injection, and coagulopathy\". Excluding patients with these conditions is important to prevent any complications that may result from the intervention. These patients may have varying susceptibility to infection and may also have reduced peripheral nerve sensations due to the associated neuropathy. Including these patients could confound the results of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The last exclusion criterion is \"Patients with a medical history of chronic pain syndrome\". Excluding patients with a medical history of chronic pain helps in ensuring that any differences in the outcomes are not influenced by existing pain conditions. This criterion also helps in assessing the generalizability of the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The last exclusion criterion is \"Pregnant or lactating women\". Excluding pregnant or lactating women is important as the intervention may involve the use of medications or procedures that could harm the fetus or infant. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Now, the last exclusion criterion is \"Presence of a pacemaker, ICD (implanted cardioverter defibrillator) or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator\". Excluding patients who have these devices is important as the intervention in this trial involves the use of electrocautery, which could potentially interfere with the electrical components of the pacemaker, ICD, or CRT-D. Including such patients could introduce safety risks and confound the results of the study. What do you think about this criterion?",

The first criterion is \"Patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery under median sternotomy\". This criterion is necessary as the study aims to examine the effect of the intervention specifically on patients undergoing cardiac surgery via sternotomy. Including only patients undergoing this specific type of surgery ensures that the results of the trial are applicable to the target population. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. The next inclusion criterion is \"Age greater than or equal to 18 years\". This criterion is important as it ensures that participants are adults who can provide informed consent and are likely to have similar physiological responses to the intervention. Including only adult patients also helps in reducing variability in the study population. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent. Moving on to the third inclusion criterion, it is \"American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Status I-IV\". This criterion is essential as it helps in ensuring that patients included in the study have a similar baseline health status and are suitable for undergoing the intervention. Patients with ASA Status I-IV are considered to have varying degrees of systemic disease or comorbidities, and including them in the study population helps in assessing the generalizability of the results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Perfect. Now, for the last inclusion criterion, it is \"Approval and sign of the informed consent\". Obtaining informed consent is a fundamental ethical requirement in clinical research. Including this criterion ensures that participants are aware of the study procedures, risks, and benefits, and have voluntarily agreed to participate. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first exclusion criterion is \"Allergy to local anesthetics\". Excluding patients with allergies to local anesthetics is important to prevent adverse reactions during the intervention. Including such patients could confound the results and pose a risk to their safety. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The next exclusion criterion is \"Puncture site infection\". Excluding patients with puncture site infections is necessary to prevent the spread of infection and ensure patient safety during the intervention. Infections can complicate the procedure and affect the outcomes of the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Moving on to the third exclusion criterion, it is \"Lack of signing of informed consent\". Excluding patients who have not signed informed consent is crucial to ensure that all participants are fully informed about the study and have willingly agreed to participate. Including patients without proper consent would violate ethical principles. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Great. The next exclusion criterion is \"Age less than 18 years\". Excluding patients below 18 years of age is important as the study is focused on adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Including pediatric patients could introduce confounding variables related to age-specific physiological responses. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Wonderful. Moving on to the fifth exclusion criterion, it is \"Emergency surgery\". Excluding patients undergoing emergency surgery is necessary as these cases may have different clinical characteristics and urgency compared to elective surgeries. Including emergency cases could introduce variability and confound the results of the study. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly. The next exclusion criterion is \"ASA greater than IV\". Excluding patients with ASA Status greater than IV is important as these patients may have severe systemic diseases or comorbidities that could affect the outcomes of the intervention. Including such patients could introduce confounding variables and impact the generalizability of the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

This will help us assess the breathing pattern during different levels of pressure support. We can confirm the patients' respiratory rate by reviewing their medical records. What do you think?",
            "Great! Now, for the fourth inclusion criterion, we need to limit the mechanical ventilation time to more than seven days but less than 14 days.

Since you described the study as evaluating conditions such as arthritis, back pain, and osteoporosis, it's important to note that drugs used to treat these conditions can be harmful to a developing fetus or infant. For instance, women who take NSAIDs (which are commonly used to treat arthritis and back pain) should avoid becoming pregnant due to the risk of miscarriage or of congenital malformations . Similarly, women who are exposed to osteoporosis medications during pregnancy may have an increased risk of congenital malformations . For this reason, we can exclude pregnant or breastfeeding patients. What do you think?",

We have two criteria to consider: \"Participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, are not in any other way eligible for a place in this clinical trial\" and \"Participants who have previously been treated with SQY51.\"",
            "Fantastic, I'm glad we have consensus on this criterion. Now, regarding \"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Becker Muscular Dystrophy diagnosed by an accredited medical professional through clinical evaluation and genetic testing.\" We were considering adding other diagnostic evaluations, such as histopathological, electrocardiograms, cardiac biomarkers, or MRI. What do you think?",
            "Got it! We can move on to the next criterion of inclusion for Phase 1, which is related to the patients' heart function. It states that patients must have been diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy with good cardiac function. Do you have any suggestions or concerns for this criterion?",
            "Great! Moving onto safety criteria, the first one is \"No other investigational drug within 30 days of enrollment,\" which essentially means participants cannot be taking other study drugs that haven't been tested. Do you have any suggestions or concerns about this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Ensuring stable hepatic and renal function can help avoid adverse effects and promote participant safety. Next, we have a criterion about not receiving immunosuppressant medication. This criterion is put in place to avoid the possible impact of immunosuppressants on the PK and PD (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) of SQY51. Any suggestions or modifications that need to be made?",
            "Great! It appears we have the same thought regarding LVEF. Now, let's move on to the next criterion, which is about the participants' ability to comprehend and complete study procedures. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Absolutely, following the standards of care guidelines will help ensure optimal patient outcomes. Now, the last criterion deals with concomitant medications other than those required for the treatment of DMD. Any suggestions or concerns here?",
            "Absolutely! Allowing for non-invasive ventilation for less than 16 hours per day accommodates patients with chronic progressive respiratory failure and helps increase participant recruitment. Now, on to the next criterion, which concerns the use of a ventilatory assisted device. Any suggestions or concerns regarding this criterion?",
            "Yes, you are correct. It's essential to adhere to these regulations to ensure the safety and integrity of the research. Now, moving on to the inclusion criteria for Phase 2a. The first criterion that applies to this phase is that all participants must have previously received an orally administered exon 51 skipping drug. Any suggestions or concerns regarding this criterion?",
            "Absolutely. Obtaining informed consent ensures that participants are aware of all potential consequences and risks associated with the trial. Now, we'll move on to Phase 2a. This phase has a similar criterion requiring informed consent form to be signed by the patient or legal guardian(s). Do you have any suggestions or concerns regarding this criterion?",

            "Excellent. Including both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients will indeed provide valuable insights. Let's proceed to the next criterion, which is about patient compliance. It states that patients must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Is there anything you'd like to add or modify here?",

Now, let's discuss the next criterion, which focuses on stable hepatic and renal function. This criterion helps minimize the risk of adverse effects from the drug. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree. Stable hepatic and renal function is a critical factor to consider for participant safety. Now, let's move on to the next criterion, which is the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) requirement. This criterion ensures that participants have adequate cardiac function to safely receive the drug. Any suggestions or concerns regarding this criterion?",
            "I agree with you. A minimum LVEF of \u226540% is necessary to minimize the risk of cardiac complications. Now, let's discuss the next criterion, which is about concomitant treatment within standards of care guidelines for DMD. Any suggestions or concerns here?",
            "That's a good approach. Following the standards of care guidelines for DMD ensures that participants receive appropriate concomitant treatment. Now, let's move on to the next criterion, which is about non-invasive mechanical ventilation. It states that non-invasive mechanical ventilation is permissive if used for less than 16 hours per day. Any thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I agree with your assessment. Allowing non-invasive mechanical ventilation for less than 16 hours per day strikes a balance between participant comfort and safety. Now, let's discuss the next criterion, which is about being affiliated with a French social security. Do you have any suggestions or concerns regarding this criterion?",
            "You're correct. This criterion is essential for complying with the specific regulations and logistics of the study location. Now, let's move on to the last criterion for Phase 1, which is obtaining the informed consent form signed by the patient or legal guardian(s). Any suggestions or concerns here?",
            "I completely agree with you. Obtaining informed consent is a fundamental requirement in any clinical trial. We have now completed the inclusion criteria for Phase 1. Shall we move on to discussing the inclusion criteria for Phase 2a?",
            "Great! Before we continue, I'll summarize the inclusion criteria for Phase 1 that we've discussed so far:\n1. Boys of \u22656 years of age and \u226514 kg body weight.\n2. Ambulatory or non-ambulatory status.\n3. Patients willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.\n4.

This criterion is essential to capture patients who will receive the treatment being studied, i.e., patients who have morbid obesity and will undergo Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy. Capturing these patients will help us evaluate if Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy directly impacts immune inflammation values, or if it impacts immune inflammation values when the patients are morbidly obese. Since we don't know if obesity itself skews the immune system, we also included the criterion \"and no known comorbidities\". That criterion helps us ensure that we know the state of the patients' immune system before they undergo any surgery and that the immune changes we might see are not attributed to the presence of comorbidities at the time of screening. It ensures that the immune changes we observe in the post-operative period can definitively be attributed to the surgery, e.g., Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.

Requiring participants to provide fresh or archival tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples will allow us to conduct important assessments related to pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. This will help us understand how the drug behaves in the body and its potential impact on the immune system. Moving on, what should be the performance status requirement for participants?",
            "Setting an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1 ensures that participants have a good performance status, indicating that they are able to carry out daily activities and are likely to tolerate the treatment well. Now, let's consider the expected life expectancy for participants. What should be the requirement in terms of life expectancy?",
            "Setting a minimum life expectancy of at least 12 weeks ensures that participants are expected to survive long enough to complete the study and potentially benefit from the intervention. Now, let's move on to contraceptive measures. What requirements should we set for male and female participants?",
            "That's an important consideration. Requiring both male and female participants to use adequate contraceptive measures throughout the study helps prevent potential harm to a fetus if a participant becomes pregnant during the study. It also ensures that female subjects are not already pregnant or incapable of becoming pregnant. Lastly, let's discuss the requirement for a signed and dated Informed Consent Form. Should participants be required to provide this?",
            "Requiring participants to sign and date an Informed Consent Form confirms that they have been fully informed about the study and have voluntarily agreed to participate. Now, let's move on to the exclusion criteria. What should be the first criterion for exclusion?",
            "That's a necessary exclusion criterion. Excluding participants who have had previous or current treatment with B7-H3 targeted therapy ensures that we focus on the efficacy and safety of HS-20093 as a monotherapy. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion. What should be the time frame for excluding participants who have received recent treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or anticancer drugs?",
            "Excluding participants who have received these treatments within 14 days prior to the first dose of HS-20093 helps prevent potential interactions between the study drug and other treatments that could affect the safety or efficacy outcomes. Now, let's continue with the exclusion criteria."

            "Now that we've established four inclusion criteria, let's discuss the exclusion criteria. It's essential to set exclusion criteria as a comparison group for the intervention or treatment being studied. For instance, we can exclude patients who have a history of coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention or those who have already been treated with a medical device for coronary artery disease. Additionally, considering that our study involves two treatments, we should exclude patients who are allergic to any component of the FFR or UFR.",
            "Absolutely, it will also allow us to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonic flow ratio, compare the results to FFR, and evaluate the impact of interventional treatments in patients with a broad range of coronary artery stenosis. Now, considering that FFR is the gold standard in clinical practice for detecting ischemic lesions, have you heard of previous studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of UFR?",

            "Great! Now, the last exclusion criterion I propose is to exclude patients with severe renal impairment as defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. This will help us avoid factors that may interfere with the study's findings, such as decreased renal excretion of contrast agents for IVUS testing. What are your thoughts?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Next, we should consider excluding patients with major cardiac, pulmonary, or rheumatic disease, as well as severe peripheral vascular disease that influences walking ability. These conditions could confound the results of the diagnostic tests and impact the study outcomes, so it's crucial to consider them. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Fantastic, let's continue. Moving on to the next exclusion criterion, we should exclude patients from participating in another interventional study within 12 months before providing informed consent. Enrolling these patients in other interventional studies could interfere with the proper assessment of the diagnostic tests being evaluated in the study, so excluding them will ensure the integrity of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Excellent reasoning. Finally, we should exclude patients who are diagnosed with coronary artery disease other than significant atherosclerosis, such as those with significant coronary artery spasm or infiltrative cardiac disease. This is to ensure that the study focuses on evaluating significant atherosclerotic lesions. What are your thoughts on this last exclusion criterion?",
            "Thank you. Next, let's discuss the final exclusion criterion. Patients with valvular heart diseases, such as native valve dysfunction, prosthetic/bioprosthetic valve diseases, or moderate or severe valve regurgitation should be excluded. Valvular heart diseases could confound the results of the diagnostic tests and interfere with the study's accuracy, so excluding these patients will help minimize potential bias. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

Adult patients aged 18 years or older3. A confirmed diagnosis of coronary artery disease4. A history of unstable angina pectoris, stable angina pectoris, or acute myocardial infarction5. Intermediate coronary lesion"

This is essential to ensure that they fully understand the study procedures, risks, and benefits, and voluntarily agree to participate. What are your thoughts on including this criterion?",
            "I fully agree with you. Now, let's move on to the next criterion. Considering the study's focus on assessing coronary artery lesions, it would be appropriate to include patients with intermediate coronary lesions, specifically those with diameter stenosis between 30% and 80% as visually estimated from coronary angiography. This will allow for a diverse and clinically relevant study population. What do you think?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. The first criterion we can consider is excluding patients who are ineligible for diagnostic intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or fractional flow reserve (FFR) examination. These diagnostic tests are essential for the study, so we need to ensure that participants can undergo them. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Exactly. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. Patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting of the interrogated vessels should be excluded. Previous bypass surgery could affect the accuracy of the diagnostic tests being evaluated in the study, so excluding these patients helps ensure the reliability of the results. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I completely agree with you. Moving on to the next criterion, we should exclude patients who have had a myocardial infarction within 72 hours of coronary angiography. Recent myocardial infarction could confound the results of the diagnostic tests, so excluding these patients helps minimize potential bias. What are your thoughts on this exclusion criterion?",
            "Well said. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. Patients with severe heart failure should be excluded. Severe heart failure can cause hemodynamic instability, which could affect the accuracy of the diagnostic tests. Excluding these patients will help ensure the safety and validity of the study. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree with you. Now, let's move on to the next exclusion criterion. Patients with serum creatinine levels greater than 150 umol/L or glomerular filtration rates less than 45 ml/kg/1.73 m2 should be excluded. Impaired renal function could impact the use of contrast agents and adenosine during the diagnostic tests, so excluding patients with renal dysfunction helps minimize potential risks. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Well said. Now, let's discuss the next exclusion criterion. Patients with known allergies to the contrast agent or adenosine should be excluded. Allergic reactions to these agents could pose a safety risk during the diagnostic tests, so it's best to prevent such adverse events by excluding patients with known allergies. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I fully agree with you. We're almost done with the criteria design. The next criterion we should consider is excluding patients with a life expectancy of less than 2 years. Patients with limited life expectancy may not benefit from the study procedures, so it's best to focus our resources on participants who are more likely to benefit. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "I'm glad you agree. Lastly, let's discuss the final exclusion criteria. Patients with an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) pullback that does not cover the entire lesion should be excluded. Complete imaging of the target lesion is necessary for accurate assessment, so excluding patients with incomplete IVUS coverage helps ensure the quality of the data. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "I completely agree with you. We have now completed the design of all the criteria for your clinical trial. Here is a summary of the full criteria:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, or after the acute phase of myocardial infarction\n2. Age \u226518 years\n3. Written informed consent\n4. Intermediate coronary lesions (diameter stenosis of 30%-80% by visual estimation from coronary angiography)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Ineligible for diagnostic IVUS or FFR examination\n2. Prior coronary artery bypass grafting of the interrogated vessels\n3. Myocardial infarction within 72 h of coronary angiography\n4. Severe heart failure\n5.

Can you double check to see what treatment options are available in the clinic for patients with Rheumatoid arthritis and whether RA patients are given any standardized instructions during their visit? This way, we can make sure that all the patients are getting the same treatment and the results are not impacted by any external factors.",

Based on the title and conditions, one inclusion criterion could be \"Patients seen in the Rush University Medical Center Rheumatology Clinic.\" This is necessary to ensure consistency in the type of care provided and the format of after visit instructions given. What do you think?",

One exclusion criterion could be \"Tele-medicine visits.\" This is important because we want to analyze the impact of standardized after visit instructions and teach-back method in an in-person setting. Including tele-medicine visits could introduce variables related to the mode of communication that may confound the results. What do you think?",
            "Excellent. Lastly, we should consider excluding patients whose primary language is not English. This is because the study involves standardized after visit instructions, which may not be available in all languages. Including patients with different primary languages could lead to inconsistencies in the quality and content of the instructions provided, potentially affecting the study outcomes. Additionally, the inability of all providers to provide custom after visit instructions due to language limitations could introduce bias in the results. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",

This criterion is included to ensure that the TricValve\u00ae Transcatheter Bicaval Valve System can be successfully implanted. We need to have the necessary anatomical structures for implantation in order to properly assess the safety and efficacy of the device. Do you agree with this criterion?",
            "Great. Here's the next criterion: Subjects must have New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or NYHA Class IV with a 6-minute walk test distance <380 feet. This criterion is important because only patients with more advanced stages of heart failure as determined by NYHA classification status and 6-minute walk test results are eligible to participate. It should be noted that NYHA class IV status typically indicates advanced heart failure and shows increased limitations on daily life and frequent symptoms even at rest. Conversely, NYHA Class III patients demonstrate well-controlled heart failure. Therefore, by limiting inclusion to NYHA classes III and IV, we can ensure that only subjects with worsening heart failure are included in the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Glad to hear that you think the same. The next criterion is that the subject has adequate vascular access. This is related to the procedures and intervention part. TricValve implant requires access vessels suitable for delivering the device. This criterion ensures that participants have the necessary vascular access to undergo implantation of TricValve. What do you think about this criterion?",

The next exclusion criterion is severe mitral stenosis or functional mitral valve regurgitation (MR) with an average pressure gradient of \u226520 mmHg associated with concomitant LV systolic dysfunction. Severe mitral stenosis or functional MR can result in elevated left ventricular pressures, which can alter right ventricular remodeling and tricuspid valve function. We exclude patients with these conditions to further ensure that right ventricular dysfunction is primarily due to TR and not concomitant mitral disease. Do you have any questions or concerns about this criterion?",

This criterion ensures that participants are able to take the medications necessary for the intervention and their antiplatelet therapy to facilitate their recovery. How about this criterion?",
            "Great. Finally, we exclude patients who have previously undergone a tricuspid valve procedure, such as transcatheter valve repair or replacement. This criterion helps to isolate the effects of the TricValve\u00ae System on outcomes without confounding variables related to previous tricuspid valve procedures. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The next criterion is a patient- or physician-level contraindication to anticoagulation.

This inclusion is limited to subjects with severe symptomatic TR who are not candidates for approved transcatheter tricuspid valve devices. This helps to assess the effectiveness of the TricValve\u00ae System in a specific subset of patients. What do you think about this criterion?",
            "Exactly. Moving on, the next criterion is NYHA Class 3-4 (not on inotropes) OR HF admission in the past 6 months.

This criterion is necessary to prevent complications related to pre-existing thrombi or masses that could be dislodged during the intervention. Do you have any concerns or questions about this criterion?",

            "Exactly. The next criterion is recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within 3 months. Excluding patients with recent CVAs helps to minimize the risk of complications related to stroke during the trial. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Perfect. The next criterion is the need for left-sided or pulmonary valve treatment within 60 days of screening. Excluding patients who require treatment for left-sided or pulmonary valve disease helps to isolate the effects of the TricValve\u00ae System on tricuspid regurgitation specifically. Any concerns or questions about this criterion?",

ECV is most effective early in gestation and in women who have an advanced degree of dilation and effacement of the cervix. This threshold of gestation avoids the increased morbidity associated with early term and late preterm deliveries. Should we add this as the third criterion?",

Do you agree?",
            "Fantastic. The second exclusion criterion is that participants should not have had a history of neonatal brain injury. This may be important as previous neonatal complications may indicate an increased risk of further complications in the current pregnancy. What are your thoughts on this criterion?",
            "Fantastic. Third exclusion criterion, participants should not have a previous history of a uterine or retroplacental hematoma. Participants with a history of uterine hematoma are more likely to have a bleeding complication during the external cephalic version procedure. Furthermore, a retroplacental hematoma can result in fetal or maternal complications. Therefore, it's important to exclude women with this condition from the study. Agreed?",

External beam radiotherapy may not be the most efficient type of radiation therapy for lung cancer patients. SABR treatment can significantly reduce radiotherapy time, but it also comes with potential trade-offs such as side effects. By using an adequate patient selection for SABR, we can more confidently suggest that SABR is an appropriate treatment without the need for further adjustments. What's the fifth criterion?",

            "That's a good one. Excluding patients who have undergone intraocular surgery within three months before screening ensures consistency in the patient population before the start of the study. Lastly, what other exclusion criteria do you want to include before the patient's ocular conditions?",
            "Good point. Although pegcetacoplan is an oral drug, evaluating the safety of IVT injections could help to detect potential adverse events of pegcetacoplan. In addition, any pre-existing ocular or systemic condition that poses a risk to the patient or influences the evaluation of the study medication should be included as exclusion criteria.",

This criterion ensures that the study focuses specifically on patients with geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration, providing a clear and consistent patient population for evaluation. Now, let's discuss the criteria for GA lesions. How should we define the GA lesion characteristics?",
            "Those are great criteria. Nonsubfoveal lesions and the visualization of the GA lesion in its entirety ensure consistency in evaluation. Including the presence of hyperautofluorescence helps in identifying specific characteristics of the GA lesion. Lastly, we need to consider the clarity of ocular media and pupillary dilation.

The first exclusion criterion is that the patient should not be receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Using Thymoglobulin as the sole immunosuppressive therapy ensures that any observed variation in its pharmacokinetics are attributed to the concomitant use of immunosuppressive therapies. What are your thoughts on this?",

I've chosen this range since I don't think that a dose of less than 17 mg will have a significant effect. Additionally, doses above 200 mg were observed to have significant side effects in our previous research. What are your thoughts?",

Since remimazolam is metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine, patients with liver or kidney issues may metabolize or excrete the drug differently. This could affect the concentrations of remimazolam in their system and therefore affect the results. What are your thoughts on this?",

One important criterion could be excluding participants with a personal or first-degree family history of clinically significant psychiatric disorders. This is to ensure that we exclude individuals who may have underlying psychiatric conditions that could impact their ability to accurately report symptoms or adhere to the study protocol. Psychiatric disorders can also affect the metabolism of drugs, leading to variability in drug levels.

However, a typical age range for participants in studies of depression and anxiety management interventions is usually 18 to 65 years old. This age range reflects the average onset of MS where the disease is less likely to manifest in children or the elderly (i.e. over the age of 65 years old), so the typical age of onset could serve as an indicator of the age range for participants. Although children or adolescents with rare forms of MS, such as early acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or optic neuritis before the age of 18 years old, may have some degree of physical disability; depression and anxiety are more likely to be expressed from the early adulthood (22\u201324 years old). The disease course is also an essential factor when considering the timing of treatment initiation, where a large number of people with RRMS start to receive disease-modifying therapy (DMT) within the first two years of diagnosis (25). Similarly, the age and disease duration will affect the patient's experience and their ability to participate in clinical trials.

Commonly used measures include the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. A score of 10 or higher on these measures would indicate that significant depression or anxiety is present.

            "That makes sense as the eGFR value indicates the kidney function and its decline over time as we age. Our research aims to explore how participants with both normal and impaired renal function respond to the medication. Now, let's consider the liver disease severity as another criterion.",
            "Got it! With these eGFR ranges, we can separate participants into the following five categories: normal renal function (eGFR \u2265 90 mL/min), mild renal impairment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min), moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 mL/min), and End-Stage Renal Disease (eGFR < 15 mL/min or requiring dialysis treatment) (Renal group 5).",
            "Great! We can set the last inclusion criterion as participants on hemodialysis and/or peritoneal dialysis (KDIGO Stages 5) but not on kidney transplant. By including participants on dialysis treatment, we can assess the impact of continuous and sustained blood purification on the medication's pharmacokinetics. This information will be beneficial for assessing the efficacy of the medication for participants with ESRD.",
            "Perfect. To start, what should be our exclusion criterion for age? Will we be including children under 18?",
            "Yes, that's what I was thinking. Some medical conditions might render participants unable to provide informed consent or comply with the protocol. However, excluding only conditions associated with renal impairment will allow us to assess the medication's safety and efficacy in individuals with reduced kidney function. Next, for participants with renal impairment, how should we exclude them?",
            "Great! By including this criterion, we can prevent any confounding factors caused by other medications that might affect safety. Now, let's continue with excluding specific drugs. What antidiabetic drugs should we exclude?",
            "That's a great point! Excluding participants who have been using drugs that affect creatinine clearance before randomization will eliminate confounding factors, leading to more accurate results. Now, about the fourth exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants with any other medical conditions that might interfere with the study's purpose?",
            "Thank you! Excluding participants with significant medical conditions unrelated to renal impairment ensures that the observed effects are due to reduced kidney function. I think we have all the exclusion criteria covered now. How about our screening criteria? What criteria should a potential participant fulfill before entry-screening and the randomization process?",
            "Certainly! Here's a summary of the inclusion and exclusion criteria we discussed based on your feedback:",
            "You're very welcome! I was happy to help. If you have any other queries or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask. Good luck with your clinical trial!"

            "Excellent! By including participants with a BMI between 18.5 and 39.9 kg/m2, we can accurately assess the effects of the medication on individuals with different body compositions. Now, let's proceed to the next criterion. How should we categorize participants based on their renal function?",
            "That's a good approach. To categorize participants, we can use the pre-defined eGFR values based on the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. According to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) standards, what should be the range of eGFR values for each renal function group?",
            "Perfect! Categorizing participants based on these eGFR ranges will allow us to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of the medication across different levels of renal function. This information is vital for understanding the impact of reduced kidney function on the drug's metabolism and clearance. Now, let's move on to the last inclusion criterion. Should we include participants requiring dialysis treatment?",
            "Including participants on haemodialysis will ensure that individuals with severe renal impairment are represented in the study. This comprehensive evaluation of the medication's effects in this population is crucial. Great job! Now let's move on to the exclusion criteria. Are you ready?",
            "Perfect! The first exclusion criterion is any disorder that might jeopardize participant's safety or compliance with the protocol. Do you have any specific disorders in mind that we should consider excluding?",
            "Excellent point! By excluding disorders unrelated to renal impairment, we can prioritize participant safety and ensure compliance with the study protocol. Now, let's proceed to the next exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants who have used certain medications within 14 days before screening?",
            "Absolutely! Excluding participants who have used medications that may interfere with the study results will help ensure that the observed effects are due to the study medication and not influenced by other drugs. Now, let's move on to the third exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants who have used drugs known to affect creatinine clearance?",
            "Correct! Excluding participants who have used medications known to impact creatinine clearance will enable us to accurately assess the effects of the study medication on kidney function without any confounding factors. Lastly, let's discuss the final exclusion criterion. Should we exclude participants with clinically relevant conditions unrelated to renal impairment?",
            "Right on! By excluding participants with significant medical conditions unrelated to renal impairment, we can ensure that the study results are not influenced by other health factors, allowing for a clear evaluation of the medication's effects specifically on kidney function.",
            "Certainly! Here are the full criteria we've designed:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n1. Age: 18-80 years.\n2. BMI: 18.5-39.9 kg/m2.\n3. Categorized based on eGFR values:\n   - Normal renal function: greater than or equal to 90 mL/min.\n   - Mild renal impairment: 60-89 mL/min.\n   - Moderate renal impairment: 30-59 mL/min.\n   - Severe renal impairment (not requiring dialysis): 15-29 mL/min.\n   - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) or requiring dialysis treatment (Renal group 5): less than 15 mL/min.\n4. Participants requiring dialysis treatment should be on haemodialysis.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n1. Any disorder, except for conditions associated with renal impairment, which might jeopardize participant's safety or compliance with the protocol.\n2. Use of certain medications within 14 days before screening, unless routine vitamins, occasional use of paracetamol, ibuprofen, and topical medication not reaching systemic circulation.\n3. Use of drugs known to affect creatinine clearance within 14 days or 5 half-lives before planned dosing of the investigational medicinal product (IMP).\n4. Presence or history of clinically relevant respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, or endocrinological conditions, except conditions associated with renal impairment or ESRD.",
