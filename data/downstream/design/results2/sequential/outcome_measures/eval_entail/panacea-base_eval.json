These outcome measures should assess the effectiveness of betamethasone treatment on respiratory distress and chronic lung disease, respectively. Can you propose measure descriptions for these outcome measures? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study involves a prospective, single-center, interventional clinical trial aiming to determine the efficacy and safety of adding metoclopromide to the treatment of primary cerebral hemorrhage (PCH) in children. A total of 42 patients will participate in the study, with 21 receiving metoclopromide treatment, while 21 will receive standard treatment. The study will be conducted at the Qingdao Children's Hospital and the Provincial Women and Children's Hospital in Shandong Province, China, and last for about 24 months.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPrimary cerebral hemorrhage (PCH) is a common cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. At the same time, PCH is closely related to intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), leading to further damage to the child's cerebral tissue, eventually leading to the child's sequelae. Metoclopromide, a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, is widely used in the field of gastrointestinal tract movement and can also exert neuroprotective effects. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of metoclopromide in the treatment of PCH in children. A total of 42 children with PCH will be included in the study and randomized into the metoclopromide treatment group and the control group. Children in the metoclopromide treatment group will be given 0.1 mg/kg metoclopramide three times daily for 7 days, while children in the control group will receive standard treatment. The primary outcome is the neurological outcome assessment (NOAA) score at 1 year after treatment. Secondary outcomes include the modified Barthel index score and head circumference at 3 and 6 months after treatment, cerebro",
            "The first outcome measure will be the number of children with favorable evolution of the cystic adenomatoid malformation (CAP). This will include the percentage of children who experience a closure of the CAP or a CAP that becomes hemodynamically insignificant under the effect of treatment with betamethasone. The second outcome measure will be the number of children with DA closure under the effect of treatment with betamethasone. This will give us additional data on the direct impact of betamethasone on the closure of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. Both outcome measures will be measured at the time of study completion, which is an average of 6 months. Is this outcome measure design complete and appropriate?"

Were there any adverse effects associated with the fumigation process? 4. Would you participate in a similar study in the future? The assessment of adverse effects should be conducted on a participant-by-participant basis using a standardized questionnaire or checklist that captures any adverse events, reactions or symptoms.

            "Excellent. Once again, I thank you for your valuable inputs. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground and Aims: Aspirin remains the most prescribed drug in the western world. However, there are a number of patient populations that have contraindications to aspirin, including gastric ulceration, renal insufficiency (RI), coagulopathies, asthma and peptic ulceration. The aim of this study was to assess NSAID utilization for analgesia in patients presenting with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to our emergency department (ED). Method: A prospective randomized control study was undertaken over a 3 years period in patients who were older than 40 years of age with an acute COPD exacerbation. Patients were randomized to one of the study arms: Aspirin 325 mg or Naproxen 500 mg. Outcomes were assessed at 1 week in all participants and follow up continued every 3 months until rehospitalization or death. Results: A total of 100 patients were included in the study. At 1 week, 2 patients in the aspirin group (10%) and 0 patients in the naproxen group had been rehospitalized. There was no statistically significant difference in the rehospitalization rate between groups. A total of 5 patients in the naproxen group (16.6%) had an increase in post\u2010treatment creatinine compared to baseline compared to 0 patients in the aspirin group (P = 0.034). Conclusion: Utilizing naproxen in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD may have increased rates of renal impairment compared to aspirin. We observed a trend toward improved rehospitalization rates in patients treated with aspirin. Further studies are required to validate these findings."

This study aimed to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ginger juice extract. Ginger juice was prepared and extracted in five different solvents (ethanol, methanol, water, n\u2010hexane, and chloroform). The extracts were tested using antibacterial, antibiofilm, and anti\u2010inflammatory assays. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of the ethanol extract was determined to be 6 mg/mL. The antibacterial activity of the ethanol extract was observed against microorganisms from the oral cavity. The antimicrobial activity of the extract showed no effect on the growth and biofilm formation of 4 microorganisms, including Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Candida parapsilosis. In the inflammatory assay, the ginger juice extract inhibited the migration of peritoneal macrophage and reduced the release of interleukin (IL)\u20106 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03b1 in lipopolysaccharide\u2010stimulated macrophages, while reducing the migration of LPS\u2010stimulated neutrophils and its supernatant.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat these conditions. However, their use is associated with adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. The investigators aimed to test the efficacy and safety of naproxen coated with polyethylene glycol (PEGylated-Nap) in preventing GI damage induced by high-dose non-selective NSAIDs. In this study, the investigators assessed the efficacy of PEGylated-nap 750 mg twice daily compared to high-dose naproxen 500 mg twice daily in preventing GI damage after four weeks of treatment due to high-dose naproxen.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nIn the last decade, gastritis and enteritis have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used medications that are used to treat inflammatory diseases, pain, and fever. NSAIDs are known to cause gastrointestinal damage, and it is believed that the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is effective in preventing this damage. The investigators aim to test the efficacy and safety of NSAIDs coated with polyethylene glycol (PEGylated-Nap) in preventing GI damage induced by high-dose NSAIDs. The investigators designed a randomized controlled trial to compare a PEGylated-nap (750 mg twice daily) with high-dose naproxen (500 mg twice daily) for four weeks. The investigators will evaluate the effects of both drugs on GI damage by measuring inflammatory markers and endoscopic evaluation",

The proposed research is divided into 2 parts to assess for possible safety concerns and to demonstrate efficacy of astragalus and ginkgo extract combination decoction in patients with chronic rhinitis with and without chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps (CRSsNP). Previous studies have shown a promising antihistamine, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergy effect of the decoction of Astragalus and Ginkgo extracts in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp. A previous study showed that this combination decoction treatment significantly reduced the total nasal symptom score, nasal polyp score, and the serum inflammatory cytokines levels of IL-5 and TGF-\u03b21. To the best of our knowledge, evidence from randomized controlled trials on the safety and efficacy of this decoction was currently not available. In addition, while other clinical studies provided evidence of symptom remission, no previous research had established a cure from decoction use. Thus, this study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment and to investigate remission rates and recurrence rates after decoction treatment. A 5-months course of action, as determined by the total sinonasal symptom score and the complete resolution of the nasal polyp score, is chosen based on a previous report showing symptomatic outcomes after 2 weeks of treatment in Chinese population. A 5-months treatment course is also chosen because it is likely that patients experience a recurrence within 10 months after the initial treatment.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Prospective, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase II Clinical Trial of Two Different Treatment Duration of Combination Dac",

Polysomnography is a comprehensive sleep study that involves the continuous recording of various physiological parameters during sleep, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electromyogram (EMG). This can provide detailed information about sleep stages, wake episodes, and respiratory disturbances. Actigraphy is a non-invasive wearable sensor that records sleep-activity patterns. It can provide information about the quantity and quality of sleep by measuring movement during sleep and wakefulness.",

            "Pain intensity is a critical outcome measure to determine the efficacy of the intervention. We can use the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to assess pain intensity. The NRS is a simple, self-reported scale that ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst pain imaginable. The NRS is a widely used and well-validated measure of pain intensity in both research and clinical settings. We can assess pain intensity on the night before surgery, the night of surgery, and the first night after surgery, as well as at other intervals during the perioperative period. It's essential to evaluate pain intensity in these time points, as pain can significantly impact sleep quality. \n\nWhat about any safety concerns? What types of adverse events or side effects are we expecting to occur?\n-----------------\nThe treatment is likely to have minimal side effects due to the local nature of nerve blockades. A small percentage of patients may experience pain or swelling at the anesthetic injection site, although these events are rare. Serious adverse effects such as infections or nerve damage are unlikely due to the careful placement of the nerve block catheter by experienced anesthesia providers.\n\nHow will these adverse events be monitored, and what actions will be taken if they occur?\n-----------------\nThe study team will closely monitor the patients for any adverse events, including pain, swelling, or infection at the injection site, and any signs of nerve damage, such as altered sensation or muscle weakness. If any adverse events occur, appropriate medical attention will be provided as necessary.\n\nWhat actions will be taken if any adverse events occur?\n-----------------\n- If a patient experiences any adverse event related to the treatment, the study team will provide appropriate medical attention and support.\n- If a serious adverse event occurs, the study team will report it to the institutional review board and regulatory authorities.\n\nStudy design\n=================\nVaccine strategy type\n=================\nSingle arm\n\nPrimary study design\n=================\nInterventional\n\nSecondary study design\n=================\nSingle arm\n\nStudy setting(s)\n=================\nHospital\n\nStudy type\n=================\nTreatment\n\nCondition\n=================\nPerioperative anxiety before knee arthroplasty\n\nIntervention\n=================\nSingle",

We plan to enroll a minimum of 100 patients over a period of 1 year. Patients must meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be eligible for the study.\n\nStudy interventions\n=================\nThe intervention in the study is the use of the Revision LR femoral stem for hip replacement surgery. Patients enrolled in the study will receive the same standard of care as provided to all patients in the hospital, including preoperative evaluation, surgical procedure, and postoperative care.\n\nMain study parameters / endpoints\n=================\nThe primary outcome measure is the revision rate of the femoral component, which will be evaluated from baseline to a follow-up period of 10 years. The revision rate will be calculated as the number of patients who require revision surgery for any reason during the study period divided by the total number of patients enrolled. The incidence of device-related adverse events or serious adverse events will also be monitored throughout the study period to evaluate the safety profile of the Revision LR femoral stem.\n\nWe will also evaluate implant stability using X-rays at the baseline visit and the 1-year follow-up visit. The Harris Hip Score will be used to assess patient mobility and functionality at the 3-month and 1-year follow-up visits. \nData collection and management\n=================\nData collection will be performed by the study investigators using a standardized case report form (CRF). The CRF will be used to collect information on patient characteristics, medical history, surgical procedure, postoperative complications, and functional outcomes. The data will be entered into an electronic database and analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n\nEthics and dissemination\n=================\nThe study protocol has been approved by the"

OM is also a complication of treatment with oral chemotherapy and radiotherapy in a range of solid tumours. Despite the use of multiple preventive strategies, the prevalence of moderate to severe OM varies between 15\u201385%. Clinical prevention strategies have included administration of oral care products, topical or systemic analgesics and agents that inhibit acute inflammation. Intraluminal administration of analgesics/anti\u2010inflammatory drugs via an irrigating solution results in a direct route between the drug and the mucosa, potentially enhancing absorption. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is an established antiseptic in many wound care products including those used for oral care and infection control purposes. Antimicrobial mouth rinses based on CHG, while primarily targeting the inhibition of dental plaque, have also been shown to have an anti\u2010inflammatory effect. Recently, CHG gel formulations have been used for local delivery in oral surgical and radiotherapy procedures to significantly reduce the incidence of OM. The study aims to determine whether topical administration of CHG during the oral phase of HSCT reduces the incidence and severity of OM compared with a placebo. This is an international, Phase 3, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, randomised trial of 300 transplant centres enrolling 500 adult HSCT patients. A further 100 patients with head and neck cancer will be enrolled in a proof\u2010of\u2010concept, parallel\u2010group, double\u2010blind, crossover study.

It has been shown to improve prognosis relative to D1- and D1+. It is expected that E-D2-LN will also improve patient survival outcomes by lowering recurrence rates and increasing survival benefits. This is especially important for node-positive patients after gastric cancer total gastrectomy. The post-operative complications for long-term gastrectomy include, among other things, cardiac complications. In cardiac complications, cardiac arrhythmia (CA) is one of the commonly observed arrhythmic disorders, which is mainly defined as the occurrence of an abnormal heart rate and/or rhythm, while cardiac conduction disturbance (CDD) is defined as a slowing of the normal conduction system due to abnormal tissue conditions in the heart. CP therapy is the first line of therapy for CA treatment after gastrectomy. The most effective and minimally invasive treatment for CDD is RT without the need for medication, and most importantly, no recurrences have occurred in treated patients.

Background = A previous study found that patients with knee OA had poor sleep quality, which affected their functional state, quality of life, pain and disease progression. The main purpose of this study is the study of the effects of two physiotherapeutic intervention programs on sleep quality. Methods = The study included two sample groups with 12 patients. Participants were recruited from a physiotherapy centre in Istanbul, Turkey through convenience sampling. The participants had bilateral unilateral primary knee osteoarthritis between 18\u201065 for more than three months. It was a randomized control trial with an allocation of 4:4. The two treatment groups were determined by choosing the odd and even numbers. The treatment protocol consisted of three sessions a week for eight weeks. The evaluation of sleep quality was conducted with the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The functional status was measured by the WOMAC OA questionnaire, and the quality of life was measured by Euroqol EQ\u20105D\u20105\u00a0L instrument. The level of pain was evaluated with VAS. Evaluation was made by observing changes in VAS, PSQI, EQ\u20105D\u20105\u00a0L and WOMAC\u2010OA questionnaires before treatment application and after eight weeks. Results = At the end of the study, the intervention group improved its quality of life and pain and reduced fatigue. The PSQI sleep quality index score showed a decrease in the intervention. In addition, the participants' function, pain and fatigue were also measured with the WOMAC\u2010OA questionnaire, with the total score of the questionnaire decreasing in the intervention group.

When do you think would be an appropriate time to assess this measure? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The present study investigated the effect of a physical activity and exercise intervention, combined with a healthier lifestyle diet, in an occupational community for older adults. It also assessed the health cost\u2010effectiveness, the impact on the mental health of older adults, and their level of satisfaction with the program. Methods: A prospective cluster\u2010randomized longitudinal design was used. A total of 290 participants (275 intervention group and 15 control group) in four different communities were included. The participants of the intervention group carried out a moderateintensity physical activity and exercise program, combined with a healthier lifestyle and dietary intervention, which also included three virtual sessions held by a general practitioner. The control group maintained its usual lifestyle habits. Interviews were conducted before and after the interventions with a sample of 296 participants. The results were analyzed for participants who completed the full intervention. The main outcome measures were the number of consultations in primary healthcare and absenteeism due to sickness. Results: There was a significant difference in the health cost\u2010effectiveness of both groups between those who adhered to the program and those who did not. The number of consultations in the intervention group was the lowest (42.8%) among participants who adhered to the program, followed by that of the control group, with 56.3%. Among those who did not adhere to the program, the numbers of consultations were 58.8% and 60.0%, respectively. The difference between intervention group and control group for number of consultations was statistically significant (p = 0.01). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the total number of consultations (p = 0.28) or the cost of consultations (p = 0.58). Conclusions: The physical activity and exercise intervention, in addition to dietary habits, had a beneficial effect and was efficient in terms of costin a primary healthcare setting. The intervention group had more positive perceived psychophysical status after the intervention and the number of consultations and the cost of visits to the health center were significantly lower compared to the control group.",

BACKGROUND: The best dose of lidocaine on local anesthesia for spinal anesthesia remains controversial.METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial, and the study participants were randomized into three groups, including control, low\u2010dose and high\u2010dose groups. The control group (normal saline) and the two dose groups were given 1\u00a0ml lidocaine 1%. The main outcome included pain score after 30\u00a0min and 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 hours, the time of the first rescue analgesia, the amount of epidural analgesia and VAS score of satisfaction to analgesia and spinal block.RESULTS: The average first rescue analgesia time of the high\u2010dose group was longer than that of the other two groups. The low dose group had fewer patients requiring additional analgesia. The average VAS satisfaction score of the low\u2010dose group was higher than that of control and high\u2010dose groups.CONCLUSION: Low\u2010dose spinal anesthesia can significantly improve the analgesic effect of cesarean section and reduce postoperative analgesic consumption.",

Design: In this study, 35 patients undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between October 2019 and January 2021 were randomized into three groups: the routine education group, pain neuroscience education group, and multimodal pain management group. The pain neuroscience education group underwent four sessions of pain neuroscience education prior to surgery, while the multimodal pain management group received a combination of pain neuroscience education and multimodal pain management, which included non\u2010opioid analgesics, physical therapy, and patient education after surgery. We assessed the success rate of the total knee arthroplasty, operation time, recurrence rate of non\u2010union, postoperative pain, and other indicators. Results: At the end of the study, the success rate of the pain neuroscience education group (87.5%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (50%, p< 0.05); the operation time in the pain neuroscience education group (76 \u00b1 16 min) was significantly shorter than that in the control group (180 \u00b1 42 min, p< 0.05), and the recurrence rate of nonunion in the pain neuroscience education group was significantly lower than that in the control group (3.1% vs. 14.3%, p< 0.05). The visual analogue scale score and the consumption of analgesics in the pain neuroscience education group were lower than those in the control group one day after operation, and the difference was statistically significant (p< 0.05). Conclusion: Bone marrow concentrate combined with autogenous bone grafting can significantly promote the healing of nonunion of maxillary premolars, reduce postoperative pain, and reduce the recurrence rate of nonunion.

Many clinical and regulatory guidelines have recommended the implementation of SET as a practice standard for IVF. Despite the benefits, the psychological and emotional challenges that may arise with the reduction of embryos to transfer or to freeze (EF) are not well\u2010described in the literature. The aim of this study was to compare the emotional response to SET and EF using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS \u201021) among patients who underwent assisted reproduction treatment. Materials and methods: This study was conducted in two phases: a cross\u2010sectional study and a prospective study. In phase 1, a sample of 214 women who had undergone IVF with SET and no EF, 84 patients who had undergone ICSI or IVF with fresh EF without transfer, and 123 patients who had undergone fresh ET with EF were included and assessed using the EPDS and DASS\u201021 questionnaires. The comparison of the scores obtained by the three groups was performed using one\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In phase 2, an observational study was conducted with 237 patients who had participated in phase 1 and chose to undergo another IVF cycle. The patients were randomly assigned to a SET group or an EF \u2010 transfer group. Those who chose to do EF without transfer were considered dropouts and were excluded. The patients were assessed again during the second IVF cycle using the EPDS and DASS\u201021 questionnaires. The comparison of the scores obtained by the groups was performed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Results: The data obtained in phases 1 and 2 were analyzed using the same methodologies. In",
            "Yes, that is correct. The outcome measures are designed to provide comprehensive and objective assessments of child development in various domains, while also capturing the parent's perception of their child's development. By evaluating the outcomes at multiple time points, we can gain valuable insights into the long-term effects of IVF on child development. \n\nBreast cancer (BC) remains the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women globally. The lifetime risk of developing BC is 1 in 23 for invasive BC and 1 in 24 for BC in situ. Most BC are classified as estrogen receptor\u2013positive (ER+), and 5 to 40% of patients treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy have endocrine-resistant BC with recurrence. Endocrine-resistant BC is defined as disease progression following 6 months of standard endocrine therapy (ET) for adjuvant treatment.1 Lumino-depleted ER (depleted-ER), or ER status negativity, and degradation of ER-alpha and -beta proteins are key mechanisms of endocrine resistance.2 Several studies report that PIK3CA mutations alone or in combination with other mutations are present in 17% to 50% of ER+ BC, with a frequency of 53.0% in highly endocrine-resistant BC.3 The degradation of ER-alpha by PIK3CA is a potent mechanism of endocrine resistance.1 Therefore, overexpression of PIK3CA is highly correlated with endocrine resistance, and is an independent negative prognosis factor for BC, suggesting that PIK3CA inhibitors may exert better effects than other drugs in treating advanced BC when it is combined with anti-estrogen therapy.4 Therefore, PIK3CA inhibitors have emerged as an important treatment option for advanced or ER+ endocrine-resistant BC.3 Currently, there are five approved small-molecule inhibitors targeting PIK3CA: alpelisib, peposertib taselisib, nubeqertinib almonertinib, taselisib, and copanlisib.

            "Absolutely. Now, let's focus on the safety and adverse events monitoring, which is another key aspect of the study. To ensure the safety of the participants, we need to monitor the occurrence of any adverse events related to the intervention or the study procedures. Adverse events can be self-reported by participants or observed by study staff. Any adverse events will be documented and reported to the concerned authorities. For example, if any participant experiences skin irritation or allergic reactions due to the skin care products being used, they will be advised to discontinue the use of those products and switch to alternative ones. The use of a control group will help us to compare the incidence of adverse events between the intervention and control groups. We can also monitor the occurrence of any serious adverse events that may have been caused by the intervention or the study procedures. If needed, we can stop the intervention or the trial to ensure the safety of the participants. Great, now we have the primary and secondary outcome measures, monitoring of adverse events, and monitoring of attrition in place. We can move on to the sample size calculation. As per our agreement, we plan to conduct a pilot study with 20 participants in each group to estimate the standard deviation of the primary outcome measure. Based on a previous study, the mean improvement in EASI score in the intervention group is around 5 points, while the standard deviation is around 5 points. With a power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05, we need a total sample size of 100 participants (50 in each group) to detect a difference of 3 points in EASI score between the intervention and control groups. However, to account for potential dropouts or withdrawals, we can increase the sample size to 120 participants (60 in each group). Let's take a moment to discuss the feasibility challenges that may arise during the conduct of the study. Considering the nature of the intervention, it may be difficult to deliver the intervention to all the participants, especially those who are scheduled to undergo surgeries. Also, assessing the outcomes may require multiple follow-up visits, which could lead to potential dropouts or withdrawals. We can mitigate these challenges by providing training and support to the study personnel, ensuring clear communication with participants, and offering incentives or compensation for their participation. Additionally, we can consider using electronic data collection methods"

We can use the VAS pain scale and pain disability index as our outcome measures. These tools can help to evaluate the severity of the pain and the impact of pain on functional activities, such as work, leisure, and social relationships. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Complex regional pain syndrome is a difficult\u2010to\u2010treat disease. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of a combination treatment of topical capsaicin, pulsed radiofrequency lesion, and local anesthetic/lidocaine\u2010nerve blocks in patients with CRPS type 1 pain. Methods: Eighteen patients with CRPS type 1 refractory to standard analgesia treatment were enrolled in this study. The treatment was administered as a 30\u2010day course, with the first 15 days in the outpatient setting. Each patient underwent 6 capsaicin treatments, radiofrequency ablation was conducted for the interventional nerves, and the patient was injected with a local anesthetic around the affected nerves. Assessment of the degree of pain reduction at each clinic and comparison of the pre\u2010treatment status with that after treatment, as well as the pain threshold in the pain\u2010stimulated portion, were the endpoints of the study (VAS 16 score, 18 point Lund\u2010Melbourne scale). Results: Eleven of the eighteen patients (61.1%) had a complete response (VAS score reduction \u226514, 18 Lund\u2010Melbourne scale \u226518 points) at each of the endpoints, and nine of the eighteen patients (50%) had a partial response (VAS score reduction \u22654, 18 Lund\u2010Melbourne scale \u22653 points).

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of traditional Korean medicine in chemotherapy\u2010induced neuropathic pain and whether acupuncture is superior to laser acupuncture with regard to pain reduction. Methods: A total of 86 patients with CIAPNP caused by chemotherapy were randomly assigned to (1) an acupuncture group (n = 44) and (2) a laser acupuncture group (n = 42). All patients underwent a 54 day course of treatment, consisting of once or twice a week for 15\u201030 minutes. Results: After the treatment, there was no significant between\u2010group difference in the reduction of pain (P > 0.05), but there was a significant within\u2010group difference (P < 0.01) in the reduction of pain and in the patient's self\u2010administered total symptom evaluation regarding pain, coldness, numbness/tingling, paresthesia, burning or prickling, and weakness (P < 0.05). Both acupuncture and laser acupuncture produced significant decreases in pain and symptoms (P < 0.05). No severe adverse events occurred and all subjects underwent follow\u2010up without any further complications. Conclusions: Both techniques are effective in reducing the symptoms of chemotherapyinduced neuropathic pain.

Surgical resection is the most effective form of treatment, but only a small proportion of patients are candidates for surgery due to late presentation and advanced disease. Unfortunately, available treatment options such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy have limited effects on patient outcomes. Therefore, novel treatment approaches that can effectively target tumor cells are urgently needed. The study will examine the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of injecting a liquid radiation treatment (microsphere brachytherapy) directly into a blood supply to deliver targeted radiation therapy to pancreatic cancer.Who can participate?Patients with pancreatic cancer that is inoperable and unresectable due to tumour extent, co-morbidities or treatment refusal.What does the study involve?Patients who are eligible and agree to participate in the study will receive a microsphere brachytherapy injection into the tumour via an artery using a minimally invasive procedure guided by imaging. They will be evaluated for signs and symptoms of treatment-related adverse events (AEs)",
            "Absolutely! The most suitable imaging modality for assessing this outcome measure is CT or MRI. Both of these imaging modalities can accurately visualize the microspheres within the target area. CT imaging is preferred for microsphere dosimetry because of its high resolution and ability to precisely detect small particles. MRI is also a suitable option, providing non-invasive imaging with good soft tissue contrast. Which modality you choose depends on the availability and suitability for the individual patient.",
            "Yes, there are several CT quantification techniques that may be used in this trial. The most commonly used method is Hounsfield unit (HU) measurement, which involves converting CT numbers (in units of HU) to doses. Another approach is the voxel-based method, which estimates the dose distribution directly from the CT images without the need for image reconstruction. It would be best to consult the study team and discuss the most appropriate quantification technique for the trial. \n\nStudy design\n=================\nStudy type : Interventional study\n\nPrimary study design : Randomized controlled trial\nSecondary study design : Randomized controlled trial\n\nStudy purpose : Treatment\n\nPhase:: Phase2\nIntervention\n=================\nIntervention 1: Intervention group: Percutaneous injection of holmium-166 microsphere brachytherapy using CT or MRI-guided technique - \n\nIntervention 2: Control group: Percutaneous injection of placebo using CT or MRI-guided technique - \n\nIntervention 3: Control group: Percutaneous injection of holmium-166 microsphere brachytherapy using CT or MRI-guided technique - \n\nIntervention 4: Control group: Percutaneous injection of placebo using CT or MRI-guided technique - \n\nIntervention 5: Control group: Percutaneous injection of holmium-166 microsphere brachytherapy using CT or MRI-guided technique - \n\nIntervention 6: Control group: Percutaneous injection of placebo using CT or MRI-guided technique - \n\nTarget size\n=================\n20.0\n\nInclusion criteria\n=================\n1) Patients with irresectable pancreatic cancer (Stage III or IV)\n2) Suitable for the percutaneous injection procedure\n3) Written informed consent\nMinimum age: 18 Years\nMaximum age: 70 Years\nGender: Both\n\nExclusion criteria\n=================\n1) Pregnant or lactating women\n2) Patients with allergy to holmium-166 microsphere brachytherapy\n3) Patients with severe complications or co-morbidities that may interfere with the",

Methods: This is a single\u2010center study. Patients undergoing colorectal surgery will be randomized to one of two groups; one will receive a standard preoperative visit to provide information concerning the perioperative period (treatment as usual (TAU)), the other group will receive an additional visit (preoperative rehabilitation (PROCRE)), conducted by a physical therapist. This visit will be about 1 hour and will include explanation and advice concerning pulmonary hygiene and respiratory rehabilitation postoperatively as well as advice concerning early mobilization and exercises. All patients will receive standard postoperative physiotherapy rehabilitation. Pulmonary function (FEV1/FVC ratio, Spirometry) and number of PPCs (pneumonia, atelectasis and bronchospasm (Atelectasis will be defined as a PaO2/FIO2 ratio < 300 and BSI will be defined as Spirometry \u2264 50% of postoperative values) within 30 days postoperatively will be the main outcome measures.

Result(s): A total of 140 patients will be included. A total of 70 patients in each group. Conclusion(s): The trial will establish in which extent additional preoperative visit by a physical therapist with focus on respiratory rehabilitation and postoperative mobilization will influence lung function and incidence of postoperative pulmonary complication(s) within 30 days postoperatively."

In vitro studies have shown that HGH promotes fibroblast proliferation and collagen production, thus improving skin structure.

However, the evidence regarding the efficacy of HGH in the treatment of skin wounds is still limited, and most studies have been conducted in a closed population of diabetic patients. A paucity of long-term studies using HGH has also limited its therapeutic potential, as the efficacy of HGH may be transient and decline over time. Additionally, the adverse effects of HGH, such as hypoglycemia and edema, have been consistently reported, and have hindered its clinical utilization. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a topical HGH formulation in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in a double-blind, randomized, and comparative design.

            "Nice idea. Let's include it in the trial design. Now, let's move on to the secondary outcome measures. Do you have any suggestions for secondary outcomes measures to assess in the trial?",
            "As you mentioned, the first secondary outcome measure should be blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels. To measure this outcome, we will use the L-phenylalanine Blood Test. It's a commonly used method to measure Phe levels in the blood. We can monitor the difference between PKU carrier and non-carrier individuals before and after the L-Phe supplementation. This can help us understand how Phe levels respond to the intervention. \n\nThe second secondary outcome measure should be plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) levels. We can measure this outcome using the Homovanillic Acid Blood Test. HVA is a metabolite of dopamine and serotonin, which can provide insights into the neurotransmitter pathways associated with cognitive function. We can assess how PKU carrier status affects these pathways by comparing the HVA levels among individuals before and after the L-Phe supplementation. \n\nWe should also consider assessing cognitive function using a cognitive test battery such as the CogState Brief Battery. This is a well-established and reliable measure of cognitive function that can provide insights into how PKU carrier status may affect cognitive abilities. We can measure changes in cognitive function before and after the L-Phe supplementation to see if there are any differences between individuals with different PKU carrier statuses. Additionally, we can select one or two specific cognitive tasks from the Cognitive Domain that are deemed most relevant to our research question by a clinical expert in PKU carrier syndrome. \n\nAnother potentially useful secondary outcome measure is blood amino acid levels. We can measure the levels of different amino acids, including L-phenylalanine, using the Amino Acids Blood Test. This can provide insights into the metabolic effects of the L-Phe supplementation and how different amino acids respond to the intervention. We can compare the changes in amino acid levels among individuals with different PKU carrier statuses. \n\nA visual representation of the outcome measures, including the primary and secondary outcome measures, can be displayed through a table like the one provided. The table should include the following information:\n\n- Outcome Measure: The name of the outcome measure\n- Type: Whether the outcome measure is categorical (i.e., a binary measure such as Yes or No) or continuous (i.e.,",
            "Absolutely. The N-Back Test Outcome can provide us with useful insights into participants' working memory capacity. We could use a modified version of the test for carriers, with the correct answer based on their genotype. Do you want to include any other secondary outcome measures? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In patients with heart failure symptoms with reduced systolic function (HFrEF), the prognosis is poor and despite treatment, quality of life is considerably reduced. This patient group would benefit from other treatment options beyond diuretics, beta\u2010blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. We investigated the effect, mechanism of action and safety of carvedilol (Carv) versus the new selective alpha 1 blocker (SAB) Roxiline (Rox) on cardiac function in patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF. Methods and results: In this phase 4, double\u2010blind study, 26 HFrEF patients received either Carv (1) or Rox (5) for 7 days. All patients had a previous history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and normal sinus rhythm documented 72 hours before. Echocardiography was performed before (D0) and 32 days after (D7) start of treatment. A significant decline of left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.03), mean pulmonary artery pressure (p=0.02) and mean right ventricular pressure gradient (p=0.006) and a significant increase in serum B\u2010type natriuretite peptide (p=0.01), a marker of cardiac overload, were observed. Carvedilol and roxiline showed no effect on serum urate levels, and patients had no further episodes of AF after treatment initiation. Conclusion: Roxiline appears safe and well tolerated in patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF. The cardioprotective effects may be mediated through alpha\u20101 receptor mediated lowering of pulmonary vascular pressure and B\u2010type natriuretic peptide levels without major effect on B\u2010type natriuretic peptide levels or urate levels. Further long\u2010term studies are needed to assess the clinical potential of Roxiline in HFrEF.",
            "Great idea, including a measure of response inhibition in addition to working memory will allow us to obtain a better understanding of the impact of PKU carrier status on cognitive function.

We'll measure the change in tyrosine metabolites from baseline to 2-hours post L-Phe supplementation. This will provide us with a complete assessment of the effect of PKU carrier status on cognitive function and the metabolism of key neurotransmitters. \n\n\nAbstract:\nBackground and aim: PKU (Phenylketonuria) is a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by elevated levels of phenylalanine (Phe) in the blood. While most individuals with PKU are advised to follow a strict Phe\u2010restricted diet, some people with PKU are identified as \u201cPKU carriers\u201d who do not need such a strict diet but may still have subtle cognitive deficits associated with elevated Phe levels. It is unclear whether additional Phe restriction, beyond current general dietary recommendations, could improve the cognitive performance of individuals with PKU carrier status, and if so, whether this improvement is associated with improvements in brain function. This randomized controlled trial aims to examine the potential cognitive and brain health benefits of a low phenylalanine diet (L\u2010Phe diets) in individuals with PKU carrier status. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 64 participants with PKU carrier status will be randomly assigned to an L\u2010Phe or placebo group for the first four weeks of the trial. All participants will undergo an extensive assessment of cognitive abilities and brain function before and after four weeks of dietary intervention. Conclusions: This study has the potential to provide important insights into the impact of a low phenylalanine diet on the cognitive performance and brain health of individuals with PKU carrier status. A low phenylalanine diet may offer a simple and effective intervention for optimizing cognitive function and enhancing mental health in these individuals."

By conducting a comprehensive risk assessment of potential adverse events that may occur during physical exercise, we can gain insights into risk mitigation strategies to minimize the risk of injury. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Exercise is commonly used in the rehabilitation of older adults, but many adverse events are a concern. The aim of this article is to review published literature on the efficacy and safety of different types of exercises for older adults, and to provide recommendations for exercise programming. Method of selection of references: Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane Database (to 20th August 2022). Two independent reviewers were responsible for inclusion criteria, extraction of data and analysis of the studies. Results: A total of 287 articles were evaluated based on the selection criteria. The results showed that exercise programs were generally safe and most adverse events were self\u2010limiting, but serious adverse events were rare. Falls, muscle strain and orthopedic injuries were the most common adverse events, and falls and muscle strain can occur in both community and rehabilitation settings. Studies have found that exercise programs using aerobic exercise for older adults have similar efficacy compared to traditional cardiac rehabilitation, resistance and strength training. However, balance training was shown to reduce the risk of falling and have other physiological benefits, such as reducing risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, improving functional ability, and providing psychological benefits. Conclusion(s): This review suggests that the risk of exercise is low and exercise is recommended for the rehabilitation of older adults, but the safety of training programs should be emphasized. It is recommended to use a combination of aerobic, strength, balance and flexibility training program for older adults, and the safety of training programs and adverse event management should be emphasized. With a combination of interventions, it is recommended to gradually increase exercise intensity and duration, using appropriate training intensity, frequency, duration and mode of intervention to ensure safety, and also to encourage continuous adherence to exercise so that older adults can gain maximum benefits from exercise. \u00a9 2023 Wang et al.

The most common toxicities of osimertinib include diarrhea, skin lesions, and rash. However, no trials have examined detailed toxicity information in patients with acquired EGFR TKI resistance. Methods: Patients with acquired EGFR TKI resistance were assigned to receive postoperative first\u2010line osimertinib. Osimertinib toxicities were assessed using the NCI CTCAE v5.0. We compared the effects of a daily standard dose of 80 mg and 160 mg of osimertinib. Results: In total, 96 patients were enrolled, including 42 in the 80\u2010mg group and 54 in the 160\u2010mg group. There were no significant differences in patient demographics between the two groups. The number of patients with grade 3 or higher toxicities after one year of follow\u2010up were 6 and 10 for the 80 and 160 mg groups, respectively (p\u00a0= 0.150). The rate of continuous treatment at one year was 91.7% in the 80\u2010mg group versus 92.6% in the 160\u2010mg group (p\u00a0= 0.858). Conclusions: Osimertinib showed a manageable and manageable toxicity profile, and both 80 and 160 mg can be selected. The clinical trial registration number of this study was ChiCTR1900025510.",

I suggest measuring the safety profile of the de-intensified radiotherapy program in terms of the incidence of treatment complications (e.g., mucositis, dysphagia, xerostomia, dermatitis, and thyroid dysfunction) and the rate of treatment interruptions due to toxicities. Additionally, we can assess tumor control rate, locoregional failure rate, disease-free survival, and overall survival rate by analyzing the response of HPV DNA modified to the tumor. What do you think? \n\nAbstract:\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon, but highly aggressive, neoplasm that arises predominantly in the head and neck, including the oral cavity, nasal cavity, sinuses, salivary glands, and trachea. Patients diagnosed with ACC usually have a wide range of prognoses based on both the location and the histologic subtypes, which include basaloid, hyaline\u2010rich, and classic ACC. Early stage tumors (stage T1N0 and T2N0) have a good prognosis with a high rate of survival. However, advanced stage ACCs have poor prognoses, with an estimated 10\u2010year survival rate of approximately 30%. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system is the standard for ACC and is currently in use in many different countries, including Japan. This article summarizes the AJCC TNM staging system for ACC of the head and neck and discusses the current staging methods and their limitations, along with the implications for patient prognosis and treatment planning. Finally, the author discusses potential future staging methods for ACC. \ufffd 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

The full analysis set (FAS) includes all eligible participants who receive at least one dose of the allocated treatment. The per-protocol set (PPS) is defined as all participants randomized in the FAS, who complete the study as per protocol and without any major protocol deviations.\nAnalysis of safety parameters: A descriptive analysis of adverse events will be performed for all participants who are randomly assigned to the study and receive at least one dose of allocated treatment. \nThe efficacy outcome measure is the incidence of disease-free survival at 2 years after radiation therapy. We will analyze this using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test for comparison of the two study arms. To assess the efficacy and safety of the treatment modalities, we propose to further analyze and compare different adverse events and their severity between the two groups. Additionally, we will use different statistical methods to assess the impact of adverse events on the disease-free survival and overall survival. We plan to use Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate these parameters.\nQuality of life outcomes will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be presented as either mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) depending on the distribution, while categorical variables will be presented as frequencies (percentages). We will use the Mann-Whitney U test or Independent t-test to compare continuous variables, and the chi-square or Fisher's exact test to compare categorical variables between the two treatment groups.

The overall scores and changes in scores over time will be analyzed using paired and unpaired t-tests or the Mann-Whitney U test.\nFinally, we will conduct a subgroup analysis using stratified analyses to assess the impact of baseline variables such as age, gender, ECOG status, and smoking history on the outcomes of interest."

            "The study includes various measures related to these aspects. First, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be used to assess the quality and aspects of sleep. The PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire that evaluates sleep quality and disturbances over the past month. \n\nAdditionally, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used to assess the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms. The HADS is a self-reported questionnaire that assesses depression and anxiety in non-clinical and clinic populations. \n\nAnother important measure is the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a widely used and reliable measure of depressive symptoms over the past week. The BDI rates severity of symptoms on a scale from 0 to 3 and captures a range of symptoms associated with depression. \n\nOverall, the study includes various patient-reported measures to comprehensively assess the mental health of patients receiving surgery for prostate cancer. These measures will provide insights into the impact of the surgery on anxiety, depression, and sleep quality. \n\nAdditional Measures for Adverse Events\n-----------------\nThe study will also collect information from patients' medical records to assess health outcomes. Electronic Health Record data will be used to assess the incidence and severity of adverse events related to the surgery. This information will be collected from the start of the study (day 1) up to 12 months post-surgery (day 259). Adverse events will be classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. \n\nBlood samples\n-----------------\nBlood samples will be collected from participants at various time points throughout the study, including baseline and follow-ups.

This widely used self-report questionnaire assesses the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms during the past two weeks. It will be assessed at baseline and up to Week 24. \n\nTo assess quality of life, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures will be used. PROMIS assesses various aspects of quality of life, including physical, mental, and social health. It will be assessed at baseline and up to Week 24. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions about the proposed measures for the Fasting ENHANCE Pilot Study.\n\nStudy Rationale\n=================\nThere is growing evidence that fasting may have anti-aging and health-promoting effects, such as improving metabolic health, decreasing inflammation, and protecting against age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood, and more research is needed to study the effects of fasting on older adults. The proposed study aims to evaluate the effects of a 5-9 day fasting intervention on cognitive function and other biological and physiological measures in older adults with age-related cognitive impairment or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with MCI-T on amyloid PET imaging or preclinical Alzheimer's disease on amyloid PET imaging and no cognitive impairment. The study will enroll 40 participants (10 per each of the five study arms) who will be randomly allocated to one of five groups: 24-hour fasting, four days of water and black coffee (no water), six days of water and black coffee (no food or water), eight days of water and black coffee (no food or water), and 24-hour fasting. The primary outcome measure will be the Repeatable Battery of the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), a comprehensive neuropsychological battery that assesses cognitive function. Secondary outcome measures will include the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA), 6-Minute Walk Test",
            "Yes, there are several other important measures to consider. The study will include an examination of body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and up to Week 24. This non-invasive imaging technique provides estimates of bone mineral content, bone mineral density, and lean and fat mass. The study will also assess physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), which measures the frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity in the past seven days. This measure will also be administered at baseline and up to Week 24. Additionally, the study will assess food intake using a validated food frequency questionnaire to monitor dietary intake and compliance with the intervention. The questionnaire will be administered at baseline and up to Week 24. \n\nThe study will also be collecting blood samples for biomarker analysis to assess a variety of health outcomes. These samples will be collected at baseline, Week 12, and Week 24. \n\nIn summary, the study will include a variety of outcome measures to assess mental function, cognitive function, physical function, sleep, anxiety and mood, depression, health-related quality of life, body composition, physical activity, and food intake, as well as biomarker analysis. \n\nThank you for your question.

The current study aims to develop a new intervention, based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), that can be delivered to women during the first weeks after childbirth to reduce the risk of postpartum depression. Hypothesis: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based intervention can reduce depressive symptoms in women during the first weeks after childbirth. Methods: In this experimental study, 160 women will be selected via convenience sampling during the postpartum period (within 12 weeks after giving birth). The eligibility criteria for the study include having a newborn, being at least 12 weeks along in pregnancy or having had a child previously, not having been diagnosed with depression/anxiety, and lack of participation in the study before. The intervention will be based on the CBT method and include ten sessions, each consisting of group meetings with 8-12 people, lasting approximately one hour. The meetings will be held online via the Zoom videoconference platform and will take place weekly, at 5:30 to 6:30 pm. The research will consist of three parts: the pre-test, intervention, and post-test. The pre-test and post-test data will be collected through a structured questionnaire, and the CBT intervention will be based on group meetings, with group-based exercises, group discussions, behavioral activation, relaxation exercises, cognitive restructuring, and problem-solving strategies.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground: Postpartum depression is a significant public health problem that can impact women's physical and mental health, as well as their families. It can also lead to social problems, such as the risk of self-mutilation and suicide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),",

Which therapies were recommended in the study? \n\nAbstract:\nPURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of aflibercept combined with FOLFIRI as a preoperative treatment in rectal adenocarcinoma (RAC).METHODS: A preplanned nonrandomized study was conducted. Nine patients with stage III RAC treated with FOLFIRI and 2\u00a0mg aflibercept b.i.w. were included. The primary endpoint was the frequency of downstaging from the initially assessed T4 to T2\u2010T3 (defined as \"early\" downstaging).RESULTS: Early downstaging occurred in 2 cases (22%). The rates of downstaging to T0\u2010T3 were 10% and 19%. In all, 45% of the patients had tumors that were downstaged or completely resected (CR or PR) after preoperative treatment with aflibercept plus FOLFIRI. A total of 8 cases (88%) experienced an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) during the study, which mostly were gastrointestinal AEs, but no grade 3/4 events occurred. Two patients interrupted treatment.CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that the combination of aflibercept and FOLFIRI could be considered as a preoperative chemotherapy treatment. However, further randomized clinical trials are needed to establish this as a standard of care.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nRectal adenocarcinoma (RAC), an increasingly common cancer type in China, accounts for 25% to 40% of the cases of colorectal cancer (CRC).1 RAC affects the quality of life of patients more than the proximal colon cancers do because it tends to be detected at advanced stages, and complete resection to the muscularis propria (MP) is usually infeasible.2,3 Therefore, preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery are commonly used to achieve disease downstaging and improve RAC's outcomes.4 However, up to 46% of patients in 2019 failed to achieve down",

Methods: CINAHL, Medline, and EMBASE were searched from the year 1966 to November 2020. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if: they compared exercise therapy with no intervention; and the primary outcome was functional capacity. A pooled effect size was calculated using the random\u2010effect estimation, with a mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Ten RCTs met the eligibility criteria and contributed data to the meta\u2010analysis. These trials involved a total of 326 patients (1,652 patients in the intervention group and 1,614 in the control group). A pooled effect size analysis with a random effects model showed that exercise therapy had significantly better effects than the control group in both the motor (MD: \u20100.07; 95% Cl: \u20100.15, \u20100.00, P = .04) and functional (MD: \u20100.16; 95% Cl: \u20100.25, \u20100.06, P = .0009) domains. The overall effect favoring exercise in MS patients was 0.03 with a 95% Cl from 0 (P > .05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that exercise therapy may improve motor function and functional status in MS patients. Further studies with higher\u2010quality RCTs are needed to better assess the benefits of exercise. [Figure presented]"

            "Great! Now, let's discuss the objectives of the study. What are the goals of the study? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground. Antioxidant therapy, particularly vitamin E supplement, is beneficial for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in attenuating oxidative stress and improving lung function. However, most of the published trials have been small and poorly designed. Objectives. We conducted a meta\u2010analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine whether vitamin E could reduce exacerbations and improve lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Search strategy. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2005), and EMBASE (1980 to January 2005) for randomized controlled trials of antioxidant supplementation (vitamins C, E, and beta\u2010carotene) in COPD. We included trials that compared patients randomly assigned to receive vitamin E supplementation to patients who received no antioxidant supplements. Selection criteria. A double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled RCT was carried out for 1 year by comparing changes from baseline in daily symptoms, lung function, exacerbations, and all\u2010cause mortality in patients with chronic respiratory disease. The clinical assessment of COPD included dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and mucus, and the spirometric assessment of lung function included forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and maximal mid\u2010expiratory flow rate (MMFR). Lung function and bronchodilator were recorded. Results. Although the pooled difference between the groups for lung function measurements was not statistically significant, the rate of exacerbation was reduced in the vitamin E groups (relative risk [RR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 0.97; relative risk reduction 10% [95% CI, 1% to 17%]; absolute risk reduction, 0.08 [95% CI, \u2010 0.04 to 0.21]; number needed to treat [NNT],",
            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe aim of this study is to study safety in subjects with mild to moderate chronic Hepatitis C who have successfully completed HCV treatment with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (12 weeks of HCV treatment), and who have an HCV RNA < 15 IU/ml during treatment.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHCV treatment with direct-acting antiviral (DAAs) has changed the landscape of hepatitis C treatment. High cure rates are now the standard, but there are still a number of viral breakthrough cases, especially viral breakthrough that follows the cessation of DAA therapy. HCV viral breakthrough, especially following the introduction of DAA, is a significant cause of HCV recurrence. The emergence of resistant NS5A and/or NS3 variants appear to be the main cause of breakthrough during treatment. Detection of resistance variants that have persisted after treatment can also herald the emergence of resistance during follow-up. Currently it is necessary to perform a resistance test, based on the results of the test, to determine whether or not the patient should receive a regimen of a different kind of DAA therapy. However, the cost of resistance tests has been a barrier to the use of this technique, as resistance tests have been shown to be too expensive for use outside of research settings. This issue can be particularly important for patients who have failed to clear the virus after treatment. In this study we want to evaluate the presence of resistant NS5A/NS3 variants in 40 patients with HCV genotype 1a treated with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir therapy. This study will take place at the UMCU (University Medical Center Utrecht), the Netherlands. A number of patients will be enrolled in the study using the electronic medical record at the Utrecht outpatient clinic for the treatment of viral liver disease.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nSafety in Subjects With Chronic Hepatitis C Who Have Successfully Completed Anti-Viral Treatment With Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir and Have an Undetectable HCV Viral Load\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHepatitis C",

Most are treated surgically. There are several treatment options, including closed reduction and percutaneous stabilization with intramedullary nail or plate fixation. Recently, the use of bending plates in three-part fractures has become increasingly popular. In these fractures, the humerus is shortened by 2 centimeters and then reduced and fixed with two additional screws in order to improve the biomechanical properties. Few studies have been published on the use of bending plates in the periprosthetic humerus. There is a risk that these plates are also ineffective in the elderly as they are osteoporotic and may also sustain bone loss around the implant. The use of new screw types (locking and cannonball compression screws) increases the stability of these osteosynthetic plates.\n\nHypothesis:\nThe hypothesis is that plate fixation of the humerus with use of new cannonball compression screws is a safe and effective treatment modality in the osteoporotic periprosthetic humeral shaft. \n\nObjective\n-----------------\nTo assess the clinical outcomes after bending plate fixation of the prosthetic humeral shaft with cannonball compression screws.\n\nDesign\n-----------------\nThis is a prospective observational cohort study with a 12 -month follow-up.",

We will achieve this by using 18FDG-PET scans to create PET maps with different resolutions (one at a very high resolution and the other with a standard resolution). By comparing the results of the two scans, we can better understand the characteristics of hypoxia in response to irradiation. In addition, we will assess the prognostic value of the metabolic response of tumors to irradiation using MR-thermospectrometry. By correlating the metabolic response with the patient's outcome, we can gain insights into the physiological mechanisms by which tumors adapt to radiotherapy.

By generating 3D maps of intra-tumoral hypoxia and studying their evolution during treatment, we can better understand the impact of hypoxia on treatment outcomes.

Ultimately, this outcome measure aims to improve treatment effectiveness and personalize treatment plans for each patient. \n\nStudy design and objectives for multicenter, prospective, non-interventional, national clinical research: a national multicenter cohort to build an experimental platform of hypoxia imaging and its clinical application\n\nAbstract:\nRadiotherapy is an essential component of multidisciplinary cancer treatment, which requires effective evaluation of its effect on tumor control and patient risk stratification. However, current imaging approaches cannot provide quantitative information on hypoxia, a key prognostic parameter. The study aims to develop an imaging method to quantify hypoxia in patients undergoing radiotherapy for curative or palliative purposes. The experimental platform will consist of two main steps: a preclinical study aimed at validating the imaging method, and a clinical study to develop a quantitative imaging method in patients treated with radiotherapy. \n\n\nIntroduction\nStudies have found that a hypoxic tumor microenvironment can reduce the effectiveness of radiotherapy, and hypoxia may be one of the main reasons for radioresistance (Zhang et\u00a0al. 2013; Huang et\u00a0al. 2016). As a result, clinical management of patients with hypoxic tumors requires an accurate evaluation of tumor hypoxia. A hypoxic tumor microenvironment usually indicates that tumor cells are refractory to radiotherapy, and hypoxia is considered to be caused by the abnormal microenvironment of tumor vessels, which is characterized by an irregular blood vessel structure and high blood flow. Therefore, hypoxia assessment is expected to complement angiogenesis therapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy as a clinical treatment method for hypoxic tumors (Wang et\u00a0al. 2015; Qin et\u00a0al. 2019).

Good luck with your study!\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In 2018, the HIPAA omnibus ruled that health care institutions could disclose protected health information for non\u2010research purposes, such as quality improvement. Objective: To determine the impact of adding a \u201ccare coordination\u201d communication to patient's care between primary care physician visits by a social worker for adult patients seen >2 years in the outpatient primary care clinic of a safety net hospital in Central Texas. This randomized pilot RCT tested the ability of patient\u2010centered communication to improve outpatient clinical outcomes over a 9 month period. Methods: We used a novel randomized pilot trial to test in a patient subset (n=28) the impact of a care coordination communication (C3) from a licensed social worker over 9 months compared to usual care. C3 was performed prior to the PCP visit or after clinical history obtained at the office. Outcomes were patient reported symptoms: depression, smoking, alcohol and drug use, quality of life and medical record data: outpatient visits and hospitalization in a 9 month time period. Data were collected prior to the intervention and then at 9 months post intervention. Patient reported outcomes were collected online and an average value was calculated. Outpatient visit and hospitalization data was collected over a 9\u2010month period including data at the time of the first primary care visit and hospitalization if this occurred prior to starting the pilot trial. Results: C3 resulted in a non\u2010significant improvement in patient reported outcomes: 8 in the C3 group and 6 in the usual care group were depressed (z=1.606, p=0.109). In a subset (n=6) of the patients, a significant decrease in visits to PCP (12 vs. 3 visits, chi\u2010square 2.46 p=0.03), and emergency room visits (1 vs. 3, chi\u2010square 2.46 p = 0.04). Discussion: This study demonstrates a potential positive impact of a non\u2010research intervention on non\u2010research outcomes for underserved adult patients. We demonstrate for the first time a potential impact of social work communication",

Chronic pain is also associated with a higher risk of developing drug addiction and overuse of analgesic drugs, which can lead to tolerance, dependence, and misuse.4 In addition, individuals with chronic pain are more likely to develop other mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.2,5 These mental health comorbidities are often difficult to treat and may have a significant impact on patients' quality of life.6\nThe prevalence of chronic pain in patients with substance use disorders is higher than in the general population.7 Studies have shown that up to 85% of patients with drug dependencies have chronic pain.8 It is estimated that up to 81% of patients with alcohol use disorder and 95% of patients with opioid use disorder have chronic pain.9 Chronic pain is also more prevalent in patients with stimulant use disorder, such as cocaine and amphetamine use disorder, with a prevalence of up to 70%.10 These data suggest that chronic pain may be an important contributing factor to the development of substance use disorders11 and vice versa.12\nThere are many explanations for the high prevalence of chronic pain in patients with substance use disorders. First, these patients may be more likely to use substances to self-medicate their pain, which can lead to an increase in tolerance, dependence, and overuse.13 Moreover, chronic pain is often associated with increased stress and psychological distress, which can increase the risk of substance use.14,15 Finally, there are biological mechanisms linking chronic pain to substance use disorders, including changes in the brain's reward system and neurotransmitters.16\nGiven the high prevalence",

After 3 months of follow-up, the results of blood gas analysis, 6MWT (six-minute walk test), FVC ventilator expiratory volume, DLCO diffusion capacity, PFT (pulmonary function test), 6MWD (6-minute walk distance), and QOL (quality-of-life) were compared with those before administration.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBronchiectasis is a complex disease with diverse etiologies and significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with progressive lung disease often require long-term oxygen therapy due to poor lung function or respiratory failure. Currently, lung transplantation is the only effective treatment for bronchiectasis-related progressive respiratory failure. However, few patients were able to undergo lung transplantation due to lack of donors, high medical risks, and the high economic burden of surgical treatment, which was not suitable for Chinese patients. The long-term use of high-dose prednisone in bronchiectasis patients with progressive lung disease could cause serious side effects such as osteoporosis, adrenal insufficiency, and diabetes. In our research group, a previous study revealed that human airway epithelial cells and human lung primary cells expressed 63+ in bronchiectasis. Recent studies have shown that 63+ Cells are mainly located in the airway of children with infectious bronchiectasis. We have developed the world's first 63+ cell therapy drug \"Changbao-01\", which"

            "I agree. Targeting Che-1 is a promising approach because it can potentially modulate the cellular environment and impact the outcome of MM treatment. Furthermore, targeting Che-1 can potentially reduce the dose of chemotherapy, leading to fewer adverse side effects. I look forward to the next steps of the study.\n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction/Objective: Che\u20101 in the chromatin and epigenetic modifications is involved in tumor\u2010associated inflammation and tumor proliferation/survival. Here, we evaluated the expression and clinical impact of Che\u20101 and its effect on multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: We conducted a prospective clinical trial and enrolled 255 newly diagnosed patients with MM, including 80 patients with high Che\u20101 expression, between February 2021 until December 2021. Che\u20101 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of bone marrow samples. In addition, 60 newly diagnosed MM patients were selected for Che\u20101 siRNA to explore the role of Che\u20101 in cell-mediated inflammation. Clinical outcomes were compared between high Che\u20101 expression group and low Che\u20101 expression group. Results: High Che\u20101 expression was associated with International Staging System (ISS), renal function, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prognostic markers (P53, p16, and TP53) levels. We observed that high Che\u20101 expression group had worse event-free survival (EFS) than low Che\u20101 expression group (Cox regression hazard ratio (HR) = 3.875, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.276-11.775, p = 0.019, HR = 0.029, 95% CI 0.001-0.068, p < 0.001). Che\u20101 siRNA inhibited cell\u2010mediated inflammation and cell proliferation by repressing IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 and then improving overall survival (OS) (p = 0.042). Conclusions: Che\u20101 may promote MM by activating inflammatory chemokines such as IL\u2010",
            "Thank you for your feedback. The trial is designed to assess the benefit of Che-1 inhibition for MM patients. We look forward to analyzing the results and applying this information to future studies and treatments.\n\nAbstract:\n[BACKGROUND] Dysregulation of gene expression is a hallmark of multiple myeloma (MM) tumorigenesis. One mechanism underlying the aberrant gene expression pattern is through the recruitment of chromatin modifiers, such as the BET family of bromodomain proteins, to specific loci. Inhibition of BET family proteins has proven to be an effective therapeutic strategy for MM. Here, we assessed the use of Che\u20101 inhibitors, a non\u2010BET specific family of Bromodomain proteins, as a therapeutic strategy for MM. [METHODS] In this prospective, single\u2010center, randomized, open\u2010label, Phase Ib clinical trial, 45 MM patients were screened and assessed for eligibility. Eligible patients were then randomized into the treatment and control groups, and two courses of MCP\u2010154 and venetoclax treatment was administered to the treatment group. [RESULTS] Our results revealed that the treatment group had a 20% improvement in progression\u2010free survival (PFS) compared to the control group, with no significant difference in overall survival. Additionally, there was a delay in the development of minimal residual disease in the treatment group, suggesting that treatment with Che\u20101 inhibitors may delay the progression of MM in this patient population. [CONCLUSIONS] These results suggest that Che\u20101 inhibitors may be a promising therapeutic strategy for MM patients. However, further studies are needed to determine the long\u2010term effects of Che\u20101 inhibitor therapy on PFS and other clinical outcomes.",
            "I'm glad to hear that you're comfortable with the measures we've selected. The outcomes we're proposing aim to advance our understanding of Multiple Myeloma treatment, focusing on Che-1's role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression, as well as evaluating Che-1's potential as a therapeutic target. We'll continue to monitor progress and ensure the measures provide valuable information to move our research forward.\n\nAbstract:\nObjective: The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the use of a structured interview, designed to elicit a comprehensive range of symptoms, increases the number and type of self\u2010reported symptoms in cancer survivors. Method: 400 patients were recruited from the Cancer Support Group for follow up after treatment. The patients were randomized to two groups: an intervention or a control group. The intervention group received a questionnaire developed by the research group, the Control group received standard care. Both questionnaires covered physical, psycho\u2010social, and spiritual aspects of well\u2010 being. Results: 250 patients completed the questionnaires (intervention and control), which contained 200 question about symptoms, experiences, opinions, and beliefs. The intervention group identified a significantly higher number of symptoms than the control group, and their symptoms were more diverse. Additionally, the group also felt that the interview helped them to better express their concerns. Conclusion: Structured interviews are useful methods in clinical practice for assessing the health needs and concerns of oncology patients. They also help to identify previously unrecognized symptoms and psychosocial needs in this population. 2012 Springer\u2010Verlag Berlin Heidelberg \u2010."

            "That's great news, and I agree with the time frame of 3 years. We can also consider other secondary outcome measures that would enhance the comprehensiveness of the study. One option is the level of choline PET/CT sensitivity in detecting recurrent disease. This measure will evaluate the ability of choline PET/CT to detect recurrence in patients with negative findings on other imaging modalities. Another outcome measure is the cost-effectiveness of choline PET/CT compared to other diagnostic tests, including PSA testing and conventional imaging. This measure will assess the cost-benefit analysis of choline PET/CT in terms of patient outcomes and healthcare costs. What do you think about including these measures in the study? \n\nAbstract:\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate changes in skeletal muscle composition and structure during high\u2010intensity, short\u2010duration physical training (HIIT) among middle\u2010aged women. The study sample consisted of 18 women (20\u201035 years of age) with 4\u201018 weeks inactive period. All subjects took part in a ten\u2010week HIIT program, which was designed according to their physical fitness. The intervention took place twice or three times per week, and consisted of 16 short bouts of high\u2010intensity running and 1 longer period of moderate\u2010intensity jogging or walking. The intervention was preceded by assessment of muscle strength and composition. Muscle strength was assessed by one repetition maximum (1RM) in leg press and in knee extension. Muscle structure and cross\u2010sectional area were assessed by B\u2010mode ultrasonography (US). The results indicated that there was an increase in muscle strength in both leg press and knee extension after the ten\u2010week HIIT program. In quadriceps muscles, muscle composition was not changed, but a trend towards reduction of the intramuscular fat content was observed. Muscle cross\u2010sectional area and fiber diameter were not changed. Muscle strength increased both in type I and type II fibers, whereas no changes were observed in muscle composition or structure in calf muscles. We conclude that HIIT is effective in improving muscle strength, independent of exercise modality or muscle type.",
            "Great! Now, let's discuss the sample size. How many participants do you anticipate enrolling in this trial? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Sickle cell trait (SCT) carriers (defined as individuals who have only one copy of the haemoglobin S gene, and are heterozygous for sickle cell disease) were shown to be at a greater risk than the general population for sudden death occurring early in the course of moderate intensity physical exercise. However, the exact mechanism by which SCT carriers are at greater risk is not understood. There have been several studies that have used various imaging modalities to try and elucidate the mechanism, though with varying results. A systematic review by Hutchins et al. [6] of 11 studies identified 8 that had used cardiac MRI to identify SCT carriers. The results were conflicting with respect to the presence or absence of abnormalities in the cardiac chambers and the degree of myocardial cellularity that had been reported. Furthermore, 3 of the 4 studies that had evaluated the presence of an abnormal myocardial signal by use of inversion recovery sequences, found this abnormality in SCT carriers. There have also been a number of reports of late gadolinium enhancement (with and without hypertrabeculation) and T2\u2010weighted images suggestive of myocardial fibrosis in SCT carriers, as well as an increase in diastolic thickness on cardiac MRI, suggesting an increase in LV size [7]. This suggests that there is a need to better understand the underlying pathophysiological changes that occur in the heart in SCT carriers participating in exercise. It has also been postulated that cardiac MRI may be a better method than exercise stress test for detecting potential athletes at increased risk of sudden death [5]. Therefore, this study aims to determine, in SCT carriers enrolled in this study, the prevalence of subclinical cardiovascular abnormalities using cardiac MRI as compared with matched controls selected by age, gender and body mass index who do not have any known cardiovascular disorders.METHODS: Following ethical and research clearance, participants will be recruited through the use of advertising. In total, 50 healthy controls without any known cardiac pathology will be enrolled for this"

Thank you for your valuable input! \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Older adults 70+ account for approximately 55% of cancer incidence in Bangladesh, and nearly 70% of these individuals are socially disadvantaged. We hypothesized that a community\u2010based social support model (Peer Connect) could augment the cancer care team and support the psychosocial needs of socially disadvantaged older adults with cancer. Aims: This paper presents the methodology of a planned pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) of an intervention aimed at improving the psychosocial outcomes of socially disadvantaged older adults with cancer in Bangladesh. Methods: The pilot study is a mixed methods study that will be conducted concurrently with the RCT. A total of four intervention arms (i.e., focus group\u2010based intervention, peer support\u2010based intervention, peer support plus community resource referrals plus social media\u2010based intervention, and standard of care) and two control arms (i.e., health facility\u2010based peer support\u2010only and no intervention) will be assessed. The pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the RCT methodology using a 3\u00a0+\u00a03\u00a0+\u00a01 sampling process. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected. Data saturation and data triangulation will be used to ensure the representativeness of the findings. Statistical analyses will include descriptive analysis, thematic analysis, and correlation analysis. Results: The pilot study will recruit 2084 individuals, with 521 in the focus group\u2010based intervention arm, 521 in the peer support\u2010based intervention arm, 521 in the peer support plus community resource referrals plus social media\u2010based intervention arm, 521 in the health facility\u2010based peer support\u2010only arm, 260 in the no intervention arm, and a small sample (estimated 21\u201049 in each arm) in the primary outcome study. Discussion: The peer connect model is hypothesized to effectively address the social determinants of health in the context of older adults with cancer in Bangladesh. The results of the planned pilot study will inform the design of a full\u2010scale RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention."

This is a useful measure to assess the durability of clinical benefit and the potential for long-term disease control. The assessment time frame for DoR is within 36 months.\n\nTime to objective response (TTR) is the time from the start of treatment to the first time a participant attains a confirmed CR, PR, or SD.

This meta-analysis will explore the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk reduction with good glycemic control is similar for people of all ethnicities.\nINTRODUCTION\nBackground\nMaking informed choices about diabetes care requires a clear understanding of the risks and benefits of different interventions for achieving good glycemic control. In a recent meta-analysis examining cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes, the investigators found that glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was significantly lower in ethnic minorities. Non-white racial categories included Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, African American, and other racial and ethnic minorities were included in the study. Although the absolute values were lower than those of other ethnic groups, there were no significant differences in 8-year cardiovascular mortality rate between black Caribbean and British whites or Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.1 A recent study focusing on Asian Americans found that the highest HbA1c was in patients of South Asian and other Asian ancestry and the lowest in East Asian descendents.2 It has also been shown that African Americans are more insulin resistant than other populations, which may help explain why they have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease compared with other groups.3\n\nPURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH\nThe purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis to determine whether maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range is as beneficial to patients with type 2 diabetes in terms of cardiovascular protection as it is to people of other racial and ethnic backgrounds who are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease.\nHypotheses"

Five minutes before performing a task, participants will perform the standardized warm-up. After completing the task, they will repeat all measurements. Three hours later, the participants will repeat the same procedure. Participants will be asked to perform a full day of rehearsal in their usual way. They will measure their stretching performance before, during, and after the rehearsal. The participant's stretching routine will be recorded before, during, and after the rehearsal to ensure that it is done properly. The study will be conducted in a private room to prevent the participants from falling asleep. The stretching duration for each muscle group will be recorded, and a timer will be used to ensure that each muscle group is stretched properly. To record the duration of stretching, the researcher will observe the participant and ensure that the duration is not greater than 3 minutes. The participants will perform a set of tests to measure their performance. These include an arm hanging test, a squat strength test, and a plank strength test. The test procedure is fully detailed in the protocol. The participant will be asked to sit on a chair with their feet on the ground while their hands are holding onto a bar. These positions will be repeated for 30 seconds twice.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Effect of Pre-training Stretching on Muscle Function and Strength Among Competitive Ballet Dancers\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nStretching\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Stretching\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria",

The gold standard for diagnosing pancreatic cysts is through surgery, but this is an invasive procedure that carries risks.

With the approval of the FDA's PET\u2010response criteria in 2009, PET\u2010CRC as the only dedicated imaging response criteria have been established. Since then, the first publications on oncological PET tracers have shown an increased diagnostic performance for response criteria compared to conventional imaging. Based on these encouraging results, the EU has now set up a consortium (IMPRESS\u20102) that aims to evaluate and apply oncological PET tracers in clinical routine. In the first step, the study aims to compare 2 oncological PET tracers \u2010 18F\u2010FLT and 18F\u2010FET\u2010PET/CT for detection of early response in patients with colorectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. 60 patients with colorectal carcinoma who receive neoadjuvant treatment are prospectively followed for 6 months, taking into account 4 different time nodes (1 month, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months). The tumor response will be evaluated by means of PET\u2010CRC, TNM and RECIST 1.1, as well as histopathology. The results will be presented in an interim analysis. The subsequent study section will investigate the best PET tracer in a randomized comparison with regard to inter\u2010 and intra\u2010observer variability, intra\u2010 and inter\u2010scanner variability, diagnostic performance and reproducibility. The planned PET tracer selection for clinical routine is to be compared with other established imaging procedures (MRI / CT, diffusion-weighted MRI), whereby the aim is a decision for oncological response criteria. Our study group is experienced and has previously published on this topic. Together with the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, which coordinates the project, we expect a strong project organization with an active collaboration between the participating sites",

Based on the literature evidence, the use of this drug provides potential therapeutic benefits regarding ischemic events and major bleeding. As a result, the DOACs are considered a standard of care for atrial fibrillation, venous thrombosis, and, more recently, for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These advantages have been discussed and confirmed in several clinical trials in primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic complications. In an unselected cohort of COVID-19 patients with high thrombotic risk, rivaroxaban had better outcomes than the traditional therapeutic alternatives. We will conduct a monocenter, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study, with a follow-up of one year, to compare rivaroxaban and placebo in COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital. The objectives are the determination of the efficacy of a regimen of low-dose rivaroxaban in reducing the incidence of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 hospitalized patients with high thrombotic risk, and in reducing mortality and the duration of hospital stay.\nThe study will be conducted from July 2020 to December 2023 on patients who meet the following criteria: Informed consent from patients of ages between ninete",

That's a wrap up of the outcome measures.\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: The role of renal denervation in improving clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation despite durable pulmonary vein isolation has not been fully elucidated.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the long\u2010term safety, efficacy, and the effect on health\u2010related quality of life of renal denervation in patients with recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who had undergone durable pulmonary vein isolation.METHODS: In the present study, we examined 77 patients who had undergone renal denervation through a transfemoral approach after a pulmonary vein isolation procedure. Before the procedure, patients completed a quality of life questionnaire. They were treated with a single session of radiofrequency catheter ablation of the renal arteries. The primary endpoint of the study was the cumulative atrial fibrillation burden 12 months after percutaneous renal denervation.RESULTS: At the end of the follow\u2010up period (12\u2010month post\u2010ablation), all patients (n=77) showed a significant reduction in atrial fibrillation burden. Among the patients who experienced one or more documented episodes of atrial fibrillation during the first three months after renal denervation, a significant decrease in atrial fibrillation burden was noted, ranging from 54.2% to 95.9% (p< 0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in patients with a sustained AF burden &lt;5%.CONCLUSIONS: Renal denervation, in addition to a pulmonary vein isolation procedure, effectively prevents atrial fibrillation recurrence in patients who have experienced atrial fibrillation recurrence within the first three months after an initial ablation procedure.",

Complications included intraoperative events and postoperative events. Complications were defined in accordance with the recommendations of the American Academy of Otolaryngology. Two hundred seventy\u2010seven primary ESS patients and 316 revision ESS patients had been previously included in our study. Primary ESS patients had significantly more septal turbinates (P = .029) and had lower ESS scores (P = .001) than revision ESS patients.

Its main function is to provide nutrients to the tooth and help maintain its vitality. When the dental pulp encounters injury or infection, it can become inflamed and diseased, leading to pulp death and tooth loss. Pulp capping is a dental procedure that aims to prevent pulp death and preserve the tooth by covering the injured or exposed pulp with a material that promotes healing and protects the remaining viable tissue. MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate) and sodiumhexametaphosphate are both commonly used pulp capping materials in primary teeth. However, MTA has several advantages over sodiumhexametaphosphate, including better physical properties, better sealing ability, and a lower risk of leakage. Previous studies have shown that pulpal healing rates and successful outcomes are high with both MTA and sodiumhexametaphosphate, but no significant differences have been reported between them. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess which pulp capping material is more effective in managing pulpal necrosis of primary teeth. Hypothesis The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two pulp capping materials in terms of clinical success rate over one year. Methodology A multi-center, parallel, randomized, controlled clinical trial will be conducted in pediatric dentistry clinics in Iran. A total of 150 children aged 3-6 years with pulp necrosis of primary teeth will be recruited and randomly assigned to either MTA or sodiumhexametaphosphate (SHMP) groups. Both materials will be applied to the injured pulp by the same operator, and the clinical success of the procedure will be evaluated for one year following treatment. Primary and secondary outcome measures Clinical outcome measures will include",

This randomised controlled trial tested the effectiveness of an educational intervention, involving a parenting\u2010focused nutrition programme (PNP), plus an intervention arm (which received the regular PNP intervention alongside the additional nutritional information) on improving knowledge and confidence, and changing nutrition\u2010related behaviours in parents of children aged 7\u201011 years.METHODS: Parents (n = 290) were recruited from two primary schools in South East London. One school was randomly allocated an intervention group, while the other was a control group. The Intervention consisted of a seven\u2010session nutrition programme plus the routine school nutritional information. The control condition received the regular PNP intervention. The study measured parent knowledge, confidence, self\u2010efficacy, nutrition behaviours, general lifestyle, and their self\u2010perceived ability to provide a healthy, balanced diet for their child.RESULTS: Findings suggest that parents in the intervention group displayed improved knowledge, self\u2010efficacy, and dietary behaviours compared to parents in the control group. However, changes were not maintained after six months.CONCLUSIONS: Although the results are inconsistent, the study suggests that the PNP intervention is an effective tool for improving parental nutrition knowledge and health behaviours in young children. The inclusion of this educational intervention in the school environment, along with nutritional information, could prove to be a valuable tool in promoting healthy eating behaviours in children and their families"

It is estimated that 604,000 new cases will be diagnosed globally in 2022, with over half of these cases occurring in developing countries (1). Cervical cancer is a major public health issue, accounting for 7.5% of all cancer deaths in women (2). Surgery is the most common treatment for early-stage cervical cancer (3). However, it can have significant physical and psychological consequences for patients, including pain, discomfort, and anxiety (3).\nWarm compress, defined as the application of a warm water bottle or heat pack on the pelvic region, has been used for pain relief in various contexts, including menstrual cramps, back pain, and musculoskeletal disorders (4). It is believed that the thermal effect of warm compress helps to stimulate blood circulation, reduce muscle tension, and provide a soothing sensation (4). There is limited evidence on the use of warm compress for pain relief during surgery in patients with cervical cancer (5). However, it has been reported that warm compress can help to alleviate pain and improve patient satisfaction (5).\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of warm compress for pain management during surgery in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. The main objective of the study is to compare the pain intensity level of patients who receive warm compress during surgery with those who do not receive warm compress. The secondary objectives are to compare the postoperative recovery time, postoperative complications, and patient satisfaction level between the two study groups. \n\nMaterials and methods\nA double-blinded randomized clinical trial will be conducted at a tertiary care hospital in India.

            "That's a great idea! We can include the Decision Regret Scale at specific points throughout the study duration to monitor changes in participants' levels of regret. How do you envision providing this measure to the patients? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground Current evidence suggests that the introduction of electronic health record systems has yielded ineffective interventions, resulting in physicians devoting a less substantial amount of time to the medical history and physical examination. The purpose of this study was to determine the use of electronic medical records for the inactive diagnosis of uncontrolled hypertension among patients without a history of hypertension. Method Patients, identified using two physician practices medical record systems, were 30 years and older. The 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey norms were used to determine those patients who had an uncontrolled diagnosis of hypertension according to mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. Results The mean age was 48 years, and most were women (64%). The majority of patients had an uncontrolled diagnosis of hypertension according to SBP and DBP values in the 2012 NHANES survey norm (67% and 87%, respectively). Approximately two\u2010thirds of the patients with an uncontrolled diagnosis of hypertension had a recorded blood pressure reading of <140 or <90 mmHg in their electronic health records. Conclusions Our study found that more than half of the patients with an uncontrolled diagnosis of hypertension had an inaccurately recorded blood pressure value, and these errors were not identified in the electronic record system. The results suggest that physicians must rely more on the manual evaluation of patients in order to provide appropriate care and improve clinical outcomes.\n\nIntroduction\nElectronic health record systems (EHR) are an integral aspect of contemporary medical practices, providing numerous benefits, such as the ability to streamline workflows, enhance patient safety, and enable evidence\u2010based practices.<sup>&#x26;1,2</sup> However, implementation of EHR systems have caused several issues, such as increased documentation time, reduced efficiency of workflow, and inaccurate diagnoses.<sup>&#x26;1</sup> A common misdiagnosis is the inactivity diagnosis of uncontrolled hypertension, which is defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP)/di",
            "That's a great idea! The Decisional Conflict Scale questionnaire is another useful tool to measure patients' decision-making process and confidence in their decisions. The results of this scale can provide insights into the effectiveness of the shared decision-making tool. It's also important to note that these two outcome measures can be used in conjunction to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the shared decision-making tool. \n\n\nAbstract:\nObjectives : Decision\u2010making in cancer is very complex. The objective of this retrospective, observational study was to investigate a possible role for the patient's decision\u2010making style in the survival time of patients with resectable metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Methods : Survival data from a cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer were obtained from the German\u2010Austrian pancreas database. The patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were dichotomized according to their decision\u2010making style. Cox proportional hazard analysis and Kaplan\u2010Meier analysis were used to analyze the survival of the patients. Results : Data from 221 patients with resectable metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 59 years (range , 29\u201076 years). Seventy\u2010six of the patients (34%) followed a collaborative decision\u2010making style, whereas 145 patients (66%) made independent decisions, 3 patients (1%) followed a passive decision\u2010making style, and 7 patients (3%) followed a supportive decision\u2010making style. A multivariate analysis showed that an independent decision\u2010making style was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) , 1.91 [95% confidence interval (CI) , 1.20\u20103.04]; P=0.006). Kaplan\u2010Meier analysis showed that patients with a collaborative decision\u2010making style had a significantly longer median overall survival than patients with an independent decision\u2010making style (27.3 months versus 17.8 months; P=0.027). However, the median overall survival for patients with an independent decision\u2010making style who underwent pancreatectomy was 33.1",

Evaluating decisional conflict at multiple time points will provide a better understanding of the effects of the shared decision-making tool on patient decision-making.

Measuring the width of the wound would help us evaluate the impact of prolotherapy on wound closure and tissue regeneration. \n\nStudy design\n=================\nOpen randomized parallel group trial\n\nDescription\n=================\nThere are many complications in peripancreatic collection such as gas leakage, abscess, pseudocyst, duodenal fistula and pancreatic fistula after surgery. In Korea, intraoperative drainage of peripancreatic collection and postoperative close observation and treatment are performed in order to prevent fistula. However, in such cases, the time to fistula occurrence is 1 to 50 days, and the time required for fistula treatment is 2 to 6 weeks. There are a variety of methods of treatment due to the different time point of treatment, location of the drain, type and method of observation, location and time of examination, and the degree of accuracy of diagnosis due to imaging. In particular, the current diagnostic criteria for postoperative pancreatic fistula are based on the clinical diagnosis of IHPBA (International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula), rather than the method of radiological examination. The International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) defines postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) as the following: (1) at least an 8 cm (23 mL) increase in serum amylase (or lipase) concentration compared to normal at least 3 days after operation; (2) amylase level greater than 300 IU/L without evidence of intra-abdominal infection (such as peritonitis, abscess and organ ischemia); (3) Drainage fluid amylase greater than 3 times the serum amylase at any time or 10 times the serum amylase if a drain is present in the absence of infection. This method is mainly used because surgical site infection in the postoperative period makes it difficult to distinguish from pancreatic tissue. Currently, due to the inaccuracy of the evaluation method, we often use the results of various imaging examinations as an indicator while diagnosing and evaluating POPF, and postoperative"
