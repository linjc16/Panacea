Objectives The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility and optimal timing of 89Zr-labeled trastuzumab PET/CT imaging in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. 2.2. Rationale For patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, the HER2 ampl",
            "1.3 Rationale for the selected primary and secondary outcome measures. The primary outcome measures are selected to evaluate distribution and uptake of 89Zr-DFO*-trastuzumab. The secondary outcome is selected to provide a point of comparison with previous experience. Overall, this information will help in characterizing the distribution of the new PET tracer and in identifying any potential side effects.",
            "Terrific. The first secondary measure is \"tumor uptake (SUVmean, %ID/cc) in HER2-HER2+ patients\". This measure provides a regional quantitative assessment of the novel tracer uptake in tumors expressing HER2. The time frame for this measure is day 4 post-injection. The next secondary measure is \"tumor to blood contrast (SUVratio)\". This measure quantifies the ration of tracer uptake in tumors to uptake in blood. This is useful in cases of tracer leakage from the blood pool. The time frame for this measure is day 4 post-injection.",
            "Great. What about the pharmacokinetic and imaging analysis measures?",
            "Excellent choice! The first pharmacokinetic measure is \"89Zr-DFO*-trastuzumab serum concentration at 30 mins (ng/mL)\". This measure helps evaluate the tracer's distribution in the body and its ability to reach the sites of interest. The time point of 30 minutes post-injection is important as it represents the time point when the tracer has dissociated from the antibody and can be assessed in the blood. It helps in determining the dosing schedule for the imaging procedure.",
            "Great. What about the imaging-derived measures?",
            "And finally, we have the literature-derived PK measure \"89Zr-DFO*-trastuzumab lit-derived PK (Cmax in \u00b5g/mL)\". This measure uses the literature values of the tracer's pharmacokinetics to approximate the tracer's behavior in the body. The time point associated with this measure is 120 minutes post-injection.",

Secondary outcome measures of mortality will be categorized into sub-events of death.\nIncidence of Clinically Significant bleeding will be assessed as death or transfusion of more than \u22651 unit of packed red blood cells within a 24-h time period or a bleeding event occurring outside the PCI time window (if applicable for the PCI arm) that requires invasive intervention to stop bleeding (major bleeding), or interruption of or discontinuation of the procedure for bleeding (minor bleeding).\nClinically significant bleeding will be evaluated by a bleeding committee using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) bleeding scale (Class 1 or 2 bleeding definition) adapted to the catheterization lab (pretrip bleeding scale) and blinded to group assignment; clinically significant bleeding will be based on an assessment of the likely causal relationship by this blinded committee prior to release of the database.\nThe primary MACE endpoint time-point will be 12 months.

            "2.2 Sample size estimation\nAfter you have established the outcome measures, you need to estimate the sample size required to answer the research question. It depends on several factors such as the standard deviation, power of the test, effect size, and the number of groups. For example, if you aim to compare the rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting between two groups (locotechnoanesthesia alone vs. loco-regional anesthesia with general anesthesia), the following formula can be used to calculate the sample size:  \nN = z2\u03b1/2 * p1-p2 * \u221am1 * \u221am2\nIn the above equation, z is the statistical z-curve table value corresponding to the desired confidence level (typically 95%), \u03b1 is the level of statistical significance (typically 5%), p1 and p2 are the two proportions (odds ratios) you want to test, m1 and m2 are the respective sample sizes of each group (patient populations), and N is the total sample size required. The z-score is to determine the critical value for a normal distribution. \n2.3 Analysis plan\nThe analysis plan for a clinical trial typically involves two primary steps: (1) Descriptive statistics; (2) inferential statistics. 2.3.1 Descriptive statistics Descriptive statistics summarize the nature and distribution of the data in a study. In most cases, the means and standard deviations are displayed graphically as box plots/histograms, but other summary statistics may also be used depending on the data. The appropriate statistical methods for descriptive analysis will depend on the nature of the data. \n2.3.2 Inferential statistics Inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population from a sample. They allow researchers to infer the characteristics of a population based on a sample. In other words, they allow you to draw conclusions based on your sample, whereas descriptive statistics provide an image of the sample itself. 2.3.2.1 Parametric or non-parametric tests Parametric tests assume the data come from a normally distributed population with an equal variance and a known (or estimated) mean. Non-parametric tests do not make these assumptions. Parametric tests include (but are not limited to):     \nOne-"

            "I'd be happy to elaborate on any of these measures. 1. Water Resistance: When determining the water resistance of a sunscreen, a subject is applied with a base amount of sunscreen, then reapplied after ~ 40 minutes, then re-applied after 80 minutes (typically, every 2-hour interval). The test is considered pass/fail for a product based on the breakdown of UV protection. Many products that claim to be water-resistant claim a duration in minutes that the protection could be expected, for example, '80+ minutes'. This requires that a product be able to achieve at least 80 minutes of UV Protection before a significant drop of protection occurs. This requires that a product be re-applied at some minimum interval based on the water-resistance claim. There are various official and unofficial tests for water-resistance.2. Skin Type: The Fitzpatrick scale is a 6-tiered scale, from very light, to fair, to olive, to dark, to very dark/black skin; then, in type 6 (darkest) there are sometimes additional classifications to further group individuals. The Fitzpatrick scale is used to help determine the appropriate SPF for the sunscreen, since different sunscreens differ with the amount of protection needed, not all sunscreens protect equally.3. Dermatological disorders: Some people have a photosensitizing disorder or are using photosensitizing medications that could impact the study. Photo-sensitive medications usually require either being taken hours before the test or being taken on the day of the test or being tested separately, as exposure to sunlight can cause adverse effects (skin burns, photosensitivity, etc). One common photosensitizing disorder is being on Accutane or another retinoid. This can have a secondary photosensitizing effect, which could worsen while taking it or cause an adverse reaction after taking it. Since this is an adverse effect seen by some using the medication, it's best to screen for it to save people grief and potentially save them from a bad reaction.4. Photosensitizing Agents: Some sunscreens contain chemical compounds that may act as photosensitizing agents. Often chemical sunscreens like BP3, PABA, or Av"

The measures should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound) and should be feasible to obtain within the logistics of the trial. When designing outcome measures, it's important to consider the following questions: 1. What outcome are we trying to measure? What aspects of the intervention or treatment are we interested in? 2. What is the target population? Who will be affected by the intervention or treatment? 3. What is the time frame for assessing the outcome? What time interval will best capture the changes induced by the intervention or treatment? 4. How will the outcome be measured? What specific criteria or indices will be used? The aim is to choose outcome measures that are relevant and meaningful to the trial aims, and that can be accurately and conveniently assessed. The outcome measures should be developed and agreed upon at the protocol or study design stage to ensure consistency in measurements throughout the trial. In summary, carefully considering outcome measures at the study design phase can help to ensure that the trial is well-defined, feasible, and likely to produce meaningful results.\nStudy design considerations for an observational cohort study"

Pure-tone audiometry can measure the softest sounds a participant can hear in each frequency range, while speech-in-noise testing can assess the ability of the participant to understand speech in noisy environments. These measures can help monitor the functional impact of gene-related hearing loss over time.",

            "The above is a fictitious conversation. However, it highlights the elements that would be discussed during a consultation for designing an outcome measure for a clinical trial. You should always consult a professional for help in designing an outcome measure for your clinical trial.\nA clinical trial is a research study that provides objective data on safety, efficacy, and optimum dosage of a treatment. Clinical trial design relies heavily on the selection of a well-defined and validated outcome measure. There are several considerations when selecting an outcome measure for a clinical trial, such as the type of clinical trial, study population and aims, and cost among others [see Box 1]. An outcome measure is a tool used to measure change in an outcome of interest over time. It is essential to use a reliable tool that measures change appropriately. Furthermore, it is required to establish the tool's validity and reliability in the disease of interest. The International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use has provided guidelines for selecting and defining endpoints and harmonization of statistical methods for medical trials.2 These guidelines provide a framework to evaluate the selection of an outcome measure.\nWhen the aim of a study is to evaluate safety, the FDA recommend using adverse event (AE) assessment as an outcome measure. An AE being an unfavorable or unintended medical event temporally associated with the use of a medical intervention, such as a drug, device, or procedure, or with no known cause.3 AEs can be quantitative or qualitative scales. The preferred reporting of AE includes preferred terms, preferred terms, or non-preferred terms.\nWhen the aim of a study involves efficacy and evaluating treatment effects, the FDA recommends the use of a surrogate endpoint instead of an AE. A surrogate endpoint is a measure of the effect of a medical treatment, either an increase or a decrease, that is reasonably likely to predict health improvements or disease-related functional impairment.4 In addition, the FDA recommends defining the time and the duration over which the treatment effect is measured.\nConventional versus Novel Outcome Measure: Conventional outcome measures are well-validated, widely used, and have a long history of use, such as pain scales. These measures are",

These measures will be captured at the initial assessment, and then again at days 1, 14, and 28 post-procedure. We will also collect data on any complications or adverse events that may occur during the study. It's important to collect these data to ensure the safety of our patients in addition to the efficacy of the intervention.",

Given the focus of the study on stress-related outcomes, we can administer the UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). These measures can capture the extent to which the intervention has impacted stress levels. We can administer the ULS and PSS at the pre-intervention and post-intervention marks. What do you think?",

And finally, let's review our total burden hour estimate.  Keep in mind that this is an approximation and may change throughout the course of the study. This means that the total burden in hours may be higher or lower than this estimate. We will submit a revised total burden estimate with our protocol. Keep in mind that there will be some overlap in these measures as some patients will be asked to complete more than one measure. We estimate a total of 1358 surveys to be completed per site with an average completion time of 5 minutes per survey for a total burden of 777 hours. 246 questionnaires to be mailed out with an estimated completion time of 15 minutes per questionnaire for a total burden of 38 hours. 24 subjects to be followed up every 3 months for 2 years with an estimated total burden of 240 visits. Finally, we will assess the level of patient engagement at four time points throughout the study for a total burden of 288 hours.

            "Sure, I'd be happy to help you. For the primary outcome measure, I would recommend using the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Subjective Global Improvement Score (ISBIS).  The ISBIS is a self-reported assessment tool that is commonly used to measure the clinical severity of Irritable Bowel Syndrome symptoms, with a possible score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 30 (maximum symptoms). Another option for the primary outcome measure could be the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBS-QoL). This is a patient-reported outcome measure that assesses the impact of Irritable Bowel Syndrome on life quality in five domains: physical, social, emotional, stool, and treatment related. This measure also has a score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting a worse quality of life. Both of these measures are valid and reliable tools for evaluating the impact of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, making them suitable for the primary outcome of your study. For the secondary outcome measures, I would recommend including the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). This is a self-reported questionnaire used to evaluate the impact of Irritable Bowel Syndrome on health-related quality of life. It includes 13 questions that are scored on a scale from 0 to 4. Another option is the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Gui-D scale.  The IBS-GUI-D is a 16-item patient-reported outcome measure that assesses Irritable Bowel Syndrome severity and treatment satisfaction. The domains included in the scale are abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, emotional problems, diarrhea, and quality of life. You might also want to include a measure of adverse events to evaluate any potential side effects of the treatment intervention. What other measures would you suggest to assess? How about some other patient-reported outcome measures?",

The ISSS consists of the following seven symptom domains: bloating; gasses; pain or discomfort scored on a Likert scale of 0-5; constipation; diarrhea; mixed; bleeding; and urgency.

Data collection To measure these outcomes, data can be collected through various methods. Each questionnaire or survey should focus on specific outcomes and be tailored accordingly. Some examples include: Demographics Patient characteristics Questions about the procedure(s) Patient health history Pre-procedure pain and anxiety Peri-procedure nursing care Post-operative pain and nursing management Complications Treatment response Speech therapy Adjuvant therapies Other health status changes Cost-effectiveness 3.3.4. Analysis of Data A power analysis should be performed to determine the sample size required to provide the desired statistical power, such as a 0.80 power for detecting a\nSignificant difference between two treatment groups. The sample size determines the time and cost required to enroll a sufficient number of patients. Calculate the standard deviation of the outcome variable (e.g., VAS pain score) in the treatment and control groups at baseline. Then, determine the maximum sample size based on the desired power. Divide the square root of the sum of the variances.\nA visual inspection of the data may be performed early in the study. If there appears to be evidence against the null hypothesis, formal hypothesis testing (e.g., an ANCOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction) can be used to test the effects of multiple treatment arms. If the treatment effects are significant, calculate a summary measure of treatment effects, such as a mean or proportion. For multiple treatment arms, adjustment for multiple comparisons or a false discovery rate may be necessary. 3.4. Ethical Considerations Patients should be fully informed of the purpose of the study and any expected risks, potential benefits, or discomforts. The risks and potential benefits of the new intervention should be weighed against the risks and potential benefits of the standard (or control) treatment.
