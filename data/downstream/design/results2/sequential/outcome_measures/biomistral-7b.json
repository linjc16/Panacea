To optimize contrast, it is important to administer a contrast agent following the injection of the microspheres. However, the timing and protocol for administering the contrast agent need further evaluation and validation. If possible, it may be beneficial to collect additional contrast-enhanced scans at early time points (e.g., 1 or 3 hours post-injection) to assess microsphere distribution within the first day and help ensure adequate target coverage. Further testing and validation are needed to determine the optimal imaging protocol for assessing the microsphere distribution and target coverage of percutaneous injected holmium-166 microspheres. Other imaging modalities such as PET or SPECT/CT scans may also be considered for this outcome measure. I suggest you develop a pilot study for optimizing the imaging protocol and ensure that the imaging modality is sensitive enough to detect the holmium.

The self-report questionnaire, is a measure of the participant's perception of the amount of benefit of the Ekso therapy. Specifically, the questionnaire will ask questions such as \"Did you find the Ekso therapy challenging?\" \"Please indicate how much you agree with the statement: The Ekso therapy was beneficial for my recovery.\" 2. TUG, Timed Up and Go, is a functional assessment that is measured in seconds. It evaluates the time it takes the participant to stand up from a seated position in a chair, walk three meters at a comfortable pace, return to the seated position, and repeat the process again. The shorter the time taken by the participant, the better their functional mobility. 3. 6MWT, 6 Minute Walk Test, is a functional assessment that measures the distance an adult can walk over the course of 6 minutes in a controlled environment . It is used as an indicator of the participant's ability to perform daily activities, such as walking to the bathroom or the kitchen. 4. FGA, Functional Gait Assessment, is a measure of the participant's ability to walk in a household and community environment with minimal verbal direction, such as navigating a walkway, crossing a threshold, and climbing one step . It is scored out of 10, with a score of 10 representing a normal gait with no assistance. 5. BBS, Berg Balance Scale, is a measure of the participant's balance, particularly in relation to gait and posture. It consists of 14 tasks, such as standing up from a sitting position and standing on one foot for up to 30 seconds . It is graded out of 14, with a higher score being better. 6. MAS, Modified Ashworth Scale, is a measure of muscle tone that ranges from 0 (no increase in tone) to 4 (affected part rigid in flexion or extension). It is used to determine the participant's level of spasticity and inform the care team about potential complications . 7. H&Y, Hoehn & Yahr Scale, is a measure of the participant's functional state in relation to the severity of the disease, such as independence in",

Based on the previous information on the exclusion criteria, we should first assess whether any participants met the exclusion criteria. If there are still participants who developed any adverse reaction related to SOT201 after starting the treatment, then this is a TEAE. We should monitor the participants for any clinical signs or symptoms throughout the entire trial period. Whenever the researchers observe any symptom, they will check whether it exists before taking the treatment. If it doesn't, then it is a TEAE. Then it is necessary to collect information about the duration, severity, and seriousness of TEAEs. Severity of TEAEs is generally evaluated based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

            "Certainly, here are some possible secondary outcome measures and potential ways to design them: I.Pain-Related Impairment Measure (PRIM): The PRIM can be used to assess how different pain symptoms impact an individual's physical and psychosocial functioning. It consists of 22 items assessing five domains: pain interference, general activity, mood, work, and social relationships. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 7, 0 indicating no impact and 7 indicating a major impact. This scale can be administered before and after an intervention to measure the change in function over time.II.Pain Interference Scale (PIS): The PIS assesses the severity of pain and its interference in daily activities, work performance, and well-being. It consists of 10 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 7, 0 indicating no pain and 7 indicating maximal pain, to assess the severity of the pain. The scale also assesses the interference of pain in seven areas of daily function: sleep, work, family/home management, recreation/social function, self-care, relaxation, and mood. Each domain is rated on a 7-point Likert scale of increasing interference; 0 means no interference, and 7 means complete interference with the item.III.Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF): The BPI-SF consists of 15 items and is divided into two subscales: pain severity and pain interference. Pain severity, evaluated by the assessment of four items, uses a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS), with 0 indicating 'no pain' and 10 indicating 'pain as bad as you can imagine'. Pain interference, assessed by the rating of 10 items, uses the same 0 to 10 NRS, but with the interpretations reversed: 10 indicates interference a great deal and 0 indicates no interference. It is suggested to use this scale before and after an intervention to track the pain intensity and pain-related interference over time.IV.World Health Organization Functional Status Scale (WFSS): The WFSS is an easy yet powerful assessment tool that can help to understand changes to patients' health status. This scale assesses a 15-",

This scale is widely used to evaluate the recovery from a stroke and the quality of recovery from lower limb paralysis . The tool is reliable and has also been validated for traumatic motor impairments and brain injury recovery . The tool has a maximum score of 66, with 2 points per test item. Higher scores indicate better mobility or motor impairment recovery. The tool is very simple to follow, and we can use it to assess the participants' gait and balance.",

This measure consists of a four-question scale that assesses the improvement in symptoms related to mobility and stability. The first question asks about changes in standing, walking, and getting up from the seated position. The second question assesses changes in sleeping. The third question asks about changes in general well-being and ability to do housework, garden work, or paid employment. The fourth and final question assesses changes in recreational activities. We can measure the participants' improvement at baseline, after each exercise session during the 6-week intervention, and at the end of the intervention program. What do you think?",

We can use a mixed-methods approach, conducting standardized surveys for patients and quantitative data collection at the healthcare organization level and patient level, as well as semi-structured interviews with program staff, lay navigator champions, and patient advocates to document stakeholder perspectives and perceived benefits and drawbacks of navigators' roles and tasks. Assessing program implementation would help us understand the program's impact and how it can be improved and tailored for future implementations.Process evaluation: This entails evaluating the community lay navigator intervention. We can conduct interviews with lay navigators and other key stakeholders, such as hospital staff and community organization staff, to determine the factors that influence the implementation of the community lay navigator intervention. Regular interviews with both patients and their family members during the time of treatment will also give us key insights into the program's effectiveness. For instance, we can ask patients and family members about their understanding of their disease and how the navigation program helped them. This will give us a better understanding of navigation programs and how they affect the patient experience and outcomes.Patient characteristics that vary by study arm: These measures include patient demographics, such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, social support, and cancer-related variables such as cancer diagnosis, stage, treatment, etc. Including these measures will help us determine whether the intervention's outcomes differ for different patient subgroups and inform us on the best approach to implement the intervention to have maximum impact. These measures can be assessed at baseline and at follow-up to identify any changes.Evaluation of organizational readiness to change: This includes measuring the organizational culture, structure, and readiness for change, especially for organizations implementing the community lay navigator intervention. This is important to ensure that organizations are receptive to the intervention and can effectively implement it. Patients' perception of the patient navigation program: This includes patients' satisfaction with the intervention and their perceived quality of the navigator's navigation services.

            "Sure, let me explain the details of each of the outcome measures. Objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST1.1 and PCWG3: ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with an investigator-assessed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at any point during treatment per Response Evaluation Guidelines for Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in Prostata Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3), is used to evaluate the antitumor efficacy in prostate cancer studies by considering the best response of the target lesion to treatment. This measure is an important, standardized surrogate endpoint of overall survival (OS), which is commonly used as the primary end point in clinical studies of solid tumors (Geyer et al., 2013). Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) by RECIST1.1 and PCWG3: This one is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of the first tumor progression or death from any cause per RECIST 1.1 in PCWG3 in prostate cancer studies. This is an important endpoint considered to represent a measure of the clinical benefit that an experimental agent confers to patients in addition to the PSA response (Mehta et al., 2016). The definition of radiographic tumor progression includes both the appearance of a new lesion and the growth of an existing one (Geyer et al., 2013). Recommended dose of YL201 for pivotal trial: The dose-determination study of YL201, which is a typical two-way classification study, is designed to determine the recommended dose for the pivotal trial. The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR by the RECIST and PCWG criteria, and the primary safety endpoint is maximum-grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Based on the results of this study, YL201 would be evaluated at the recommended dose in its pivotal trial of patients with mCRPC.",

Based on the information you have provided, I suggest considering the following secondary outcome measures: Prostate cancer-specific antigen (PCSA) response, Quality of Life (QOL) measures, Cytokines and biomarkers in urine samples, rPFS rate at 6 months under RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 criteria per independent review, Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) rate at 9 months under RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 criteria per independent review, Best overall response per RECIST1.1 and PCWG3 by independent review, Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 9 months by RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3, Objective response rate (ORR) at 3 months, and Adverse event (AE) rate at 12 months. Based on these measures, it seems that the time frame for most of them is approximately within 36 months with the exception of cytokines and biomarkers in urine samples and AE rate at 12 months which are within 2.25 years.",

DCR is not an efficacy measure but is a safety measure. I understand that you may want to include it as an outcome measure since DCR is included in your trial design. However, since DCR is a safety outcome measure, I do not consider it as a secondary efficacy outcome measure.",

Second, testing a variety of novel analytical methods, including machine learning approaches. We can use these novel analytical methods to identify and confirm biomarkers that may reflect the disease state or indicate response to therapy. These biomarkers can be useful in clinical trials for assessing drug safety and efficacy, and in clinical diagnosis of PD in different stages.

            "To measure patient satisfaction, we can use a standardized survey questionnaire that can be administered in-person once the patient is discharged. The questionnaire would capture the overall experience of the patient during the hospital stay, their satisfaction with the nursing and medical care received, and their overall opinion on the hospital stay. The questionnaire can include Likert scale type items, open-ended questions, and questions specific to the care and treatment experience of the patient. A score from 0 to 10 can be assigned based on the responses to the survey. Higher scores would indicate greater patient satisfaction. We can administer this questionnaire 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year after surgery. Do you have any further suggestions or recommendations?",

            "That's a great choice for a primary outcome measure. To measure the functional muscle power output of the leg, we can use the cycle sprint test. This test measures the maximum lower limb muscle power in Watts from three times 10-second maximal efforts. Higher values indicate better muscle power output. We can assess this outcome measure at different time points: preoperative, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year after surgery. What do you think?",
            "Absolutely! For measuring muscle strength, we can use the manual muscle testing (MMT) as a standardized measuring tool. The patient, in a sitting position with 20 degrees knee flexion, will be asked to actively extend the knee against resistance proximal to the ankle. We'll use the numeric score 0-5 from the Daniels and Worthingham Scale to assess quadriceps muscle strength. Higher values indicate better muscle strength. We can assess this outcome measure at preoperative, 48 hours after surgery, day of discharge (7+/- 2 days postoperative), 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year after surgery. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "To measure mobility, we can use the timed up and go test (TUG). This test is a standardized measuring tool that times the patient's ability to rise from an armchair, walk to a line on the floor 3 meters away, turn, and walk back to the chair. Lower values on the TUG test indicate better mobility. We can assess this outcome measure at preoperative, 48 hours after surgery, day of discharge (7+/- 2 days postoperative), 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year after surgery. What do you think?",
            "For clinical results, we can include parameters such as redness, swelling, hyperthermia, wound/scar assessment, range of motion, stability, and adverse events. These parameters will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical outcomes and potential complications associated with the surgery and nerve blocks. We can assess these clinical results at preoperative, day of discharge (7+/- 2 days postoperative), 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year after surgery. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "To assess radiological results, we can use x-rays, including ap and lateral views, patella views, and whole leg axis views. These x-rays will help us evaluate the alignment of the leg, patella position, and overall leg axis. We can assess radiological results at preoperative, day 1 after surgery, 6 weeks, and 1 year after surgery. What do you think about this approach?",
            "To measure pain control, we can use the numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, with lower values indicating better pain control. We can assess pain levels before surgery, twice daily on the ward (except for the first 6 hours: hourly), day of discharge (7+/- 2 days postoperative), 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year after surgery. What are your thoughts on this measurement for pain control?",

            "Understood. In that case, what types of outcome measures are you interested in assessing? We will focus on the progression of hearing loss over time as the primary outcome of the study. To assess this, we will gather data such as audiogram results, stapedial reflex measurements, speech perception tests, and cochlear filters. Are you interested in assessing any other behavioral responses related to hearing, or any health or developmental outcomes? No, because this is an observational clinical trial, we want to minimize interventions and treatments that could complicate the study. Instead, the focus will be on natural history and the progression of the condition over time. In most of the cases, audiogram results from the ages of 3 months and one year will determine patient eligibility. However, the protocol outlines the schedule and visits, starting at 1 day after hospital discharge and extending until the child is five years old. We plan to measure other outcomes as well, including hearing thresholds, audiovestibular testing, and language milestone developmental trajectories.",

Stapedial reflex testing to measure the ossicular connection, which is represented by a significant change in the transfer function of the middle ear reflex.",

Auditory behavioral responses: These can be measured using electrocochleography (ECochG) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing, which are non-invasive audiological tests to evaluate auditory responses in the cochlear, auditory nerve, and brainstem. We can test ECochG and ABR at least annually for 2 four-year study.",
            "I would suggest considering speech perception skills as an outcome measure. Speech perception is essential to everyday communication skills, and it can provide information about the impact of hearing loss on the development of speech and language skills in pediatric participants. Assessing speech perception skills can help identify areas where pediatric participants may require additional support in school and social settings. We can consider using standardized tests to measure speech perception skills, such as the Children's Test of Reception of Speech (CTRS). We can test these skills at baseline and annually for 4 years during the study.",

This measure, which can be assessed by using a speech-in-noise test, can be used to evaluate a participant's speech understanding in quiet and noise. Tracking speech recognition in noise over time can be very valuable for monitoring the ability of pediatric participants with OTOF, GJB2, or GJB2/GJB6 mutations to understand speech in different listening environments and track the impact of hearing loss on speech recognition and daily functioning.

OAEs are a non-invasive measure of cochlear function and can provide information about the health of the outer hair cells in the cochlea. Monitoring OAEs amplitudes can help assess the structural integrity of the cochlea and detect early signs of cochlear dysfunction in pediatric participants with gene-related hearing loss. We can also measure OAEs amplitudes annually for 4 years.",

This may help to ensure that any improvements observed are sustained over time rather than being a temporary effect of the treatment . Another thing to consider is that vaginal atrophy tends to progress without intervention. One study showed that 85% of untreated postmenopausal women will have symptoms within two years of menopause initiation .",

Furthermore, you will need to consider how you will obtain these outcomes, i.e. will you use non-contact imaging or contact measurements? It's important to have consistency throughout your study and ensure that you are obtaining measurements as accurately as possible as you want to reduce bias in your results as much as possible.",

The goal is to compare the safety and tolerability of the two dupilumab drug products. We can measure the relationship between circulating ADA-specific anti-drug IgG antibody titers (i.e., seroconversion rate) as a biomarker for immunogenicity between study arms. Since the study design involves only one subcutaneous injection, we don't need to pay too much attention to the bioavailability (F%) of each drug product. However, the terminal serum half-life (t1/2) and drug clearance (CL) are important secondary pharmacokinetic parameters that can be measured and can provide information on the drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination.",

[IN6] That\u2019s perfect. The first one that you have there is the immediately after treatment, which I\u2019m going to put in here as 1-month, since you also plan to collect the outcomes at 1-month. Then you have the one at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. Okay, that\u2019s great. Did I get that right? [IN5]Yes, that's correct! [IN6] Perfect. Before we move on, we also need to decide on how QoL is measured. Since the main outcome of the study is QoL, it\u2019s important to choose an appropriate measure for this. To do so, we need to decide on the population on which we want to focus. For your study, since the population consists of 18-80-year-olds, we can focus on generic QoL measures, like SF-12 or SF-36 or the EQ-5D. Since QoL is being measured at three different time points, we may also want to make sure that the measures you choose to use are sensitive to change, so that we can capture the change of the QoL over time.

DLTs are a type of adverse events (AEs) that are attributed to treatment and can severely impact the patient. Therefore, monitoring DLTs helps us assess whether a treatment is safe enough for clinical use [1\u20134]. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are any AE that occurs during or after the start of treatment, regardless of whether they are related to the treatment or not [1, 2, 5, 6]. They can appear at any time during treatment and can be monitored to ensure the safety of the patient [1\u20133, 5, 6]. The severity of TEAEs may be assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). CTCAE is a graded scale used to classify the severity of TEAEs in clinical trials based on the impact on the patient [1, 2]. Lastly, CR30 assessed by independent central review can provide us with an overall assessment of the response to the treatment [1\u20133, 5\u20137].",

            "The WOMAC is a questionnaire that assesses subjective outcomes related to osteoarthritis in the knee joint. It includes questions related to pain, stiffness, and disability or loss of function. The questionnaires consist of three parts: (a) a 24-item questionnaire to measure pain, stiffness, and physical function; (b) a 7-item questionnaire to measure pain and stiffness; (c) a 24-item questionnaire to measure pain, stiffness, and physical function, including five additional items. The WOMAC has been validated for use in various studies and is available in different languages. The answers to each question differ based on the subsection, but for all pain and stiffness questions, there are five possible answer choices: none (no pain or stiffness), mild (can carry out all activities, but with some pain or stiffness), moderate (has enough pain or stiffness to limit normal activities, but not able to carry out all activities), severe (has enough pain or stiffness to limit all activities), and extremely severe (unable to carry out any activity). For the physical function section, different weights are assigned to each question based on activity impairment . To calculate the pain and stiffness scores, the participant's response for each pain and stiffness question is first converted into a 0 to 100 score, where 100 is the worst condition. If no pain or stiffness was reported, scores for pain or stiffness are excluded from the total. Subsequently, five subscales are produced in each domain as the mean of all questions . It is important to mention that in all subscales, a lower score indicates fewer symptoms or better functional limitations. The total scores range from 0 to 100, where higher scores suggest better functional limitations. Do you have any more questions about the WOMAC questionnaire?",
            "The time frame for assessing functional limitations will depend on the specific research question and context. Generally, the WOMAC index includes questions about pain, stiffness, and functional limitations over a specific time frame. It may ask about \"the pain during the past week\" or \"any physical difficulty you may have had in getting up from an armchair.\" For assessment of functional limitations based on daily activities, the recommended time frame is \"the past week.\" It could also be assessed based on \"today\" to obtain a more accurate reflection of the patient's status.",
            "Let's focus on the secondary outcome measure of pain. I suggest using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The VAS is a common and widely used scale that measures pain intensity on a continuous numerical scale. The scale is usually anchored at its ends by words such as 'no pain' and 'worst possible pain'. The McGill Pain Questionnaire is an instrument that assesses different aspects of pain, including severity. It includes a list of descriptive words and requires subjects to 'tick' the boxes that represent their experience of pain. The words may be related to Sensory (i.e., throbbing, shooting, tiring), Affective descriptor (i.e., tiredness, depressing), Evaluative descriptor (i.e., scary, crippling), and Fear descriptors (i.e., fearful, terrifying). Scores can be obtained based upon the number of 'sensory and evaluative descriptors' marked as well as the number of 'fear' descriptors used. Please let me know if you have any other preferences or recommendations regarding these outcome measures.",
            "For pain intensity, the measure description should mention the use of the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure the level of pain experienced by the participants. Moreover, it should specify the instructions, such as stating that participants should mark their pain level on a 10 cm line with 0 points indicating no pain at all and 10 points indicating the worst possible pain. We can also describe how the resulting scores can be converted into a percentage or integer to make it easier to calculate and interpret.",
            "For the assessment of pain intensity and muscle strength, I suggest the use of the following time frames: 1) at baseline before any interventions, 2) immediately after the interventions, 3) the end of the intervention period, and 4) at follow-up after a certain period of time. This will provide valuable information about the changes that occur during the study period, as well as any long-term effects that might be present.",

            "Since the study duration is four weeks, it would be appropriate to assess functional limitations at both the baseline and four weeks following the intervention. This will allow us to evaluate the changes over the course of the study.",
            "For the secondary outcome measures, I recommend assessing pain intensity and muscle strength. Pain intensity can be measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which asks participants to mark their pain level on a 10 cm line. Muscle strength can be assessed using a handheld dynamometer, where participants perform maximal voluntary isometric contractions for knee flexion and extension. The force generated can then be measured in kilograms. Both measures can provide valuable insights into the effects of the interventions. What do you think?",
            "Certainly! For pain intensity, the measure description should explain the use of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which ranges from \"no pain\" to \"worst pain imaginable.\" Participants mark their pain level, and the distance from the \"no pain\" end is measured in millimeters. As for muscle strength, the measure description should mention the use of a handheld dynamometer to assess maximal voluntary isometric contractions for knee flexion and extension.

These measures provide a broad assessment of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, and can detect significant differences in the pharmacokinetic behavior of a drug between different formulations. Therefore, these measures are critical for determining bioequivalence and are recommended by regulatory agencies for use in bioequivalence studies.",

Therefore, the PK samples will be obtained from blood draws before administration and continuously for 24 hours post-dose.",

It is also important to specify whether the AUC was calculated using a linear trapezoidal method with (AUClast) or without (AUCinf) extrapolation to infinity. Finally, it is recommended to report the variability of AUCs assessed by the coefficient of variation (CV) and percentage coefficient of variation (%CV). The percentage change will be reported as a 90% confidence interval together with the upper and lower limits at baseline.

Stroke prevention medication recognition: We can measure the proportion of patients who correctly identify their antithrombotic medications. This measure can be assessed at both the 7-day and 90-day marks to evaluate immediate and sustained knowledge retention following the intervention.\n\n2. Patient satisfaction with stroke education (at 7 days): Similar to the primary outcome measure, we can use a 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with the quality of their stroke education. This measure will provide early feedback and help identify any immediate issues with the intervention.\n\n3. Stroke etiology recognition (at 7 days) and Stroke risk factor recognition (at 7 days): These measures will assess the immediate impact of the intervention on participants' ability to recognize and understand the cause of their stroke and their vascular risk factors. \n\n4. Stroke patient education retention survey: We can use a standardized survey called the Stroke Patient Education Retention (SPER) survey, which consists of 5 questions. The total score from this survey will reflect participants' knowledge retention. We can assess this measure at both the 7-day and 90-day marks.\n\n5. EuroQOL - visual analog scale: This measure will assess participants' self-reported quality of life. The visual analog scale provides a simple and quick assessment, and we can evaluate it at both the 7-day and 90-day marks.\n\n6. Modified Rankin Scale: This scale evaluates the functional disability of participants at the 90-day mark. It provides a standardized assessment of functional outcomes.\n\n7. Medication adherence: We can use the Adherence Estimator survey, which consists of 3 questions, to assess participants' adherence to their stroke prevention medications. The total score from this survey reflects the risk of non-adherence. We can assess this measure at both the 7-day and 90-day marks.",

Measuring CR rate and MRD negativity at specific time points can help with understanding and determining the efficacy of Linvoseltamab in the treatment of HR-SMM. Now, aside from the two primary endpoint measures and the five secondary endpoint measures that we have discussed so far, there are a few other potential endpoint measures that you may also want to consider. These are (i) progression-free survival (PFS); (ii) response rate (RR); (iii) overall survival (OS); (iv) durations of MRD and/or response negativity; (v) depth of minimal residual response (MRD); (vi) duration of response (DoR); and (vii) lymphocytapenia.

For example, progression-free survival could be measured from the time of randomization until the first objective response, or progression to active multiple myeloma, death, or last follow-up. Additionally, overall survival could be measured from the time of randomization until death or last follow-up, respectively.",

Additionally, incorporating overall survival can provide important information on the impact of Linvoseltamab. Furthermore, measuring the changes in serum free light chains can offer insights into the targeted antigen pathway. Finally, in-cycle biopsies could also be considered to explore the effects of Linvoseltamab on the bone marrow microenvironment.",

This is called regression to the mean . Regression to the mean in prospective studies, such as clinical trials, occurs because an initially extreme value tends to decrease toward the population mean over time, causing a random decrease in mean differences between two groups . This issue could confound the estimated treatment effect; the differences between the control and treatment groups can be partially attributed to regression to the mean effects .",

We already have a few suggestions, but there may be other potential measures that we haven't considered yet. It's essential to conduct a thorough literature review to identify all relevant measures. [Further discussion on literature review, data collection methods, and statistical analysis can be conducted at a later stage. Based on your study objectives, sleep logs are valuable data sources that can provide insights into the individual sleep cycle and patterns of persons with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Reviewing these records would be a feasible method for assessing sleep duration and consistency, circadian rhythm, sleep apnea, and restlessness during the night. However, this is not an objective measure, and there could be some inconsistency across clinicians and facilities. Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard method for assessing sleep quality. It is an objective measure that includes the following components: polysomnographic recording of EEG, oro-nasal airflow, chest and abdominal excursions, oxygen saturation, EMG, ECG, sleep monitoring, and video recording. It provides comprehensive information on various aspects of sleep such as sleep stages, sleep architecture, sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, and respiratory function during sleep. However, the cost and complexity of PSG limit its routine use in clinical settings for sleep assessment. Additionally, most PSG devices require attachment of multiple sensors to the body, which could be challenging for bed-ridden individuals. Actigraphy is a non-invasive method that employs limb accelerometers and gyroscopic sensors to monitor sleep and wakeful states. Actigraphs are often included as part of PSG, providing an objective measure of sleep-wake activity and giving an estimate of total sleep time. However, it does not measure sleep architecture or arousal index, and its output can be confounded by muscle activity and posture. Wider adoption of actigraphy could be limited by the complexity of the technology. Some actigraph devices require the placement of multisensor devices on the chest or scalp using belt and wrist attachment. Although there are actigraph devices that do not require such attachments, the sleep-wake estimates produced by these actigraph devices have been found to be significantly different from PSG compared with those produced by devices that attach to",

One final measure for now is the differences in patient-reported pain scores. We can measure this using the visual analog scale (VAS) when patients wake up after surgery or arrive at the PACU. We can then administer analgesia and repeat the VAS measurement at specific intervals until patients are discharged from the PACU.

Monitoring regional ventilation patterns, lung compliance, and end-expiratory lung volume, among others, through electrical impedance tomography will provide valuable insights on ventilation and perfusion homogeneity, atelectasis, and regional over- and under-distension, which can have a direct impact on postoperative pulmonary outcomes. Now, let's move on to the final measure. How about comparing the differences in dynamic compliance?

It involves a chair stand and walking task. During the test, the participant is asked to stand up from a standard chair without using their arms for support and to walk at a normal pace to a line on the floor, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The test is performed once, and the time taken is measured from when the participant leaves the chair to when they sit back down. The time taken to complete the test is recorded in seconds.Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): The NPRS is a straightforward measure that asks the participant to rate their current pain from 0 to 10. The scale is easy to understand and quick to complete. \"0\" indicates no pain, while \"10\" represents the worst pain imaginable. It is a simple yet effective measure of pain levels.Quadriceps Muscle Strength: Measuring the quadriceps muscle strength gives an indication of the participant's capability for knee extension and aids in identifying functional limitations. To assess quadriceps muscle strength, a hand-held dynamometer can be used (e.g., Takei Digital Grip Strength Dynamometer Digital Hand-Held Muscle Tester). The process typically involves having the participant lie down on a bed with their knee flexed at an angle of 90 degrees.

Another secondary outcome measure could be \"Stool taxonomic relative abundances and diversity indices.\" This measure would assess the change in stool taxonomic relative abundances and diversity indices (alpha and beta diversity) at 6 and 12 weeks compared to baseline. Similar to the previous measure, it can be evaluated using t-tests and regression analysis. What do you think about including this measure?",

            "Alright, to recap, the primary outcome measure for the REEV SENSE system should reflect its ability to measure gait parameters. As you mentioned earlier, gait speed is an objective measure that provides valuable information about an individual's cognitive and neuronal processes. It can also indicate their level of independence and potential health risks. The primary outcome measure of REEV SENSE Sense would be gait speed, which can be obtained through the GaitRite measurement system using the instrumented walkway.",
            "Given that the time frame for the primary outcome measure (walking speed) is fairly broad, we will need to include additional outcomes measures to assess the reliability and validity of the REEV SENSE device. In fact, walking speed is one of 17 primary outcome measures recommended by the Task Force of the World Congress of Physical Therapy in relation to clinical use of instrumented gait analysis . So, a secondary outcome measure could be the overall percentage of time the sensor was worn by the subject, as it may give us a more accurate picture of the accuracy of the data collected. What are your thoughts?",
            "KPP, or Knee Position Predictor, refers to the algorithm's ability to predict the position of the knee joint during the gait cycle. This is an important parameter to evaluate as the knee joint plays a critical role in the gait's overall function. It's good to consider it. If the REEV SENSE's estimation of the knee position varies greatly from the ground truth, it could indicate inaccuracies in the system. Is this something you are considering as a potential outcome measure for your clinical trial?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the walking cadence measure. This measure would determine the number of steps taken by the patient in a minute. Comparing the cadence measured with REEV SENSE to the reference method would give an indication of the leg motion and the step frequency. The time frame for this measure would be throughout study completion. Are you open to moving on to the next secondary outcome measure, stride length measure?",
            "The precision of walking cadence is a good indicator of gait rhythm, and it is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on improving walking efficiency and endurance. Comparing the walking cadence measured by REEV SENSE with the reference method will allow us to assess the accuracy and reliability of REEV SENSE in this measurement. The REEV SENSE and motion capture system would measure the walking cadences from participants during the treadmill walking during the 2 hours of the study. What are your thoughts on this secondary outcome measure?",

Moving on, the next secondary outcome measure, walking gait speed measured between the right heel and the left heel, seems to be well aligned with one of our primary outcome measures. So, we will prioritize our primary outcome first and look at this secondary outcome later in the measurement design. If needed, we may choose to remove this secondary outcome measure later, since it can be captured from the primary outcome measures we have already selected for this pilot study. Moving onwards, the next secondary outcome measure is walking cadence measured in the left arm-swing motion and captured by the gyroscope sensor attached to the knee. We have a primary outcome measure that captures walking cadence. Do you think the one that we have already chosen is sufficient or can we add this secondary outcome measure since this is another critical feature that will provide additional value?",

Swing time is the time between a foot's initial ground contact (heel strike) and its next complete toe off on the same limb. Compared to normal walking, individuals with post-stroke gait impairment tend to have a longer swing time that indicates an insufficient leg acceleration (forward) in the swing phase and slow push-off speed from the ground.

It refers to the balance in the distribution of weight between the lower limbs during gait, typically expressed as a percentage, with higher scores indicating a more symmetrical locomotor pattern. We can measure gait symmetry by comparing the relative proportions of stance time and swing time between the affected and non-affected limbs using a symmetry index. This index is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the percentage of stance time and swing time between the affected and non-affected limbs. When the percentage of stance time and swing time is evenly matched between limbs, the symmetry index will be zero. Comparing the stance symmetry measure precision between the REEV SENSE device and the reference method would give us valuable insights into the accuracy and reliability of the device in assessing gait symmetry.

Using a battery of neuropsychological tests will provide more comprehensive information on the specific domains of cognitive function that might be affected by tDCS. It would also allow for comparisons between participants who had different baseline levels of cognitive impairment. I suggest incorporating measures of attention, memory, and executive function in the battery as these are the most frequently impaired domains in depression. To assess the effectiveness of tDCS, it would be best to analyze the neuropsychological test data using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline scores as a covariate. This approach will minimize the potential effects of inter-subject variability in baseline performance. I recommend using the same time frame for this outcome measure as for the other outcome measures at 8 weeks post-treatment. This will allow us to directly compare the tDCS group to the sham group and determine the impact of tDCS on cognitive function during the observation period.",

This questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool that helps identify the emotional and behavioral responses of children in the dental setting. Comparing the responses between control and experimental groups will help assess if sweet orange oil inhalation is effective in managing children\u2019s anxious and behavioral responses during dental procedures. Any thoughts on this?",

            "Certainly! For the secondary outcome measure, I propose using the \"Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale\" (MCDAS). This validated scale takes into account various aspects of dental anxiety, such as fear of dental procedures, fear of injections, and overall anxiety levels. By incorporating this measure, we can gather more detailed information on the impact of sweet orange oil inhalation on different dimensions of anxiety. The time frame for this measure would also be \"through study completion, within 10 months\" to ensure anxiety levels are assessed at multiple time points. What are your thoughts on this measure?",

For this, I suggest using the \"Wong Baker pain rating scale.\" It's a widely used tool for assessing pain intensity in children. By asking children to self-report their pain levels using this scale, we can quantify the degree of pain experienced after local anaesthetic administration. The time frame for this measure would also be \"through study completion, within 10 months\" to consistently monitor pain levels post-intervention. What do you think?",

For this arm, patients will receive the standard intervention of a combined FTB, PACS, and IPACK block. The PACS block procedure is done by inserting a 20 G \u00d7 50 mm spinal needle below the anterior inferior pelvic nerve through an abdominal oblique landing point with the patient at a 60 angle (head turning to the opposite side) to the right or left.

            "Yes, that's a great measure! Assessing the time from the end of surgery to the first opioid dose will help us understand the onset of analgesia. The sooner the patients receive effective pain relief, the better it is for them. This is crucial as we want to minimize the amount of time patients experience significant pain after surgery.",
            "I agree. Measuring pain levels at regular intervals will provide us with a clearer picture of the trends in postoperative pain and the efficacy of the interventions and analgesic medications in managing pain. Compiling the data will also help us evaluate the pain relief provided by the interventions and identify any potential pain-relieving benefits.",

This will not only reassure the safety of the interventions but also help us identify any potential harm associated with the techniques.",
            "I agree that this is a valuable outcome to consider. Assessing the quality of sleep can provide us with an understanding of the impact of the interventions on patient recovery. Poor sleep quality can increase pain sensitivity and impair functional outcomes, so maintaining good sleep quality is crucial.",

Assessing the intensity of postoperative pain with a longer recall period of 7 days will provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the sustained analgesic effects of the interventions. We can continue using the Pain Intensity short form questionnaire (PROMIS) for this measure as well.",

            "You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?",
            "Certainly! Here is the full list of outcome measures and their descriptions:Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS)VAS is a simple and widely used tool that measures the intensity of pain on a continuous level. It works by presenting a scale, usually a horizontal 11-point line, with the ends labelled most severe (10) and no pain (0) and subjective ratings of pain level being placed on the line between these two points. A higher score on the scale indicates the pain is worse. In this study, we propose pain as the primary outcome measure. VAS will be assessed multiple times after the day of injection, as follows:Day 1,Day 3,Day 5,Week 1,Week 2,Week 4,Day 7,Week 5,Week 12, andWeek 24.VIPAC VIPAC is another tool that measures pain, but it differs from VAS in its application and the collected data. VIPAC is similar to a stopwatch, as it is designed to show both an increase and decrease in pain levels. It provides three values: (1) beginning, i.e., when the pain starts, (2) end, when the pain ends, and (3) duration, displaying the amount of time it takes for the pain to start and end. It also creates a figure resembling the curve of a sound wave, with the beginning, the peak, and the end of the pain. Inflammation will be assessed before and after the pain assessment. The VIPAC will be assessed similar to VAS, i.e., multiple times after the day of injection, as follows:Day 1,Day 3,Day 5,Week 1,Week 2,Week 4,Day 7,Week 5,Week 12, andWeek 24.QuickDash Thumb QuestionnaireQuickDASH is a brief 11-item measure of disability, which was derived from the original 30-item DASH questionnaire (developed by Rothrock et al. in 1993), which was intended for assessing upper arm, wrist, or hand problems. Each item on the QuickDASH questionnaire asks about the difficulty to perform or the interference of specific activities due to a problem or condition. The QuickDASH will be used at baseline and 4 weeks after baseline"

            "Absolutely. For the secondary outcome measures, it's important to assess the functional improvement in the affected thumb and evaluate the impact of the treatment on hand strength and dexterity. I would recommend considering the QuickDash Thumb Function Questionnaire as one of the secondary outcome measures. It can measure functional outcomes from day 1 of injection to six months post-injection, giving a standardized assessment of thumb function. Additionally, measures such as Grip Strength, Pinch Strength, and Key Strength can provide valuable insights into the overall hand function and the ability to perform daily activities. Assessing these measures over the same time frame will help evaluate the treatment's impact on strength and dexterity. What are your thoughts on these suggestions?",

            "That's an excellent idea. What are the other candidate outcome measures (secondary outcomes) for the study?",
            "Great option, as it will take into account the changes that occur in the liver caused by the inflammatory condition of the bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease. Additionally, these changes are expected to decrease over time as inflammation subsides and fibrosis develops in the intestines. In this way, we can evaluate whether specific liver values can indicate significant changes in intestinal fibrosis or inflammation. However, just one primary outcome measure might not be enough for this interventional study. Is there any other parameter that seems essential to include in the outcome measures?",
            "Yes, indeed. Collecting the data before surgery would help establish a baseline and make it easier to monitor any changes after the surgery. The next potential measure is the median shear-wave elastography values. Do you think having this measure would be important?",
            "Great! Now, let's move on to the secondary outcome measures. We already evaluated the mean shear-wave elastography values. We will continue to move in chronological order. The next choice is the median shear-wave elastography values. I'm assuming you're referring to the median values 3 months post-surgery. So, how about we go with that?",
            "Yes, assessing the median values before and after surgery will certainly provide valuable information. This will allow us to not only monitor any changes in tissue stiffness but also help us quickly pinpoint outliers in the data. Should we move on to the tertiary outcome measure?",

Is there a specific time frame you have in mind for assessing these values?",
            "Excellent! Now, let's move on to the secondary outcome measures. We have a few options here. We can consider mean shear-wave elastography values, median shear-wave elastography values, and the stability index of shear-wave elastography values. Which one would you like to discuss first?",
            "That's a good choice. By assessing the mean shear-wave elastography values, we can establish a baseline for the elasticity of the intestinal tissue. This will help us track any changes in tissue stiffness post-operatively. Is there a specific time frame you have in mind for assessing these values?",

Let's summarize them:\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure: liver stiffness values useful for assessing intestinal fibrosis and inflammation. We aim to identify liver stiffness values (kPa) measured with shear-wave elastography that may predict the degree of bowel wall fibrosis or inflammation. These values will be assessed 3 months after surgery.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n1. Mean shear-wave elastography values: We will evaluate the mean shear-wave elastography values (m/s) of the target intestinal loop before surgery.\n2. Median shear-wave elastography values: We will evaluate the median shear-wave elastography values (m/s) of the target intestinal loop before surgery.\n3.

Objective measures will provide more accurate data on cognitive functions, while subjective measures can give insights into the participants' perceptions and quality of life. Based on the trial details, the primary outcome measures are mainly assessing safety and not having any specific focus on the cognitive functions. In this case, you may want to include measures that assess language or memory functions, both of which can be subjectively or objectively quantified. Examples of subjective measures are participant interviews, questionnaires (such as quality of life and daily life functioning assessments), and neuropsychological testing of the specific cognitive domains. Examples of objective measures are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood biomarkers. These objective measures can help assess the impact of the FUS treatment on the brain.

The HADS consists of 14 items, and each item is given a score of 0 to 3. The total score for the HADS can range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of anxiety or depression. The scale is used to measure the severity of anxiety and depression in both hospital and outpatient settings.

            "I completely agree with your choices. Assessing depression symptoms is essential to understand the impact of MentorPRO on mental health outcomes. We can use the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) to measure depression symptoms over the last two weeks. Similarly, we can use the General Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) scale to assess anxiety symptoms. Lastly, we can measure life satisfaction using a single item question. This will provide a holistic view of participants' well-being. How does that sound?",
            "Certainly! For the self-reported depression symptoms, we'll be using the PHQ-9. It measures depression symptoms over the last two weeks, excluding suicidal ideation. The scores range from 0 (no depression symptoms) to 24 (high/extreme depression symptoms). We'll assess this measure 9 weeks after the program starts. The same time frame applies to self-reported anxiety symptoms using the GAD-7 scale, which has scores ranging from 0 (no anxiety symptoms) to 21 (extreme/severe anxiety symptoms). Lastly, for life satisfaction, we'll use a single item question with responses ranging from 1 (very satisfied) to 4 (very dissatisfied). This measure will also be assessed 9 weeks after the program starts.",
            "For the secondary outcome measures, I recommend assessing academic self-efficacy, cognitive load, and the sense of belonging to the university community. These measures will help us understand the impact of MentorPRO on academic outcomes and overall well-being. What are your thoughts on these suggestions?",
            "Of course! For academic self-efficacy, we can use a single item question that assesses participants' confidence in their ability to be successful students at UMass Boston. The scores will range from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), with higher scores indicating greater perceived academic self-efficacy. This measure will be assessed 9 weeks after the program starts. Similarly, for cognitive load, we'll use a single item question that evaluates the exhaustion participants may feel when finding resources on campus. Scores range from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), and higher scores reflect greater perceived exhaustion when seeking needed resources. Again, this measure will be assessed 9 weeks after the program starts. Lastly, we'll assess the sense of belonging to the university community using a single item question. Scores range from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), with higher scores indicating a greater sense of belonging. This measure will also be assessed 9 weeks after the program starts.",

            "Great question! According to our discussion, the primary outcome (acute toxicity) will take place from the start of treatment through 90 days post-treatment. To assess the long-term toxicity of Proton GRID, we can measure adverse events by organ system. This means we will collect a separate measure of adverse events for each organ system, for example, gastrointestinal, dermatological, endocrine-hepato-biliary, cardiovascular, etc. We can use the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, to grade the severity of these events [33, 34]. Another important outcome for us will be overall patient survival, which we can measure from the start of treatment until death or the last follow-up. With these measures, we can assess the long-term outcomes for patients in the treatment group. Additionally, we can measure tumor response using RECIST 1.1. Do those sound good?",
            "Certainly! For this measure, we should consider capturing two time points. One time point could be at the start of treatment/baseline, and the second time point could be at the end of treatment/90 days after the start of treatment. By capturing these time points, we can measure the immediate effects of treatment on PRO-CTCAE scores and later effects. In addition to these measures, we should also capture the disease response to the treatment. While we are primarily interested in toxicity outcomes, assessing the impact of the treatment on the disease is also important. This will provide additional information about the effectiveness of the treatment.",

This will help us understand the long-term side effects of the treatment. We can use the RTOG/EORTC toxicity criteria for long-term grade 3 or higher toxicities. This will give us a standardized grading system to evaluate the long-term toxicities reported by the patients. What are your thoughts on this measure?",

Stable disease (SD = tumor burden decrease or increase \u2264 30% or neither, so disease burden within \u00b1 30% of the nadir. Progressive disease (PD) > 30% increase in the sum of the longest perpendicular diameters.",
            "I would suggest collecting data for ORR and DCR for 3 months. As these measures are assessed earlier than PFS, collecting data for these measures during the first 3 months will provide a better understanding of the initial response tumor response compared to assessing PFS alone.",

With this data, we would be able to have a more accurate measure of how Trabectedin and PLD affects the overall survival of elderly patients with ovarian cancer over a more extended period.",
            "Yes, time-to-tumor progression (TTP) could be another primary outcome measure to consider. TTP reflects the time a patient lives without tumor progression. Assessing TTP will provide additional insights into the treatment's efficacy in delaying tumor progression aside from PFS. I would recommend including TTP as a primary outcome measure. What are your thoughts?",
            "Yes, the same data collection duration (8 months) would be appropriate for these measures. It is critical to collect information on treatment-related measures (starting/total dose and treatment duration) for 8 months to accurately evaluate the adherence to the treatment and its effects as well as the effects on previous and subsequent treatments. Including PFI will allow us to better analyze the outcomes and stratify the results based on this important patient characteristic.",

It's important to note that the ASAS20 response was first developed to evaluate therapeutic trials of methotrexate in AS patients. However, it has been adopted as a standard in evaluating the therapeutic management of AS. It is recommended to also examine the ASAS50 and ASAS70 responses which reflect changes in 50% and 70%, respectively, in the same four domains and no worsening in the remaining one. The scores range from 0 to 100, where 0 is no change and 100 is complete remission. As such, we can also consider these two other outcome measures as the secondary outcome measures.

The target lesions are those that have been selected to represent the tumor during the baseline assessment. The RECIST criteria provide standard definitions for complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD).

A target lesion is a measurable lesion selected from the group of lesions present at baseline. The selected lesion is subsequently used as the basis of measurement for the evaluation of that lesion. It would be measured for every visit from day 28 of the first cycle (cycle 1) and at the last timepoint, or if the patient discontinues the study early due to an emergent safety situation. The result will be expressed in the percentage change from baseline, compared to the result at the first baseline visit.

As the study is focused on patients with advanced solid tumors with limited treatment options and an expected low response rate, we need to assess whether there is any anti-tumor activity in patients treated with ND-003. Therefore, I would suggest including tumor response according to RECIST v1.1 as a primary outcome measure. Tumor response will be determined based on changes in tumor sizes measured by 2D tumor measurements, as previously reported. The response will be classified as complete response, partial response, progressive disease, and stable disease according to RECIST v1.1 criteria.",

We can also assess the time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax), which indicates the drug's onset of action. Additionally, we can measure the elimination half-life (t1/2) and clearance (CL/F) of ND-003, which provide information on the drug's elimination rate and systemic exposure. Assessments for these parameters will be conducted at various time points up to 72 hours after a single dose administration.",

We can also measure progression-free survival (PFS), which evaluates the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death. Lastly, we can measure overall survival (OS), which assesses the overall survival of patients from randomization until death from any cause.

Assessments for ORR, PFS, and OS will occur from baseline through up to 6 cycles or until disease progression.",

Now, let's focus on designing the outcome measures. We can start with the primary outcome measure. Do you have any specific ideas or requirements for the primary outcome measure?",
            "That's a great suggestion! Assessing the number of patients amendable to curative surgical interventions is indeed a crucial outcome measure. It provides a clear indication of the effectiveness of the combined therapy in making patients eligible for potentially curative procedures such as resection, transplantation, or ablation. We can measure this outcome from the date of first treatment to the date of last treatment, with an average time frame of 3 years. Does that sound reasonable to you?",
            "Excellent! Now let's move on to the secondary outcome measures. We have several options to consider based on the study objectives and the nature of the treatment. We can start with the overall response rate (ORR) measured by mRECIST criteria. What are your thoughts on including this measure?",
            "I completely agree. The overall response rate (ORR) is a standard measure of treatment response in oncology trials. By using the mRECIST criteria, which are specifically designed for assessing treatment response in hepatocellular carcinoma, we can accurately evaluate the treatment's impact on tumor regression. We can measure ORR from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST, with an assessment period of up to 3 years. How does that sound?",
            "Great! Now let's continue with the other secondary outcome measures. We have options such as time to progression (TTP), time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), incidence of study-related adverse events, pathological response, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response, and quality of life (QoL) after treatment. Which measures would you like to include?",
            "That's an excellent choice! Including all of those measures will give us a comprehensive understanding of the treatment's effectiveness and impact on different aspects of patient outcomes. We can measure time to progression (TTP), time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression or death from any cause. Incidence of study-related adverse events can be measured from the date of first treatment to 90 days after the last treatment. Pathological response can be assessed from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression or death from any cause, with an assessment period of up to 5 years. Disease control rate (DCR) can be measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented response according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years. Duration of response can be defined as the time from first documented evidence of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the first documented sign of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause. Lastly, quality of life (QoL) after treatment can be assessed from the date of first follow-up to radiographically documented progression or death from any cause, up to 3 years. How does this sound?",

The rationale behind combining both aerobic and resistance exercises is the fact that it was not certain that either one alone would be enough to improve the treatment response. Some studies suggest there may be an additive effect of combining both types of exercises. Also, we wanted to match the physical activity patterns most patients with breast cancer report doing on a daily basis. Patients who exercise regularly tend to do a combination of both aerobic and resistance exercises. Therefore, we want to match the activities and intensities of our study groups' exercises to the patient cohort we try to include in our study.

            "We can use two secondary outcome measures in addition to the Gugging Swallowing Screen. First, the Performance Test of Eating and Drinking (P-EDS) would be a valuable tool since it assesses patients' ability to eat. It's a practical tool that was specifically developed to assess a patient's swallowing function or eating ability.",
            "The timeframes for assessing the FOIS can vary depending on the study design, but it is typically assessed as a one-time assessment after treatment completion. This assessment provides a general measure of overall oral intake and swallowing function at a given time point. In addition to the FOIS, another functional measure is the Food Intake Level Scale (FILS). The FILS is an 8-point scale that provides a more detailed measure of changes in oral intake over time. It can be used at regular intervals, not just at the end of the treatment, to track the progress of swallowing function. The primary purpose of the FILS is to monitor dysphagia progression; however, the secondary purpose is to predict the need for PEG placement (Sellers, Kunkel, & Watts, 2014), which makes it a valuable tool for clinical decision making.",
            "In addition to measuring severity and functional outcomes, it's important to measure the incidence of adverse events during the intervention. Consider collecting data on the following:",
            "The PAS can be evaluated at each time point of videofluoroscopy during the study. This will allow you to monitor swallows and assess the risk of penetration/aspiration in response to the intervention. Additionally, the PAS can be evaluated during the study based on the FOIS, with evaluations at baseline, after the intervention, and at follow-up to determine how the effectiveness of the intervention is related to improvements in swallowing function.",
            "Yes, another important measure to consider is the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), which can be used to evaluate eating rate. Monitoring eating rate is crucial for preventing aspiration in patients with dysphagia. The FFQ will consist of questions about the speed at which the subject is eating different food types and will help you assess whether the intervention leads to a reduction in the rate of eating and improved swallowing function.",
            "The time frame for evaluating the FDS will be the same as the other measures. It will be evaluated from baseline to the end of the treatment, which is a period of 3 weeks. This will allow you to assess changes in swallowing function and evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention throughout the treatment period.",

It provides a subjective assessment of swallowing and airway safety, and is evaluated on a scale of 0 to 100 points. Higher scores on the SSPQ indicate improved swallowing safety and reduced fear of swallowing. Assessing this outcome will provide useful information about how the participants perceive their swallowing abilities.",
            "Yes, that makes sense. The DOSS will be used to guide treatment decisions, but it was not included due to its high level of detail. The DOSS measures several aspects of dysphagia, including safety, nutrition, comfort, and function. This measure is typically used over a 1 to 2-week period, whereas the other primary outcome measures are collected at specific time points, such as at baseline, mid-treatment, and treatment completion. By using multiple scales, we can gather comprehensive data related to severity, risk, safety, nutrition, and function, which can help guide treatment decisions and track overall changes in dysphagia severity throughout the course of treatment.",
            "For secondary outcome measures, we recommend adding the Swallowing Behavior Observation (SBO) scale and the Upper Digestive Symptom Impact Scale (UD-SIS). The SBO is a behavioral assessment of swallowing that provides an objective evaluation of oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing. It uses a scale of 0 to 24 points, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The UD-SIS is a measure of the impact of swallowing dysfunction on daily life activities and health. It assesses quality of life based on a scale of 0 to 148 points. Higher scores indicate a greater impact on daily life. Both scales will help provide additional information about the impact of treatment and may be useful for long-term evaluations.",

This measure should be assessed at each scheduled follow-up, with all fatal events tracked from the death registry.\n\n2. For the HF group, we can include the outcome measure of cardiovascular death, which refers to death resulting from diseases or conditions affecting the cardiovascular system. This measure should be assessed at each scheduled follow-up, with all fatal events tracked from the death registry.\n\n3. Additionally, we can include the outcome measure of HF-related rehospitalization for the HF group. This measure assesses the situation where patients previously hospitalized for heart failure experience a recurrence or worsening of symptoms, requiring readmission to the hospital. It should be assessed at each scheduled follow-up.\n\n4. We should also consider a composite outcome measure of bleeding and transfusion, defined using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) categories. This measure should be assessed at each scheduled follow-up and during hospitalization.\n\n5. Furthermore, we can include a composite outcome measure of in-hospital device-related adverse events, such as device embolization, fracture, thrombosis, displacement, heart arrest, and cardiac perforation. This measure should be assessed during the hospitalization period.\n\n6. Another important secondary outcome measure is the composite outcome of long-term device-related adverse events, including device embolization and thrombosis. This measure should be assessed at each scheduled follow-up.\n\n7. To assess patients' physical function, we can include changes in patients' peak oxygen uptake, measured by the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). This measure should be assessed at each scheduled follow-up.\n\n8. For evaluating the impact on patients' quality of life, we can consider changes in health-related quality of life scores reported by participants via the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. This measure should be assessed at each scheduled follow-up.\n\n9. Lastly, for the HF group and SHD group, we can include changes in health-related quality of life scores reported by participants via the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).

The incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula may also be reported as an event (yes/no). This outcome is a binary measure categorized based on the presence of postoperative pancreatic fistula within a specified time period (usually 30 days postoperatively). To standardize terminology, this outcome is sometimes referred to as surgical site infection. In addition to the incidence rate of pancreatic fistula, it would be helpful to include a measure for the severity of pancreatic fistula. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is an internationally accepted scale for clinical trials to grade and compare the severity of postoperative complications. It would be helpful to categorize the incidence of pancreatic fistula based on this scale. Here is a sample summary of how you could report the incidence and severity of pancreatic fistula: The incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula within 30 days of surgery was 25% (25 out of 98 patients) in the CUSA group versus 37% (28 out of 77 patients) for electrocautery (p-value = 0.12). Of the 25 cases of pancreatic fistula in the CUSA group, only one (4%) was considered a severe complication, while 14 cases (18%) in the electrocautery group were considered severe (p-value = 0.08).",

Consider using either self-reported measures, such as the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale , or measure the biological changes through inflammatory and stress hormone levels. In addition, you can include measures such as quality of life, exercise adherence, physical fitness, and anxiety/depression as the secondary outcome measures.",

For the exercise group, we will incorporate measures of muscle strength and range of motion, as well as measures of health behaviors, anxiety, depression, and fatigue. For muscle strength, we can use handgrip strength and leg strength assessed using a dynamometer. We can assess these measures at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks. For range of motion, we can use the Timbie test for shoulder range of motion and the sit and reach test for lower back and upper leg flexibility. These measures can also be evaluated at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks. For health behaviors, we can use the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Physical Health Scale. For measures of anxiety, depression, and fatigue, we can use the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (DASS) Scale, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, Fatigue Scale, and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scale.

Additionally, we can use questionnaire sheets to gather feedback from parents regarding the relief of nasal obstruction. As for the recurrence rate, we can use the same fibro-optic evaluation and questionnaires to assess the incidence of recurrence. Does that make sense?",

For the time frame of the primary outcome analysis of rate of patients without any grade 2 and more toxicities within the PTV, I suggest choosing the end of the radiotherapy period and then 1 month after the last radiation therapy session.",

For the time frame, I suggest that the rate of acute toxicity is measured by the incidence of toxicities within the first 90 days after radiotherapy and the rate of late toxicity is measured by the incidence of toxicities between 90 days and 3 years after radiotherapy. Is that accurate?",
            "Great! Now, the final step is to select the instruments. There are many different instruments available for measuring side effects after cancer treatment. Here are three common instruments:Radiotherapy Oncology Group-Respiratory Group (RTOG-RG) 0, 1, 4, and 5 questionnaire (QoR40) is a 40-item questionnaire that assesses symptoms and functional status during radiotherapy. Each item has five possible answers, ranging from 1 (no symptoms) to 5 (very serious symptoms). The questionnaire can be used at admission, after completion of the initial treatment, during follow-up, and as an end-of-radiotherapy assessment. It is not designed to evaluate specific tumor sites but rather the general effects of radiation therapy on the lungs, heart, or other organs.EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 is a set of two questionnaires developed by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire that measures various aspects of quality of life and functioning during and after cancer treatment, such as pain, physical, emotional and social well-being, and fatigue. QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item questionnaire that measures specific symptoms associated with breast cancer and its treatment.Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ, Satisfaction Scale) is a 17-item questionnaire that assesses patient satisfaction with cancer treatment. It includes questions about overall perceptions of therapy, treatment-related side effects, and medical care. The CTSQ is a standardized questionnaire and has been used in several studies to evaluate patient satisfaction with breast cancer treatment. [ 22, 23].",

The time frame for this measure is 1 year after the start of radiotherapy, which will allow for the assessment of changes in quality of life over time. Any additional details you would like to add or modify regarding this outcome measure?",

The safety and tolerability of the intervention are crucial for ensuring patient safety. The incidence of adverse events should be the primary outcome measure from the start of the intervention to the end of the follow-up. I suggest defining adverse events on the consent form and evaluating them consistently during each visit until the end of the follow-up duration, so you can identify any additional events.

It provides a standardized method for evaluating inflammation and overall gingival health. The time frame for this measure would be 1 year to allow for long-term evaluation of gingival health. \n\n2. Peri-implant tissues health (Clinical) - Modified plaque index: This measure evaluates the accumulation of plaque around the implants. It's important to assess plaque accumulation to determine the effectiveness of the PEKK framework in maintaining oral hygiene and preventing peri-implant complications. Again, the time frame for this measure would be 1 year.",
            "Excellent question! Secondary outcome measures provide additional insights into the treatment's impact. Based on the study objectives, I would suggest the following secondary outcome measures:\n\n1. Peri-implant probing depth: This measure assesses the depth of the peri-implant pockets using a plastic periodontal probe. Increased probing depths indicate inflammation and potential peri-implantitis. Monitoring probing depth allows for early detection of changes in the peri-implant tissues. The time frame for this measure would also be 1 year.\n\n2. Peri-implant radiographic evaluation: This measure focuses on evaluating changes in marginal bone height around the implants using periapical radiographs. Marginal bone loss is a common complication in implant dentistry and can impact the long-term success of the prostheses. Monitoring bone height changes provides valuable information on implant stability and the impact of the PEKK framework on bone preservation. The time frame for this measure would also be 1 year.",

Progression-free survival refers to the time from starting chemotherapy until the appearance of new progressions or recurrences of the disease. It is a commonly used survival endpoint in cancer trials. Overall survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the patient's death from any cause. Both of these outcomes will provide valuable information on the efficacy of intravenous vitamin C in treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, we need to consider safety outcomes, which will be crucial in this study. Have you thought about how we will assess the safety of the intervention?",
            "Great question! Another potential secondary outcome that comes to mind is exercise capacity. We can assess exercise capacity using 6-minute walk test. By measuring the distance that the participants walk in 6 minutes with a stopwatch and a ruler, we obtain an estimate of their exercise capacity. Compared to a similar measurement performed at the baseline of the trial, an increased distance walked indicates an increase in exercise capacity that could be a result of intravenous infusion of vitamin C.",
            "A third secondary outcome measure we can incorporate into the study is the assessment of systemic oxidative stress levels. Since vitamin C is an antioxidant, it would be valuable to evaluate whether intravenous vitamin C increases the body's overall antioxidant status. One way to measure this is to assess biomarkers of oxidative stress levels before and after the trial. By doing so, we can determine if intravenous vitamin C has a significant effect on systemic oxidative stress levels. Some examples of oxidative stress-related biomarkers that we can assess are malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. We can check for these biomarkers using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and an ultra-violet detection (UV) system.",
            "Based on the study design, it would be interesting to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of intravenous vitamin C between treatment arms. We can do this by assessing the ascorbic acid serum level at three time points: (1) prior to the start of treatment, (2) during treatment, and (3) during follow-up. The ascorbic acid level can be assessed 24 h prior to each cycle of chemotherapy, during chemotherapy, and two weeks after chemotherapy.",
            "Lastly, it would be valuable to monitor patient-reported cancer-related fatigue at different time points. Patient-reported fatigue is a common symptom experienced by cancer patients due to the disease itself or because of treatment-related side effects, so assessing this outcome measure could provide additional information on the impact of intravenous vitamin C on cancer-related fatigue. We can use the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) to assess patient-reported cancer-related fatigue at the same time points as previously mentioned.",

It is calculated by measuring the change in E' velocity between the end of the P wave and end of the T wave of the QRS-T complex during atrial contraction (A wave), which represents a measure of left ventricular preload. The formula for calculating E\u2032 variation is: E\u2032Variation = (E\u2032End-Diastole - E\u2032Early-Diastole) - (E\u2032End-Systole - E\u2032Early-Systole). To derive this parameter, a tissue Doppler velocity is measured at the junction of the left ventricular wall and posterior annulus. The E' variation (\u2206E') is then calculated by subtracting the E' values during systole from those during diastole. A positive E' variation value indicates fluid-responsiveness, whereas a negative value indicates a non-responsive state.",

The overall duration of the trial is approximately 13 months from enrolment to study completion. The duration of the main part of the study is 12 weeks, which is the duration of the treatment and follow-up period. During this timeframe, all investigational drugs are blindly administered to all patients. Then, the final visit is scheduled up to 7 days after the last dose of the investigational drug (i.e., study treatment plus 1 weeks safety follow-up). Therefore, the duration between screening and the first treatment (i.e., visit at randomization) is approximately 1 week.

Measuring ctDNA levels involves quantifying the amount of ctDNA in the blood plasma, which typically refers to the cell-free fraction of circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). To assess the ctDNA levels before and after treatment, researchers will isolate the cell-free DNA from blood plasma samples from participants and conduct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to quantify the copy number of a biomarker target region. The percentage of ctDNA percentage is often determined by comparing ctDNA copy numbers to total copy numbers. The PCR amplification region for ctDNA detection will be pre-defined by a unique target DNA sequence located in the most informative, somatic cancer drivers (for example, genes with exome-wide mutation rates) using next-generation sequencing technologies. It is important because the tumor genome is fragmented into cfDNA, which reflects the genomic properties of the tumor.

The score is based on severity ratings for daily hives severity and daily itch severity, each measured on a 0-6 scale. The hives severity rating is the average of nine 0-6 scores for severity of hives in each body region (face, ears, eyes, scalp, neck, torso, back, arms, and legs). The itch severity rating is the average of five 0-6 severity scores for hives, itch in other body areas, overall itch, pruritic throat, and pruritic eyes. Each score can be added to obtain a UAS7 sub-score that ranges from 7-42. To obtain the UAS7 score, the UAS7 sub-score is divided by 7 and multiplied by 100 to yield a composite score of 0-600. An individual UAS7 score below or equal to 8 is considered \"no urticaria.\" Scores of 8.1-80 are considered \"minimal urticaria,\" scores of 81-150 are considered \"mild urticaria,\" 151-250 scores are considered \"moderate urticaria,\" and 251-600 scores are considered \"severe urticaria\" .

The absolute change from baseline in the Daily Urticaria Activity Score (UAS6). The UAS6 is the sum of the Daily Hives Severity Score (HSS6 score) and the Daily Itch Severity Score (ISS6 score). Similar to the UAS7, a higher score indicates greater disease activity.The time frame for assessing this outcome would be at Week 12.1. The absolute change from baseline in the Daily Pruritus Severity Score (DSS) at Week 12. The DSS is a one-question measure on how an individual's itching severity was experienced that day on a scale of 0 - 3.",

Based on the information provided, I suggest using validated scales to measure vaccination attitude (confidence or hesitancy) for different subpopulations. This could include the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines Survey - Short Form (PACV-SF), Emory Vaccine Confidence Index (EVCI), Vaccination Confidence Scale (VCS), and Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale (VAX). These scales can be used to assess vaccine confidence over a 6-month period for caregivers of young children, caregivers of older pediatric patients, adult patients, and clinical workers/health professionals. What do you think of this suggestion?",

Based on the goals of the study, I suggest including measures related to missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs) and vaccination rates. For missed opportunities, we can analyze well visit completion rates before and after the intervention in different subpopulations such as adult patients and pediatric patients. We can also track the total number of well clinic visits at baseline and analyze changes over a 6-month period. Additionally, monitoring vaccination rates in different subpopulations over the same 6-month period will provide valuable information on the overall impact of the intervention. What are your thoughts on these secondary outcome measures?",
            "Excellent! To summarize, the outcome measures for the clinical trial on group intervention for vaccine confidence are as follows:\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Vaccine confidence scale(s): Measured by validated scales such as PACV-SF, EVCI, VCS, and VAX. This measure will assess vaccination attitude (confidence or hesitancy) over a 6-month period for different subpopulations.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs): Analyzing well visit completion rates before and after the intervention, as well as changes in total well clinic visits over a 6-month period.\n- Vaccination rates: Monitoring vaccination rates in different subpopulations over a 6-month period.\n\nThese outcome measures will help evaluate the impact of the group intervention on vaccine confidence and vaccination outcomes.
