It depends on several factors such as the standard deviation, power of the test, effect size, and the number of groups. For example, if you aim to compare the rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting between two groups (locotechnoanesthesia alone vs. loco-regional anesthesia with general anesthesia), the following formula can be used to calculate the sample size:  \nN = z2\u03b1/2 * p1-p2 * \u221am1 * \u221am2\nIn the above equation, z is the statistical z-curve table value corresponding to the desired confidence level (typically 95%), \u03b1 is the level of statistical significance (typically 5%), p1 and p2 are the two proportions (odds ratios) you want to test, m1 and m2 are the respective sample sizes of each group (patient populations), and N is the total sample size required. The z-score is to determine the critical value for a normal distribution. \n2.3 Analysis plan\nThe analysis plan for a clinical trial typically involves two primary steps: (1) Descriptive statistics; (2) inferential statistics. 2.3.1 Descriptive statistics Descriptive statistics summarize the nature and distribution of the data in a study. In most cases, the means and standard deviations are displayed graphically as box plots/histograms, but other summary statistics may also be used depending on the data.

They allow researchers to infer the characteristics of a population based on a sample. In other words, they allow you to draw conclusions based on your sample, whereas descriptive statistics provide an image of the sample itself. 2.3.2.1 Parametric or non-parametric tests Parametric tests assume the data come from a normally distributed population with an equal variance and a known (or estimated) mean. Non-parametric tests do not make these assumptions. Parametric tests include (but are not limited to):     \nOne-"

Some potential measures could include measures of redness and burning, as well as assessments of skin condition by a dermatologist. These measures will help evaluate whether the participants experienced any irritation, redness, or other adverse effects after using the sunscreen. Additionally, a dermatologist assessment could help evaluate the overall skin condition of each participant before and after using the sunscreen. These measures will provide a more comprehensive view of the efficacy and safety of the sunscreen.",
            "I'd be happy to elaborate on any of these measures. 1. Water Resistance: When determining the water resistance of a sunscreen, a subject is applied with a base amount of sunscreen, then reapplied after ~ 40 minutes, then re-applied after 80 minutes (typically, every 2-hour interval). The test is considered pass/fail for a product based on the breakdown of UV protection. Many products that claim to be water-resistant claim a duration in minutes that the protection could be expected, for example, '80+ minutes'. This requires that a product be able to achieve at least 80 minutes of UV Protection before a significant drop of protection occurs. This requires that a product be re-applied at some minimum interval based on the water-resistance claim. There are various official and unofficial tests for water-resistance.2. Skin Type: The Fitzpatrick scale is a 6-tiered scale, from very light, to fair, to olive, to dark, to very dark/black skin; then, in type 6 (darkest) there are sometimes additional classifications to further group individuals. The Fitzpatrick scale is used to help determine the appropriate SPF for the sunscreen, since different sunscreens differ with the amount of protection needed, not all sunscreens protect equally.3. Dermatological disorders: Some people have a photosensitizing disorder or are using photosensitizing medications that could impact the study. Photo-sensitive medications usually require either being taken hours before the test or being taken on the day of the test or being tested separately, as exposure to sunlight can cause adverse effects (skin burns, photosensitivity, etc). One common photosensitizing disorder is being on Accutane or another retinoid. This can have a secondary photosensitizing effect, which could worsen while taking it or cause an adverse reaction after taking it. Since this is an adverse effect seen by some using the medication, it's best to screen for it to save people grief and potentially save them from a bad reaction.4. Photosensitizing Agents: Some sunscreens contain chemical compounds that may act as photosensitizing agents. Often chemical sunscreens like BP3, PABA, or Av",

            "Outcome measures form an integral part of any clinical trial. They define the key aspects that need to be investigated and provide a clear framework for analysis. The measures should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound) and should be feasible to obtain within the logistics of the trial. When designing outcome measures, it's important to consider the following questions: 1. What outcome are we trying to measure? What aspects of the intervention or treatment are we interested in? 2. What is the target population? Who will be affected by the intervention or treatment? 3. What is the time frame for assessing the outcome? What time interval will best capture the changes induced by the intervention or treatment? 4. How will the outcome be measured? What specific criteria or indices will be used? The aim is to choose outcome measures that are relevant and meaningful to the trial aims, and that can be accurately and conveniently assessed. The outcome measures should be developed and agreed upon at the protocol or study design stage to ensure consistency in measurements throughout the trial. In summary, carefully considering outcome measures at the study design phase can help to ensure that the trial is well-defined, feasible, and likely to produce meaningful results.\nStudy design considerations for an observational cohort study",

Do you think we can recruit 60 participants in each arm easily? Participant recruitment will be challenging since this is a complex intervention and patients with knee osteoarthritis are usually not easy to recruit for this type of trials.

The objective response rate (ORR) measures the percentage of participants with confirmed best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to treatment. This helps evaluate the efficacy of YL201 in treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The time frame for assessing ORR is approximately within 36 months. \n\nRadiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) measures the time from the date of first administration to first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST1.1 and PCWG3 criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. It provides insights into the duration of disease control and the impact of YL201 on disease progression. The time frame for rPFS assessment is also approximately within 36 months.\n\nLastly, we have the recommended dose of YL201 for the pivotal clinical trial. This measure aims to determine the optimal dose of YL201 for further clinical development and helps establish its safety and efficacy profile. The time frame for assessing the recommended dose is approximately within 36 months.",

It provides valuable information on the proportion of patients who have stable disease or better response. The time frame for DCR assessment is approximately within 36 months.\n\nDuration of response (DoR) measures how long a patient's tumor responds to treatment before showing signs of progression. This measure reflects the sustainability of treatment efficacy. The time frame for assessing DoR is also approximately within 36 months.\n\nTime to objective response (TTR) measures the duration from the start of treatment to the first objective response. This provides insights into the speed of response to YL201. The time frame for assessing TTR is approximately within 36 months.\n\nThere are also other secondary outcome measures related to PSA response, overall survival, and pharmacokinetics.

The second secondary outcome measure is improvement in symptoms of atrial fibrillation, such as PVCs, palpitations, and the number and severity of atrial tachycardia episodes. How would you recommend we assess this measure, and what would be an appropriate time frame for evaluation?",

Higher heart rates are associated with higher levels of anxiety, so comparing the results of the STAI-YA questionnaire and the VAS with heart rate values can help validate the reliability of the primary measures. This would also provide insights into the physiological changes associated with the use of virtual reality to reduce anxiety during dental procedures. I think this approach would make the study stronger. What do you think?",

You can do this through a self-report survey where patients rate their satisfaction with the virtual reality intervention on a Likert scale.

The time frame for this measure would be just after the procedure. \nThose are great suggestions. Another secondary outcome measure could be to assess the amount of pain medication used during and after the procedure. This can be assessed using a Likert scale rating scale or a numerical scale. The difference between the amount of pain medication used before and after the virtual reality intervention can serve as an indicator of the effectiveness of virtual reality in reducing anxiety, which often leads to pain reduction.

Cost: We can assess the patient out-of-pocket cost to fill their VTE prophylaxis prescription on the day the script is filled. This will help us understand the financial burden associated with each medication and its potential impact on patient preference and adherence.\n2. Satisfaction as measured by NIH PROMIS Medication Adherence Scale (PMAS): We can use a validated scale like the NIH PROMIS PMAS to measure patient satisfaction with their VTE prophylaxis drug. This will provide comprehensive data on patient satisfaction, which can influence adherence rates and treatment preferences.\n3. Reasons for non-adherence: It would be valuable to investigate patient-reported issues with adherence from the day of discharge to post-operative day 30. This will help us identify potential barriers to treatment compliance and develop strategies to improve medication adherence.\n4. VTE rate: Monitoring the rate of venous thromboembolism events from the day of discharge to post-operative day 90 is critical for evaluating the efficacy of each drug in preventing VTE in bladder cancer patients.\n5. Bleeding rate: We should also evaluate the rate of major and minor bleeding events from the day of discharge to post-operative day 90 to assess the safety profile of each medication.",

You should always consult a professional for help in designing an outcome measure for your clinical trial.\nA clinical trial is a research study that provides objective data on safety, efficacy, and optimum dosage of a treatment. Clinical trial design relies heavily on the selection of a well-defined and validated outcome measure. There are several considerations when selecting an outcome measure for a clinical trial, such as the type of clinical trial, study population and aims, and cost among others [see Box 1]. An outcome measure is a tool used to measure change in an outcome of interest over time. It is essential to use a reliable tool that measures change appropriately. Furthermore, it is required to establish the tool's validity and reliability in the disease of interest. The International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use has provided guidelines for selecting and defining endpoints and harmonization of statistical methods for medical trials.2 These guidelines provide a framework to evaluate the selection of an outcome measure.\nWhen the aim of a study is to evaluate safety, the FDA recommend using adverse event (AE) assessment as an outcome measure. An AE being an unfavorable or unintended medical event temporally associated with the use of a medical intervention, such as a drug, device, or procedure, or with no known cause.3 AEs can be quantitative or qualitative scales. The preferred reporting of AE includes preferred terms, preferred terms, or non-preferred terms.\nWhen the aim of a study involves efficacy and evaluating treatment effects, the FDA recommends the use of a surrogate endpoint instead of an AE. A surrogate endpoint is a measure of the effect of a medical treatment, either an increase or a decrease, that is reasonably likely to predict health improvements or disease-related functional impairment.4 In addition, the FDA recommends defining the time and the duration over which the treatment effect is measured.\nConventional versus Novel Outcome Measure: Conventional outcome measures are well-validated, widely used, and have a long history of use, such as pain scales. These measures are",

By evaluating the rate of infectious complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, sepsis, and shock, the study can determine the effectiveness of immunonutrition in reducing these complications.\n- Time Frame: The time frame of 30 days after surgery is appropriate as it allows for the assessment of short-term outcomes related to infectious complications, providing valuable information on the immediate impact of immunonutrition on post-operative morbidity.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Outcome Measure: Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)\n- Measure Description: The CCI is a comprehensive measure that takes into account all post-operative complications, providing a more holistic view of the patient's overall complication burden. By assessing the CCI at 30 and 90 days after surgery, the study can evaluate the long-term impact of immunonutrition on complications beyond infectious outcomes.\n- Time Frame: The time frames of 30 and 90 days after surgery allow for the assessment of both short-term and medium-term outcomes, providing a more thorough evaluation of the effects of immunonutrition on post-operative complications over time.\n\n- Outcome Measure: Mortality rate\n- Measure Description: Assessing the mortality rate at 30 and 90 days after surgery is essential for understanding the impact of immunonutrition on patient survival following cystectomy. By evaluating mortality outcomes, the study can determine if immunonutrition has any effect on reducing the risk of death post-operatively.\n- Time Frame: The time frames of 30 and 90 days after surgery are appropriate for assessing short-term and medium-term mortality outcomes, providing valuable information on the potential benefits of immunonutrition in improving patient survival.\n\n- Outcome Measure: Complication-free survival rate\n- Measure Description: This outcome measure evaluates the rate of post-operative complication-free survival, providing valuable information on the overall success of the surgical procedure and the impact of immunonutrition on patient outcomes. By assessing complication-free survival at 90 days after surgery, the study can determine the long-term effects of immunonutrition on patient recovery.\n- Time Frame: The time frame of 90 days after surgery allows for a comprehensive evaluation of complication-free survival, capturing both short-term and medium-term outcomes related to post-operative recovery.\n\n- Outcome Measure: Treatment compliance rate\n- Measure Description: Assessing serum arginine levels before and after intake of the allocated nutrition provides insight into patient adherence to the prescribed immunonutrition regimen. Monitoring treatment compliance is essential for interpreting the study results accurately and ensuring that the intervention is being implemented as intended.\n- Time Frame: The time frames of between Day -30 and Day -10 for baseline assessment and at preoperative admission after intake of the allocated nutrition (Day -1) allow for the evaluation of treatment compliance at key time points in the study timeline, ensuring that patients are receiving the intervention as planned."

The primary outcome measure I would recommend is the evolution of the axSPA global activity score, which assesses the change in the BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index) score. This self-administered questionnaire evaluates the activity of the disease in terms of fatigue, pain, and stiffness. The time frame for this measure would be between the 2 month visit and the 5 month visit. What do you think about this measure?",

This means that the total burden in hours may be higher or lower than this estimate. We will submit a revised total burden estimate with our protocol. Keep in mind that there will be some overlap in these measures as some patients will be asked to complete more than one measure. We estimate a total of 1358 surveys to be completed per site with an average completion time of 5 minutes per survey for a total burden of 777 hours. 246 questionnaires to be mailed out with an estimated completion time of 15 minutes per questionnaire for a total burden of 38 hours. 24 subjects to be followed up every 3 months for 2 years with an estimated total burden of 240 visits.

Another possible measure could be changes in health-related quality of life as determined by an EORTC questionnaire over time among patients with a long-term response to regorafenib monotherapy for at least 5 months. EORTC is a leading organization for the development of questionnaire measures of health-related quality of life in various cancer populations. The EORTC QLQ-C30 survey includes 30 items assessing five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items of symptom distress, as well as global health status and satisfaction with treatment.

It was standardized on a sample of 380 typically developing boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 8. The BOT-2 SF is designed to provide an objective method to identify developmental motor problems. The BOT-2 SF assists in identifying those infants and children who are at risk for developmental delays and/or handicaps. Theoretical sampling reliability coefficients (r) for each of the 8 major group profiles are r = .80 to .95. Construct validity is demonstrated by significant negative correlations with chronological age (r = -.68 to -.78). The BOT-2 SF is a psychological and educational diagnostic tool which helps identify and stratify children for developmental monitoring and intervention programs. (McIntosh, 1982) Age group: Birth to 8 years Administration time: 15-20 minutes Score interpretation: Total raw scores on the overall test are converted, by reference tables, into age-equivalent scores. This age equivalent number corresponds to a T-score within the standard score. Standard and extended age-equivalent scores are presented as well as standard scores for the fine motor and combined scales. Scores for the subtests are also presented on the test report. A summary score providing an overall picture of motor proficiency is provided along with a profile of strengths and weaknesses on the test item level.

Materials are commonly provided through advertisements that are often placed in medical centers and hospitals, on Internet message boards, or in academic journals. When a patient is interested and meets all of the eligibility criteria, the screening instrument is used to assess whether or not the subject is eligible to participate.\nScreening criteria can be broad or specific and are dependent upon the nature of the clinical trial. Screening instruments may be a combination of medical history and operational criteria that must be met for participation. The screening instrument may also be used to weed out participants based upon their inability or unwillingness to meet certain parameters.\nSomeone who does not pass the screening instrument must do so before being considered for enrollment. The screening process may consist of a telephone conversation guided by a script to assess eligibility and whether or not the subject is motivated to participate.\nAn interview or meeting may be conducted to obtain both written and verbal consent.\nWhen contacting potential participants, assuring the privacy of the subject as well as maintaining the safety of the subject is of utmost importance.\nInformed consent is a legal requirement that is a prerequisite before any scientific, medical, or research intervention can be performed on any subject. Obtaining informed consent is an ethical requirement by an institutional review board (IRB) and falls under the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. \nA signed, written document is maintained by the investigator to document informed consent.

It is a 5-meters-walkway mat that presents the total time to walk 5 meters as well as a score for each of the four variables: Timing in seconds: 0. First timestep, 0. Second and third steppartnership, Step symmetry and speed variability; Total score ranges between 0 to 60. I created an example of a CAG-S protocol that you can use for your study. It is a gold criterion measure that will allow a strong validation of your device. It also has good interrater and intrarater reliability. The total time is the time taken for the subject to complete the 5 meter walkway. This variable is obtained by measuring the time of the sound signal generation, and the time the foot actually touches the floor. The first step time is the time between the sound of the first foot striking the ground and the second foot leaving the ground. The second and third step partnership variables refer to the time that it takes for the second and third feet to complete its action in relation to the first foot. The subject cannot begin the next foot strike until the first foot has completed its entire cycle. The foot may be lifted from the ground in between steps, but the total cycle time includes this time. The step symmetry variable is an estimation of the time relationship between the right and left feet in the initiation of both the first step and the partnership steps.

            "Thank you for providing all the necessary information. Now, let's discuss the outcome measures. Based on the details of your study, I have identified several outcome measures. The primary outcome measure is the intensity of postoperative pain. The measure description is the Pain Intensity short form questionnaire (PROMIS), which assesses pain intensity over a 24-hour recall period. This measure will be evaluated 24 hours after the surgery.",
            "That's a great suggestion! Assessing the intensity of postoperative pain with a longer recall period of 7 days will provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the sustained analgesic effects of the interventions. We can continue using the Pain Intensity short form questionnaire (PROMIS) for this measure as well.",
            "Absolutely! Monitoring the total morphine consumption is crucial in assessing the effectiveness of the interventions and their impact on opioid usage. Lower morphine consumption may indicate better pain control and reduced opioid-related side effects. I think this outcome measure will provide valuable insights into the analgesic effects of the interventions.",
            "That's a great point. The time to first opioid dose is an important measure as it reflects the efficiency of the interventions in providing prompt pain relief. A shorter time interval may indicate rapid pain control, which is crucial for the postoperative recovery of the patients.",
            "I completely agree. Monitoring pain levels at frequent intervals will provide us with a detailed analysis of the efficacy of the interventions in maintaining pain control over time. Understanding the fluctuations in pain intensity can help us tailor analgesic strategies and optimize patient comfort during the immediate postoperative period.",
            "That's an important measure to ensure patient safety. Assessing complications and adverse effects will help us monitor the tolerability of the interventions and promptly manage any potential risks associated with the analgesic techniques.",
            "That's a great addition. Evaluating the quality of sleep will provide insights into the impact of postoperative pain management on patient sleep patterns. It's an essential aspect of postoperative recovery and overall patient well-being.",
            "Excellent suggestion! The QoR15 questionnaire is a validated tool that can provide a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of recovery after surgery and anesthesia. This measure will allow us to assess multiple recovery domains and capture the overall success of the interventions in promoting patient well-being.",
            "I completely agree. Evaluating patient satisfaction is crucial as it reflects the patient's subjective experience and perception of the interventions. Understanding patient satisfaction will provide us with valuable insights into the acceptability and effectiveness of the analgesic techniques, guiding future clinical practice and patient-centered care.",

However we cannot measure RFS for bile duct cancer. For bile duct cancer, a better measure of long-term outcomes could be overall survival, which is the time from surgery to death, not including causes other than disease recurrence. 3 years is still a reasonable time frame for overall survival for bile duct cancer too since it's a relatively rare cancer. I think we should aim for 5 years of follow-up for overall survival for bile duct cancer. 3 years is enough for overall survival for pancreatic, liver, and ampullary cancer, and for bile duct cancer, we can aim for 5 years.

Participants: Female adolescents with emotional and behavioral problems between 13 and 18 years old. Exclusions: Severely mentally ill patients (e.g., psychotic disorders, acute suicidality, active substance abuse); currently pregnant or lactating female; unable to speak or understand English; current caregiver unable to participate in intervention. Intervention: The ProSavvy Program: a manualized, group-based, manual-assisted CBEM intervention with 12 weekly sessions of 90 minutes each. Components include psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, goal-setting, stress and anger management, relaxation techniques, and relapse prevention. Control condition: Caregiver management as usual (usual care), which may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both. Measures: Primary outcomes: Difficulty index of the Youth Problem-Solving Inventory (YPI); Peabody Caregiver- Youth Agreement Scale; the Multidimensional Assessment of Problem Solving; and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT); Secondary outcomes: Beck Hopkins Symptoms Checklist for DSM-5 (BHS) - 30-item, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) - 24-item; Columbia-Suicide Severity Scale (C-SSS) - 11 items; Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) - 13 items; Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) - 10 items; Child Depression Inventory - 25-items; Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) - 20-item; Intervention expectancy and adher",

            "Yes, that's perfect. We can start measuring weight right after the baseline visit and again after 2 months. Great. Next, what about secondary outcomes? What will you measure to evaluate the effects of the interventions on other aspects of health such as body composition, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels?",
            "Of course! Measures of blood lipids are important for assessing the risk of cardiovascular disease. High cholesterol levels can increase the risk for heart disease. The fasting plasma lipid profile should include the following measures. Total cholesterol, Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the \"bad\" cholesterol that can form plaque on the walls of arteries), and High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the \"good\" cholesterol that can help remove excess cholesterol from the blood). The ideal total cholesterol level for adults is less than 200 mg/dL, and the ideal LDL cholesterol level for adults is less than 100 mg/dL. Triglycerides, or blood fats, also should be tested. These are the primary constituents of body fat and usually are measured as part of the total cholesterol test. They can be elevated in people who are overweight or who consume a lot of carbohydrates. If triglycerides, LDL, and/or total cholesterol are not yet high, but elevated levels are a family trait, it probably is best to have this condition checked repeatedly (every 3 - 5 years). A measure of blood sugar(glucose) also is warranted. Abnormal blood glucose levels can be an early sign of diabetes. There are various ways to measure blood glucose. The A1c test reflects your average blood sugar level over the prior 2 - 3 months. The test measures the percentage of hemoglobin in your blood that's coated with sugar. An A1c level of 6.5 percent or less is normal; 7.0 - 6.4 percent indicates prediabetes; and 6.5 percent or higher indicates diabetes. More-intensive screening, such as repeated A1c testing or the fasting plasma glucose test, is recommended for people who have any of the risk factors for blood glucose disorders. Other blood tests include serum insulin and pro\u00adinsulin levels, which help to diagnose insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes",

Blood Hormone - Adiponectin Level: We can monitor the adiponectin level through blood tests at the visit intervals. The range of measurement would be 2-37 ug/mL.\n\n5. Blood inflammation: We can monitor various markers of inflammation in the blood, including Zonulin, ApoB-48, hsCRP, LPS, sCD14, IL-6, MCP-1, and Angptl4. These measurements will be taken at the visit intervals.\n\n6. Feces SCFA: We can measure the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces at the visit intervals to assess changes in gut microbiota composition and function.\n\n7. Feces sIgA: We can measure the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in feces at the visit intervals to evaluate the mucosal immune response and gut barrier function.\n\n8.

For your information, secondary outcome measure is a measure that provides additional information about the effect of an intervention but is not a major focus of the study. In a clinical trial, the secondary outcome measures are generally considered as a supportive measure. They help justify the major outcomes and provide more information about the general well-being of the participants.

Here's a possible description of the Primary Events-Free Survival measure: \"The primary outcome measure is event-free survival, assessed by imaging or in-person visit at 6, 12, and 18 months post-randomization. An 'event' is defined as any of the following: disease progression, recurrence, or death from any cause.\" That looks good. Now, let's continue to brainstorm additional outcome measures that could be used in the study. Are there any other important parameters to evaluate?",
            "Definitely. You could consider a measure of overall survival, which would assess the percentage of patients alive without disease progression or recurrence at specified follow-up times. Additionally, you may want to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of Abrelimab and Apatinib by assessing the proportion of patients with pathological complete response at biopsy or the response rate to therapy.  These measures would be assessed at multiple time points after the initiation of treatment, and you may need to consider a time window in which the patient may be considered eligible for the trial. What do you think?",
            "Another measure to consider is the incidence of adverse events, such as chemotherapy-induced toxicity or drug-induced liver injury. Assessing the incidence of adverse events would help us to identify any potential complications associated with the treatment intervention and to monitor the safety of the treatment. Additionally, it would be valuable to assess the change in health-related quality-of-life measures, such as theEQ-5D-5L, to evaluate the effect of the treatment on the patients' health-related quality of life. How about including those measures as well?",
            "In summary, to design a clinical trial outcome measure, we can start by identifying the treatment's aims and essential components. We then need to determine the study population and the timing and duration of follow-up. Finally, we must decide on the type and duration of the outcome measures to monitor. A discussion with key stakeholders such as the FDA, funding agencies, and the trial steering committee is necessary to ensure the practicality of the planned measures.",

Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify?",
            "Absolutely. For the first secondary outcome measure, I recommend assessing the R0 resection rate. This measure evaluates the success of the surgical intervention in achieving a complete resection of the tumor with negative margins. A high R0 resection rate is crucial for improving the chances of long-term disease control and survival. The time frame for monitoring the R0 resection rate would also be up to approximately 3 years. What do you think?",
            "Another important secondary outcome measure to consider is event-free survival (EFS). This measure provides a broader assessment of the treatment's efficacy in preventing disease recurrence, progression, or death from any cause. Similar to the primary outcome measure, monitoring EFS up to approximately 3 years allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the treatment's impact on the patients' overall disease control and survival outcomes. Additionally, we can include recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) as outcome measures. RFS specifically focuses on evaluating the treatment's effectiveness in preventing disease recurrence, while OS evaluates the treatment's impact on the patients' long-term survival outcomes. Both RFS and OS would be monitored up to approximately 3 years. What are your thoughts on these secondary outcome measures?",

The adminstration time is 7 minutes per subject, and the measure description is: \"The PoData plate is placed under the right foot and the patient will push down until a \u2018one-kilo-force\u2019 pressure is reached or felt (about 250 newtons), at which the plate produces a 14mm displacement. This is a reliable indicator of the static plantar pressure distribution of the human body. With practice the subject will typically reach steady balance and the plate displacement will remain under control. The plate has a resolution of 0.1mm, which offers a high degree of accuracy.\" Couldn't you also include a measure of motor function? Yes, that's true, and based on your previous research interests, I suggest including the Functional Ambulation Profile as the measure of motor function.

This could involve administering specific questionnaires related to illness awareness and comparing the responses before and after the intervention. We can also track the changes weekly for up to 4 weeks post-intervention. This will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the intervention in improving illness awareness over time. What do you think about this suggestion?",
            "The time frame for assessing illness awareness can be divided into three points: pre-intervention, immediately following the intervention, and weekly for up to 4 weeks post-intervention. By collecting data at these time points, we can track the changes in illness awareness over time and evaluate the long-term effects of the intervention. This time frame will provide a comprehensive understanding of the treatment's impact on illness awareness. Do you have any other ideas or suggestions?",

This can be done using functional imaging techniques such as fMRI. By comparing baseline measurements with post-intervention measurements, we can investigate how non-invasive neuromodulation affects neural processes related to illness awareness in schizophrenia. This will provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of the intervention. What do you think about this suggestion?",

            "That's a great idea! The Lawton Activities of Daily Living Scale is also a very popular assessment for its clinical utility and responsiveness to change. The measure specifically analyzes an individual's activity independence in six domains: bathing, dressing, grooming, transferring, walking, and eating. The scale ranges from 0 to 24 points, with 0-8 points classified as dependent, 9-16 points as semi-dependent, and 17-24 points as independent. This measure allows for quick and easy measurement of an individual's functional status. I think a 12-week time frame would be appropriate for this measure as well. Now that we have selected our primary and secondary outcome measures, we need to develop a study plan. The first step will be to randomize the participants evenly into two groups: treatment and control. The treatment group will receive the Hypervolt device, while the control group will receive a sham device that looks and feels like the actual device but does not deliver therapeutic voltage. We will then follow up with the participant at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 to evaluate changes in the primary and secondary outcome measures using intention-to-treat analysis. In conclusion, this study protocol outlines the study design for a randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy of the Hypervolt device in treating shoulder impingement syndrome.",

You're right, a weekly measurement for 12 weeks is appropriate. Other measures that we may consider using as secondary outcome measures might include the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Constant-Murley Score (CMS). The Shoulder Disability Questionnaire assesses the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living and sports-related activities, and ranges from 0-100 points, with higher scores indicating better function. The Constant-Murley Score is a 10-point numeric rating scale that measures pain, function, and overhead activity. It is used to assess the effects of shoulder impingement syndrome. Both of these measures can provide valuable information on the effectiveness of the treatment interventions.",

Although I recognize that the intent of these measures is to capture change, I am concerned that in a clinic setting, very few study participants will achieve 100% motion at baseline.  It is also important that the minimum and maximum scores within each group are included in the study report.\nIf I were your IRB, I would require you to add an additional measure for each of these outcomes, ensuring that scores greater than 0 and less than 100 are assessed. You can use existing measures from the NIH Toolbox Physical Activity and Exercise Scale or the Physical Functioning Scale that includes items such as \"I had to stop because I was out of breath\" or \"During the past week, I found it hard to do my usual activities\" from the Medical Outcomes Trust SF-6Dv2. Alternatively, you can request IRB approval to have study participants verbally describe how much trouble, in comparison to usual, they had with each measure, allowing you to summarize your results later.\nI can't say for sure that the addition of these measures would change the outcome of your IRB review, but please be prepared to defend your sample size if these measures are reviewed. I would also recommend adding a time frame for follow-up assessment to ensure participants are not engaging in exercise beyond the 8 weeks of the study.

            "The Nurse Cultural Competence Scale is a suitable measure to evaluate the cultural competence levels of nurses. By using this scale, you'll be able to assess the impact of the bibliotherapy method on enhancing nurses' cultural competence over the 12-week period.",
            "For assessing the knowledge of cultural differences, you could develop a self-administered questionnaire consisting of multiple-choice questions related to cultural practices, beliefs, and values of different cultures. This measure will help evaluate the nurses' understanding and awareness of cultural diversity. It would be ideal to administer this questionnaire before the intervention and at the end of the study, which is 12 weeks.",
            "I suggest using the Healthcare Provider Cultural Competence Instrument, which consists of 15 items measuring attitudes towards cross-cultural nursing care on a 5-point Likert scale. This instrument can effectively capture nurses' attitudes towards engaging with diverse patient populations. Similar to the knowledge measure, it would be beneficial to administer this instrument before the intervention and at the end of the study, which is 12 weeks.",
            "You're welcome! It's important to have a comprehensive assessment of both knowledge and attitudes towards cross-cultural nursing care. These secondary outcome measures will provide valuable information about the impact of the intervention on nurses' understanding and attitudes.",
            "You're welcome! I'm glad I could assist you in designing the outcome measures for your trial. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your study!"

Let's review the criteria that the outcomes in this study meet:\nOutcomes should be meaningful to those involved in the study and to the healthcare system. Here, the outcomes address the healthcare system's need for reducing readmission rates, and the patients' need to improve their functional capacity and quality of life.\nOutcomes should represent meaningful changes from baseline. All of the measures in this study represent meaningful changes from baseline (weight loss, decreased malnutrition, improved function, etc.).\nOutcomes should reliably and validly measure what they are intended to measure. Here, the measures have established reliability and validity in measuring their respective constructs.\nOutcomes should be feasible to assess during the study course and not overly burdensome for participants. While the 30-day hospital readmission is a meaningful outcome, it may not be feasible for all participants to provide the necessary information, so the 1-year readmission may be a more appropriate outcome for the study.\nOutcomes should be objectively measured. Here, the measures are objective (weight, malnutrition score, functional capacity, etc.), not subject to bias.\nOutcomes should be timely measures. The study's duration of 1 year is necessary to assess longer-term changes, such as readmission rates.\nThe process of item generation can be contentious when there are numerous stakeholders involved and multiple perspectives. This step should not be rushed, but instead, take the time needed to work through each item, discussing the evidence and rationale in depth where necessary.\nOnce the interventionalist has identified the key outcomes, they can start to develop the data elements need to measure each outcome. Data elements include the exact wording of the measure, any necessary exclusions or modifiers, timing of assessment (including intervals), the population (e.g., all patients, a cross-section of patients pre-discharging"

For that, I would recommend measuring the drug concentration in the blood at different time intervals up to 4 hours after dosing. This way, we can determine the exposure and efficacy of ND-003 in the body. Do you have any other ideas?",

The PK study will be conducted 2-3 times after a single oral dose and once before the first cycle of multiple administrations (7-14 days). This is necessary to determine the optimal dosing regimen and to confirm that ND-003 is being absorbed and distributed properly. Do you have other suggestions for primary outcome measures?",
            "Great! All of these outcome measures sound like good primary measures to use.",
            "Of course. Here's a list of the proposed secondary outcome measures: Plasma level of ND-003: Time-weighted average concentration over time will be measured on Days 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Plasma level of ND-003: Maximum observed plasma concentration will be measured on Day 1 after the first dose and at days 1 and 2 after multiple doses. Changes in performance status: Assessment will be made at baseline, Day 29, and Day 57. In case of multiple doses, assessment will be done after each dose. Efficacy of ND-003: Assessment will be made by measuring the time to progression of disease and/or radiographic parameters such as tumor size, lesion number, and location on imaging study/x-ray. Adverse events: Detection of adverse events will be done throughout the study and graded according to frequency and severity. Blood chemistry: Parameters to be measured will be alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and creatinine clearance. Urine analysis: To measure the concentration of urinary metabolites of ND-003. Blood flow rate: Measured using Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tracer concentration in tumor.\nWould you like me to run through the entire protocol for you?",

Based on the trial details, I suggest considering parameters related to the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of ND-003. These measures will provide valuable insights into the drug's absorption, distribution, elimination, and overall efficacy. What do you think?",
            "Certainly! For the pharmacokinetic parameters, we can consider measuring the maximum concentration (Cmax) of ND-003, which reflects the drug's absorption rate and bioavailability. We can also assess the time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax), which indicates the drug's onset of action. Additionally, we can measure the elimination half-life (t1/2) and clearance (CL/F) of ND-003, which provide information on the drug's elimination rate and systemic exposure. Assessments for these parameters will be conducted at various time points up to 72 hours after a single dose administration.",
            "Yes, for the efficacy of ND-003, we can consider measuring the objective response rate (ORR), which assesses the tumor response to treatment based on RECIST criteria. This measure will provide insights into the drug's preliminary efficacy. We can also measure progression-free survival (PFS), which evaluates the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death. Lastly, we can measure overall survival (OS), which assesses the overall survival of patients from randomization until death from any cause. These measures will help evaluate the drug's impact on disease progression and overall survival. Assessments for ORR, PFS, and OS will occur from baseline through up to 6 cycles or until disease progression.",

            "Thank you for providing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These will help us in defining the study population and eligibility criteria. Now, let's focus on designing the outcome measures. We can start with the primary outcome measure. Do you have any specific ideas or requirements for the primary outcome measure?",
            "That's a great suggestion! Assessing the number of patients amendable to curative surgical interventions is indeed a crucial outcome measure. It provides a clear indication of the effectiveness of the combined therapy in making patients eligible for potentially curative procedures such as resection, transplantation, or ablation. We can measure this outcome from the date of first treatment to the date of last treatment, with an average time frame of 3 years. Does that sound reasonable to you?",
            "Excellent! Now let's move on to the secondary outcome measures. We have several options to consider based on the study objectives and the nature of the treatment. We can start with the overall response rate (ORR) measured by mRECIST criteria. What are your thoughts on including this measure?",
            "I completely agree. The overall response rate (ORR) is a standard measure of treatment response in oncology trials. By using the mRECIST criteria, which are specifically designed for assessing treatment response in hepatocellular carcinoma, we can accurately evaluate the treatment's impact on tumor regression. We can measure ORR from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST, with an assessment period of up to 3 years. How does that sound?",
            "Great! Now let's continue with the other secondary outcome measures. We have options such as time to progression (TTP), time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), incidence of study-related adverse events, pathological response, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response, and quality of life (QoL) after treatment. Which measures would you like to include?",
            "That's an excellent choice! Including all of those measures will give us a comprehensive understanding of the treatment's effectiveness and impact on different aspects of patient outcomes. We can measure time to progression (TTP), time to intrahepatic tumor progression (TTITP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression or death from any cause. Incidence of study-related adverse events can be measured from the date of first treatment to 90 days after the last treatment. Pathological response can be assessed from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented progression or death from any cause, with an assessment period of up to 5 years. Disease control rate (DCR) can be measured from the date of first treatment to radiographically documented response according to mRECIST, assessed up to 3 years. Duration of response can be defined as the time from first documented evidence of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the first documented sign of disease progression (PD) or death from any cause. Lastly, quality of life (QoL) after treatment can be assessed from the date of first follow-up to radiographically documented progression or death from any cause, up to 3 years. How does this sound?",

These measures are self-reported and self-assessed at each of the assessment time points. Mild symptoms of depression and/or anxiety are quite common among individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). It is expected that the intervention will lead to reductions in anxiety and depression. Depression is a known correlate of poor quality of life in people with MS. Anxiety, although not as well studied, may also be a correlate of poor quality of life in MS. The study is aimed at reducing symptom levels of anxiety and depression, therefore these outcomes are the focus of the main analyses.  Psychological distress The Self-Report Questionnaire 20+ (SRQ 20+) The primary outcome measure will be self-reported mental well-being at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks. The SRQ 20+ is a measure of self-reported psychological distress. It is a shortened version of the original Social Readout Questionnaire, with 20 items rated on a 4-point scale. It is a measure of general emotional distress, with good psychometric properties and is widely used for research and clinical purposes.  Worry The primary outcome measure will be self-reported worry. Worry will be assessed via the Worry Questionnaire (Worry-B), a 4-item measure of anxiety. This is a widely used measure in clinical and research settings. Individuals rate their past 7-day level of worry on a scale from 0 to 4. The scale provides a total anxiety score for each assessment. It has good psychometric properties.  Physical Measures Physical health The primary outcome measure for physical health is the self-report Primary Outcome Measure (POM), which is derived from a series of self-report questions relating to MS disease characteristics, medication and comorbidities. The POM is based on questions from the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS\u00ae) developed by NIH. The PROMIS items on which the Primary Outcome Measure (POM) is based",

The PES assesses the degree to which pain has interfered with daily activities. The GSES is a measure of self-efficacy with respect to performing activities and tasks. The UWSES-MS is a measure of MS-specific self-efficacy beliefs. The BFIMS is a measure of individuals' ability to find benefit in the stressful experiences related to MS. The SWLS is a measure of individuals' perception of their own well-being. The RYFFPWB is a measure of the positive valence, in addition to the negative valence, in people's lives.",

When developing outcome measures, consider the level of burden to the participant (time, cost, inconvenience, risk, or discomfort), the ability to link the measures to the intervention, the face validity (conceptual fit) of the measures, the sensitivity to change, and the feasibility of implementation. Keep in mind that the choice of measures needs to keep the participant's perspective in mind as much as possible.\nThe unit of analysis in clinical trials is the individual participant, and all outcome measures should be closely linked to the individual participants. For this reason, individual-level rather than group-level measures are typically used in clinical trials. The following tips are provided for developing individual-level outcome measures:\nConceptual clarity: Develop an outcome measure that reflects the intervention's hypothesized mechanism of action.\nValidity and reliability: Aim for a balance of validity and reliability. Choose measures that have demonstrated validity in similar populations and settings, and choose measures that can be assessed in a consistent and reliable manner.\nFeasibility of measurement: Consider the burden of measurement to the participant, including type of assessment (interviewer-administered, self-report, observed), frequency and timing of measurement, staff training needs, data storage and retrieval, and financial costs.\nSensitivity to change: Choose measures that are sensitive to the intervention's effect.\nFactorial validity: Consider the factorial validity of the measure, so that if applicable, factors can be considered in analysis.\nDifferential item functioning: Ascertain that there are no racial or ethnic differences in interpretation of the measure.\nResponse style: Ascertain that responses are not confounded by individual differences in level of education, motivation, and intelligence.\nResponse set: Minimize confounding by extraneous responses.

The ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing, dressing, and walking, is important in determining patient outcomes following discharge from skilled care. There are many tools that can be used to assess ADLs and they are often used to assess the patient's preparedness before discharge from skilled care. One of the most widely used is the Katz Index of Independence in ADLs. This is a simple tool that evaluates a patient's ability to perform eight ADLs on a scale of 1 (no help required) to 4 (patient requires assistance). Another useful tool is the MDS Level of Functioning assessment, which is used to assess a patient's level of cognitive or physical impairment and can estimate their ability to recover. To assess quality of life following the intervention, we can use a tool called the Nottingham Quality of Life Profile, which assesses five domains: physical, social, emotional, cognitive, and spiritual. This questionnaire rates each domain on a one to five scale. When used in conjunction with other measures of patient functioning, such as the Katz Index, it is a useful tool to evaluate the benefits of the intervention. Measuring caregiver outcomes is an important component of the study as it will help determine the impact the intervention had on the caregiver's life as well as to provide information to develop future interventions. Caregiver burden is a critical factor in assessing the outcomes associated with providing care for someone with dementia and can be assessed with a tool like the Burden Interview. Burden is measured in the context of the resources expended to provide care, the impact on the caregiver's daily life, and the level of satisfaction with the caregiving experience. Caregiver distress can be measured with the Geriatric Depression scale, an 11-item instrument used to detect depression in the elderly population. Caregiver sense of competence can be assessed with the Burden Interview or the Caregiver Competencies Survey. Caregivers' perception of the value of the intervention to their lives can be measured with the Satisfaction With Care Instrument. How should we best proceed? Is",

It includes 12 items on a five-point scale and measures the caregiver's perceptions of the adverse effects of caregiving on their emotional, social, financial, physical, and spiritual functioning. Higher scores on the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale indicate greater burden. For caregiver distress, we can use the Distress Thermometer, which includes one item on an 11-point scale measuring negative affect related to caregiving.

            "Absolutely. The FES-I is an excellent measure to evaluate the effect of the AERO program on reducing fear of falling and improving overall quality of life. With this added measure, we can fully capture the benefits of the intervention. Now, let's move on to the study design and recruitment. As this is a randomized controlled trial, we need a minimum of 80 participants per group to have 80% power to detect a significant difference in the proportion of participants adhering to the AERO program between the treatment and control groups at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. We'll need 895 patients (447 per arm) to provide statistical power of 80% with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 for this effect size. Given that dropout rates are commonly higher in the control group, we'll need to enroll 1,035 patients to account for 15% dropout between three and 12 months. 925 patients will be needed to include at least 447 in the control group and 488 in the intervention group to balance the numbers between the groups. Since the intervention is of reasonable length (12 weeks), our sample size calculations don't need to account for continued follow-up beyond 12 weeks, but we'll keep the sample size calculations conservative and include additional time points to account for follow-up losses if needed. 760 subjects would need to be screened to enroll 925 eligible subjects, so we'll need to devote significant time and resources to identify an optimal study population and implement an efficient screening process. We also need to consider the cost of training the study personnel and implementing the intervention. With the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined, do you think we still have a total sample size that is sufficiently Powered? Do you have any additional suggestions for how we might improve the design or recruitment of participants? \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd",

Another important measure to consider is the evaluation of treatment efficacy in improving kyphosis angle. One way to evaluate this is by using radiographic measurements of the pre- and post-treatment kyphosis angle. By comparing the kyphosis angle before and after the treatment, we can determine if the porous titanium microspheres are effective in correcting the deformity.

By evaluating the reduction in kyphosis through the segmental Cobb angle, we can quantify the structural changes in the vertebral body post-treatment. A time frame of 3 months should be sufficient to track the early effects of porous titanium microspheres on spinal alignment. Additionally, assessing the rate of patients with dislocation of the sphere is crucial for evaluating the safety and efficacy of the treatment.

These markers may include, but are not limited to, LDH, C3, C4, and albumin levels. 6) Incidence of adverse effects, which will be recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria.",

We can measure this using commonly available tests such as the 6-minute walk test and the functional impairment assessment test. The 6-minute walk test is a test of aerobic endurance used to measure the change in 6-minute walking distance over time. The functional impairment assessment test is a timed test to measure the ability to perform physical tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, and lifting objects.

The Timed-Up and Go test assesses mobility and balance in a 30-second period. The 10-meter walk test assesses gait and balance over a distance. The one-leg standing balance test assesses static balance. The time frame for these measures will be at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow-up visits.",
            "For the balance test, the Timed Up and Go test is a commonly used measure of static-dynamic balance in elderly individuals. It involves performing a timed chair-to-standing task, with the participants being instructed to keep as upright as possible for 10 seconds, as well as standing up from a seated position without using arms for support. The test is performed in standing and in three different positions: normal stance, forward, and tandem. This test has been shown to be a sensitive and specific measure of static and dynamic balance in elderly persons. It needs to be administered in three different positions because the lateral static balance tends to be better in front than in the other positions and dynamic balance is better in the back position, so it's important to test in all conditions. We usually perform the test at 0, 6, and 12 months. Does this time frame sound appropriate?",

The trial will include 4 arms with an equal number of patients in each group and 20 participants in each center. The different arms involve Mirabegron 50mg, Mirabegron 100mg, Mirabegron 50mg followed by 100mg, and placebo. This is a standard three-arm parallel-group comparison trial that will assess the effectiveness of Mirabegron in treating OAB.

The three factors are: 1) participants will be masked - neither the participant nor the investigator will know which treatment is being given (they use the term \"triple masking\" when it is applied to both participant and investigator); 2) blinding of the treatment allocation concealment process, which means that the person(s) responsible for product allocation will be masked; 3) blinding of the investigator, so the investigator does not know which treatment group the participant is in.\nA crossover trial is an observational study where one of the phases is an interventional trial, i.e, an RCT. If the crossover phase is used as the main analysis when the treatment effects are the same for both treatments, this type of study is considered a type of equivalence trial. Not all RCTs are crossover trials. The term may only be used when there is a realistic possibility that the treatments being studied have similar effects, i.e, their intended uses are the same.\nA RCT nested within a trial is any randomized controlled trial where a subset of the study population is randomly assigned to an active treatment arm within the larger study design. For example, an open-label RCT for the treatment of a particular medical condition is nested within a larger open-label trial to evaluate the same treatment for other conditions. As with all RCTs, allocation concealment must be considered. However, in contrast to stand-alone RCTs, the sample size is usually smaller.

Based on the information provided, I suggest using validated scales to measure vaccination attitude (confidence or hesitancy) for different subpopulations. This could include the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines Survey - Short Form (PACV-SF), Emory Vaccine Confidence Index (EVCI), Vaccination Confidence Scale (VCS), and Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale (VAX). These scales can be used to assess vaccine confidence over a 6-month period for caregivers of young children, caregivers of older pediatric patients, adult patients, and clinical workers/health professionals. What do you think of this suggestion?",
            "Great! Now let's move on to the secondary outcome measures. Based on the goals of the study, I suggest including measures related to missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs) and vaccination rates. For missed opportunities, we can analyze well visit completion rates before and after the intervention in different subpopulations such as adult patients and pediatric patients. We can also track the total number of well clinic visits at baseline and analyze changes over a 6-month period. Additionally, monitoring vaccination rates in different subpopulations over the same 6-month period will provide valuable information on the overall impact of the intervention. What are your thoughts on these secondary outcome measures?",
            "Excellent! To summarize, the outcome measures for the clinical trial on group intervention for vaccine confidence are as follows:\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n- Vaccine confidence scale(s): Measured by validated scales such as PACV-SF, EVCI, VCS, and VAX. This measure will assess vaccination attitude (confidence or hesitancy) over a 6-month period for different subpopulations.\n\nSecondary Outcome Measures:\n- Missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs): Analyzing well visit completion rates before and after the intervention, as well as changes in total well clinic visits over a 6-month period.\n- Vaccination rates: Monitoring vaccination rates in different subpopulations over a 6-month period.\n\nThese outcome measures will help evaluate the impact of the group intervention on vaccine confidence and vaccination outcomes.
