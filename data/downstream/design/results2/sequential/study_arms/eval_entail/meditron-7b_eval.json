            "Thank you very much.\n[HYP] I would like to talk more about the research aims and goals. Can we meet at my lab again?\nIn our next meeting, we will have the following things to discuss:\n1. We will be creating a timeline of the study. We have 16 weeks before the beginning of the intervention in week 23. I would like to know by the next meeting what the students need to do at this point and in what time frame\nThey will be working on finalizing the intervention. I propose we will be holding 2 meetings per week, one to review the control site and one to move forward in refining the intervention.\n2. We will have a discussion about the control site and how to move forward with the control site vs. the other site. This is particularly important as we discuss the time when the intervention takes places. For the purposes of having a control site, having both a control and active site in operation concurrently is too difficult. It sounds like you would prefer to complete the data gathering at one site and start the intervention a few months later, after completing the baseline and follow-up assessments at the control site, to minimize contamination.\n3. We will discuss our time schedule and work plan. Since the study requires approval from the University and Health Research Board, approval will most likely take at least 6 weeks but possibly even up to 2 months, after which we can start recruiting. So I would like to know what you think about the timeline of the study.\n[HYP]\nI would like to discuss the intervention, as well. I think that the interventions we are providing in each of the 14 intervention sites should be different. If we decide to keep it this way, some kind of intervention comparison or effect modification should be specified.\nOne thought is to provide one version of the intervention for the active sites and a different version for the control sites. This could be a randomized cluster comparison. This would be a form of effect modification.\nAnother effect modification could be to keep the intervention consistent across all 14 sites but provide education to the study staff with the active sites to ensure intervention fidelity and adherence and to the study staff with the control sites to ensure the intervention is delivered in a consistent manner. This could be done during",

We hope this article will help you to improve this protocol and make it better. .\nA 66-year-old male underwent a successful mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position during mitral valvotomy. The operation was performed only with general anesthesia at a general hospital without cardiopulmonary bypass machine. The intravertebral air (IVA) technique was not applied to this case, although this technique is one of the standard method for general anesthesia during open-heart surgery under deep anesthesia without cardiopulmonary bypass. We believe that the IVA technique was not applied because of the following two reasons: (1) the patient did not complain any respiratory disturbances or hypoxemia after the operation, and (2) the patient's age was a little too high. We report the case, and discuss the reasons in order of age and the patient's body, whether IVA should be applied for elderly patients needing general anesthesia without cardiopulmonary bypass during open-heart surgery in the mitral position or not. For the IVA technique, we should observe closely the patient from the standpoint of age and vital signs. The general anesthesia for patients over 70 years old in the mitral position needs an IVA technique as a standard method.

            "PB-718? What is it for? A genetic tool for the analysis of ecdysone regulatory networks through manipulation of ecdysone receptor coactivator expression.\nIn Drosophila, juvenile hormones (JHs) and ecdysteroids (ECDs) comprise a pair of related hormones in circulation. ECD titer acts in concert with transcription factors  to modulate molting and metamorphosis. The activation of transcription by the nuclear receptors EcR/HR36, USP, E75, FTZ, and BR-C involves the formation of a protein complex with the p160 family member Tra1 or Tra2 (Tr1/2), the histone acetyltransferase Hat1, and the coactivator Mediator (MED). In the current model for the molecular organization of the JH signaling pathway, JHR ligand binding leads to the dissociation of DCO, a JH-dependent multiprotein complex containing Puc and MED. JHR-DCO dissociation results in the loss of the transcriptional activity of JHR, suggesting a functional analog between JHR pathway and the ECD pathway; however, the molecular interactions underlying the JHR pathway remain elusive. Here we show that, as seen with the ECD pathway, transcriptional regulation of Tr1/2 and MED by ECD acts to stabilize the p160 nuclear receptor complex at the ECD response element. These data provide new insight into the JHR pathway, and this system has potential for testing the function of various components, such as DCO, in JHR signaling.

The device can be surgically implanted like a pacemaker or inserted in the nostril like a device to treat allergies, and it must be designed to be inert and nonactive.

Regarding the practical aspects: </b> The Fate of Fresh and Aged Nanotubes after Being Engulfed into Different Types of Human Cells and Their Implications for Potential Use in Bone Tissue Engineering.\nThe fate of materials after being engulfed for human cells has long been of great interest to scientists and engineers alike. To date, this topic has typically been confined to the cellular uptake of polymers and to the ensuing mechanisms by which they are degraded within cells and cleared out. In this paper, we first study our experimental and computational protocols to determine the degree to which these can be used to study the fate of nanomaterials after being engulfed by cells. We observe a lack of fidelity in the results as well as some issues with data collection and analysis, particularly with cells that are highly metabolic. We then report the fates of three types of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with different amounts of folic acid adsorbed on their surfaces. Cells that are not metabolically active, when engulfing either fresh or aged CNTs, release more of their respective enzyme within 2 h than after 48 h. On the other hand, metabolically active cells (both the osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 and primary human osteoblasts) release more of their respective enzyme within 48 h when engulfing aged CNTs than fresh CNTs. These differences in enzyme release appear to be a consequence of distinct changes in the mechanisms by which CNTs enter the cells. Molecular insights into the effects of metals and antioxidants on aquatic plants under heavy metal stress\nHeavy metal (HM) accumulation in plants poses a threat to food security. To avoid the accumulation of HMs in crops, agricultural soil was used to investigate the effect of antioxidants on HM uptake in plants.

It was also to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various surgical and drug treatments in the context of QALY and survival.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe analysis involved papers from PubMed, Ovid and Embase, in which quality-adjusted survival and quality-adjusted life years were compared to survival and life expectancy. The literature search was conducted from 1 January 2000 to 29 August 2012 using the following key words: metastatic, neoplasm, oncology, outcomes, overall survival, quality adjusted life years, quality of life, survival, survival analysis, survival curves, survival rate, survival study, quality of life, quality-adjusted life years, quality-adjusted survival, surgery, surgical treatment, treatment. A total of twenty-two publications were finally selected from the initial 2,563 identified papers.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe survival analysis showed that the estimated life expectancy for the groups treated with gemcitabine ranged from 5.7 to 9.9 months. The estimated median survival for cisplatin treatment ranged from 4.6 to 7.2 months. The expected 1-year survival with chemotherapy and radiation therapy was 40.0%. The QALY values in patients undergoing radical cystectomy varied from 1.06 to 2.4 years. The effectiveness of surgical and drug treatments in the context of quality-adjusted life expectancy was evaluated.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evaluation of the effectiveness of various treatments based on quality of life and quality-adjusted survival may help make decisions by physicians and patients.

            "NUTRITIONAL SLOMESIA\u2014A CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION AIDING IN ASSESSMENT OF MIXED INTOLERANCE AND DISEASE\n\nThe nutritional slomesia or nutritional diathesis permits a more rational approach to the understanding of the nutritional effects of a diet when mixed nutritional insufficiency and deficiencies coexist. A system of classification can facilitate the nutritional therapy by placing it on a rational basis.The importance of the diet in medical treatment can hardly be overemphasized. One of every three diagnoses of the medical officer of the National Health Service (B.M.F.) of England is concerned with nutrition. Yet, in an inquiry that has already been reported, 1 approximately 40% of the patients with diseases or conditions requiring hospital care, and receiving food from the dietician of the National Hospital, had been given a diet not well balanced in nutrients, or lacking essential vitamins and minerals, the fault having been due not so much to lack of expert knowledge of dietetics or to ignorance, as to the absence of facilities for nutritional assessment and to the inability of the doctors in charge to obtain help and advice in such cases. Thus, whereas at the National Hospital, most of the 124 wards had one or more dieticians, 14 wards had none. Similar inadequacies exist in other institutions. It is indeed paradoxical that the nutritional state, in which all life processes depend, has hitherto received so little attention.Even in text-books, the matter of the nutritional state is given little coverage. The most comprehensive and detailed report on the subject was published some thirty years ago by Wilder 2 from the Mayo Clinic. This excellent survey was of value, in that it not only gave a description of the various nutritional faults, but also outlined a general classification of the symptoms. It is, however, not an easy book to consult and does not offer a simple method of assessing the nutritional state in the individual. A more recent publication by Woolf 3 had the advantage of being more concise, but was not comprehensive enough; the third edition of Allan'",
            "</s> I would recommend that the second study arm should be patients with high expression of the identified biomarkers or targets identified from the first study phase. The intervention could be a personalized treatment plan based on the patient's specific biomarkers or targets. This arm would help to confirm the impact of the identified targets or biomarkers on patient outcomes and treatment effectiveness. This would be an important next step in validating the identified biomarkers or targets and determining their relevance in treating recurrent glioblastoma in patients. By understanding how the targets and biomarkers contribute to the disease progression and treatment response, we can develop more effective and personalized treatment plans that are tailored to the individual patient's specific needs. Immunomodulatory effect of curcumin on LPS-activated DCs generation and CD4+CD25-T cells proliferation\n\nCurcumin (Cur) is derived from the root of the spice turmeric and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine owing to its numerous pharmacological activities. Immune regulation is the most important characteristic of Chinese herbs during medication. Using an immunomodulatory index to analyze the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in enhancing the function of immune organs, we observed an up-regulation in the immune organ function as a result of Cur treatment. Here, we report that Cur, isolated from Rhizoma of Curcumae was used to modulate toll-like receptors (TLR)-activated dendritic cell (DC) generation. We also report that Cur decreased LPS-induced inflammatory factors, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), in murine bone-marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs). Moreover, DCs treated with Cur and LPS demonstrated significantly enhanced ability to induce allogeneic T-cell proliferation.

A Cooling and Heating Mechanism for Sustained Changes in Photosynthetic CO2 Fixation in a Marine Diatom\nScientists recently discovered that genetic engineering allows certain algae to survive temperatures that have been too hot for the oceans for several millions of years. Now researchers have begun to describe how these algae actually cope with the stress by using physiological means alone. The work by the researchers was conducted with the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, whose ability to withstand high temperatures made it the algal model of choice. Surprising findings reveal that the algae\u2019s ability to handle heat is possible through a temperature-dependent adjustment of CO2 capture by biochemical processes in the chloroplast. The process is known as nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). The researchers developed a model to describe the NPQ action of the diadon cells in response to sudden temperature shocks. They explain that the NPQ process is essential in maintaining photosynthetic rates when the temperature rises over several degrees Celsius within a matter of a minute or two. They argue that the algae\u2019s \u201ccooling\u201d property of NPQ provides them with the time to activate enzymatic pathways to prevent death by excess light absorption of photodamaged chlorophyll, and hence loss of essential CO"

Bimodal response properties in V1 and V2 neurons\n\nBimodal neurons fire to sounds and other stimuli like light. We recorded from simple and complex cells within monkey area V1 and near area V2 of the dorsal pathway while presenting naturalistic movies for sound and light modalities. In all, 60 V1 simple cells had a better sound response than light response (sound-onset preference), and 10 cells had a better light than sound response (lightonset preference). In area V2 we found 7 sound-preferring and 9 light-preferring cells. Sound-preferring V1 cells showed short (\u223c75 ms) and sustained (\u223c500 ms) visual responses. Interestingly, the short-latency visually evoked responses were larger in complex cells than in simple cells. The sustained response was also larger in complex than simple cells, but its onset was delayed and the response was delayed at the onset of V2. Light-preferring visual cells showed short-, sustained-, transient-, and oscillatory responses to naturalistic sounds.

            "# Background\n\n### General Description\n\nDefinitively establishing causal relationships is difficult in traditional prospective studies due to potential confounding factors. With the recent rise in high-dimensional datasets, it is possible to examine potential associations in a causal manner through interventional (causal) analysis. This involves estimating the counterfactual causal effect of one variable on another. There are many ways in which to derive a causal estimator based on the observed data.\n\n### Interaction, Mapping, and Mediation\n\nMediation and causal estimation are somewhat related, but not the same. This tutorial covers mediation within a general framework, while the following tutorials focus on causal analysis specifically.\n\nThe intervention-induced signal, known as an interaction or e-effect, measures the extent to which the mediator value changes in the presence of the control variable. The e-effect is the difference between the mediator value in the intervention arm and the control arm, holding the control variable constant at some value. The e-effect measures a local association between an observation (a single value) and the control variable. Consider an analysis of the e-effect between a categorical predictor and a binary mediator. Suppose the effect of the categorical predictor on the binary mediator is positive and the effect of the binary mediator on the outcome is also positive. Then the e-effect provides a local association between the categorical variable and the outcome, quantifies by how much the binary mediator value is expected to change after controlling for the effect of the categorical predictor. Mediation analysis differs from an e-effect analysis in that the former aims to estimate the whole distribution of the mediator and the outcome, and not just the difference or local association between the two. There are specific assumptions for e-effect analysis in contrast to mediation analysis; we have included a definition below for e-effect analysis and have included a discussion of assumptions behind mediation analysis in .\n\n### Interactive Pipeline\n\nThese interactive tutorials build upon each other and are designed to be done in order.

Could you please discuss a bit of the background and rationale? <a href=\"\">This Phase 3 Trial is going to determine whether the M72/AS01E-4 vaccine can protect individuals from progressing to active tuberculosis after having been infected with bacteria that cause tuberculosis. In addition, the trial intends to test the hypothesis that vaccinating with M72/AS01E-4 will reduce reactivation of latent tuberculosis and thereby reduce the number of new cases of active tuberculosis. In this vaccine, the M72/AS01E-4 is administered to tuberculosis patients with negative acid fast staining sputum. The patients' sputum will be examined monthly by a laboratory technician to check for positive acid fast staining sputum that indicates that the patients are progressing into active tuberculosis. M72/AS01E-4 will be administered twice at 0 and 4 months to the tuberculosis patients who test negative for sputum-positive active tuberculosis at each of those intervals. Patients will be followed for an average of 42 months after their vaccination with M72/AS01E-4.

The effect of a non-calibrated electrogoniometer on goniometry measured knee angle during a squat exercise\nAbstract Background: Recent reviews of knee angle measurement found only two validated devices for measuring knee angle during squat exercises. Objective: The aim of this study was to see whether the angle measured by the non-calibrated Wired Electrogoniometer (WEG) correlated with the angle of the joint measured by the validated Kinovea device during a squat exercise. Methods: A group of 44 students (male and female) participated in the research. Participants were fitted with WEG on the lateral epicondyle while Kinovea device placed on the lateral malleolus. On the squat, a series of photos were taken by the camera with Kinovea device positioned between the subject\u2019s feet. Knee flexion was measured using the WEG and the Kinovea device to determine if a correlation was present between them. Results: Pearson r and intraclass correlation coefficients between the WEG and Kinovea devices showed that the WEG had a negative correlation to the Kinovea device and did not show significant agreement between the two devices at the level of p\u2009<\u20090.05.

Al-Tumah 1 1 University of Kuwait, Kuwait.  \n  559: IMPACT OF SARS-COV-2 ON VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM IN COVID-19 PATIENTS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND METAANALYSIS OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES BACKGROUND Covid-19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and is characterized by vascular damage, thrombosis, and multi-organ failure. The clinical manifestations of Covid-19 vary, from mild to critical, and the patients at the intensive care unit (ICU) are considered to have severe disease. Increased risk of thrombosis has been reported in patients hospitalized with Covid-19, compared with other similar illnesses. MATERIAL AND METHOD A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol. Eligible studies had to include hospitalized patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, with or without thrombotic events confirmed by venous thromboembolism (VTE) imaging, such as computed tomography angiography (CTA), venography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or any combination of these tests. Articles published between Dec 2019 and May 2020 were searched using Pubmed, Clinicaltrials.Gov, Web of ScienceTM, and Medrxiv. The main outcomes were VTE events and prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). RESULTS A total number of N = 14,296 ICU patients and N = 11,360 patients from non-ICU settings (NICU) were included and analyzed. Pooled prevalence of VTE was 1",

The study design was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial with enrollment starting in 2010 and finalizing in 2013. The patients in this trial had diabetes mellitus, CKD stage V, and required hemodialysis at least 3 times weekly. Exclusion criteria included severe malnutrition, chronic inflammatory disease (excluding diabetes mellitus), or use of parenteral nutrition. Also excluded was pregnancy in the prior 90 days. All patients were receiving dietary advice consistent with the National Kidney Foundation Clinical Practice Guidelines at the time of enrollment: 0.8 to 1 g of protein/kg of body weight/day and 25 to 35 kcal/kg/day. All patients had a prescribed intake of 1 g of protein/kg of body weight/day plus 2 to 4 g of weight-based L-alanyl-L-glutamine.\nPatients with low circulating albumin concentration (< 30 g/L) were randomized to either the control group (standard treatment only) or the experimental group (supplemental parenteral nutrition with branched-chain protein-amino-acid infusate), and they were followed for 6 months. Both groups continued with the dietary advice as described; however, the experimental group received parenteral nutrition infusate and standard treatment with protein-amino-acid enriched and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA+)-enriched protein infusate, whereas the control group received standard treatment only. All treatment was given 3 times weekly for 15 minutes. The protocol called for the use of a random-number generator to produce the allocation sequence.

To reduce the complexity of the turbulent flow a simplified and idealized geometry model is introduced and implemented in a three-dimensional grid resolving large eddy simulation technique. In comparison with experiment, it shows that the LES is able to reproduce the turbulent cloud structure quite well. The experimental results show that the fractional cloud area of entrained particles decreases with increasing age of the cloud and droplet size. This can be attributed to the fact that the inertia of the entraining air flows becomes quite low relative to the inertia of the falling drops in aged cloud, which means that the velocity gradient imposed by the gravity in the falling drops is larger than the drag force between the drops in the older cloud. In addition, in the entrainment mode the effect of the turbulence in the flow is more pronounced in the falling drops in the younger cloud, for which inertia plays the main role, than in the older cloud, for which inertia is rather secondary. In the bounce mode the effect of the turbulence in the flow and the falling velocity are similar for both younger and older clouds. In the simulations a clear difference between the entrainment of large and small drops",

A comparison of the immunological aspects and efficacy of t-PA and TNK in acute ischemic stroke patients\nIntroduction The present study was designed to identify the immunological aspects in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients and the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with two different urokinase-type plasminogen activators (u-PA): recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and recombinant t-PA/urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) (t-PA/u-PA) (KABI-403). Methods The data were retrospectively analyzed with a prospectively collected database of patients who were consecutively enrolled in the prospective study. Results Eighty-two AIS patients who received intravenous thrombolysis using rt-PA and t-PA/u-PA according to standard eligibility criteria were included in this study. Among the 82 patients, 49 received rt-PA (mean age: 66.41 \u00b1 11.34 years) and 33 received t-PA/u-PA (mean age: 63.27 \u00b1 13.24 years). Higher rate of intracranial hemorrhage was detected in the rt-PA group. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on the fourth day was more decreased in the t-PA/u-PA group than that of the rt-PA group. T-PA/u-PA significantly recovered the cerebrovascular perfusion compared with rt-PA.

Patients were classified into 2 groups based on concurrent use of an opioid and a second analgesic or addiction medication. We used an inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis to compare risk factors and management strategies between the buprenorphine and methadone groups after controlling for confounding variables. Finally, we compared adverse event incidence among concurrently using buprenorphine vs methadone.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIncidence of concurrent use of buprenorphine and opioids or opioids and methadone in patients on the waiting list was 0.50% and 0.49%, respectively. Among the concurrent users, the median age was 24.2 years (buprenorphine group) vs 22.2 years (methadone group). Median time on the waiting list among concurrent users was 7 days for the buprenorphine group and 3 days for the methadone group.

            "Evaluating the Quality of Dry Eye Measurements\nPurpose To introduce novel quality measures for assessing the reliability of dry eye assays, which can be calculated from routine clinical and/or experimental data. Methods Three candidate quality measures are defined: E(R) and E(T), which incorporate measures of repeatability and reproducibility of standard laboratory assays, and E(Q), calculated from variability in patients' quality-of-life responses to changes in their dry eye symptoms. The formulas for these quality measures are developed on the basis of data presented in this article, from studies of the clinical and experimental reproducibility of a selection of dry eye disease assessments. Calculation of quality measures was performed by application of these formulas to a representative pool of data, which was compiled from a number of clinical studies undertaken at the Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London, and from two studies performed with human subjects. The formulas for quality measures were applied to selected clinical and experimental data in the studies reported here. Results Repeatability of laboratory measurements was high in both clinical and experimental studies (E(R) > 0.9). Reproducibility of clinical data was lower, reflecting differences in dry eye disease status under different conditions (E(T) = 0.45-0.74). Based on data from a subset of patients with dry eye disease, reproducibility of patients' quality-of-life responses to dry eye treatment was very high (E(Q) > 0.9). Conclusions Using quality measures, the information on reproducibility of an assay can be determined directly from the variability in patient clinical responses to treatment. Reliability of an assay can be assessed by calculation of the average E(R), E(T) and E(Q). These quality measures should be useful for estimating the likelihood of a true change in dry eye status in an individual patient and aiding the development and validation of new dry eye assays.

A search was conducted in March 2020 using YouTube and Facebook to target online videos uploaded by news channels, media institutes, and official entities. A list of items was designed to assess the quality of the videos in terms of the following: relevance, content, sources, accuracy, fairness, and clarity. In total, 50 YouTube and 47 Facebook videos were evaluated using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 22 items addressing these subthemes. This study indicated that 74% of the videos on YouTube were produced by official sources compared to 40% of the recorded Facebook videos. More than 70% of the videos contained adequate information in terms of content, sources, and accuracy. However, only 44% of the evaluated videos met the requirements according to the fairness subtheme. The evaluation of the reliability score indicated that only 52% and 42% of the evaluated videos on YouTube and Facebook, respectively, were reliable.

            "The Association Between Dietary Inflammatory Index and Dementia\u2014A Longitudinal Study\n\nBackground: Diet may contribute to risk of dementia. The dietary inflammatory index (DII \u00ae ) is a novel index for evaluating diet-related inflammation. Epidemiological studies have reported a link between DII and multiple adverse health effects including neurodegenerative conditions, but it is unclear whether DII impacts dementia risk. Objectives: We investigated the association between DII and dementia risk. Methods: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were measured at baseline and at follow-up among the 7957 participants in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) during 1991-2015. The mean and standard deviation of change in the MMSE score were calculated according to DII quartile categories, and the association between DII and change in MMSE score was analyzed by using linear regression. Next, the association between DII and dementia risk was studied in a follow-up cohort of participants during 1991-2015. Results: During follow-up, total 769 participants developed dementia disease. Based on average MMSE scores at baseline, the participants were classified into 4 categories: normal (\u226527), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, 24-26), and moderate cognitive impairment (20-23), and severe cognitive impairment (\u226419). The rate of decline in MMSE score increased with increasing DII quartile, especially in MCI and severe cognitive impairment.

The memory was induced in normal rats after immobilization stress, which is known to enhance the neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral reactions of rats. To evaluate the levels of GABA and NMDA, and the GABA/NMDA ratio, we used both postmortem and in vivo microdialysis. In parallel, another group of rats was tested using in vivo microdialysis coupled with behavioral experiments, in which avoidance memory formation was induced by two successive inescapable footshocks. It was found that in the hippocampal dialysate, the levels of GABA increased after an immobilization stress, but the levels of NMDA were unaffected. A simultaneous increase in the GABA/"

This study investigated the efficacy of two popular probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) and Enterococcus faecium (Ef) in pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae.Materials and Methods:Adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (1) control (intranasally instillation of 0.1 mL PBS), the only difference being that Lp (10 8 colony-forming units [cfu]) and Ef (10 8 cfu) were intranasally administrated in the Lp and Ef groups, respectively, 48 h before the induction of pneumonia. Then, K. pneumoniae (10 8 cfu) was administrated 24 h before the induction of pneumonia.Results:The Lp group showed significant improvements in the macroscopic scoring of lung injuries, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and bacterial load when compared to the other groups. The mean survival time in 30 days was significantly increased in the Lp group compared to the Ef and control groups (P<0.001). Improvement in the mean time until death was more prominent in non-survivors in the Lp group than in the other groups.

            "Improvements to the Diffusion-Limited Aggregation model in one and two dimensions.\nWe improve two versions (DLAD and DLAT) of the Diffusion-Limited Aggregation algorithm originally due to Witten and Sander, by allowing for more than one particle per site, and by employing the Monte Carlo method. Our version allows for up to ten particles per lattice site (DLAT-100) and a more efficient strategy is applied in this case to reduce the number of required iterations. This paper reports the results of the simulations with these improved methods, and the results of simulations with DLAT-100 are compared with those resulting from a new version of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner model. Our results show an improved agreement between the models for a particular value of the ratio of reaction rate constant to the growth rate, \u03b1R for DLAT-100, and suggest that the value of the exponent for the fractal dimension of aggregates should be slightly greater than that previously calculated by Witten and Sander. A Case of Acute Rhabdomyolysis and Severe Myoglobinuria in a Middle-aged Woman Without Hypertension or Acidemia\n\n\n\n# Introduction\nRhabdomyolysis is a syndrome that involves myocyte necrosis that may be due to a variety of reasons. Rhabdomyolysis is frequently encountered in a clinical setting, but is easily undiagnosed in early stage. Rapid improvement in medical care has contributed to the decrease in mortality rate of rhabdomyolysis at present compared to the past. It is essential, however, to make an early diagnosis for the better management of rhabdomyolysis in terms of the serious adverse outcome it causes.\nHerein, we discuss a case of a Japanese woman in her 50s who presented to our hospital for acute onset of rhabdomyolysis with markedly elevated serum levels of creatine kinase (CK). The case shows that rhabdomyolysis in an elderly individual can be caused by even minor triggers.\n\n## Case presentation\nA Japanese woman in her 50s visited a nearby department of ophthalmology for right eye pain.

To investigate apoptosis in PC3 prostate cancer cells, a flow cytometric, comet assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methodologies were adopted. Anti-tumor effects were studied in a PC3 prostate cancer cell line by cell viability and cell cycle assays, as well as the evaluation of tumor volume and body weight in PC3 xenograft tumor models. Results: Gen-NLCs was obtained with high loading capacity of 79.949.36% efficiency. Genistein release in 48 h was 26.2% in the presence of 10 mM tris-HCl, 137 mM NaCl, and 1 % Tween-80 (pH 7.4). Gen-NLCs presented low cytotoxicity in vivo, while Gen-NLCs led to higher PC3 cell apoptosis and G1-phase arrest. MCF-7 proliferation was inhibited by both formulations, with lower IC50 values for Gen-NLCs. The antitumor effects of Gen-NLCs were more significant in vivo, with smaller tumor size and higher median survival.

The role of surgery in patients with spontaneous haematoporphyrin-induced photodynamic therapy complications.\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of small peripheral and superficial tumours located in the upper urinary tract, bladder and prostate. It is a non-invasive technique, which is not associated with the morbidity and mortality rates associated with surgery. It is reported that in over 95% of patients there are no significant complications. However, we report a patient who had major complications and ultimately required partial nephrectomy of right kidney. To our knowledge this is the first reported example of this in over 500 patients treated with PDT. A 4-year-old boy had a transitional cell carcinoma involving the left upper and lower urinary tract. This was treated with PDT to the left ureter and lower pole ureteric stenosis of the left kidney. Six months later he developed severe haematuria and pyrexia. Cystoscopy revealed the left ureter was extremely inflamed. A left nephroureterectomy was carried out and this was complicated by a pulmonary embolism.

Twenty\u2010six obese females with Type 2 DM were randomized into two groups with 13 in EP and 13 in EPDC. Before and after training at two different glucose loads (OGTT 75 g and OGTT 150 g), glucose kinetics were monitored by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps and continuous infusion of glucose to determine rates of glucose appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd). After 24 weeks there were no significant differences between the two groups, but a trend for improvement in the 0\u2010120\u2010min glucose values was evident in the EPDC after the 75\u2010g glucose loading.

This approach should include a neurologist and an anesthesiologist who specializes in neuromuscular disease. Pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle mimicking plantar fasciitis.\nPigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is an uncommon condition that may present as a pseudo lesion or as a real lesion. When PVNS presents as a pseudo lesion, it may be difficult to differentiate from common foot problems. We describe the clinical and sonographic features of a case of a left ankle PVNS in a 19-year-old woman who suffered from bilateral ankle pain. On physical examination, she presented mild tenderness on the left ankle and the pain could only be triggered when bearing weight on the affected ankle, with radiating pain down to the toes. The examination showed a limited range of motion of the left ankle and it was difficult to distinguish a synovial effusion or a popliteal cyst in the medial gutter. However, in spite the lack of typical features, the diagnosis of PVNS of the left ankle seems to be reasonable, as the patient had a 2-year history of the lesion and a previous ultrasound examination in a different department had been performed. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. This unusual case can serve as a reminder that PVNS may appear as a pseudo lesion and the possibility of PVNS should be born in mind by all clinicians.

Children who underwent adenoidectomy showed a significant increase in preoperative peak expiratory flow rate and a significant decrease in the postoperative levels of serum IgE level.

Mapping of the genetic determinants of protoporphyrin accumulation in erythrocytes and liver of the rat and their relationship with liver haem and Fe metabolism.\nIn this study we tried to find out the mechanism by which protoporphyrin (Ppp) accumulates in rat erythrocytes and liver. Four lines of rats bred for high concentrations of Ppp in these organs were fed a diet either depleted in ferrous iron or supplemented with Porphomax. After 4 weeks, Ppp concentrations in blood, liver and kidney, haem and Fe concentrations in both liver and kidney, as well as Fe distribution in the liver, and the liver activities of haem synthetic and Fe, transport-related enzymes were determined. In addition, dietary Fe and Zn intake and serum protoporphyrin-Zn concentration were measured. The results clearly show that Porphymax, besides its iron chelator effect, also inhibited the transferring/iron reutilization pathway in the liver by depressing ferroportin and Zn transporter Znt1 and ZnT1 mRNA levels. Dietary Fe decreased Zn (Znt1 and ZnT1) transporters mRNA levels and Zn intake was lower in the lines with the higher Ppp concentrations in comparison with controls. Zn levels in the liver, but not Fe concentrations were negatively correlated with Ppp concentration in both blood and liver. Furthermore, the results indicate that dietary Fe has a predominant effect on erythrocyte but not on liver Ppp accumulation. This is corroborated in the present experiment with different rats genetically selected for low or high liver Fe and Zn accumulation. .\nIn an earlier report it could",

            "A model of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) lung disease progression identifies pro-inflammatory responses\n\nNon-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), including Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MAB), cause infections in the lung, with significant morbidity and mortality. However, the underlying basis of disease progression is incompletely understood, hampering the development of new therapies. Disease is not restricted to the lungs and often requires extensive surgical intervention. Furthermore, new or worsening cavitary disease can occur and often becomes infected with other pulmonary bacteria. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the lungs and peripheral blood from patients with progressive and arrested NTM lung disease, and in a mouse model, to identify potential markers of NTM lung disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that CD40, NLRP3, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A are associated with the active cavitary disease, inversely correlated with disease arrest and, importantly, inducible in NTM-infected T cells in progressive and arrested disease states. Importantly, these responses are associated with NTM lung disease and not a result of bacterial load. These observations indicate that immune response profiles are associated with NTM disease progression.Author summaryNon-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), including the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MAB), cause severe lung disease with extensive lung function decline and are a challenge to treat.

The number of patients visiting the ED and the reasons for visit were categorized.Results: The number of first-visit patients at the ED from April 1 to June 30, 2020, was 2306, showing a 19.8% decrease over the same period the year prior. The number of visits for fever, a typical symptom of COVID-19, increased slightly. The number of trauma-injury-related visits also increased.Conclusions: The number of patients visiting the ED had a decreasing trend in 2020 due to COVID-19.

NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates differentiation of neuronal cells including neural stem cells.\nTo investigate the possibility of using oxidative stress-related antioxidative agent to prevent oxidation-induced neuronal damage for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD), we previously have demonstrated that the Keap1/Nrf2-dependent antioxidant response suppressed oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. Here, to elucidate the role of Nrf2 in maintaining neuronal cells, we examined the effect of sulforaphane (SFN), a potent inducer and activator of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, on the SH-SY5Y cells. Treatment of the cells with SFN suppressed the spontaneous apoptosis and the hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. A previous report revealed that in neurogenic zones, nestin(+)/NeuN(-), double-positive, cells were regarded as neuronal progenitors with the neuronal stem cell (NSC) properties. The SFN up-regulated expression levels of Nestin and NeuN in SH-SY5Y cells. An in vitro culture system with human NSCs (hNSCs) was also tested for treatment with SFN. It also had neuroprotective effects against H(2)O(2)-mediated neurotoxicity. Taken together, results show that SFN-mediated up-regulation of Nestin and NeuN may indicate the ability to maintain neuronal cells. Therefore, regulation of the antioxidant response via the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway is suggested as one of the strategies for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD.

On the mechanism of formation of chiral tetraalkylammonium carboxylates: racemization of cameral chiral centers.\nThe mechanism of the formation of chiral tetraalkylammonium carboxylates from racemic alkyl bromides and carboxylic acids in high yield has been elucidated by experimental and theoretical studies. The mechanism consists of the ion/pair association of racemic bromide-induced enamines with the carboxylic acid to produce a bifunctional carbanion, which reacts as the enamine and nucleophile to capture the alkyl halide to give the biscationic intermediate. The enamine of both enantiomers is formed from the racemic primary alcohol and the enantiopure alcohol in the same way, and the two types of biscationic intermediates are easily interconverted through a rotation about the carbon-bromine bond of the alkyl halide and a rotation about the carbanion bond at the bromide anion, which leads to the racemization of the cameral chiral centers. The alkyl halides, which are derived from the racemic tetraalkylammonium bromides, are easily racemized during the preparation of the alkyl bromides by a reaction with methylamine. Thus, although one can start with chiral carboxylic acids or tetraalkylammonium salts and prepare chiral tetraalkylammonium carboxylates directly in enantiomerically pure form by the method described here, an initial separation of the racemic halides is required. .\nA 42-year-old woman underwent radical operation for sigmoid colon cancer.

Cystic duct fistula in association with a distal pancreatectomy.\nA 27-year-old female who had a history of appendicitis presented for laparoscopic cholecystectomy with multiple gallstones and a distended gallbladder. She also had an inflamed pancreas and a dilated pancreatic duct at its infundibulum. At surgery, the duct of the main pancreatic duct was ligated and divided, which resulted in a large duct-gallbladder fistula. The fistula was surgically repaired but a week later the patient experienced an acute pancreatitis that was followed by recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. In order to control her pancreatic disease and her pain, the fistula was surgically occluded and a cystgastrostomy was constructed, which controlled all of the episodes of recurrent pancreatitis. A review of the literature revealed only three prior cases of a cystogastric fistula in the same patient with a cyst-gallbladder fistula. Development of an inhibitory activity assay and production of inhibitors that enhance the survival of Cryptococcus neoformans during host colonization\nCryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of fungal pneumonia in people living with HIV in sub\u2010Saharan Africa and has significant intrinsic drug resistance, thus necessitating the discovery of new therapeutic compounds effective against it. ABSTRACT Cryptococcus neoformans is a common cause of fungal pneumonia in people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and has significant intrinsic drug resistance, thus necessitating the discovery of new therapeutic compounds effective against it. We have developed a method for assaying C. neoformans biofilm inhibitory activity and discovered a panel of novel cyclic peptides that inhibit C. neoformans biofilms and enhance the survival of C. neoformans during intracellular infection in amoebae.

Association of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) metabolic genotype with bladder carcinogenesis stage in a Southwest Italian cohort.\nWe evaluated 159 bladder cancer patients  for NAT2 metabolic phenotype and genotype frequencies. We also analyzed the association of NAT2 phenotypes and genotypes and the cancer stage in this series. Bladder tumors were histopathologically graded and staged by a urologist. All patients also underwent cystoscopy to rule out the recurrence or progression of tumors. NAT2 genotype results did not show significant differences either between patients and healthy individuals or concerning NAT2 genotype frequencies. NAT2 phenotype frequencies were similar to those reported in Western countries showing a predominant distribution of extensive metabolizers, followed by rapid and intermediate metabolizers. However, we found significantly higher distribution of wild-type homozygous extensive metabolizers in advanced tumors (T2-4/N+) compared to less advanced tumors (Ta-1/N0 and Tis/N0) (chi2(1) = 5.4984 and P = 0.0392). This increased NAT2 gene activity in patients with advanced stages may indicate higher susceptibility of these subjects to bladder cancer development suggesting that the genetic determinant of bladder tumorigenesis may be associated to NAT2 variant allele. Rare Association of Congenital Insensitivity to Pain With Anhidrosis With Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism and Severe Psychiatric Disturbance\n\nCongenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA, OMIM #256800) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by congenital analgesia (without touch, pressure, temperature, and pain), reduced sweating, and mental impairment. The major features of CIPA are congenital analgesia, which means the patient fails to perceive painful noxious stimuli and reduced sweating. This is reported to be the most common symptom of CIPA.

Then, participants in the group on pindolol and group on placebo will be divided into the GP1a and GPla 2 (GPlac) according to whether or not they are responsive to pindolol. This will be achieved by screening serotonin receptor 1A (5-HT1a) polymorphism Gln270Pro and by performing a double-blind assessment of the responders to pindolol. Participants with at least one copy of the variant allele (Gln) and responders with the Gln270Pro polymorphism will be allocated to the group on pindolol (GP1a). Those who fall into other categories will be allocated to the control group. The treatment period with pindolol will last 15 weeks; there will be an inter-trial period of 1 week after the treatment and a 12-week follow-up.

I think my paper has benefited a lot from your feedback. .\nBACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate early results of total knee arthroplasties performed on patients treated at the Clinics of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Hospital in Bydgoszcz.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n459 TKAs on 396 patients (371 women and 25 men) were performed in this Hospital during the course of 11 years. The age of the surgical patients was in the range of 36-85 years. The assessment of functional results, assesed clinically and radiologically, was conducted during the first postoperative year. The clinical assessment of the knee's functional state (according to Knee Society's Clinical Rating Scale) was performed during the pre- and postoperative period. The radiological assessment of the knee's function involved X-ray (anteroposterior and lateral views) imaging for determining the presence of degenerative alterations with the assessment of the joint space narrowing degree measured with the use of Kellgren and Lawrence radiographic criteria.\n\n\nRESULTS\n18 knees were removed due to unacceptable results of TKA (4% of the whole studied group). 41 complications (9,62%) in 31 patients were observed. They were distributed as follows: infections (4 cases, 0,85%) and dislocations (1 patients, 0,22%). In the pre-operative period the degenerative changes in knees ranged from 2 to 4 degrees according to Kellgren and Lawrence scale. The improvement of the Knee Society's Clinical Rating score and functional range of motion (3 - 90) was recorded after the first TKA.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n1. TKA procedures should be performed by properly trained surgeons. 2. It is advantageous to conduct a physiotherapy procedure immediately after TKA. 3. TKA is indicated in patients with severe degenerative changes of knee joints. 4. Patients with inflammatory ar",

We evaluated parameters of carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms under the effect of three combinations of three common components of obesity indices: waist circumference (W), hip circumference (H), waist/hip ratio (R), and waist-to-body mass ratio (R1). A total of 358 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with overweight or obesity (BMI>25 kg/m2) were enrolled in the study. We found the highest level of mean serum triglycerides (p>0.001) and HOMA-IR (p>0.001), an indicator of the insulin resistance of beta-pancreatic cells and elevated level of arterial pressure (p>0.001). According to the combinations of three common components of anthropometric indices, the highest rate of patients was registered in the first group (combination of W, H, R). The second combination of indices (W, H, R1) includes the second-largest group of patients (11 (3.0%)). The third combination (W, H, R2) included eight (2.3%) patients. In the groups with combination of three indices only a few patients had level of arterial hypertension (21.5-42.9%), while patients with obesity (33.9-39.7%) were more frequent. In all groups, patients were more frequently females. The highest frequency of abnormal carbohydrate metabolism was observed in the subgroup of combination W+H+H+R (16.4%). This method can be recommended to evaluate the level of metabolic and carbohydrate risk of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with metabolic syndrome due to overweight",
