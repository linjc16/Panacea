Phase 2 trials test a new agent in a bigger group of people to determine if it is effective in treating the disease. A phase 2 trial like the one described uses a control group to compare the safety and effectiveness of the new agent with the standard treatment for the disease. For this trial, the control arm is standard of care for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, which is a combination of intravenous (IV) fluids and intravitreal (into the eye) chemotherapy for patients with evidence of central nervous system and/or liver metastasis. We also have a group of participants receiving the combination of Ziv-Aflibercept and Cemiplimab, which is the investigational arm.",

We hypothesize that early rewarming, passive motion, and early ambulation may improve these outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of a study that will compare, for the first time, intraoperative blood salvage alone to a protocol of early rewarming and passive motion and early ambulation (the use of an intraoperative cryocooler with a hyperbaric blanket and knee compression device, respectively) for their impact on total blood loss and the rate of postoperative complications in patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty.

What specific data will we obtain for each study arm?  [/PIC] For the \"ECP: Intestinal Tissue Analysis\" arm, we will collect samples of intestinal tissue from patients before and after treatment and analyze them to determine the effects of ECP on the immune cells in the intestinal tract. This data can help us understand how ECP works at a cellular level and identify potential biomarkers for response to the treatment. For the \"Control: Placebo/Standard Treatment\" arm, we will collect similar data from patients receiving standard treatment only. For the \"Other: Standard Treatment Only\" arm, we will collect data on clinical outcomes such as symptoms, remission rates, and biochemical markers such as blood biomarkers. Together, this combined data pool will help us determine the specific benefits of ECP over standard treatment, both in terms of clinical outcomes as well the mechanisms of action at a cellular level. [PIC] [image] [/PIC] The next step is to decide on a sample size calculation for each arm, which will help us determine how many patients we need to include in each arm to have a high degree of confidence that our results are not due to chance. The sample size calculation depends on the anticipated treatment effect and the variability of the data. We can use past studies in our area as a guideline for our sample sizes. What are some factors that might influence the variability of our data? What other considerations should we keep in mind when conducting the sample size calculation? [PIC] [image] [/PIC] Let's start by assuming a treatment effect size of 0.5, which means that we would expect 50% more patients treated with ECP to be in remission than those receiving standard treatment. We can estimate the variability of the response by looking at our current data or previous studies. For the \"ECP: Intest",

A priori, we expect a standard deviation (SD) of 15 points for the endpoint pain score, which implies a minimum of 80% of patients (n=25) per group will be needed to detect a difference (with 80% power) in pain score of 30 points between the groups (assuming a normal distribution of data). Dividing 80% by 2 arms yields 40 per group. Thus, our final study enrollment numbers will be 80 patients total, with 40 per arm. This may seem like a large sample size, but we must remember that this is a novel intervention and a large number of patients is needed to ensure sufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful effect.

We think it's an interesting comparison. Do you have any questions on this design or the interventions?",

The placebo group will receive a sugar pill instead of Hydroxychloroquine or Colchicine, but they will be informed of the trial hypothesis and the fact that they are participating in a trial, so they will know that they are receiving a placebo rather than the study medication. The placebo group will help us determine the effect of the study drugs on the clinical course of the disease, but not the true effect of the drug on symptoms or biomarkers. What do you think?"

We would be able to gather valuable data on the treatment of perforated diverticulitis by including these three study arms in the clinical trial. 24-h pouchoscopy should also be performed in all patients. The aim of 24-h pouchoscopy is to detect any postoperative leak, which can help avoid surgical reintervention and reduce hospitalization. It is a simple and non-invasive test, and the results are available immediately. 24-h pouchoscopy must be performed by an experienced surgeon. What do you think about this?"
