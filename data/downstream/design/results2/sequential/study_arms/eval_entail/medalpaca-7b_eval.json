Phase 2 trials test a new agent in a bigger group of people to determine if it is effective in treating the disease. A phase 2 trial like the one described uses a control group to compare the safety and effectiveness of the new agent with the standard treatment for the disease. For this trial, the control arm is standard of care for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, which is a combination of intravenous (IV) fluids and intravitreal (into the eye) chemotherapy for patients with evidence of central nervous system and/or liver metastasis.

We hypothesize that early rewarming, passive motion, and early ambulation may improve these outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of a study that will compare, for the first time, intraoperative blood salvage alone to a protocol of early rewarming and passive motion and early ambulation (the use of an intraoperative cryocooler with a hyperbaric blanket and knee compression device, respectively) for their impact on total blood loss and the rate of postoperative complications in patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty.

What specific data will we obtain for each study arm?  [/PIC] For the \"ECP: Intestinal Tissue Analysis\" arm, we will collect samples of intestinal tissue from patients before and after treatment and analyze them to determine the effects of ECP on the immune cells in the intestinal tract. This data can help us understand how ECP works at a cellular level and identify potential biomarkers for response to the treatment. For the \"Control: Placebo/Standard Treatment\" arm, we will collect similar data from patients receiving standard treatment only. For the \"Other: Standard Treatment Only\" arm, we will collect data on clinical outcomes such as symptoms, remission rates, and biochemical markers such as blood biomarkers. Together, this combined data pool will help us determine the specific benefits of ECP over standard treatment, both in terms of clinical outcomes as well the mechanisms of action at a cellular level. [PIC] [image] [/PIC] The next step is to decide on a sample size calculation for each arm, which will help us determine how many patients we need to include in each arm to have a high degree of confidence that our results are not due to chance. The sample size calculation depends on the anticipated treatment effect and the variability of the data. We can use past studies in our area as a guideline for our sample sizes. What are some factors that might influence the variability of our data? What other considerations should we keep in mind when conducting the sample size calculation? [PIC] [image] [/PIC] Let's start by assuming a treatment effect size of 0.5, which means that we would expect 50% more patients treated with ECP to be in remission than those receiving standard treatment. We can estimate the variability of the response by looking at our current data or previous studies. For the \"ECP: Intest",

A priori, we expect a standard deviation (SD) of 15 points for the endpoint pain score, which implies a minimum of 80% of patients (n=25) per group will be needed to detect a difference (with 80% power) in pain score of 30 points between the groups (assuming a normal distribution of data). Dividing 80% by 2 arms yields 40 per group. Thus, our final study enrollment numbers will be 80 patients total, with 40 per arm. This may seem like a large sample size, but we must remember that this is a novel intervention and a large number of patients is needed to ensure sufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful effect.

Phase I pharmacokinetic studies can be done early in the discovery process before large scale drug development begins. Dose-A pharmacokinetic studies are useful for determining the dose and route of administration of a new drug in order to reach therapeutic plasma levels consistent with efficacy. The objective of a Phase I dose-a, pharmacokinetic study is to achieve measurable drug plasma concentrations against which dose-efficacy relationships can be established in subsequent nonclinical or clinical studies. It is typically used when only a preliminary formulation is available and a final formulation requires optimization. To be considered effective, a new drug must have adequate bioavailability and its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) must be greater than the minimum effective concentration (Cm). Bioavailability can be increased by decreasing its rate of absorption or increasing its volume of distribution. A sufficient dose for human Phase 1 use is that which results in a concentration that is 2- to 10-fold higher than the human equivalent of the optimal dose for a particular species used for preclinical testing. Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) must be at least 30% higher than that seen with the minimum effective dose. Dose-a studies help determine whether: Increasing the dose of a drug increases or decreases the concentration of the drug in the bloodstream Increasing the size of a drug particle increases or decreases the drug concentration in the bloodstream Changing the formulation of a drug (e.g. tablet to injectable formulation) decreases or increases the concentration in the blood If the drug is absorbed slowly from the gastrointestinal tract, it is advantage",

In the bone expansion procedure, we will use a high-speed surgical drill to create a channel in the edentulous bone and insert the implant at a specific angle and torque.

The machined transcortical surface will be tested to see if micro-machining of the implant shaft has an effect on clinical and radiological predictability of the implant in narrow ridges. The roughened surface group will be tested to determine the effect of a roughened surface for the narrow ridge application in order to test if surface texturing of the implant increases implant osseointegration for narrow ridges.  After placement of the implants, patients will be followed-up at regular intervals for a period of at least one year post-operatively, at which time radiographs and clinical photos will be taken and measurements of bone and soft tissue levels at implant level will be taken.

Seventy patients with the primary diagnosis of fibromyalgia will be recruited from outpatient department of the hospital. 2. After obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio into one of two groups: Experimental group and control group. 3. Experimental group will be administered the Pain Modulation Index test, followed by the Pain Detection and the Central Sensitivity Inventory questionnaires. Control group will be administered only the questionnaires. 4. Patients in both groups will have six weeks to complete assessments. 5. Patients will be contacted by phone one or two weeks after their final assessment to determine if they have experienced any changes in their pain. 6. Patients will be asked to complete the Visual Analog Scale to evaluate pain after two and four weeks. 7. Data will be analyzed using SPSS software, with a two tailed alpha set at 0.05 and a power set at 0.80. 8. In the case of an urgent need to discontinue treatment for any safety reason, patients in both groups will undergo treatment as guided by the treating physician. 9. The data collected from the two groups will be compared using the independent t-test or the Mann-Whitney test, and a p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. 10. The study coordinator will not be permitted to interpret the results or act as a potential reviewer. 11. The study will be submitted to the ethics committee of our hospital for approval. A copy of the submitted study protocol will be provided to the committee for their review. The trial will begin once approval is granted. 12. At the end of the study, results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. 13. In the case of any unforeseen adverse events, the trial will be stopped immediately.

The analysis plan is an important part of the study protocol, as it describes how we will actually analyze the data collected. In clinical research, the analysis plan is usually broken down into several stages, each with its own protocol.\nThe analysis plan should address the research question being asked, how the data will be analyzed to answer the research question, and what outcomes will be compared to determine the answer. For example, in our mock study on participation rates in clinical trials by gender and age group, the analysis plan could include a statistical analysis of data from the included patients, broken down by gender and age group, to determine the difference in participation rates between each group. A confidence interval can be calculated to determine the precision and accuracy of the data, and statistics such as Pearson's chi-squared test or Student's t-test may be used to analyze the data. Based on the results, a conclusion can be drawn as to whether there are significant differences in participation rates by gender or age group. The full analysis plan should be outlined in detail in the study protocol.\nIt's important to remember that the analysis plan may change during the course of a study, as new information or challenges arise during data collection. It's also important to note that the study protocol should be thorough, comprehensive and clearly written, to ensure all research team members and external parties understand the protocol and plan of action.\nCommunicating the Results \u2191\nThe final step in the mock study is to communicate the results to relevant stakeholders. Depending on the nature of the study, the results may be presented at a scientific conference, published in a peer-reviewed journal, or given to industry or governmental departments as part of a grant report. Presenting results in an academic setting may require an abstract, presentation, or poster, while publishing in a peer-reviewed journal will require a full manuscript. A grant",

Data collection: A data collection form will be used to collect information on demographics, clinical symptoms, and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint will be the patient-reported pain score (on a 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 to 10) at 3 weeks after treatment. 5.

Including a control arm with a comparison group (e.g., non-musicians) allows you to determine whether your study arm (musicians) really does experience increased musculoskeletal pain and interference, or if they are simply self-reporting that they experience more pain and interference due to factors like the social desirability effect (where participants report experiencing more pain to be highly desirable). For example, if the non-musician group rates themselves as being in moderate or severe pain, then you would also include measures like a visual analog scale (VAS) assessment of pain to confirm that the musicians really are experiencing higher pain levels than the non-musicians.

We reviewed the sample size calculation formula in a previous module to determine how well an existing study design would recruit enough participants to answer the research question. Here, we are going to go a step further to ask if enough patients with the disease of interest will be included in this trial, and how we can improve the success of the study by minimizing the dropouts. In the context of clinical trials, we use statistical analysis to assess whether the difference in treatment effect between treatment groups (e.g., drug vs. placebo or competing drug) is statistically significant. The statistical analysis used is often a t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA), and this is why they are referred to as clinical endpoints. In addition, the effect size or power of the study can also be determined using this analysis. For example, if the drug being studied has a large effect, and we want to see a large difference in drug treatments, we will need more subjects in each group to answer our research question. However, if the effect size of the drug is small, we might only need to recruit approximately half of the patients per group to get the answer. Therefore, we need to calculate the effect size or power of the study to know how much samples are needed. This is how statistical analysis is essential in a clinical study.",

The intervention entails the use of EUS to deliver a lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) for the treatment of benign gallbladder pathology, including cholelithiasis, chronic calculous cholecystitis, and cholecystitis. When needed, endoscopic lithotripsy will be used to fragment gallstones, which may inhibit stent-jumping and facilitate the procedure.  EUS-guided gallbladder manipulation by ultrasound imaging is minimally invasive, bloodless, and without the risks involved in laparoscopic or open surgery.  In addition, because no dissection of the gallbladder is needed during EUS or endoscopic lithotripsy, the risk of short and long-term complications are minimized.  Compared to laparoscopic cholectomy, EUS-guided therapy is technically simpler, with a shorter postoperative recovery period and in-hospital stay.   However, because of the learning curve associated with this emerging endoscopic technique, surgical intervention may not be feasible for the current pilot study and we must proceed with endoscopic therapy instead.  Endoscopic lithotripsy is a relatively new method used to fragment stones that cannot be safely removed by the stent, and its efficacy is unknown at this time.

The experimental group will receive persuasive messages highlighting the efficacy of the actions recommended, the reciprocity arm will encourage participants to adhere to guidelines to protect those who have been kind to them, and the fear of harm arm will emphasize the dangers of non-adherence by highlighting potential negative consequences.

To do this, you can use the \"Crossover\" tool and set the entry into the within-subject factor as the treatment of interest and the exit from the factor as the control or contrast treatment. The default setting for the within-subject factor is 2x2 but you can change it to suit your needs. Then, just choose a block size that will provide an adequate number of treatment-control pairs.\nFor example, we could use a 2x2 within-subject crossover design with a block size of 2 to compare two treatments: 1) treatment #1: drug A, and 2) treatment #2: no treatment.\nWhen the same subject is given both treatments, some factors need to be fixed and other factors are randomized. The fixed factors are the subject and treatment factors since every subject receives both treatments. The random factors would be the blocks and within-subject factors; in this case, the treatment-control crossover. To create this design, open the design matrix and fill in the information below and make the within-subject factor the treatment-control crossover, as shown here.\nThe entry of 1 in the treatment-control crossover factor means that the subject will receive the first treatment first and then the second treatment. The exit of 2 means that the subject will receive the second treatment first, and then the first treatment ("

(Continued) 4.1.5 Recruitment Finding qualified, eligible subjects who meet the criteria for enrollment in the trial is crucial to the success of a clinical study. Competent and energetic study staff with in-depth knowledge of the protocol and the disease under investigation are essential to enrolling study subjects as rapidly and effectively as possible. Well-publicized advertisements aimed at the target population are helpful in identifying subjects. Subjects are often recruited through the collaboration of the study physician and an advertising and marketing firm, although the principal physician or specialist involved with a study usually is responsible for initiating and continually monitoring subject enrollment. Sponsors may use either the \"head-research-site\" model or the \"centralized-recruitment\" model for subject recruitment. In the \"head-research-site\" model, sponsors place their field personnel to work with investigators and their study staff at each research site and subject enrollment occurs at the site from sponsor-proposed screening and eligibility criteria, thereby assuring rapid study start-up and enrollment and assuring uniformity in study conduct. In the \"centralized-recruitment\" model, prospective subjects are solicited from media ads and are submitted to a central location for screening by a centralized screening unit prior to enrollment into the study. Investigators can use either model. If the centralized system is used, subject flow is monitored by the principal investigators and sponsor through frequent phone calls, site visits, and regular reporting. 4.1.6 Recruiting Ethnically Diverse Populations When conducting a multicenter study in the United States, the study sponsor is required to implement procedures for the collection of data on race and ethnicity, in addition to collecting specific gender data, in order to satisfy current Federal requirements (FDA, HIPAA, DHHS and DNI).

The sample size calculation will depend on the mean uptake in the HER2- negative breast cancer group, the mean uptake in the HER2-positive cancer group and the magnitude of SD, both in pre-therapy and post-trastuzumab.

Patients with increased body mass (BMI 25-34.9 kg/m\u00b2):\nIntervention/Treatment: The same maneuver as above, using the same values for PPEEP and alterations of the inspiratory/expiratory ratio, but a reduced rate of 5 breaths per minute compared to the non-obese group. The maneuver will be conducted 3 times at different stages of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure.\nGreat job, let's continue! Could you provide a comprehensive list of the measurable outcomes or endpoints?",
            "You're welcome, but it is your study. I'm just here to help. Now, let's move onto the data collection and analysis. Can you provide the details regarding the measurements?",
            "No problem! I'd be happy to help you with that. A randomized controlled study with a control group will be useful to compare the recruitment maneuver to the other standard practices. You could also explore the use of the maneuver compared to a standardized care intervention. As for the research question, I would ask if the maneuver is an effective and efficient way to increase PEEP. To answer this question we need to know the incidence and prevalence of this maneuver in practice. Do most clinicians already use it and if not, do they hesitate because they don't know about it or because they feel it is not useful? If more clinicians use it, how do we know that the difference is due to the maneuver? Lastly, a study investigating the safety and potential adverse events will be necessary. Are patients harmed by the maneuver or do potential adverse events cancel the benefits? \nConclusion: The rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial studying the use of the recruitment maneuver to increase PEEP in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy"
