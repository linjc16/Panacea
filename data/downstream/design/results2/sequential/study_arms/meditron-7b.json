            "Thank you very much.\n[HYP] I would like to talk more about the research aims and goals. Can we meet at my lab again?\nIn our next meeting, we will have the following things to discuss:\n1. We will be creating a timeline of the study. We have 16 weeks before the beginning of the intervention in week 23. I would like to know by the next meeting what the students need to do at this point and in what time frame\nThey will be working on finalizing the intervention. I propose we will be holding 2 meetings per week, one to review the control site and one to move forward in refining the intervention.\n2. We will have a discussion about the control site and how to move forward with the control site vs. the other site. This is particularly important as we discuss the time when the intervention takes places. For the purposes of having a control site, having both a control and active site in operation concurrently is too difficult. It sounds like you would prefer to complete the data gathering at one site and start the intervention a few months later, after completing the baseline and follow-up assessments at the control site, to minimize contamination.\n3. We will discuss our time schedule and work plan. Since the study requires approval from the University and Health Research Board, approval will most likely take at least 6 weeks but possibly even up to 2 months, after which we can start recruiting. So I would like to know what you think about the timeline of the study.\n[HYP]\nI would like to discuss the intervention, as well. I think that the interventions we are providing in each of the 14 intervention sites should be different. If we decide to keep it this way, some kind of intervention comparison or effect modification should be specified.\nOne thought is to provide one version of the intervention for the active sites and a different version for the control sites. This could be a randomized cluster comparison. This would be a form of effect modification.\nAnother effect modification could be to keep the intervention consistent across all 14 sites but provide education to the study staff with the active sites to ensure intervention fidelity and adherence and to the study staff with the control sites to ensure the intervention is delivered in a consistent manner. This could be done during",
            "Excellent! We are well on our way to conducting this feasibility and pilot trial. We hope this article will help you to improve this protocol and make it better. .\nA 66-year-old male underwent a successful mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position during mitral valvotomy. The operation was performed only with general anesthesia at a general hospital without cardiopulmonary bypass machine. The intravertebral air (IVA) technique was not applied to this case, although this technique is one of the standard method for general anesthesia during open-heart surgery under deep anesthesia without cardiopulmonary bypass. We believe that the IVA technique was not applied because of the following two reasons: (1) the patient did not complain any respiratory disturbances or hypoxemia after the operation, and (2) the patient's age was a little too high. We report the case, and discuss the reasons in order of age and the patient's body, whether IVA should be applied for elderly patients needing general anesthesia without cardiopulmonary bypass during open-heart surgery in the mitral position or not. For the IVA technique, we should observe closely the patient from the standpoint of age and vital signs. The general anesthesia for patients over 70 years old in the mitral position needs an IVA technique as a standard method. HLA-A and HLA-B polymorphisms in Kedah population, Malaysia, showing strong geography-related differentiation with other Southeast Asia populations\n\nBackground: The Kedah population in Malaysia shares a common cultural and linguistic origin with populations from the Thai-Yunnan region in China. Aims: In this study, we aimed to compare the genetic diversity of the Kedah population with those of other regions in mainland China and in Southeast Asia.Methods: Five hundred blood samples were recruited from a rural area of Kedah and analyzed for genetic variations using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing of class I human leukocyte antigen genes A and B.Results: Results showed that overall genetic diversity is strong with 966 and 866 distinct",

            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
