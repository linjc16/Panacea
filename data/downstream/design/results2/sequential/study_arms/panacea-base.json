Could you please also provide a description of the study sample and the planned study duration? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In our study, the aim was to test a novel approach for the assessment of patient\u2010reported outcomes (PROs), by comparing the two most commonly used instruments\u2010the MRI and the SF\u201036 Health Survey\u2010with the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI\u2010S) scale and with each other in a group of breast cancer patients during their pre\u2010 and post\u2010opertive stay in the hospital. Methods: We consecutively enrolled fifty women affected by invasive breast carcinoma undergoing radical mastectomy and selected forty breast cancer patients without mastectomy (BC). The MRI and the SF\u201036 survey were administered pre\u2010operatively and the patient's status was evaluated by the PGIS scale post\u2010operatively. The SF\u201036, the MRI and PGIS questionnaires were repeated at the seventh\u2010day follow\u2010up in BC patients. Results: The mean and standard deviation of the SF\u201036 scores at pre\u2010operative were very similar between the groups of patients undergoing or not surgery, with the exception of the mean difference of the \u201cEmotional Role Limitations\u201d score (MRI 24.9, S.d. = 41.5 vs SF\u201036 44.5, S.d. = 27.28) which showed a tendency toward deterioration in the MRI group (p=0.01) that was confirmed by the SF\u201036 score (MRI 42/SF\u201036 56, p=0.002). These differences were reversed after surgery, when the mean and the standard deviation of the SF\u201036 scores were more elevated in the MRI group. The PGI\u2010S score was higher than the SF\u201036 in both groups of patients and was not related to any of the SF\u201036 domains before surgery, while it was significantly better than the SF\u201036 scores in MRI patients at the follow\u2010up. The MRI showed a significant correlation with the PGIS scale (r\u00a0=\u00a00.501; p\u00a0<",

[/RESPONSE] Can we evaluate whether this program improves the outcomes for patients with chronic low back pain? [RESPONSE] Yes, of course. We've already included some outcomes such as pain intensity, disability, and quality of life in our study objectives. However, we should also consider other potential outcomes that may be related to chronic low back pain, such as the use of healthcare resources, employment status, and psychological well-being. \n\nWe can explore those outcomes as secondary objectives and incorporate relevant measures into the study protocol.

            "Great! For the fourth study arm, we could combine the self-management program with nurse coaching. Participants in this arm would engage in the self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based nursing coaching sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: There is a lack of studies examining the use of patient activation to enhance engagement in self\u2010management among patients with chronic low back pain. The use of patient activation as the central framework for a nurse\u2010led program may facilitate patient engagement in behavior changes that improve self\u2010management and consequently, outcomes. Methods: The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial to test the proposed intervention. 60 patients with non\u2010specific chronic low back pain will be screened for inclusion and randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups: 1) Self\u2010management intervention; 2) Self\u2010management plus health behavior change counseling; 3) Self\u2010management plus nursing coaching; and 4) Control (usual care). Each intervention group will receive a 6\u2010week group self\u2010management program. The intervention groups will receive either three coaching or counseling sessions, while the control condition will not receive any intervention. Pre\u2010post measures will be used to assess differences in patient engagement in self\u2010management. Changes in self\u2010management behavior and outcomes will be measured by questionnaires and a qualitative interview with four patients from each intervention group. The effect of the intervention on patient engagement in self\u2010management will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis. The effect on self\u2010management behavior and outcomes will be analyzed using structural equation modeling. Discussion: The proposed research will provide important information on the implementation and effectiveness of patient activation as a framework for nurse\u2010led behavioral interventions in chronic low back pain. We expect the interventions to significantly improve patients\u0092 engagement in self\u2010management behavior and enhance clinical outcomes such as self\u2010efficacy and pain impact. The proposed research may have implications for the development of evidence\u2010based, patient\u2010centered nursing interventions for chronic pain."

Objectives: We evaluated the impact of CKD and Hepatobiliary disease (HBD) on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and lurasidone using population pharmacokinetic analysis. Methods: We conducted a phase 1 double\u2010blind, parallel\u2010group study to determine the bioequivalence of orally administered risperidone IR and risperidone LA, and orally administered lurasidone IR and lurasidone HCl. On days 5\u201012, subjects received either two doses of the candidate reference product (CRP) and two doses of the alternate reference product (ARP), or vice versa. Subjects with moderate to severe CKD or mild to moderate HBD had their pharmacokinetic parameters estimated using NONMEM.

Results: The AUC and Cmax of risperidone were similar in both risperidone formulations, with 90% CIs of AUC and Cmax ratio within acceptability criteria (80.00%\u2010125.00%). Across CKD levels, ratios of AUC and Cmax for both risperidone and its active metabolite paliperidone and lurasidone and its active metabolite desalkyl lurasidone were consistent with bioequivalence.

This approach has identified only 10% to 30% of patients with non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who may benefit from single\u2010agent ICI therapy, leading to the need for more effective ICI agents.Objective: To evaluate durvalumab in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (platinum\u2010based therapy) compared with platinum\u2010based therapy alone in patients with untreated stage III NSCLC inadequately treated with surgery or radiation therapy.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Phase 3 PACIFIC trial was a multicenter, open\u2010label, randomized trial conducted at 234 academic and community practices in 34 countries between December 28, 2015, and September 8, 2017. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 10 doses of durvalumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks PD\u2010L1 expression, or platinum\u2010based therapy in the neoadjuvant setting and continued 1 year later as sequential maintenance therapy after completion of chemotherapy. This is an interim analysis of OS in patients with stage III NSCLC and no known EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) sensitizing mutations, a population that represents a large fraction of patients in the standard of care treatment population. Data analysis was conducted during August 28, 2018, to January 17, 2019.Data Analysis: Of 713 patients, 500 were included in this analysis; 251 had disease progression or died prior to an OS event and 249 were alive at 24\u2010month OS assessment. The trial is continuing and the median follow\u2010up is about 24 months (range, 0\u201029.2 months).

What are your thoughts on this study arm? \nAbstract:\nBackground & aims: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a very poor prognosis. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in patients with resectable disease, although its effect on overall survival is modest and the long\u2010term survival of patients with PDAC remains dismal. Furthermore, patients may already present with metastatic disease and in this setting, no cure is available with conventional chemotherapies, although novel therapeutic approaches, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapy, are being investigated. Thus, there is an unmet medical need to find effective therapies to increase the survival of PDAC patients. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a one\u2010year nutritional intervention, including advice about carbohydrate intake, on health\u2010related quality of life (HRQOL), physical activity, body composition, and biomarkers in patients with PDAC. Methods: We performed a single\u2010center, randomized, controlled, assessor\u2010blinded clinical trial at a large academic oncology center. The study was registered as NCT03706382. Eligibility criteria included patients with histologically confirmed resectable or metastatic disease, scheduled to start chemotherapy, age \u226518 years, no major weight loss within the past 30 days, and no concomitant metabolic disease. Patients were randomized (1:1) to an intervention group (carbohydrate restriction, 30\u201350g/day) or a control group (standard\u2010of\u2010care [SoC], >130g/day).

Colon\u2010specific colon cancer (CRC) and liver metastases (LM) are associated with poorer clinical outcomes than rectal\u2010specific rectal cancer (RRC) and liver metastases (RLM). Whether the differences are due to the intrinsic properties of CRC and RRC or treatment differences remains unclear. Methods. A total of 406 colon cancer (CC), RRC, and patients with LM were included. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and secondary outcomes included recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) and response rate (RR) in each subgroup. Results.

Are there any measurements or assessments that would require physical examination or collection of biological specimens? \n\nStudy\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nNeck and back pain are among the leading causes of disability in the United States, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 70% for neck pain and 84% for low back pain. Many chronic pain patients (53% for neck pain) seek alternative treatments. One such treatment, Pneumatic Compression Therapy, is a technique that involves mechanically compressing and decompressing a localized area in order to promote lymphatic flow, reduce localized lymphedema, and relieve pain. Preliminary data from human studies has demonstrated that PCT relieves pain due to inflammation, but the underlying mechanisms of action of this treatment are not well understood. Our long term goal is to mechanistically understand the mechanism of pain relief delivered by PCT in order to optimize and expand this treatment. This has been a focus of our lab since early 2020, when we began to explore the utility of the novel NIRF-LI imaging technique for the purposes of measuring the lymphatic properties of the body as well as non-invasive detection of inflammation. In a pilot clinical trial, we have successfully demonstrated the use of our NIRF-LI imaging method to detect inflammation, in the form of raised lymphatic vessel density, in the axillary lymph nodes of patients with COVID-19. Here, we seek to leverage this novel imaging modality to further study the lymphatic and pain-mediating properties of the Pneubelt pneumatic compression device. This imaging technology has great potential to inform the diagnosis and treatment of inflammation-related diseases such as chronic neck and back pain.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nNeck and back pain are among the leading causes of disability in the United States, with an estimated 25% lifetime prevalence. Nearly half of American adults will experience low back pain during their lifetime, with the lifetime prevalence of neck pain being even higher at 70%.

The study aims to investigate whether a medication safety educational program using an interactive app designed for Drugs.gov website is effective in improving medication safety-related attitudes and knowledge among adult health consumers in Malaysia from April to June 2023.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground and Rationale: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 4 to 6.5 million deaths are linked to medication errors throughout the world, which makes medication safety a global issue. Medication errors occur frequently in the primary care settings regardless of countries or health care systems. A cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia (SA) among healthcare professionals (HCPs) reported that healthcare providers encountered 1.9 incidents per each month. The study also showed the most common risk factors for medication incidents were medication errors and/or adverse events (69.6%) and prescribing (70.0%) respectively. The study also reported that the most commonly involved medications in the near misses included antibiotics (46.8%), anticoagulants (33.7%), gastrointestinal (GI) medications (21.9%), and vitamins (4.9%), respectively. The majority of drugs were in tablet formulation and the most frequent routes of administration were oral (61.1%) and topical preparations (54.9%). The highest and lowest medication incidents, in terms of frequency, occurred in general practice (1.6 per month) and in emergency departments (0.1 per month) respectively. In Malaysia, inappropriate prescription of medication in primary care settings has been reported among community pharmacists. It is estimated that 70% of the drugs collected at community pharmacies were repackaged and given to patients inappropriately compared to those prescribed by doctors. In addition, inappropriate prescription of herbal medications to patients has been reported. A study conducted in primary health care facilities in Malaysia among young adult (18-35) patients reported that herbal medications and food supplements were frequently prescribed. Most",

In Group 1, 500,000 units of epinephrine, in Group 2, 250,000 units of epinephrine, and in both Group 3 and the control group, only bupivacaine (5 mg/kg) were used. The lowest diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the control group by the time the patients were transferred to the delivery room. All the other parameters studied did not differ significantly among the groups.

The main feature of acute hypercapnia is the accumulation of end-tidal CO2 due to alveolar ventilation. This is common in COPD and asthma. The purpose of oxygen combined with CPAP is to avoid respiratory acidosis caused by hypoxemia, which can reduce the risk of acute respiratory failure. However, some patients have acute hypercapnia due to sleep apnea, which requires treatment from sleep apnea. Hypercapnia is common in critically ill patients caused by increased carbon dioxide due to acute hypercapnia, poor response to mechanical ventilation, and hypoperfusion of the alveoli. This hypercapnia can lead to cardiac arrhythmia, increased intracranial pressure, and decreased cardiac output. At present, there are mainly non-invasive mechanical ventilation and intubation for patients with hypercapnia, but no research data are currently available.\n\nHealth condition(s) or problem(s) studied\n=================\nHypercapnia\n\nCondition category\n=================\nRespiratory\n\nPrimary outcome\n=================\nThe amount of oxygen used in the treatment;",

This study was designed to determine the efficacy of chitosan on wound healing in an animal model and its efficacy compared to SSD in patients with burns or wounds. Materials and Methods: A randomized double\u2010blind controlled trial was conducted amongst patients with full\u2010thickness burns or wounds. The experimental group was treated with chitosan based cream along with chloramphenicol eye drops while the control group was treated with the commercially available silver sulphadiazine gel. Patients were clinically evaluated everyday for pain, bleeding, swelling, erythema and discharge of fluid. Microbial cultures of the wound were also done and the percent healing was assessed with a ruler. Results: A total of 60 patients were included in the study and the duration of the study was an average of 14 days. 75% of participants in the experimental group as compared to 91.6% for the control group had a complete epithelialization and were pain\u2010free. No patient in the control group reported any side effects while 18% of the participants in the experimental group had itching, mild burning sensation and redness around the wound which subsided after 24 to 48 hr. Conclusion: Chitosan is a better alternative for treating burns and wounds when compared to SSD and could be used extensively in India.",

A 6-week standardized treadmill training regimen consisting of 20-minute running bouts over 3 consecutive days (70-80% of the initial maximum heart rate) will be applied (maximum heart rate = 220-age). The effects of the training program will be compared to a non-trained control group (n = 5). Measurements, such as, blood pressure and plasma glucose levels will be taken before and after standardized physical activity. The study is part of bachelor's and master's theses from the School of Physiotherapy at the University of South-Eastern Norway.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe purpose of the present study is: To investigate physiological changes in healthy middle-aged men due to a short period of moderate-intensity treadmill running training. More specifically, the effects on systemic oxidative stress, body composition, exercise performance in the 20-minute running protocol, and the effects on blood pressure levels are evaluated. The study aims to investigate the effect of an acute bout of exercise in relation to cardiovascular response during and after exercise. The study sample consist of 5 healthy, middle-aged men who are not used to practicing physical activity, who have already been asked orally and in writing for participation. The planned study start is the end of November 2014.

What do you think? \n\nAbstract:\nEighteen patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a sternotomy were evaluated. The patients were divided into a group receiving 300 mg of vitamin B12 orally prior to the operation (prevention group) and a group not receiving any form of vitamin B12 supplementation (control group). The results of the study were analyzed using the Mann\u2010Whitney U test and a chi\u2010square test. All patients underwent transarterial coronary artery bypass grafting with or without valve surgery. No perioperative mortality (in\u2010hospital, at 30 days) or morbidity (reoperation for bleeding, graft failure, stroke, low cardiac output syndrome, renal failure requiring dialysis, and low cardiac output requiring a vasoactive agent) was observed. In one case, sternal decubitus with the sternostomy drainage system in situ was necessary because of prolonged low cardiac output syndrome, which was not related to vitamin B12 deficiency. The postoperative mean intensive care unit length of stay, median hospital stay, or mortality rates were not significantly different between the two groups. We conclude that perioperative prophylactic use of vitamin B12 is not required for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a sternotomy.Copyright 2018 Changchun University of Chinese Medicine",

Participants in the control arm will also continue with standard pre-eclampsia prophylaxis and their usual antihypertensive treatment. \nA detailed description of the control arm is as follows: Starting from the 16th week of gestation, participants will consume a daily 70 ml of Beet-It Sport\u00ae. This is a placebo that will serve as the control group and will not contain nitrates. Similar to participants in the experimental arm, participants in the control arm will also continue with standard pre-eclampsia prophylaxis and their usual antihypertensive treatment.

Dopamine A receptor agonists like bromocriptine and pergolide are reported to be very effective in the treatment of EFGR and have proved their safety after prolonged use. However, the management of EFGR still remains a challenge as fetal death with good\u2010birth\u2010weight remains high with current treatment regimens. The present study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of Bromocriptine in improving outcome in women with EFGR. This was a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study carried out in the Government College of Home\u2010opathy, Kolkata, West Bengal from 2013 to 2015. In this study, 51 patients of EFGR were divided into two groups\u2010 Group B\u2010bromocriptine and Group P\u2010placebo. Bromocriptine was administered (5 mg two times daily) in Group B. In group P, the placebo was given two times daily. In both groups, doppler studies were carried out at weekly intervals. In those who did not respond to initial treatment, a repeat dose of 5 mg two times daily was given and the dosage of bromocriptine was reduced after 4 weeks in group B. In this comparative study, no significant differences were noticed between the two groups as regards improvement in Doppler parameters and fetal growth rate. These results suggest that in addition to other management protocols bromocriptine and pergolide should not be routinely used in EFGR.",

Could you also share the study design details? \n\nStudy type\n=================\nInterventional study\n\nStudy design\n=================\nParallel\n\nDescription\n=================\nRationale\n-----------------\nAt the time of diagnosis, most of MS patients are unaware of disease severity due to a relatively low level of disability and have the hope of becoming free of symptoms. However, MS is a chronic disorder that develops through a relentless deterioration of the nervous system that can lead to disability and reduced quality of life for patients, as well as a significant increase in total health care costs. Therefore, an early initiation of disease modifying therapy (DMT) in progressive phase may improve clinical outcomes. Interferon (INF)-Beta-1b is a commonly used DMT and can be applied as Subcutaneous Injection (SC-INF) or in Patient Administered Injection (PAI)-INF. PAI-INF does not require training and can be administered at home by patients or their family members. PAI-INF is advantageous in that it minimizes the burden on health resources by reducing the number of visits to hospitals and clinics. In addition, injection method is associated with treatment compliance due to improved patient satisfaction. \nPatients are unaware that early initiation of therapeutic intervention is an important factor for the prevention or attenuation of disability in MS. Therefore, patient satisfaction is closely associated with patient compliance. The most common side effects of PAI-INF associated with the injection procedure are pain, skin rash and itching. Pain and injection site reactions are reported in up to 69% of patients when using PAIs, and the frequency of pain increases with repeated use. Although a number of studies have examined skin reactions, such as erythema, pruritus, etc., to INFs, there is limited research on pain caused by injection itself. Pain is significantly higher in PAI-INF than in SC-INF, suggesting that it is an important factor to consider in the use of PAI-INF in the treatment of MS patients. However, no studies have compared the injection pain between the two groups.\nPAI-IFN is administered less often than SC-INF: the frequency of injection was about 5 to 7 times lower for PAI-INF within a 21-day",

It has been reported that early termination of an arrhythmic event by direct current (DC) shock has a higher success rate. However, most SVT is shock resistant. Objective The clinical effects of a new DC shock protocol for terminating SVT, delivered at 1.5 to 3 joules with an initial energy of 1.5 joules, were evaluated by measuring the success rate of terminating SVT and arrhythmia conversion time. Methods A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients who experienced sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and whose hemodynamics were stable were included. Patients in group A received 1.5 joules and a 30\u2010second monitoring period followed by 3 joules if the SVT persisted, while patients in group B received 3 joules immediately. If the patients had hemodynamic or ECG instability, standard treatment was applied. Results Of the 100 patients included in the study, 40 were in group A and 60 were in group B. The mean monitoring time was greater in group A than in group B (16 seconds vs. 4.5 seconds, P < 0.05). No significant difference in arrhythmia termination (92.5% in group A vs. 88.3% in group B, P > 0.05), arrhythmia conversion time (69.5 seconds vs. 58 seconds, P > 0.05), hemodynamic changes (P > 0.05), and adverse effect rates (P > 0.05) were observed between the two groups. Conclusions Early DC shocking at 1.5 to 3 joules can be used as the first treatment strategy for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This protocol may result in early termination of SVT, although it is a novel approach.",
            "Is there a placebo arm in the trial? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe main objective of this study is to find out whether taking a daily supplement of 1000 mg of the antioxidant vitamin E supplement has an effect on the incidence of headaches in patients with tension headaches who have failed to respond to treatment with simple analgesics. The investigators have decided to test the possible antioxidant mechanism of action of vitamin E by determining a) how much plasma vitamin E increases after taking 1000 mg of vitamin E compared with a dose of 400 mg of vitamin E given earlier in the trial and, more importantly, b) how much plasma vitamin E decreases after stopping 1000 mg of vitamin E compared with a dose of 400 mg of vitamin E given earlier in the trial. The investigators hypothesis is that the changes from baseline in plasma vitamin E concentration between the two vitamin E groups will differ significantly. By testing both of these hypotheses at the same time in the same population of patients, the investigators will determine whether vitamin E plays an important role in the maintenance of plasma vitamin E levels that is different from a placebo effect. If plasma vitamin E is unable to maintain plasma vitamin E levels significantly higher than placebo then presumably vitamin E does not provide an important long term benefit over a placebo. A placebo-controlled trial is the ideal method of determining this so the investigators are planning this as a multicenter trial involving several tertiary referral headache centres. If the study shows that plasma vitamin E concentrations remain higher than placebo on 1000 mg of vitamin E for at least one week and possibly three weeks then this will give clinical support to testing the clinical effect of higher doses of vitamin E on reducing the frequency of tension-type headaches\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe main objective of this study is to determine whether there is a long term antioxidant effect of alpha-tocopheryl acetate (d-alpha-tocopherol acetate, vitamin E) on the prevalence of headaches in patients with unilateral or bilateral chronic tension-type headaches who have failed to respond to treatment with simple analgesics.

What do you think the primary and secondary outcomes should be? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: COVID\u201019 may cause mild illness in some children, such as cough or fever, but it can also cause severe disease in children, such as pneumonia. Children 12 to 17 years of age experience the most hospitalization\u2010related morbidity and mortality for COVID\u201019. Limited data are available on the safety and efficacy of different pharmacologic treatments for COVID\u201019 in children, and the American Academy of Pediatrics has not yet recommended any specific medications for this age group. In adults with COVID\u201019, various drugs have been investigated, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and monoclonal antibodies; none have demonstrated conclusive benefit. Methods: For this study, we collected deidentified data from the pediatric electronic health record of the children who received monoclonal antibody infusions during their initial COVID\u201019 illness. Data were collected prospectively on whether monoclonal antibodies decreased the need for hospitalization and other outcomes. Results: 11 patients received monoclonal antibodies, of whom 41% had at least 1 outcome related to COVID\u201019 illness. The most common outcome was a positive change noted on home oxygen saturation (29%), and 6% of patients were hospitalized. Monoclonal antibodies may have decreased hospitalization (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.3 [95% confidence interval , 0.02\u20130.83]\u00a0in the bivariate model; IRR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.09\u20131.62] in the multivariate model).

The overall 5\u2010year survival rate for patients with advanced or metastatic disease in the UK is only 2%. Currently, there are no targeted therapies for advanced disease, other than chemotherapy with gemcitabine\u2010based regimens, which prolongs survival in about 30% of patients. The combination of capecitabine and nab\u2010paclitaxel in an attempt to overcome chemoresistance has gained recent traction in the treatment of advanced disease. Objective: To present the results of a prospective phase 2 study, NIBIT\u20101213 (NCT02405745), conducted at the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, evaluating the efficacy of nab\u2010paclitaxel plus capecitabine as a first\u2010line treatment in advanced disease. Methods: One hundred and twenty patients with advanced PC were treated with nab\u2010paclitaxel (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 and capecitabine (2000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily days 1 to 14; every 3 weeks) on an outpatient basis. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR) at 6 weeks assessed by RECIST 1.1. Patients with disease\u2010free survival of > 12 weeks post entry and who completed 6 therapy cycles were eligible for crossover treatment with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 and 8) once daily every 3 weeks. Results: One hundred and twenty patients (pts) were recruited between November 2013 until November 2016. The median age of the pts was 60 years (37\u201076 years) with 63% males; 90% were stage 4 and 58% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0\u20101.

In preclinical  non-human studies, antibodies targeting BCMA have shown anti-tumor activity in  multiple myeloma. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that decreases production of immune system chemicals in the body that cause inflammation [1]. Elotuzumab is a humanized immunoglobulin \u03b31 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7), which is preferentially expressed on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and B cells. Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) which is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cell cancer. In combination with low-dose dexamethasone as part of the pomalidomide pomalyst (POM) (dexamethasone) in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients, pomalidomide acts like an agent that affects the immune system (immune system) and can reduce lymphocytes, white blood cells (including white blood cells). Pomalidomide and its metabolites act differently from and are not chemotherapeutic agents like melphalan. Pomalidomide and lenalidomide are not therapeutically equivalent [2].

It has been shown to prevent the formation of new blood vessels in tumors and inhibit tumor growth. Blocking VEGF may also enhance the immune response against cancer.\n- Cemiplimab is a human monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody that works by blocking the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on immune cells. This helps enhance the immune response against cancer cells.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with!"

Studies have shown that the hot EMR technique is associated with higher rates of adverse events and recurrence compared to the cold EMR technique. Despite this, there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials comparing the two techniques. In recent years, the endoscopist preference for the use of diathermic snare in the large colon has increased due to increased success rates, decreased treatment time, and improved patient satisfaction. However, the efficacy and safety of mucosectomy with a diathermic snare for large colonic adenomas remain unclear.

The aim of this observational study was to evaluate long\u2010term efficacy of percutaneous tumor ablation in advanced cirrhosis with unresectable HCC. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study comprising a total of 300 cases with HCC from March 2011 to October 2018 who were treated with radiofrequencyablation (RFA) or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) for HCC in advanced cirrhosis. The study subjects were divided into two groups according to whether the patients had liver cirrhosis (LC) or not. The clinical and imaging data of the patients were analyzed. Kaplan\u2010Meier method and Cox regression were used for survival analysis. Results: Fifty\u2010six cases were treated with RFA and 161 cases were with PEI for HCC in advanced cirrhosis.

The outcomes were evaluated in terms of complications, cost, convenience during dressing change, and patient and healthcare provider satisfaction. Results: This study shows that the healing period was statistically significantly different in the 1st and 2nd study stages. Although the mean healing period for the S/A group was 27 days, it was 25 days for the P\u2010200 group, with a significant difference of 1.8 days. The healing period for the S/A and P\u2010200 groups was 10.9 and 11 days, respectively. The difference between 2 groups was not statistically significant.

In the present study we have compared the efficacy and safety of large\u2010volume paracentesis versus albumin infusion as initial treatment modality in patients with ascites secondary to cirrhosis. Eighty patients with ascites of at least two months duration secondary to cirrhosis were studied in a randomized, open, prospective study, with crossover design. The patients were allocated randomly to one of two treatment groups: paracentesis (group A) received 3.5 L of paracentesis and 15 g of hydroxyethyl starch in the first 24 hours and 10 g of hydroxyethyl starch daily for three days, whereas group B received 2 g/kg of human albumin intravenously during the first three days. Hemodynamic measurements were performed before starting treatment and after three days. Clinical outcome of the two treatment modalities, paracentesis and albumin infusion respectively, was studied by physical examination, blood tests and electrocardiography. After three days, when the crossover design entered into action, the ascites could not be controlled adequately in 10 of 40 patients in group A and albumin infusion was indicated; on the other hand, none of the patients in group B required a change in the treatment protocol. Thus, large\u2010volume paracentesis is not superior to albumin infusion in controlling refractory ascites. We believe that albumin might have beneficial effects on other features of cirrhosis."

The use of TACE or RE is accompanied by increases in serum levels of lactate, which is known to occur with low hepatic synthesis of alanine aminotransferase and glutamine depletion, in turn resulting in liver dysfunction and renal failure. Furthermore, serum lactate has been associated with reduced survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, this study aims to evaluate if lactate, serum amino acids, organ blood flow, and endothelial function (assessed by flow-mediated dilatation) are different in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who receive TACE versus RE.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nVascular and Hepatic Changes Associated With Trans-Arterial Interventions (TACE or RE) in Patients With Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Radiation: radioembolization\n* Procedure: trans-arterial chemoembolization\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients who have cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma Patients who are scheduled for trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radioembolization (RE) Patients who have not undergone trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radioembolization (RE) in"

There is also an absence of effective biomarkers in this disease, and there is limited understanding of why some patients with similar tumors respond to treatments while others do not.\n\nIn the study, the investigators use the 2-deoxy-2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) technology to help surgeons map out the most efficient and safe surgical approaches in patients with a new glioblastoma (GBM), who have been randomly assigned to receive surgery and chemoradiation. A CT scan with contrast of the brain is also used to define tumor location, size and shape. With the aim of improving the removal of the tumor, the investigators use data from these scans to determine the tumor volume, anatomical obstacles, and to create a 3D model of the brain and tumor in the patient. Then, they use information from the CT scan to create a template of the brain using special software. Finally, the investigators register the patient's brain in the space of the model brain to make a personalized model to predict the patient's post-operative functions following surgical resection of the tumor. Post-operative prediction of functions is conducted using a previously established and validated function assessment system.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nOptimal Tumor Removal With PET-Driven Surgery - Phase 2\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nRecurrent Glioblastoma, Adult\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Radiation: 3-Dimensional Positioning and Surgery Planning\n* Radiation: Stereotactic Biopsy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: A minimum age of 18.

I hope that this study will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of transcutaneous spinal stimulation for shortening ventilator dependence in patients with respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nStudy protocol: Spinal Cord Stimulation to Reduce Ventilator Dependence in Patients With COVID-19\nAbstract:\nBackground: Respiratory distress syndrome is one of the main complications resulting in high mortality in patients with COVID\u201019. There is a pressing need to develop effective interventions for reducing ventilator dependence in these patients. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as a potential therapy. A systematic review and meta\u2010analysis of ten randomized controlled trials showed that cervical cord stimulation (CCS) resulted in shorter breathing tube duration, shorter hospital stay, and less mortality compared to conventional medical treatment. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of SCS in reducing ventilator dependence in patients with respiratory distress syndrome and other causes of acute respiratory failure, as well as evaluate the safety of SCS. Methods: This is a single\u2010center, randomized, double\u2010blind controlled study. This study will enroll adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure caused by respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, sepsis, or other causes deemed appropriate by the primary investigator, and patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019 pneumonia. Patients with indications for SCS and those requiring continuous ventilation support for at least 72 hours will be included in the study. Exclusion criteria include a history of severe head trauma, spinal cord disease, or spine surgery; severe cognitive impairment; spinal abscess or spine infection; coagulation dysfunction; and spinal cord injury. Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups: the study group and the control group. The study group will receive SCS therapy, whereas the control group will receive conventional medical treatment. The primary outcome is ventilator dependence in 28 days, whereas the secondary outcomes are duration of ventilator dependence, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital death, hospital readmissions within six months after discharge, and the incidence of side effects.

Psychological resilience is the ability to adapt and adapt positively to challenging experiences. This can include facing stress, dealing with change, or coping with adversity. Counseling is a form of therapy, in which a trained professional provides guidance, support, and tools to help individuals manage their thoughts and emotions. Both psychological resilience and counseling are important topics to explore when considering nursing students' well-being. \n\n\nIn particular, I am interested in exploring the following research questions regarding psychological resilience and counseling for nursing students:\n\n1. What is the current state of psychological resilience among nursing students?\n2. What are the challenges facing nursing students in terms of their psychological resilience and mental health?\n3. What types of counseling services or interventions would be most effective in promoting psychological resilience and supporting the mental health of nursing students?\n4. How can technology be used to deliver counseling services and interventions to nursing students in a convenient and accessible manner?\n5. How can nursing schools and hospitals create a supportive environment for nursing students to promote their psychological resilience and mental health? \n\n\nTo explore these research questions, I propose a mixed methods approach to combining quantitative and qualitative research methods. Quantitative methods will involve conducting a survey to assess nursing students' psychological resilience and mental health, as well as their experiences with counseling services and interventions. Qualitative methods will involve conducting interviews and focus groups to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by nursing students and the strategies they use to cope with stress and promote their psychological resilience. \n\n\n\n1.

Surgical techniques for breast reconstruction have been adapted to help prevent the development of lymphedema. The purpose of this study is to determine if the placement of internal sutures during closure of the axillary cavity significantly decreases postoperative arm swelling. Methods: The investigators hypothesize that arm swelling, as measured by arm circumference, will be significantly reduced in the treatment group versus the control group at 2 weeks and 1 year after surgery. Design: Patients presenting for breast reconstruction with a mastectomy and axillary node surgery will be asked to take part in the study. After the completion of the resection, one arm will be randomized to the treatment arm (internal sutures placed upon closure of the axillary cavity) and one arm will be randomized to the control arm (sutures to close the axillary cavity will not be placed internally). The treatment will be performed on the side of the operation with the control placed on the opposite side.

The risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is about 8% (range 0\u201038%). This study aimed to investigate the risk factors and evaluate the prognostic significance of high\u2010risk features identified by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in GSTM. METHODS: Data of 628 consecutive patients who underwent EUS assessment and subsequent ESDs with curative intent were retrospectively reviewed. The association of LNM on EUS staging and pathology with preoperative clinical parameters and tumor characteristics was assessed. Results: LNM was observed in 25 patients (4.0%) which were confirmed by post\u2010ESD pathology. Higher rates of LNM were observed in lesions greater than 2 cm and with an irregular borders. Independent risk factors for LNM were size>2cm and irregular margins on pre\u2010ESD EUS evaluation (P=0.037 and P=0.003). None of the tumor characteristics or comorbidities including age, gender, location, ulceration, depth of stromal invasion, or vascular invasion correlated with LNM. Of the 573 tumors with curative resection, the 3\u2010year LRFS after ESD was 94% and the 3\u2010year RFS was 95%. Tumors with high\u2010risk characteristics on EUS were not found to associate with survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: A total of 4% of GSTMs had associated lymphatic invasion. High risk of LNM was limited to tumors with irregular borders and >2cm. None of the pre\u2010ESD tumor characteristics were found to predict LNM or affect prognosis",

The second study arm is the control group, also known as the \"no intervention\" group. Participants do not receive any specific intervention or treatment and continue with their usual routines. \n\nThis article aims to discuss the importance of the parent-child relationship in the development of children, the role of siblings in promoting adaptive behavior, family stress and adjustment, and the need to improve services and support for parents and siblings. The study will investigate the application of an innovative web-application tool that aims to promote a cohesive and cooperative family environment, reduce psychological distress in parents, promote social-emotional functioning and academic performance in children with a disability, and enhance the health and social well-being of all family members. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nSibling relationships typically begin at birth and evolve in conjunction with the child's development. As the child's cognitive and emotional development progresses, their perception and needs of siblings change and this may impact their relationship with them. Sibling relationships play a fundamental role in the healthy development of children beyond that of parents. However, studies show that there is a relationship between the family environment and the development of the sibling. Therefore, improving the coexistence and relationships between brothers and sisters is crucial for developing the entire family and promoting healthy family environments. In this context, the importance of identifying the factors that impact the quality of family relationships becomes increasingly relevant, as this can help us design and implement interventions aimed at improving communication, enhancing empathy, and reducing maladaptive behavior in families with children with special needs. Research shows that families face challenges in balancing the needs of all family members, which can lead to high rates of family stress and adjustment problems. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in addition to presenting a higher level of difficulty in social interaction and communication, also have challenges integrating into a schooling environment. This poses an additional challenge for parents, especially mothers, who become their primary caregivers. Studies show that parental overinvolvement and emotional exhaustion are associated with increased stress levels. This can strain parent-child relationships, and increase the likelihood of family problems. In short, research suggests that children with ASD have",

Methods: A total of 30 consecutive Asherman patients who had undergone USSM\u2010DCC of Asherman Syndrome (AS) were included, were divided into two groups. The first receiving NAC pretreatment (N;300 mg), a week prior to the operation and repeated every 6 hours for seven days postoperatively and the other receiving placebo (B).

            "I absolutely agree. Having a control group is an essential part of the study's design to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. It will allow us to draw accurate conclusions about the impact of the stress ball on pain perception. \n\n[STUDY ADVANCE]\n[INCL] I think inclusion of only one injection site per subject is a reasonable methodology. It is likely that the injection pain would be similar at different areas of the body if a single injection site is selected for each subject. [/INCL] The selected site of subcutaneous injection varies by study and may be influenced by personal preferences and/or medical reasons. Therefore, it is logical to only include one injection site in terms of scientific validity and feasibility. Additionally, using one injection site in a study design allows for greater comparability between subjects in terms of pain perception and can reduce the potential for bias. Moreover, it ensures that the findings of the study can be generalized to a wider population, as the same site and injection method may be applicable to different patient groups. \n\n[EXCL] This trial has a relatively short follow-up period of six weeks, so there is a risk that confounding factors may emerge during the study period, interfering with the assessment of pain perception in the study population. However, if the intervention group has significantly lower levels of pain perception compared to the control group, it is highly unlikely that confounding factors can account for this difference. [/EXCL] The six-week duration of the study is considered sufficient to observe any possible differences in pain perception between the intervention and control groups. Longer studies with more follow-up visits may be necessary to fully understand the effects of the intervention. \n\n[OUTCOME] How will the primary outcome be measured?",

Methods: Patients who underwent single\u2010leg HTO for varus or valgus knee deformities and were 5 years from their index HTO were identified and included in this study. The Tegner knee function score and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to assess the health\u2010related quality of life (HRQL) 2 years after the index HTO. Associations between HRQL and patient characteristics were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLMs). Results: The current study included 245 patients (mean age 51.8 years, 71% female). HRQL was significantly decreased from 20.3 (SD 3.6) before to 14.3 (SD 2.4) after 2 years. The most pronounced changes were seen in pain (from 44.5 (SD 6.4) to 34.2 (SD 4.9) points), symptoms (from 56 (SD 8.9) to 43.8 (SD 9.4) points) and physical function scores (from 45.4 (SD 6.3) to 36.2 (SD 5.2) points). In the generalized linear models, female sex was associated with decreased HRQL [Tegner: \u20101.2, p = 0.004, KOOS Subscale: \u20100.8\u20101.5, p = 0.012\u20100.04]. An increased age at the time of reconstruction was not associated with the health\u2010related quality of life. Conclusion: In conclusion, HRQL is negatively affected by HTO. The greatest decreases are seen at two years after reconstruction for the pain, symptoms and physical function subscales of KOOS. Female sex is associated with worse HRQL."

            "According to the treatment guidelines of the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) in the UK, the target volumes should be delineated according to the breast cancer stages. For patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk breast cancer, the target volume should generally include the whole breast and regional lymph nodes. For patients with high-risk breast cancer, the target volume may include the whole breast, regional lymph nodes, and chest wall. In contrast, for patients with very high-risk breast cancer, the target volume may include the whole breast, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and internal mammary nodes. The extent of target volumes may vary depending on the breast cancer stage and the patient's situation. Therefore, we recommend that the target volumes for different study arms be determined based on the patient's breast cancer stages and the RCR guidelines.

Can you tell me more about the intervention or treatment that will be used? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study was initiated through a collaborative project between Korea National Cancer Center and Samsung Pharm Co, Ltd. The drug used in this study, JHU 2-10, is a highly active receptor for the human epidermal growth factor type 2 (HER2) with unique structure of HER2 dimerization. It is a highly purified drug produced from a single molecular, with no contamination from other similar drugs. There is currently no approved drug in Korea for patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer with a HER2 mutation (or known HER2 amplification). The drug in this study, JHU 2-10, has been administered in previous clinical trials and showed evidence of tolerability and antitumor effect. Therefore, this study was aimed to perform a clinical study to determine proper methods of administering this drug and the best dose to minimize side effects and maximize efficacy.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is a dose-escalation study for the drug JHU 2-10 to determine the optimal treatment dose. The study was conducted under a Simon design and patients were equally divided into 6 different groups according to the dose of JHU 2-10. Patients were treated every 3 weeks for 2 cycles without a rest period (21 days). Patients who were treated with the drug for 2 cycles at each dose were assessed for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Drug-related side effects evaluated for DLT assessment included hematological and non-hematological toxicities, such as neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension and peripheral neuropathy. DLT was assessed at the end of the second cycle of drug administration, when symptoms resolved or after a 3-week interval, whichever was longer. If a patient was confirmed to have DLT, the next dose group was added to the trial. Otherwise, 2 more patients will be enrolled in the current group, and the patient cohort for assessing DLT will be assessed after 3 more weeks of follow-up.

To investigate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin for prevention of exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Materials and methods. A 36\u2010month multicenter open\u2010label, prospective, randomized controlled study was performed on 59 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were treated with alogliptin (n=29) and glimepiride (n=30). The effects of treatment on pulmonary functions, 6\u2010minute walking distance (6MWD), symptoms of exacerbation, and lung cancer risk factors were compared. Results. Alogliptin was effective in preventing exacerbations, leading to reduction in the frequency of exacerbation from 3.17\u00b11.74 to 0.00\u00b10.00 per year and total days of exacerbation from 28.48\u00b151.12 to 0.00\u00b10.00 days in COPD patients, whereas glimepiride was not. Significant changes in symptoms of COPD were also observed in the alogliptin group, and lung cancer risk factors significantly decreased in the alogliptin group compared to the glimepiride group. Conclusions. Alogliptin improved exacerbation and prevention of symptoms of COPD as well as risk factors of lung cancer in patients with COPD. Thus, alogliptin could reduce risks of lung cancer and exacerbations of COPD.",

Please provide me with a brief description of the interventions. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The clinical problem is that many patients treated by gastroenterologists complain about digestive ailments and often consult non\u2010conventional practitioners. This may be related to lifestyle (anxiolitic and antidepressant) factors, as well as dietary factors (rich in refined carbohydrates), which are more easily available. Methods & analysis: We will use a two\u2010arm cluster randomised controlled clinical trial design; a cohort of 200 patients from clinical practice, divided into two groups that will receive either a conventional treatment intervention or nutritional/dietetic intervention for digestion. The nutritional intervention will offer information about the diet and lifestyle modification. The conventional treatment intervention will offer conventional clinical practice for digestion. Primary outcomes are as follows: general health (EuroQol\u20105D), functional gastrointestinal disorders [Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI)], quality of life (EuroQol\u20105D), and clinical outcomes (clinical examination, laboratory tests, nutritional assessment, gastroscopy and endoscopy). Secondary outcomes are as follows: anxiety, depression and stress [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)]; digestive function (self\u2010report scales); nutritional assessment (nutritional laboratory tests); digestive symptoms and behaviours (questionnaires); daily habits and attitudes related to nutrition (Nutrition Behaviour Questionnaire); daily habits and attitudes related to physical activity (Physical Activity Questionnaire); daily habits and attitudes related to stress, anxiety and depression (Daily Mood Log). Ethics and dissemination: This intervention will be conducted and evaluated according to the National Health Council (CONSORT) and the SPIRIT guidelines. The results will be discussed in a scientific forum in a way that they are made available to all researchers interested in the area.

It's important to carefully design study arms to ensure that the trial is effective and provides accurate results. \n\nAbstract:\nObjectives: To assess the clinical significance of the recently introduced automated technique known as the single bundle technique (SBT) in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using the radial artery graft. Background: SBT is an innovative technique that allows surgeons to place various anastomoses for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with a single needle inserted into the artery over 2 needles. However, the clinical significance of the SBT remains to be determined. Procedure: SBT was performed in 60 patients undergoing CABG with the radial artery graft. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: experimental (n\u00a0= 30) and control (n\u00a0= 30). The experimental group underwent CABG using the single needle technique, while the control group underwent CABG using traditional manual techniques. The primary outcomes of the study were bleeding complications, sternal wound infection, and in\u2010hospital cardiac complications. Results: The SBT was successfully performed in all 60 patients. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of baseline characteristics. On follow\u2010up, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups in terms of in\u2010hospital bleeding and cardiac complications. In spite of the fact that the SBT was not inferior to the manual technique, the graft was opened in only 1 patient in the experimental group. The SBT allows for a faster and easier radial artery harvest, reducing the operative time significantly. Conclusion: SBT is a new technique for harvesting the radial artery by using the same needle. This technique can be used in the majority of patients, and it leads to shorter surgical time and fewer surgical stress and adverse outcomes."

            "Regarding design details, I suggest choosing one or more alternative designs that match the nature of your trial. This will make it faster and easier to find participants. Here are some possible options for this study: In the control group, the participant follows the standard care of SPC Nottwil for tracheostomy tube weaning and decannulation (no use of alternative protocols such as the Cough-Assist Device or the Decannulation Protocol). In the next arm, participants can take part in the Cough-Assist Device trial, which will evaluate the effectiveness of the device and its impact on the ability to decannulate and improve overall health and quality of life of people with paraplegia. \n\nIn the third arm, patients can also be part of the Decannulation Protocol trial, which will investigate the use of the protocol and its impact on the ability to decannulate and improve overall health and quality of life of people with paraplegia. In the fourth arm, the participant uses their current method of tracheostomy tube weaning and decannulation, but they also receive additional support from the care team to help them improve their skills related to swallowing, coughing, and controlling the tracheostomy tube.    In the final arm, the participant can use any type of non-invasive mechanical ventilation support while receiving standard care from SPC Nottwil for tracheostomy tube weaning and decannulation. \n\nThis design will help you compare the results of each intervention and identify the most effective and efficient approach for tracheostomy tube weaning and decannulation in people with paraplegia. If you decide to use this design, I recommend using a randomized controlled trial design with multiple arms to ensure that your results are reliable and unbiased. \n\nYou can also refer to the guidelines from the Swiss National Science Foundation for further guidance on designing such a clinical trial.  https://www.snf.ch/en/home.html\n\nI hope this helps!

            "For the criteria, it's the same as for the first arm. However, the intervention/treatment would involve the use of an objective tool for assessing the patient's readiness for decannulation, such as the Decannulation Readiness Assessment Tool (DRAT) or the Tracheostomy Decannulation Readiness Assessment Scale (TDRAS). The reasoning behind this arm is to compare the effectiveness of the objective tool with the standard clinical evaluation in determining the readiness for decannulation. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short\u2010term effects of a high\u2010protein diet on upper skeletal muscle mass in non\u2010diabetic healthy individuals.METHODS: In this randomized, controlled parallel\u2010arm study, 26 young men were stratified by body mass index (BMI) and randomized to a high protein diet or standard diet for 5 days. Skeletal muscle mass was measured by computed tomography (CT) at the android and gynoid regions. Whole\u2010body protein requirements were determined by a 5\u2010day balance study and used to calculate the 16\u2010component formula to optimize protein intake over the 5\u2010day intervention period.RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects (n, 14 per arm) was 23 \u00b1 2 years. Mean body weight was 72.8 \u00b1 12.5 kg, and BMI was 25.3 \u00b1 3.1 kg\u00b7m2, with 3 subjects in each group being overweight and 11 having normal weight. The groups did not differ in android or gynoid muscle area, or in leg muscle area, fat\u2010free mass, or whole\u2010body protein requirements. On average, the men increased their protein intake by 97.4 \u00b1 60.7 g/d, which would be calculated to have resulted in an average loss of 187 mg of leg muscle nitrogen.CONCLUSION: The diet induced a small, statistically non\u2010significant, positive imbalance in net muscle protein balance using the 16\u2010component formula after 5 days. This imbalance would need to be sustained for a year or more to be functionally significant.

The intervention/treatment would be a structured care pathway, which may involve individualized nursing care or support services during the decannulation process. This arm is designed to assess the effectiveness of this structured care pathway in improving outcomes and supporting the decannulation process in patients with specific needs. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Tracheostomy is a common procedure in intensive care and other care settings, primarily for patients with a critical illness or those with tracheal obstructive diseases. Decannulation, or the removal of the tracheostomy tube, is a crucial step in the recovery process. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured care pathway and post\u2010decannulation follow\u2010up monitoring in patients undergoing decannulation at the Swiss Paraplegic Center Nottwil (SPC). Methods: This is a prospective cohort study with four study arms: (1) tracheotomized adult in\u2010patients with any medical diagnosis, (2) patients decannulated in the SPC, (3) planned decannulation at the SPC during the project\u2019s data collection period, and (4) patients with planned decannulation at the SPC during the project\u2019s data collection period and follow\u2010up monitoring. The study outcomes include measures of patient and family/caregiver satisfaction, health\u2010related quality of life (HRQOL), and clinician and patient/family/caregiver evaluation of the decannulation process. Patients undergoing decannulation will undergo standardized assessments during the procedure and at follow\u2010up visits, depending on their study arm. Results: Enrolled patients will be monitored for a duration of 3 months post\u2010decannulation. Data analysis will involve descriptive analyses and statistical comparisons between the study arms using appropriate tests, including t\u2010tests and analysis of variance. Conclusions: This study will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of a structured care pathway and post\u2010decannulation monitoring in patients undergoing decannulation at the Swiss Paraplegic Center Nottwil. The findings may inform future improvements in patient care processes and clinical decision\u2010making related to tracheostomy management and decannulation.",

We hypothesise that an integrated approach combining the analysis of clinical practice and subjective experiences will provide valuable insights into the tracheostomy-related care pathway, identify risk factors associated with decannulation, and contribute to the development of evidence-based guidelines for its safe and effective implementation.To assess patients' experiences, a qualitative, semi-structured interview approach is chosen. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the experiences and perspectives of patients, and is especially suitable for exploring sensitive and complex topics related to health and well-being.

People with sleep apnea usually have an alteration of sleeping architecture, which causes a high level of fatigue during the day. A lot of rehabilitation programs are being developed to improve this disorder. As sleep maintenance insomnia is very common in patients with sleep apnea and is a problem of itself, the aim of this project is to target improvement of sleep maintenance insomnia in patients with sleep apnea, thanks to the modulation of the cerebral sleep rhythms with transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a non-invasive and safe neurostimulation technique. In the investigator's first research project (Phase I), the investigator will identify patients that are eligible for tACS. This will be a pilot observational study, with about fifteen patients. The main goals of this project are to test the acceptability of tACS for this indication (in terms of safety and tolerability) and to check the reproducibility of the effects of the stimulation.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nModulation of the Cerebral Sleep Rhythms With Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation to Improve Patient's Sleep in the Frame of Sleep Apnea Syndrome\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nInsomnia Sleep-Type, Sleep Maintenance With Insomnia Complaint, Central and Obstructive Sleep Apnea\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation)\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Male and female patients of 18 years or oldest, Undergoing rehabilitation of a sleep apnea syndrome defined with or without an associated insomnia disorder (counselled or undergoing psychological or medical rehabilitation), Have a",

This is because 64Cu FAPI preferentially accumulates in those types of cancers. An FAPI PET-CT scan can be used to detect cancer.Sometimes cancer patients cannot undergo an FAPI PET-CT scan because they have had certain drugs that can bind to 64Cu FAPI. For example, patients who take proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for a long time cannot have an FAPI PET-CT scan. Proton pump inhibitors affect the way 64Cu FAPI behaves in the body, causing it to show up in a different way on the scan. This study aims to learn how PPI therapy can affect the way 64Cu FAPI behaves, which may affect the way that 64Cu FAPI PET-CT scans are interpreted by doctors.Who can participate?Adults with cancer who are scheduled to undergo a second 64Cu FAPI PET-CT scan at least 4 weeks after their first 64Cu FAPI PET-CT scan.

In this article, we outline the importance of studying the use of hydroxychloroquine in IRP patients and the potential benefits and risks of the drug. The use of hydroxychloroquine in IRP patients has the potential to improve their quality of life and reduce the need for long\u2010term steroid use. However, it is important to ensure that the drug is used safely and effectively by carefully monitoring potential side effects and adjusting the dosage as necessary. We discuss the available evidence on the use of hydroxychloroquine in IRP patients and propose a clinical trial to further investigate its efficacy and safety.

This procedure can lead to postoperative parenchymal fistula (POPF), as well as bleeding, hematoma, and biliary leak. Postoperative pancreatic fistula is the most common complication of pancreatic surgery. Pancreatic fistula can disrupt the healing process and result in delayed recovery and hospitalization. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of using the Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) device as a device, and the incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula. METHODS: The inclusion criteria will be 50 cases of pancreatic head tumors that require transection of the pancreatic body or tail. The exclusion criteria will be patients with a history of chronic pancreatitis, preoperative infection or inflammation, preoperative radiotherapy, and patients with hemodynamic or other severe complications prior to the operation. After obtaining the approval of the ethics committee, 50 patients will be randomly divided into two groups. All patients will receive standard preoperative examination and treatment. Patients who receive traditional surgery using a scalpel will be assigned to the experimental group, and patients who receive pancreatic transection with the CUSA device will be assigned to the comparator group. POPF incidence, hospitalization costs, and postoperative recovery time will be compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The results of this study will be statistically analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The significance and effectiveness of our conclusions will be determined by analyzing the differences in POPF incidence, hospitalization costs, and postoperative recovery time between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide new evidence for the clinical use of the CUSA device in pancreatic transection procedures, thereby reducing the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistulas.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nPancreatic fistula is a common complication of pancreatic surgery, which can lead to pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function damage",

I'm glad I could help.\n\nAbstract:\n=================\nBackground: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a common complication after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), which increases morbidity and mortality rates. The Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) has been used in various laparoscopic surgeries to achieve hemostasis and reduce complications. However, its application in PD remains unclear. This study aims to analyze the efficacy and safety of the CUSA device in reducing POPF incidence during pancreatoduodenectomy. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in China among PD patients (aged 18\u201380 years) from May 2019 to January 2022. The study design was a comparison of two groups: those who underwent PD using the CUSA device and those who underwent PD using a surgical scalpel. POPF was defined according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery consensus guidelines. The primary outcome was rates of postoperative complications, while the secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, postoperative mortality, and recurrence rate. Results: A total of 60 patients were included in the study, with 30 in each group. The age, gender, and disease etiology were comparable between the groups. The total postoperative complication rate was significantly lower in the CUSA group compared to the surgical scalpel group (P\u2009<\u2009.05). There was no significant difference in postoperative POPF rates between the groups (P\u2009>\u2009.05). The length of hospital stay and postoperative mortality rates were not significantly different between the groups (P\u2009>\u2009.05). Conclusions: Use of the CUSA device during PD appears safe and reduces the incidence of overall postoperative complications without increasing POPF rates.

New therapies have been developed to reduce the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events in AF patients and one of the goals is to determine which of the new therapies is the most effective and safe. Several clinical trials have been showing conflicting results and recommendations for their use continue to be controversial. The investigators will follow for up to 5 years AF patients under treatment with drugs indicated for the treatment of Heart Failure (HF). The investigators goal is to study which drug can be more effective in reducing the progression to the advanced stages of HF in these patients\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAtrial Fibrillation (AF) is becoming one of the main causes of heart failure. The risk of heart failure in AF patients is the greatest in those treated with \u03b2-blockers, calcium antagonists, and digoxin. The use of loop diuretics seems to protect against heart failure. The new direct current inhibitors of Ionotropic Receptors (IRI) may be cardioprotective. Furthermore, some non-IRI drugs that have been developed for the treatment of heart failure (HF), such as Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNI) or Soluble Guanylate Cyclase (sGC) Stimulators (YCs), could also potentially prevent AF recurrence in patients already treated for the same indication. The objective of the registry is to prospectively follow for 5 years AF patients treated with IRI or non-IRI drugs indicated for the treatment of Heart Failure (HF), in order to evaluate the prognosis of patients according to the type of treatment. For the purpose, the investigators will follow a large series of patients followed in a university hospital in 2012-13. The registry aims to contribute to defining criteria for the use of these drugs in AF patients in addition to the classic heart failure drugs.

In addition, a meta\u2010analysis of small RCTs of intravenous iron infusion in patients with low ferritin levels suggest a role in improving symptoms and exercise capacity. Despite these findings, the role of intravenous iron in the routine practice for heart failure patients is not well known. Objective: This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the effi\u2010cacy of intravenous iron therapy as an adjunct to therapy in patients with reduced ejection fraction and decompensated heart failure in routine clinical practice. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patient records from September 2004 to March 2019. Records with diagnosis of heart failure and iron deficiency (ID) (ferritin < 200 ng/mL and transferrin saturation \u2264 25%) were reviewed. ID was treated with intravenous iron therapy according to the local protocol. Blood biochemistries were assessed within the past 28 days for iron deficiency. Improvement after treatment was defined by a delta percentage change of >10% of hemoglobin level above the lower limit of normal. Results: A total of 108 patients with a mean age of 68.0 \u00b1 11.3 years and a mean follow\u2010up time of 840 \u00b1 770 days were treated for ID. Iron deficiency was more pronounced in men (n = 67, 62%), patients with ischemic (n = 78, 72%) and non\u2010ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 95, 89%), and patients with diabetes (n = 73, 68%) or hypertension (n = 63, 59%).

            "Great! Now, before we move on, I have one question related to both study arms. Why have you chosen to include two separate arms for SGLT2 inhibitors and sGC stimulators, rather than just one study arm with both drugs?",
            "That sounds reasonable. What is the reasoning behind this design? \nAbstract:\nBackground: Pregabalin is a calcium\u2010influx inhibitor, frequently used in the management of neuropathic pain. The mode of action of pregabalin has been elucidated over time \u2010 it has anticonvulsant and anti\u2010seizure properties through binding to the alpha\u20102delta subunit of voltage\u2010gated calcium channels on the nerve membrane. It inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and increases the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. As a result, it reduces the perception of pain in patients with neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action of pregabalin has been studied in multiple models and is well\u2010known. It is likely to have a similar mechanism of action in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS). We hypothesize that pregabalin will be effective in the treatment of RLS. Methods: We are conducting a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trial in 40 patients with moderate to severe symptoms of RLS. The trial aims to establish the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in the management of RLS. We will evaluate the patient's symptoms using the International Restless Legs Scoring Scale, which assesses the frequency, severity, and intensity of symptoms, as well as the quality of life (RLSQOL) impact of the disease. The treatment period will last for 8 weeks, and patients will be stratified according to their symptoms at baseline. Results: The primary outcome of the study is the change in International Restless Legs Scoring Scale (IRLS) scores\u00a0from baseline. The secondary outcome will be changes in the RLSQOL. Adverse effects, such as dizziness, somnolence, depression, and cognitive impairment, will also be assessed as safety outcomes. Conclusion: If this study shows that pregabalin is effective and safe in the management of RLS, it will provide a new treatment option for patients with RLS, especially those who have not responded to existing therapies. This study will provide valuable experimental evidence for the use of pregabalin in the management of RLS, contributing to the development of new and effective therapies for patients with RLS.",

Materials/Methods : Thirty\u2010six right\u2010dominant workers with NMN and no prior history of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were recruited to prevent the occurrence of ACTS. The subjects were randomized into three groups. All subjects performed acupressure, wrist splinting and education about appropriate ergonomic behaviors. The subjects in the acupressure group underwent acupressure after 30min of splinting for hand and wrist, the splinting group applied the wrist splinting for 10min after acupressure and the education group received only education without any treatment for 15min. Results : After 12 weeks, the incidence rate of ACS was significantly lower in both intervention groups than in the control group (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the wrist pain, median motor nerve conduction (MMNC) and the pressure pain threshold (PPT) of median and lateral epicondyle between both intervention groups except ulnar motor nerve conduction (UMNC) (p<0.001). Conclusion : 12 weeks of acupressure and splinting resulted in lower incidence of ACS than education alone with no difference in pain severity and nerve function among the groups.

Methods A high\u2010risk population of untreated CKD population (creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) who underwent AAA surgery between 2004 and 2013 was retrospectively reviewed from the National Disease Registry in Taiwan. A three\u2010point scale index was developed by including age, ankle\u2010brachial index, and hemoglobin into the model. The patients were equally allocated into test and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. The calibration and validity of the new index with or without two new parameters erythrocyte sedimentation rate and albumin (ESR/ALB) were then assessed and compared based on clinical characteristics and outcomes. Results Of the eligible 2054 patients (69.2% male, median age of 67 years); 3162 (15.3%) CKD patients had AAA (2096 and 1066 were assigned to the validation and test cohorts, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.835, 0.846, and 0.846 for the three models. The integrated discrimination improvement, net reclassification index, and the calibration showed no significant differences between the models. Compared with the baseline risk, the use of the new model containing 4 parameters (ESR/ALB) slightly increased C\u2010statistic from 0.831 to 0.837 (P = 0.445). Conclusions The new model with or without 4 parameters demonstrated equivalent accuracy in predicting the risk of untreated CKD patients with AAA."

            "Undergoing DCCV involves the administration of an appropriate dose of Suxethonium Chloride for sedation. As per the manufacturer's protocol, a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg will be given and repeated in 5 minutes if appropriate. The patient will remain intubated until the end of DC Cardioversion. At that time, the patient will also undergo Pulmonary Vein Isolation following which the Intubation tube will be removed and the patient will undergo anesthesia via a Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA). Following pre-procedural tests, the two femoral veins will be punctured with a 16G introducer sheath and an 8F pigtail catheter will be inserted at the superior vena cava under ECG observation. Two sheaths will be inserted in the two femoral veins through the introducer sheath in the same location as the 16G introducer sheath. The distance from the femoral vein puncture point to the mid-point of the two femoral veins, which is approximately 2.5 cm, is calculated using a ruler to facilitate accurate sheath insertion. A multi-point electrode catheter is used to locate the four pulmonary veins. Under the guidance of a left cavity map, the left atrial and left cardiac chambers are connected. Based on the catheter positioning and mapping, ablation will be performed at the following structures: left atrial roof, anterolateral pulmonary vein line, superior pulmonary vein line, inferior pulmonary vein line, mitral isthmus, and the left atrial posterior wall if the PV is not completely isolated. Ablation line is constructed approximately 5 mm from the PV. Bidirectional block is assessed for all ablation lines to ensure adequate isolation of the PV. During the operation, continuous intravenous anesthesia was maintained using Fentanyl and Midazolam. After successful ablation, the sheaths and pigtail catheters will be removed, local hemostasis will be performed as necessary, and the patient will be monitored in the ICU, and the ICD lead connector will be removed in the ICU, and the LMA will be removed in the ICU after the patient",

            "For intermittent phrenic nerve pacing, a quadripolar catheter will be positioned at the right ventricular apex or interventricular septum using local anesthetic and xylocaine sedation. After that, the electrophysiologist will deliver a DC shock of 200 joules for 3 seconds, which will mimic the effects of ablation but will not create any lesions. Following that, the electrode will be retracted from the phrenic nerve while being under local anesthetic and sedation. The ablation catheter will then be placed through the venous sheath at the pulmonary veins and moved at the same distance where the electrophysiologist ablated for the active comparator arm. This is to ensure that the ablation catheter won't touch the phrenic nerve to prevent any adverse effects.

            "Perfect. Now that we have all the necessary information, let's start designing the study arms. We'll begin with the active comparator arm. In this arm, patients will undergo DC cardioversion (DCCV) plus pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Additionally, an implantable loop recorder will be inserted in the pre-pectoral area with local anesthetic at least one week before randomization. Two femoral sheaths will also be inserted at the groin area in all patients on the day of the procedure prior to randomization. Is there anything you'd like to add or modify for this arm?",

Participants will receive standardised protocolised education on self-administered therapy and will undergo an in-person nurse visit followed by remote monitoring.\n\nParticipants will undergo 2 pre-screen tests to ensure they are eligible to participate in the trial, and the pre-screen tests will be reviewed by an MS expert. They will have an enrolment phone call followed by 6 telephone calls which will be conducted by a clinical nurse consultant (CNC), each occurring during different times of the day: 3 in the afternoon at 2pm (Monday, week 4, week 6); and 3 in the morning at 9am (Tuesday, Wednesday, week 8).  The initial phone calls occur at the start of the onboarding program and may include a visual support tool to confirm understanding of the therapy, and a review of any safety concerns experienced thus far during therapy. The 2 following morning phone calls are designed to assess if the patients experienced any problems with therapy. The 2 remaining afternoon phone calls are designed to ask the patient further questions on self-administered therapy education and the experience of the patient managing their therapy. It is expected the calls will last approximately 5 minutes.\n\nBackground information such as demographics will be recorded by the nurse and any data collected during these calls and pre-screen tests will be reviewed and stored by an MS expert.\n\nAll enrolled patients will receive a reminder email or SMS reminder 1 day prior to each scheduled telephone call.

This study aimed to explore the influence of COVID\u201019, social support, and socioeconomic factors on surgical outcomes after esophageal and gastric cancer surgery in PLWH versus non\u2010PLWH.METHODS: This was a sub\u2010study of a prospective cohort study conducted at multiple sites. Consecutive patients were enrolled and followed up. The primary outcome was length of stay (LOS). Univariate analysis was performed to compare the surgical outcomes between PLWH and the non\u2010PLWH group. Factors thought to be associated with LOS were added stepwise to a multivariate cox\u2010regression analysis.RESULTS: Between January 2018 and October 2019, 463 patients underwent esophagectomy and 71 patients laparoscopic gastric surgery with a total of 534 surgeries in the cohort. There were 20 PLWH (n\u2009=\u200910) and 514 non\u2010PLWH (n\u2009=\u2009265). The demographic, operative, and tumor characteristics of PLWH were identical to the non\u2010PLWH group (p\u2009>\u2009\u20090.05).

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purposes of the study are to estimate the safety and efficacy of this procedure in relieving post-chemotherapy and/or post-radiation therapy symptoms of severe pain with significant and prolonged disability not alleviated by at least 2 months of maximally tolerable oral analgesics, and to study changes in cerebral circulation and blood/brain oxygenation with this procedure. Cerebral circulation and hemodynamic measurements, magnetic resonance imaging, and evaluation of disability will be performed before and after the procedure. Additionally, cerebral venous oxygen saturation (SJV), total hemoglobin, and plasma levels of angiogenic factors in cerebrospinal fluid will be measured. The investigators hypothesize that this procedure should improve cerebral oxygen balance and therefore should provide pain relief and decreased disability.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe investigators will determine the safety and potential efficacy of transperineal transcranial direct current stimulation of a target cortical area combined with the intravenous infusion of high dose intravenous ascorbic acid (IVAA) in the treatment of intractable chronic pain due to brain pathology, such as brain metastases, following standard of care intravenous chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy, both of which are typically accompanied by the systemic administration of steroids. Patients with brain metastases are usually very sensitive to steroids. Steroid administration often results in the return of vision and cognitive function and a reduction in tumor progression and pain. However, systemic administration of steroids for a long duration can be harmful with a number of potential side effects. While pain due to brain metastases can be effectively treated by the use of oral analgesics, this option is often limited by poor neurologic status, intolerable side effects, and the risk for addiction. Brain metastases produce high concentrations of norepinephrine and interacts with the central nervous system to produce pain. High levels of extracellular norepinephrine are neurotoxic. In vitro studies demonstrate the norepinephrine in the brain metabolizes to dopamine ascorbic acid, which is thought to mediate pain. The aim of this study is to perform",

A dose of 800 mg in a 20-minute infusion will be administered in dose level (DL) 1. Based on data from the first 3 subjects in DL1, subsequent doses will be escalated in dose-escalation cohorts. After the MTD or RP2D has been identified for ROSE12 doses at 15-minute, 20-minute, 30-minute, 1 hour, 1.5 hour, and 2 hour infusions, an additional cohort of 1-subject Dose escalation will be enrolled to determine if a higher MTD or RP2D can be identified. The first subject of this DL dose escalation cohort will receive a dose of ~2,000mg. In an attempt to obtain data on both MTD and RP2D, the dose escalation will proceed to a 1700 mg dose if the DL1 dose is tolerated for 4 cycles. This will help determine whether it might be safely possible to administer weekly ROSE12 (800 mg), while simultaneously receiving Atezolizumab (840 mg) on a 3-weekly cycle, and whether this would be superior to Atezolizumab alone. Arm B: ROSE12 is administered via intravenous infusion and/or atezolizumab is administered via intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each 21\u2013day cycle.

            "Great, let's move on to the study type and phase. Can you provide me with that information? \nHypothesize that tibolone at a low dose of 2.5mg daily can prevent androgen deprivation-induced osteoporosis related to prostate cancer treatment, compared with placebo. It's a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted from 2021.01.01 to 2025.12.31.\nStudy population\nThe study population was 40-75 years of androgen deprivation therapy treatment with prostate adenocarcinoma patients, excluding patients with previous history of hormonal therapy for prostate adenocarcinoma, bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis, patients with a history of hypersensitivity to tibolone or other selective estrogen receptor modulators.\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board of Asan Medical Center. A detailed explanation for this study and a signed informed consent certificate were provided to each subject after appropriate explanation of the procedure and the risks involved in the study.\nDetermine the number of subjects needed for the study considering the dropout rate of 10%.\nThe sample size was calculated using PASS 2008 program (NCSS, LLC USA) and as a result, considering in the first group of 101, the percentage difference of bone mineral density for total hip in the two groups, the standard deviation of a difference of bone mineral density, the one-sided, and the statistical significance, the number of subjects needed at a single time point is 160-164 each for a total of 320 (160 for each treatment group), respectively.\nStudy arm 1. Experimental group: Tibolone 2.5 mg per orally once daily (once a day) for 6 months (1 tablet per dose)\nStudy arm 2. Control group: Placebo for oral consumption once a day (once a day) for 6 months (1 tablet per dose)\nPrimary Endpoint\nThe changes in bone mineral density (BMD), BMD% change (%), LS mean and standard deviation of spine BMD and % change of BMD at each visit for each group are measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry",

            "That's a good idea. Including a control group will allow us to compare the effects of the Luo-Bu-Fu-Ke-Bi-RI Pill with an established treatment. Now, let's move on to the treatment group. Any suggestions?",
            "Excellent suggestion! The treatment group receiving the Luo-Bu-Fu-Ke-Bi-RI Pill will help us evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new drug. By comparing the outcomes of this group with the control group, we can determine whether the new treatment is superior, equivalent, or inferior to the standard therapy.",
