Could you please also provide a description of the study sample and the planned study duration? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In our study, the aim was to test a novel approach for the assessment of patient\u2010reported outcomes (PROs), by comparing the two most commonly used instruments\u2010the MRI and the SF\u201036 Health Survey\u2010with the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI\u2010S) scale and with each other in a group of breast cancer patients during their pre\u2010 and post\u2010opertive stay in the hospital. Methods: We consecutively enrolled fifty women affected by invasive breast carcinoma undergoing radical mastectomy and selected forty breast cancer patients without mastectomy (BC). The MRI and the SF\u201036 survey were administered pre\u2010operatively and the patient's status was evaluated by the PGIS scale post\u2010operatively. The SF\u201036, the MRI and PGIS questionnaires were repeated at the seventh\u2010day follow\u2010up in BC patients. Results: The mean and standard deviation of the SF\u201036 scores at pre\u2010operative were very similar between the groups of patients undergoing or not surgery, with the exception of the mean difference of the \u201cEmotional Role Limitations\u201d score (MRI 24.9, S.d. = 41.5 vs SF\u201036 44.5, S.d. = 27.28) which showed a tendency toward deterioration in the MRI group (p=0.01) that was confirmed by the SF\u201036 score (MRI 42/SF\u201036 56, p=0.002). These differences were reversed after surgery, when the mean and the standard deviation of the SF\u201036 scores were more elevated in the MRI group. The PGI\u2010S score was higher than the SF\u201036 in both groups of patients and was not related to any of the SF\u201036 domains before surgery, while it was significantly better than the SF\u201036 scores in MRI patients at the follow\u2010up. The MRI showed a significant correlation with the PGIS scale (r\u00a0=\u00a00.501; p\u00a0<",

[/RESPONSE] Can we evaluate whether this program improves the outcomes for patients with chronic low back pain? [RESPONSE] Yes, of course. We've already included some outcomes such as pain intensity, disability, and quality of life in our study objectives. However, we should also consider other potential outcomes that may be related to chronic low back pain, such as the use of healthcare resources, employment status, and psychological well-being. \n\nWe can explore those outcomes as secondary objectives and incorporate relevant measures into the study protocol.

            "Great! For the fourth study arm, we could combine the self-management program with nurse coaching. Participants in this arm would engage in the self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based nursing coaching sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: There is a lack of studies examining the use of patient activation to enhance engagement in self\u2010management among patients with chronic low back pain. The use of patient activation as the central framework for a nurse\u2010led program may facilitate patient engagement in behavior changes that improve self\u2010management and consequently, outcomes. Methods: The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial to test the proposed intervention. 60 patients with non\u2010specific chronic low back pain will be screened for inclusion and randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups: 1) Self\u2010management intervention; 2) Self\u2010management plus health behavior change counseling; 3) Self\u2010management plus nursing coaching; and 4) Control (usual care). Each intervention group will receive a 6\u2010week group self\u2010management program. The intervention groups will receive either three coaching or counseling sessions, while the control condition will not receive any intervention. Pre\u2010post measures will be used to assess differences in patient engagement in self\u2010management. Changes in self\u2010management behavior and outcomes will be measured by questionnaires and a qualitative interview with four patients from each intervention group. The effect of the intervention on patient engagement in self\u2010management will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis. The effect on self\u2010management behavior and outcomes will be analyzed using structural equation modeling. Discussion: The proposed research will provide important information on the implementation and effectiveness of patient activation as a framework for nurse\u2010led behavioral interventions in chronic low back pain. We expect the interventions to significantly improve patients\u0092 engagement in self\u2010management behavior and enhance clinical outcomes such as self\u2010efficacy and pain impact. The proposed research may have implications for the development of evidence\u2010based, patient\u2010centered nursing interventions for chronic pain."

Objectives: We evaluated the impact of CKD and Hepatobiliary disease (HBD) on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and lurasidone using population pharmacokinetic analysis. Methods: We conducted a phase 1 double\u2010blind, parallel\u2010group study to determine the bioequivalence of orally administered risperidone IR and risperidone LA, and orally administered lurasidone IR and lurasidone HCl. On days 5\u201012, subjects received either two doses of the candidate reference product (CRP) and two doses of the alternate reference product (ARP), or vice versa. Subjects with moderate to severe CKD or mild to moderate HBD had their pharmacokinetic parameters estimated using NONMEM.

Results: The AUC and Cmax of risperidone were similar in both risperidone formulations, with 90% CIs of AUC and Cmax ratio within acceptability criteria (80.00%\u2010125.00%). Across CKD levels, ratios of AUC and Cmax for both risperidone and its active metabolite paliperidone and lurasidone and its active metabolite desalkyl lurasidone were consistent with bioequivalence.

This approach has identified only 10% to 30% of patients with non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who may benefit from single\u2010agent ICI therapy, leading to the need for more effective ICI agents.Objective: To evaluate durvalumab in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (platinum\u2010based therapy) compared with platinum\u2010based therapy alone in patients with untreated stage III NSCLC inadequately treated with surgery or radiation therapy.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Phase 3 PACIFIC trial was a multicenter, open\u2010label, randomized trial conducted at 234 academic and community practices in 34 countries between December 28, 2015, and September 8, 2017. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 10 doses of durvalumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks PD\u2010L1 expression, or platinum\u2010based therapy in the neoadjuvant setting and continued 1 year later as sequential maintenance therapy after completion of chemotherapy. This is an interim analysis of OS in patients with stage III NSCLC and no known EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) sensitizing mutations, a population that represents a large fraction of patients in the standard of care treatment population. Data analysis was conducted during August 28, 2018, to January 17, 2019.Data Analysis: Of 713 patients, 500 were included in this analysis; 251 had disease progression or died prior to an OS event and 249 were alive at 24\u2010month OS assessment. The trial is continuing and the median follow\u2010up is about 24 months (range, 0\u201029.2 months).

What are your thoughts on this study arm? \nAbstract:\nBackground & aims: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a very poor prognosis. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in patients with resectable disease, although its effect on overall survival is modest and the long\u2010term survival of patients with PDAC remains dismal. Furthermore, patients may already present with metastatic disease and in this setting, no cure is available with conventional chemotherapies, although novel therapeutic approaches, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapy, are being investigated. Thus, there is an unmet medical need to find effective therapies to increase the survival of PDAC patients. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a one\u2010year nutritional intervention, including advice about carbohydrate intake, on health\u2010related quality of life (HRQOL), physical activity, body composition, and biomarkers in patients with PDAC. Methods: We performed a single\u2010center, randomized, controlled, assessor\u2010blinded clinical trial at a large academic oncology center. The study was registered as NCT03706382. Eligibility criteria included patients with histologically confirmed resectable or metastatic disease, scheduled to start chemotherapy, age \u226518 years, no major weight loss within the past 30 days, and no concomitant metabolic disease. Patients were randomized (1:1) to an intervention group (carbohydrate restriction, 30\u201350g/day) or a control group (standard\u2010of\u2010care [SoC], >130g/day).

Colon\u2010specific colon cancer (CRC) and liver metastases (LM) are associated with poorer clinical outcomes than rectal\u2010specific rectal cancer (RRC) and liver metastases (RLM). Whether the differences are due to the intrinsic properties of CRC and RRC or treatment differences remains unclear. Methods. A total of 406 colon cancer (CC), RRC, and patients with LM were included. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and secondary outcomes included recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) and response rate (RR) in each subgroup. Results.

Are there any measurements or assessments that would require physical examination or collection of biological specimens? \n\nStudy\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nNeck and back pain are among the leading causes of disability in the United States, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 70% for neck pain and 84% for low back pain. Many chronic pain patients (53% for neck pain) seek alternative treatments. One such treatment, Pneumatic Compression Therapy, is a technique that involves mechanically compressing and decompressing a localized area in order to promote lymphatic flow, reduce localized lymphedema, and relieve pain. Preliminary data from human studies has demonstrated that PCT relieves pain due to inflammation, but the underlying mechanisms of action of this treatment are not well understood. Our long term goal is to mechanistically understand the mechanism of pain relief delivered by PCT in order to optimize and expand this treatment. This has been a focus of our lab since early 2020, when we began to explore the utility of the novel NIRF-LI imaging technique for the purposes of measuring the lymphatic properties of the body as well as non-invasive detection of inflammation. In a pilot clinical trial, we have successfully demonstrated the use of our NIRF-LI imaging method to detect inflammation, in the form of raised lymphatic vessel density, in the axillary lymph nodes of patients with COVID-19. Here, we seek to leverage this novel imaging modality to further study the lymphatic and pain-mediating properties of the Pneubelt pneumatic compression device. This imaging technology has great potential to inform the diagnosis and treatment of inflammation-related diseases such as chronic neck and back pain.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nNeck and back pain are among the leading causes of disability in the United States, with an estimated 25% lifetime prevalence. Nearly half of American adults will experience low back pain during their lifetime, with the lifetime prevalence of neck pain being even higher at 70%.

The study aims to investigate whether a medication safety educational program using an interactive app designed for Drugs.gov website is effective in improving medication safety-related attitudes and knowledge among adult health consumers in Malaysia from April to June 2023.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground and Rationale: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 4 to 6.5 million deaths are linked to medication errors throughout the world, which makes medication safety a global issue. Medication errors occur frequently in the primary care settings regardless of countries or health care systems. A cross-sectional study conducted in Saudi Arabia (SA) among healthcare professionals (HCPs) reported that healthcare providers encountered 1.9 incidents per each month. The study also showed the most common risk factors for medication incidents were medication errors and/or adverse events (69.6%) and prescribing (70.0%) respectively. The study also reported that the most commonly involved medications in the near misses included antibiotics (46.8%), anticoagulants (33.7%), gastrointestinal (GI) medications (21.9%), and vitamins (4.9%), respectively. The majority of drugs were in tablet formulation and the most frequent routes of administration were oral (61.1%) and topical preparations (54.9%). The highest and lowest medication incidents, in terms of frequency, occurred in general practice (1.6 per month) and in emergency departments (0.1 per month) respectively. In Malaysia, inappropriate prescription of medication in primary care settings has been reported among community pharmacists. It is estimated that 70% of the drugs collected at community pharmacies were repackaged and given to patients inappropriately compared to those prescribed by doctors. In addition, inappropriate prescription of herbal medications to patients has been reported. A study conducted in primary health care facilities in Malaysia among young adult (18-35) patients reported that herbal medications and food supplements were frequently prescribed. Most",

In Group 1, 500,000 units of epinephrine, in Group 2, 250,000 units of epinephrine, and in both Group 3 and the control group, only bupivacaine (5 mg/kg) were used. The lowest diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the control group by the time the patients were transferred to the delivery room. All the other parameters studied did not differ significantly among the groups.

The main feature of acute hypercapnia is the accumulation of end-tidal CO2 due to alveolar ventilation. This is common in COPD and asthma. The purpose of oxygen combined with CPAP is to avoid respiratory acidosis caused by hypoxemia, which can reduce the risk of acute respiratory failure. However, some patients have acute hypercapnia due to sleep apnea, which requires treatment from sleep apnea. Hypercapnia is common in critically ill patients caused by increased carbon dioxide due to acute hypercapnia, poor response to mechanical ventilation, and hypoperfusion of the alveoli. This hypercapnia can lead to cardiac arrhythmia, increased intracranial pressure, and decreased cardiac output. At present, there are mainly non-invasive mechanical ventilation and intubation for patients with hypercapnia, but no research data are currently available.\n\nHealth condition(s) or problem(s) studied\n=================\nHypercapnia\n\nCondition category\n=================\nRespiratory\n\nPrimary outcome\n=================\nThe amount of oxygen used in the treatment;",

This study was designed to determine the efficacy of chitosan on wound healing in an animal model and its efficacy compared to SSD in patients with burns or wounds. Materials and Methods: A randomized double\u2010blind controlled trial was conducted amongst patients with full\u2010thickness burns or wounds. The experimental group was treated with chitosan based cream along with chloramphenicol eye drops while the control group was treated with the commercially available silver sulphadiazine gel. Patients were clinically evaluated everyday for pain, bleeding, swelling, erythema and discharge of fluid. Microbial cultures of the wound were also done and the percent healing was assessed with a ruler. Results: A total of 60 patients were included in the study and the duration of the study was an average of 14 days. 75% of participants in the experimental group as compared to 91.6% for the control group had a complete epithelialization and were pain\u2010free. No patient in the control group reported any side effects while 18% of the participants in the experimental group had itching, mild burning sensation and redness around the wound which subsided after 24 to 48 hr. Conclusion: Chitosan is a better alternative for treating burns and wounds when compared to SSD and could be used extensively in India.",

A 6-week standardized treadmill training regimen consisting of 20-minute running bouts over 3 consecutive days (70-80% of the initial maximum heart rate) will be applied (maximum heart rate = 220-age). The effects of the training program will be compared to a non-trained control group (n = 5). Measurements, such as, blood pressure and plasma glucose levels will be taken before and after standardized physical activity. The study is part of bachelor's and master's theses from the School of Physiotherapy at the University of South-Eastern Norway.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe purpose of the present study is: To investigate physiological changes in healthy middle-aged men due to a short period of moderate-intensity treadmill running training. More specifically, the effects on systemic oxidative stress, body composition, exercise performance in the 20-minute running protocol, and the effects on blood pressure levels are evaluated. The study aims to investigate the effect of an acute bout of exercise in relation to cardiovascular response during and after exercise. The study sample consist of 5 healthy, middle-aged men who are not used to practicing physical activity, who have already been asked orally and in writing for participation. The planned study start is the end of November 2014.

What do you think? \n\nAbstract:\nEighteen patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a sternotomy were evaluated. The patients were divided into a group receiving 300 mg of vitamin B12 orally prior to the operation (prevention group) and a group not receiving any form of vitamin B12 supplementation (control group). The results of the study were analyzed using the Mann\u2010Whitney U test and a chi\u2010square test. All patients underwent transarterial coronary artery bypass grafting with or without valve surgery. No perioperative mortality (in\u2010hospital, at 30 days) or morbidity (reoperation for bleeding, graft failure, stroke, low cardiac output syndrome, renal failure requiring dialysis, and low cardiac output requiring a vasoactive agent) was observed. In one case, sternal decubitus with the sternostomy drainage system in situ was necessary because of prolonged low cardiac output syndrome, which was not related to vitamin B12 deficiency. The postoperative mean intensive care unit length of stay, median hospital stay, or mortality rates were not significantly different between the two groups. We conclude that perioperative prophylactic use of vitamin B12 is not required for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a sternotomy.Copyright 2018 Changchun University of Chinese Medicine",

Participants in the control arm will also continue with standard pre-eclampsia prophylaxis and their usual antihypertensive treatment. \nA detailed description of the control arm is as follows: Starting from the 16th week of gestation, participants will consume a daily 70 ml of Beet-It Sport\u00ae. This is a placebo that will serve as the control group and will not contain nitrates. Similar to participants in the experimental arm, participants in the control arm will also continue with standard pre-eclampsia prophylaxis and their usual antihypertensive treatment.

Dopamine A receptor agonists like bromocriptine and pergolide are reported to be very effective in the treatment of EFGR and have proved their safety after prolonged use. However, the management of EFGR still remains a challenge as fetal death with good\u2010birth\u2010weight remains high with current treatment regimens. The present study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of Bromocriptine in improving outcome in women with EFGR. This was a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study carried out in the Government College of Home\u2010opathy, Kolkata, West Bengal from 2013 to 2015. In this study, 51 patients of EFGR were divided into two groups\u2010 Group B\u2010bromocriptine and Group P\u2010placebo. Bromocriptine was administered (5 mg two times daily) in Group B. In group P, the placebo was given two times daily. In both groups, doppler studies were carried out at weekly intervals. In those who did not respond to initial treatment, a repeat dose of 5 mg two times daily was given and the dosage of bromocriptine was reduced after 4 weeks in group B. In this comparative study, no significant differences were noticed between the two groups as regards improvement in Doppler parameters and fetal growth rate. These results suggest that in addition to other management protocols bromocriptine and pergolide should not be routinely used in EFGR.",

Could you also share the study design details? \n\nStudy type\n=================\nInterventional study\n\nStudy design\n=================\nParallel\n\nDescription\n=================\nRationale\n-----------------\nAt the time of diagnosis, most of MS patients are unaware of disease severity due to a relatively low level of disability and have the hope of becoming free of symptoms. However, MS is a chronic disorder that develops through a relentless deterioration of the nervous system that can lead to disability and reduced quality of life for patients, as well as a significant increase in total health care costs. Therefore, an early initiation of disease modifying therapy (DMT) in progressive phase may improve clinical outcomes. Interferon (INF)-Beta-1b is a commonly used DMT and can be applied as Subcutaneous Injection (SC-INF) or in Patient Administered Injection (PAI)-INF. PAI-INF does not require training and can be administered at home by patients or their family members. PAI-INF is advantageous in that it minimizes the burden on health resources by reducing the number of visits to hospitals and clinics. In addition, injection method is associated with treatment compliance due to improved patient satisfaction. \nPatients are unaware that early initiation of therapeutic intervention is an important factor for the prevention or attenuation of disability in MS. Therefore, patient satisfaction is closely associated with patient compliance. The most common side effects of PAI-INF associated with the injection procedure are pain, skin rash and itching. Pain and injection site reactions are reported in up to 69% of patients when using PAIs, and the frequency of pain increases with repeated use. Although a number of studies have examined skin reactions, such as erythema, pruritus, etc., to INFs, there is limited research on pain caused by injection itself. Pain is significantly higher in PAI-INF than in SC-INF, suggesting that it is an important factor to consider in the use of PAI-INF in the treatment of MS patients. However, no studies have compared the injection pain between the two groups.\nPAI-IFN is administered less often than SC-INF: the frequency of injection was about 5 to 7 times lower for PAI-INF within a 21-day",

It has been reported that early termination of an arrhythmic event by direct current (DC) shock has a higher success rate. However, most SVT is shock resistant. Objective The clinical effects of a new DC shock protocol for terminating SVT, delivered at 1.5 to 3 joules with an initial energy of 1.5 joules, were evaluated by measuring the success rate of terminating SVT and arrhythmia conversion time. Methods A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients who experienced sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and whose hemodynamics were stable were included. Patients in group A received 1.5 joules and a 30\u2010second monitoring period followed by 3 joules if the SVT persisted, while patients in group B received 3 joules immediately. If the patients had hemodynamic or ECG instability, standard treatment was applied. Results Of the 100 patients included in the study, 40 were in group A and 60 were in group B. The mean monitoring time was greater in group A than in group B (16 seconds vs. 4.5 seconds, P < 0.05). No significant difference in arrhythmia termination (92.5% in group A vs. 88.3% in group B, P > 0.05), arrhythmia conversion time (69.5 seconds vs. 58 seconds, P > 0.05), hemodynamic changes (P > 0.05), and adverse effect rates (P > 0.05) were observed between the two groups. Conclusions Early DC shocking at 1.5 to 3 joules can be used as the first treatment strategy for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This protocol may result in early termination of SVT, although it is a novel approach.",
            "Is there a placebo arm in the trial? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe main objective of this study is to find out whether taking a daily supplement of 1000 mg of the antioxidant vitamin E supplement has an effect on the incidence of headaches in patients with tension headaches who have failed to respond to treatment with simple analgesics. The investigators have decided to test the possible antioxidant mechanism of action of vitamin E by determining a) how much plasma vitamin E increases after taking 1000 mg of vitamin E compared with a dose of 400 mg of vitamin E given earlier in the trial and, more importantly, b) how much plasma vitamin E decreases after stopping 1000 mg of vitamin E compared with a dose of 400 mg of vitamin E given earlier in the trial. The investigators hypothesis is that the changes from baseline in plasma vitamin E concentration between the two vitamin E groups will differ significantly. By testing both of these hypotheses at the same time in the same population of patients, the investigators will determine whether vitamin E plays an important role in the maintenance of plasma vitamin E levels that is different from a placebo effect. If plasma vitamin E is unable to maintain plasma vitamin E levels significantly higher than placebo then presumably vitamin E does not provide an important long term benefit over a placebo. A placebo-controlled trial is the ideal method of determining this so the investigators are planning this as a multicenter trial involving several tertiary referral headache centres. If the study shows that plasma vitamin E concentrations remain higher than placebo on 1000 mg of vitamin E for at least one week and possibly three weeks then this will give clinical support to testing the clinical effect of higher doses of vitamin E on reducing the frequency of tension-type headaches\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe main objective of this study is to determine whether there is a long term antioxidant effect of alpha-tocopheryl acetate (d-alpha-tocopherol acetate, vitamin E) on the prevalence of headaches in patients with unilateral or bilateral chronic tension-type headaches who have failed to respond to treatment with simple analgesics.

What do you think the primary and secondary outcomes should be? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: COVID\u201019 may cause mild illness in some children, such as cough or fever, but it can also cause severe disease in children, such as pneumonia. Children 12 to 17 years of age experience the most hospitalization\u2010related morbidity and mortality for COVID\u201019. Limited data are available on the safety and efficacy of different pharmacologic treatments for COVID\u201019 in children, and the American Academy of Pediatrics has not yet recommended any specific medications for this age group. In adults with COVID\u201019, various drugs have been investigated, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and monoclonal antibodies; none have demonstrated conclusive benefit. Methods: For this study, we collected deidentified data from the pediatric electronic health record of the children who received monoclonal antibody infusions during their initial COVID\u201019 illness. Data were collected prospectively on whether monoclonal antibodies decreased the need for hospitalization and other outcomes. Results: 11 patients received monoclonal antibodies, of whom 41% had at least 1 outcome related to COVID\u201019 illness. The most common outcome was a positive change noted on home oxygen saturation (29%), and 6% of patients were hospitalized. Monoclonal antibodies may have decreased hospitalization (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.3 [95% confidence interval , 0.02\u20130.83]\u00a0in the bivariate model; IRR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.09\u20131.62] in the multivariate model).

The overall 5\u2010year survival rate for patients with advanced or metastatic disease in the UK is only 2%. Currently, there are no targeted therapies for advanced disease, other than chemotherapy with gemcitabine\u2010based regimens, which prolongs survival in about 30% of patients. The combination of capecitabine and nab\u2010paclitaxel in an attempt to overcome chemoresistance has gained recent traction in the treatment of advanced disease. Objective: To present the results of a prospective phase 2 study, NIBIT\u20101213 (NCT02405745), conducted at the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, evaluating the efficacy of nab\u2010paclitaxel plus capecitabine as a first\u2010line treatment in advanced disease. Methods: One hundred and twenty patients with advanced PC were treated with nab\u2010paclitaxel (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 and capecitabine (2000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily days 1 to 14; every 3 weeks) on an outpatient basis. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR) at 6 weeks assessed by RECIST 1.1. Patients with disease\u2010free survival of > 12 weeks post entry and who completed 6 therapy cycles were eligible for crossover treatment with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 and 8) once daily every 3 weeks. Results: One hundred and twenty patients (pts) were recruited between November 2013 until November 2016. The median age of the pts was 60 years (37\u201076 years) with 63% males; 90% were stage 4 and 58% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0\u20101.

In preclinical  non-human studies, antibodies targeting BCMA have shown anti-tumor activity in  multiple myeloma. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that decreases production of immune system chemicals in the body that cause inflammation [1]. Elotuzumab is a humanized immunoglobulin \u03b31 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7), which is preferentially expressed on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and B cells. Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) which is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cell cancer. In combination with low-dose dexamethasone as part of the pomalidomide pomalyst (POM) (dexamethasone) in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients, pomalidomide acts like an agent that affects the immune system (immune system) and can reduce lymphocytes, white blood cells (including white blood cells). Pomalidomide and its metabolites act differently from and are not chemotherapeutic agents like melphalan. Pomalidomide and lenalidomide are not therapeutically equivalent [2].

It has been shown to prevent the formation of new blood vessels in tumors and inhibit tumor growth. Blocking VEGF may also enhance the immune response against cancer.\n- Cemiplimab is a human monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody that works by blocking the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on immune cells. This helps enhance the immune response against cancer cells.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with!"

Studies have shown that the hot EMR technique is associated with higher rates of adverse events and recurrence compared to the cold EMR technique. Despite this, there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials comparing the two techniques. In recent years, the endoscopist preference for the use of diathermic snare in the large colon has increased due to increased success rates, decreased treatment time, and improved patient satisfaction. However, the efficacy and safety of mucosectomy with a diathermic snare for large colonic adenomas remain unclear.

The aim of this observational study was to evaluate long\u2010term efficacy of percutaneous tumor ablation in advanced cirrhosis with unresectable HCC. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study comprising a total of 300 cases with HCC from March 2011 to October 2018 who were treated with radiofrequencyablation (RFA) or percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) for HCC in advanced cirrhosis. The study subjects were divided into two groups according to whether the patients had liver cirrhosis (LC) or not. The clinical and imaging data of the patients were analyzed. Kaplan\u2010Meier method and Cox regression were used for survival analysis. Results: Fifty\u2010six cases were treated with RFA and 161 cases were with PEI for HCC in advanced cirrhosis.

The outcomes were evaluated in terms of complications, cost, convenience during dressing change, and patient and healthcare provider satisfaction. Results: This study shows that the healing period was statistically significantly different in the 1st and 2nd study stages. Although the mean healing period for the S/A group was 27 days, it was 25 days for the P\u2010200 group, with a significant difference of 1.8 days. The healing period for the S/A and P\u2010200 groups was 10.9 and 11 days, respectively. The difference between 2 groups was not statistically significant.

In the present study we have compared the efficacy and safety of large\u2010volume paracentesis versus albumin infusion as initial treatment modality in patients with ascites secondary to cirrhosis. Eighty patients with ascites of at least two months duration secondary to cirrhosis were studied in a randomized, open, prospective study, with crossover design. The patients were allocated randomly to one of two treatment groups: paracentesis (group A) received 3.5 L of paracentesis and 15 g of hydroxyethyl starch in the first 24 hours and 10 g of hydroxyethyl starch daily for three days, whereas group B received 2 g/kg of human albumin intravenously during the first three days. Hemodynamic measurements were performed before starting treatment and after three days. Clinical outcome of the two treatment modalities, paracentesis and albumin infusion respectively, was studied by physical examination, blood tests and electrocardiography. After three days, when the crossover design entered into action, the ascites could not be controlled adequately in 10 of 40 patients in group A and albumin infusion was indicated; on the other hand, none of the patients in group B required a change in the treatment protocol. Thus, large\u2010volume paracentesis is not superior to albumin infusion in controlling refractory ascites. We believe that albumin might have beneficial effects on other features of cirrhosis."

The use of TACE or RE is accompanied by increases in serum levels of lactate, which is known to occur with low hepatic synthesis of alanine aminotransferase and glutamine depletion, in turn resulting in liver dysfunction and renal failure. Furthermore, serum lactate has been associated with reduced survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, this study aims to evaluate if lactate, serum amino acids, organ blood flow, and endothelial function (assessed by flow-mediated dilatation) are different in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who receive TACE versus RE.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nVascular and Hepatic Changes Associated With Trans-Arterial Interventions (TACE or RE) in Patients With Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Radiation: radioembolization\n* Procedure: trans-arterial chemoembolization\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patients who have cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma Patients who are scheduled for trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radioembolization (RE) Patients who have not undergone trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radioembolization (RE) in"

There is also an absence of effective biomarkers in this disease, and there is limited understanding of why some patients with similar tumors respond to treatments while others do not.\n\nIn the study, the investigators use the 2-deoxy-2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) technology to help surgeons map out the most efficient and safe surgical approaches in patients with a new glioblastoma (GBM), who have been randomly assigned to receive surgery and chemoradiation. A CT scan with contrast of the brain is also used to define tumor location, size and shape. With the aim of improving the removal of the tumor, the investigators use data from these scans to determine the tumor volume, anatomical obstacles, and to create a 3D model of the brain and tumor in the patient. Then, they use information from the CT scan to create a template of the brain using special software. Finally, the investigators register the patient's brain in the space of the model brain to make a personalized model to predict the patient's post-operative functions following surgical resection of the tumor. Post-operative prediction of functions is conducted using a previously established and validated function assessment system.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nOptimal Tumor Removal With PET-Driven Surgery - Phase 2\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nRecurrent Glioblastoma, Adult\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Radiation: 3-Dimensional Positioning and Surgery Planning\n* Radiation: Stereotactic Biopsy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: A minimum age of 18.

I hope that this study will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of transcutaneous spinal stimulation for shortening ventilator dependence in patients with respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nStudy protocol: Spinal Cord Stimulation to Reduce Ventilator Dependence in Patients With COVID-19\nAbstract:\nBackground: Respiratory distress syndrome is one of the main complications resulting in high mortality in patients with COVID\u201019. There is a pressing need to develop effective interventions for reducing ventilator dependence in these patients. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as a potential therapy. A systematic review and meta\u2010analysis of ten randomized controlled trials showed that cervical cord stimulation (CCS) resulted in shorter breathing tube duration, shorter hospital stay, and less mortality compared to conventional medical treatment. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of SCS in reducing ventilator dependence in patients with respiratory distress syndrome and other causes of acute respiratory failure, as well as evaluate the safety of SCS. Methods: This is a single\u2010center, randomized, double\u2010blind controlled study. This study will enroll adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure caused by respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, sepsis, or other causes deemed appropriate by the primary investigator, and patients diagnosed with COVID\u201019 pneumonia. Patients with indications for SCS and those requiring continuous ventilation support for at least 72 hours will be included in the study. Exclusion criteria include a history of severe head trauma, spinal cord disease, or spine surgery; severe cognitive impairment; spinal abscess or spine infection; coagulation dysfunction; and spinal cord injury. Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups: the study group and the control group. The study group will receive SCS therapy, whereas the control group will receive conventional medical treatment. The primary outcome is ventilator dependence in 28 days, whereas the secondary outcomes are duration of ventilator dependence, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital death, hospital readmissions within six months after discharge, and the incidence of side effects.

Psychological resilience is the ability to adapt and adapt positively to challenging experiences. This can include facing stress, dealing with change, or coping with adversity. Counseling is a form of therapy, in which a trained professional provides guidance, support, and tools to help individuals manage their thoughts and emotions. Both psychological resilience and counseling are important topics to explore when considering nursing students' well-being. \n\n\nIn particular, I am interested in exploring the following research questions regarding psychological resilience and counseling for nursing students:\n\n1. What is the current state of psychological resilience among nursing students?\n2. What are the challenges facing nursing students in terms of their psychological resilience and mental health?\n3. What types of counseling services or interventions would be most effective in promoting psychological resilience and supporting the mental health of nursing students?\n4. How can technology be used to deliver counseling services and interventions to nursing students in a convenient and accessible manner?\n5. How can nursing schools and hospitals create a supportive environment for nursing students to promote their psychological resilience and mental health? \n\n\nTo explore these research questions, I propose a mixed methods approach to combining quantitative and qualitative research methods. Quantitative methods will involve conducting a survey to assess nursing students' psychological resilience and mental health, as well as their experiences with counseling services and interventions. Qualitative methods will involve conducting interviews and focus groups to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by nursing students and the strategies they use to cope with stress and promote their psychological resilience. \n\n\n\n1.

Surgical techniques for breast reconstruction have been adapted to help prevent the development of lymphedema. The purpose of this study is to determine if the placement of internal sutures during closure of the axillary cavity significantly decreases postoperative arm swelling. Methods: The investigators hypothesize that arm swelling, as measured by arm circumference, will be significantly reduced in the treatment group versus the control group at 2 weeks and 1 year after surgery. Design: Patients presenting for breast reconstruction with a mastectomy and axillary node surgery will be asked to take part in the study. After the completion of the resection, one arm will be randomized to the treatment arm (internal sutures placed upon closure of the axillary cavity) and one arm will be randomized to the control arm (sutures to close the axillary cavity will not be placed internally). The treatment will be performed on the side of the operation with the control placed on the opposite side.

The risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is about 8% (range 0\u201038%). This study aimed to investigate the risk factors and evaluate the prognostic significance of high\u2010risk features identified by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in GSTM. METHODS: Data of 628 consecutive patients who underwent EUS assessment and subsequent ESDs with curative intent were retrospectively reviewed. The association of LNM on EUS staging and pathology with preoperative clinical parameters and tumor characteristics was assessed. Results: LNM was observed in 25 patients (4.0%) which were confirmed by post\u2010ESD pathology. Higher rates of LNM were observed in lesions greater than 2 cm and with an irregular borders. Independent risk factors for LNM were size>2cm and irregular margins on pre\u2010ESD EUS evaluation (P=0.037 and P=0.003). None of the tumor characteristics or comorbidities including age, gender, location, ulceration, depth of stromal invasion, or vascular invasion correlated with LNM. Of the 573 tumors with curative resection, the 3\u2010year LRFS after ESD was 94% and the 3\u2010year RFS was 95%. Tumors with high\u2010risk characteristics on EUS were not found to associate with survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: A total of 4% of GSTMs had associated lymphatic invasion. High risk of LNM was limited to tumors with irregular borders and >2cm. None of the pre\u2010ESD tumor characteristics were found to predict LNM or affect prognosis",

The second study arm is the control group, also known as the \"no intervention\" group. Participants do not receive any specific intervention or treatment and continue with their usual routines. \n\nThis article aims to discuss the importance of the parent-child relationship in the development of children, the role of siblings in promoting adaptive behavior, family stress and adjustment, and the need to improve services and support for parents and siblings. The study will investigate the application of an innovative web-application tool that aims to promote a cohesive and cooperative family environment, reduce psychological distress in parents, promote social-emotional functioning and academic performance in children with a disability, and enhance the health and social well-being of all family members. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nSibling relationships typically begin at birth and evolve in conjunction with the child's development. As the child's cognitive and emotional development progresses, their perception and needs of siblings change and this may impact their relationship with them. Sibling relationships play a fundamental role in the healthy development of children beyond that of parents. However, studies show that there is a relationship between the family environment and the development of the sibling. Therefore, improving the coexistence and relationships between brothers and sisters is crucial for developing the entire family and promoting healthy family environments. In this context, the importance of identifying the factors that impact the quality of family relationships becomes increasingly relevant, as this can help us design and implement interventions aimed at improving communication, enhancing empathy, and reducing maladaptive behavior in families with children with special needs. Research shows that families face challenges in balancing the needs of all family members, which can lead to high rates of family stress and adjustment problems. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in addition to presenting a higher level of difficulty in social interaction and communication, also have challenges integrating into a schooling environment. This poses an additional challenge for parents, especially mothers, who become their primary caregivers. Studies show that parental overinvolvement and emotional exhaustion are associated with increased stress levels. This can strain parent-child relationships, and increase the likelihood of family problems. In short, research suggests that children with ASD have",

Methods: A total of 30 consecutive Asherman patients who had undergone USSM\u2010DCC of Asherman Syndrome (AS) were included, were divided into two groups. The first receiving NAC pretreatment (N;300 mg), a week prior to the operation and repeated every 6 hours for seven days postoperatively and the other receiving placebo (B).

            "I absolutely agree. Having a control group is an essential part of the study's design to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. It will allow us to draw accurate conclusions about the impact of the stress ball on pain perception. \n\n[STUDY ADVANCE]\n[INCL] I think inclusion of only one injection site per subject is a reasonable methodology. It is likely that the injection pain would be similar at different areas of the body if a single injection site is selected for each subject. [/INCL] The selected site of subcutaneous injection varies by study and may be influenced by personal preferences and/or medical reasons. Therefore, it is logical to only include one injection site in terms of scientific validity and feasibility. Additionally, using one injection site in a study design allows for greater comparability between subjects in terms of pain perception and can reduce the potential for bias. Moreover, it ensures that the findings of the study can be generalized to a wider population, as the same site and injection method may be applicable to different patient groups. \n\n[EXCL] This trial has a relatively short follow-up period of six weeks, so there is a risk that confounding factors may emerge during the study period, interfering with the assessment of pain perception in the study population. However, if the intervention group has significantly lower levels of pain perception compared to the control group, it is highly unlikely that confounding factors can account for this difference. [/EXCL] The six-week duration of the study is considered sufficient to observe any possible differences in pain perception between the intervention and control groups. Longer studies with more follow-up visits may be necessary to fully understand the effects of the intervention. \n\n[OUTCOME] How will the primary outcome be measured?",

Methods: Patients who underwent single\u2010leg HTO for varus or valgus knee deformities and were 5 years from their index HTO were identified and included in this study. The Tegner knee function score and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to assess the health\u2010related quality of life (HRQL) 2 years after the index HTO. Associations between HRQL and patient characteristics were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLMs). Results: The current study included 245 patients (mean age 51.8 years, 71% female). HRQL was significantly decreased from 20.3 (SD 3.6) before to 14.3 (SD 2.4) after 2 years. The most pronounced changes were seen in pain (from 44.5 (SD 6.4) to 34.2 (SD 4.9) points), symptoms (from 56 (SD 8.9) to 43.8 (SD 9.4) points) and physical function scores (from 45.4 (SD 6.3) to 36.2 (SD 5.2) points). In the generalized linear models, female sex was associated with decreased HRQL [Tegner: \u20101.2, p = 0.004, KOOS Subscale: \u20100.8\u20101.5, p = 0.012\u20100.04]. An increased age at the time of reconstruction was not associated with the health\u2010related quality of life. Conclusion: In conclusion, HRQL is negatively affected by HTO. The greatest decreases are seen at two years after reconstruction for the pain, symptoms and physical function subscales of KOOS. Female sex is associated with worse HRQL."

            "According to the treatment guidelines of the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) in the UK, the target volumes should be delineated according to the breast cancer stages. For patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk breast cancer, the target volume should generally include the whole breast and regional lymph nodes. For patients with high-risk breast cancer, the target volume may include the whole breast, regional lymph nodes, and chest wall. In contrast, for patients with very high-risk breast cancer, the target volume may include the whole breast, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and internal mammary nodes. The extent of target volumes may vary depending on the breast cancer stage and the patient's situation. Therefore, we recommend that the target volumes for different study arms be determined based on the patient's breast cancer stages and the RCR guidelines.

Can you tell me more about the intervention or treatment that will be used? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study was initiated through a collaborative project between Korea National Cancer Center and Samsung Pharm Co, Ltd. The drug used in this study, JHU 2-10, is a highly active receptor for the human epidermal growth factor type 2 (HER2) with unique structure of HER2 dimerization. It is a highly purified drug produced from a single molecular, with no contamination from other similar drugs. There is currently no approved drug in Korea for patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer with a HER2 mutation (or known HER2 amplification). The drug in this study, JHU 2-10, has been administered in previous clinical trials and showed evidence of tolerability and antitumor effect. Therefore, this study was aimed to perform a clinical study to determine proper methods of administering this drug and the best dose to minimize side effects and maximize efficacy.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is a dose-escalation study for the drug JHU 2-10 to determine the optimal treatment dose. The study was conducted under a Simon design and patients were equally divided into 6 different groups according to the dose of JHU 2-10. Patients were treated every 3 weeks for 2 cycles without a rest period (21 days). Patients who were treated with the drug for 2 cycles at each dose were assessed for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Drug-related side effects evaluated for DLT assessment included hematological and non-hematological toxicities, such as neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension and peripheral neuropathy. DLT was assessed at the end of the second cycle of drug administration, when symptoms resolved or after a 3-week interval, whichever was longer. If a patient was confirmed to have DLT, the next dose group was added to the trial. Otherwise, 2 more patients will be enrolled in the current group, and the patient cohort for assessing DLT will be assessed after 3 more weeks of follow-up.

To investigate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin for prevention of exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Materials and methods. A 36\u2010month multicenter open\u2010label, prospective, randomized controlled study was performed on 59 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were treated with alogliptin (n=29) and glimepiride (n=30). The effects of treatment on pulmonary functions, 6\u2010minute walking distance (6MWD), symptoms of exacerbation, and lung cancer risk factors were compared. Results. Alogliptin was effective in preventing exacerbations, leading to reduction in the frequency of exacerbation from 3.17\u00b11.74 to 0.00\u00b10.00 per year and total days of exacerbation from 28.48\u00b151.12 to 0.00\u00b10.00 days in COPD patients, whereas glimepiride was not. Significant changes in symptoms of COPD were also observed in the alogliptin group, and lung cancer risk factors significantly decreased in the alogliptin group compared to the glimepiride group. Conclusions. Alogliptin improved exacerbation and prevention of symptoms of COPD as well as risk factors of lung cancer in patients with COPD. Thus, alogliptin could reduce risks of lung cancer and exacerbations of COPD.",

Please provide me with a brief description of the interventions. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The clinical problem is that many patients treated by gastroenterologists complain about digestive ailments and often consult non\u2010conventional practitioners. This may be related to lifestyle (anxiolitic and antidepressant) factors, as well as dietary factors (rich in refined carbohydrates), which are more easily available. Methods & analysis: We will use a two\u2010arm cluster randomised controlled clinical trial design; a cohort of 200 patients from clinical practice, divided into two groups that will receive either a conventional treatment intervention or nutritional/dietetic intervention for digestion. The nutritional intervention will offer information about the diet and lifestyle modification. The conventional treatment intervention will offer conventional clinical practice for digestion. Primary outcomes are as follows: general health (EuroQol\u20105D), functional gastrointestinal disorders [Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI)], quality of life (EuroQol\u20105D), and clinical outcomes (clinical examination, laboratory tests, nutritional assessment, gastroscopy and endoscopy). Secondary outcomes are as follows: anxiety, depression and stress [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)]; digestive function (self\u2010report scales); nutritional assessment (nutritional laboratory tests); digestive symptoms and behaviours (questionnaires); daily habits and attitudes related to nutrition (Nutrition Behaviour Questionnaire); daily habits and attitudes related to physical activity (Physical Activity Questionnaire); daily habits and attitudes related to stress, anxiety and depression (Daily Mood Log). Ethics and dissemination: This intervention will be conducted and evaluated according to the National Health Council (CONSORT) and the SPIRIT guidelines. The results will be discussed in a scientific forum in a way that they are made available to all researchers interested in the area.

It's important to carefully design study arms to ensure that the trial is effective and provides accurate results. \n\nAbstract:\nObjectives: To assess the clinical significance of the recently introduced automated technique known as the single bundle technique (SBT) in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using the radial artery graft. Background: SBT is an innovative technique that allows surgeons to place various anastomoses for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with a single needle inserted into the artery over 2 needles. However, the clinical significance of the SBT remains to be determined. Procedure: SBT was performed in 60 patients undergoing CABG with the radial artery graft. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: experimental (n\u00a0= 30) and control (n\u00a0= 30). The experimental group underwent CABG using the single needle technique, while the control group underwent CABG using traditional manual techniques. The primary outcomes of the study were bleeding complications, sternal wound infection, and in\u2010hospital cardiac complications. Results: The SBT was successfully performed in all 60 patients. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of baseline characteristics. On follow\u2010up, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups in terms of in\u2010hospital bleeding and cardiac complications. In spite of the fact that the SBT was not inferior to the manual technique, the graft was opened in only 1 patient in the experimental group. The SBT allows for a faster and easier radial artery harvest, reducing the operative time significantly. Conclusion: SBT is a new technique for harvesting the radial artery by using the same needle. This technique can be used in the majority of patients, and it leads to shorter surgical time and fewer surgical stress and adverse outcomes."

            "Regarding design details, I suggest choosing one or more alternative designs that match the nature of your trial. This will make it faster and easier to find participants. Here are some possible options for this study: In the control group, the participant follows the standard care of SPC Nottwil for tracheostomy tube weaning and decannulation (no use of alternative protocols such as the Cough-Assist Device or the Decannulation Protocol). In the next arm, participants can take part in the Cough-Assist Device trial, which will evaluate the effectiveness of the device and its impact on the ability to decannulate and improve overall health and quality of life of people with paraplegia. \n\nIn the third arm, patients can also be part of the Decannulation Protocol trial, which will investigate the use of the protocol and its impact on the ability to decannulate and improve overall health and quality of life of people with paraplegia. In the fourth arm, the participant uses their current method of tracheostomy tube weaning and decannulation, but they also receive additional support from the care team to help them improve their skills related to swallowing, coughing, and controlling the tracheostomy tube.    In the final arm, the participant can use any type of non-invasive mechanical ventilation support while receiving standard care from SPC Nottwil for tracheostomy tube weaning and decannulation. \n\nThis design will help you compare the results of each intervention and identify the most effective and efficient approach for tracheostomy tube weaning and decannulation in people with paraplegia. If you decide to use this design, I recommend using a randomized controlled trial design with multiple arms to ensure that your results are reliable and unbiased. \n\nYou can also refer to the guidelines from the Swiss National Science Foundation for further guidance on designing such a clinical trial.  https://www.snf.ch/en/home.html\n\nI hope this helps!

            "For the criteria, it's the same as for the first arm. However, the intervention/treatment would involve the use of an objective tool for assessing the patient's readiness for decannulation, such as the Decannulation Readiness Assessment Tool (DRAT) or the Tracheostomy Decannulation Readiness Assessment Scale (TDRAS). The reasoning behind this arm is to compare the effectiveness of the objective tool with the standard clinical evaluation in determining the readiness for decannulation. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short\u2010term effects of a high\u2010protein diet on upper skeletal muscle mass in non\u2010diabetic healthy individuals.METHODS: In this randomized, controlled parallel\u2010arm study, 26 young men were stratified by body mass index (BMI) and randomized to a high protein diet or standard diet for 5 days. Skeletal muscle mass was measured by computed tomography (CT) at the android and gynoid regions. Whole\u2010body protein requirements were determined by a 5\u2010day balance study and used to calculate the 16\u2010component formula to optimize protein intake over the 5\u2010day intervention period.RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects (n, 14 per arm) was 23 \u00b1 2 years. Mean body weight was 72.8 \u00b1 12.5 kg, and BMI was 25.3 \u00b1 3.1 kg\u00b7m2, with 3 subjects in each group being overweight and 11 having normal weight. The groups did not differ in android or gynoid muscle area, or in leg muscle area, fat\u2010free mass, or whole\u2010body protein requirements. On average, the men increased their protein intake by 97.4 \u00b1 60.7 g/d, which would be calculated to have resulted in an average loss of 187 mg of leg muscle nitrogen.CONCLUSION: The diet induced a small, statistically non\u2010significant, positive imbalance in net muscle protein balance using the 16\u2010component formula after 5 days. This imbalance would need to be sustained for a year or more to be functionally significant.

The intervention/treatment would be a structured care pathway, which may involve individualized nursing care or support services during the decannulation process. This arm is designed to assess the effectiveness of this structured care pathway in improving outcomes and supporting the decannulation process in patients with specific needs. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Tracheostomy is a common procedure in intensive care and other care settings, primarily for patients with a critical illness or those with tracheal obstructive diseases. Decannulation, or the removal of the tracheostomy tube, is a crucial step in the recovery process. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured care pathway and post\u2010decannulation follow\u2010up monitoring in patients undergoing decannulation at the Swiss Paraplegic Center Nottwil (SPC). Methods: This is a prospective cohort study with four study arms: (1) tracheotomized adult in\u2010patients with any medical diagnosis, (2) patients decannulated in the SPC, (3) planned decannulation at the SPC during the project\u2019s data collection period, and (4) patients with planned decannulation at the SPC during the project\u2019s data collection period and follow\u2010up monitoring. The study outcomes include measures of patient and family/caregiver satisfaction, health\u2010related quality of life (HRQOL), and clinician and patient/family/caregiver evaluation of the decannulation process. Patients undergoing decannulation will undergo standardized assessments during the procedure and at follow\u2010up visits, depending on their study arm. Results: Enrolled patients will be monitored for a duration of 3 months post\u2010decannulation. Data analysis will involve descriptive analyses and statistical comparisons between the study arms using appropriate tests, including t\u2010tests and analysis of variance. Conclusions: This study will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of a structured care pathway and post\u2010decannulation monitoring in patients undergoing decannulation at the Swiss Paraplegic Center Nottwil. The findings may inform future improvements in patient care processes and clinical decision\u2010making related to tracheostomy management and decannulation.",

We hypothesise that an integrated approach combining the analysis of clinical practice and subjective experiences will provide valuable insights into the tracheostomy-related care pathway, identify risk factors associated with decannulation, and contribute to the development of evidence-based guidelines for its safe and effective implementation.To assess patients' experiences, a qualitative, semi-structured interview approach is chosen. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the experiences and perspectives of patients, and is especially suitable for exploring sensitive and complex topics related to health and well-being.

People with sleep apnea usually have an alteration of sleeping architecture, which causes a high level of fatigue during the day. A lot of rehabilitation programs are being developed to improve this disorder. As sleep maintenance insomnia is very common in patients with sleep apnea and is a problem of itself, the aim of this project is to target improvement of sleep maintenance insomnia in patients with sleep apnea, thanks to the modulation of the cerebral sleep rhythms with transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a non-invasive and safe neurostimulation technique. In the investigator's first research project (Phase I), the investigator will identify patients that are eligible for tACS. This will be a pilot observational study, with about fifteen patients. The main goals of this project are to test the acceptability of tACS for this indication (in terms of safety and tolerability) and to check the reproducibility of the effects of the stimulation.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nModulation of the Cerebral Sleep Rhythms With Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation to Improve Patient's Sleep in the Frame of Sleep Apnea Syndrome\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nInsomnia Sleep-Type, Sleep Maintenance With Insomnia Complaint, Central and Obstructive Sleep Apnea\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation)\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Male and female patients of 18 years or oldest, Undergoing rehabilitation of a sleep apnea syndrome defined with or without an associated insomnia disorder (counselled or undergoing psychological or medical rehabilitation), Have a",

This is because 64Cu FAPI preferentially accumulates in those types of cancers. An FAPI PET-CT scan can be used to detect cancer.Sometimes cancer patients cannot undergo an FAPI PET-CT scan because they have had certain drugs that can bind to 64Cu FAPI. For example, patients who take proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for a long time cannot have an FAPI PET-CT scan. Proton pump inhibitors affect the way 64Cu FAPI behaves in the body, causing it to show up in a different way on the scan. This study aims to learn how PPI therapy can affect the way 64Cu FAPI behaves, which may affect the way that 64Cu FAPI PET-CT scans are interpreted by doctors.Who can participate?Adults with cancer who are scheduled to undergo a second 64Cu FAPI PET-CT scan at least 4 weeks after their first 64Cu FAPI PET-CT scan.

In this article, we outline the importance of studying the use of hydroxychloroquine in IRP patients and the potential benefits and risks of the drug. The use of hydroxychloroquine in IRP patients has the potential to improve their quality of life and reduce the need for long\u2010term steroid use. However, it is important to ensure that the drug is used safely and effectively by carefully monitoring potential side effects and adjusting the dosage as necessary. We discuss the available evidence on the use of hydroxychloroquine in IRP patients and propose a clinical trial to further investigate its efficacy and safety.

This procedure can lead to postoperative parenchymal fistula (POPF), as well as bleeding, hematoma, and biliary leak. Postoperative pancreatic fistula is the most common complication of pancreatic surgery. Pancreatic fistula can disrupt the healing process and result in delayed recovery and hospitalization. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of using the Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) device as a device, and the incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula. METHODS: The inclusion criteria will be 50 cases of pancreatic head tumors that require transection of the pancreatic body or tail. The exclusion criteria will be patients with a history of chronic pancreatitis, preoperative infection or inflammation, preoperative radiotherapy, and patients with hemodynamic or other severe complications prior to the operation. After obtaining the approval of the ethics committee, 50 patients will be randomly divided into two groups. All patients will receive standard preoperative examination and treatment. Patients who receive traditional surgery using a scalpel will be assigned to the experimental group, and patients who receive pancreatic transection with the CUSA device will be assigned to the comparator group. POPF incidence, hospitalization costs, and postoperative recovery time will be compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The results of this study will be statistically analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. The significance and effectiveness of our conclusions will be determined by analyzing the differences in POPF incidence, hospitalization costs, and postoperative recovery time between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide new evidence for the clinical use of the CUSA device in pancreatic transection procedures, thereby reducing the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistulas.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nPancreatic fistula is a common complication of pancreatic surgery, which can lead to pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function damage",

I'm glad I could help.\n\nAbstract:\n=================\nBackground: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a common complication after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), which increases morbidity and mortality rates. The Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) has been used in various laparoscopic surgeries to achieve hemostasis and reduce complications. However, its application in PD remains unclear. This study aims to analyze the efficacy and safety of the CUSA device in reducing POPF incidence during pancreatoduodenectomy. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in China among PD patients (aged 18\u201380 years) from May 2019 to January 2022. The study design was a comparison of two groups: those who underwent PD using the CUSA device and those who underwent PD using a surgical scalpel. POPF was defined according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery consensus guidelines. The primary outcome was rates of postoperative complications, while the secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, postoperative mortality, and recurrence rate. Results: A total of 60 patients were included in the study, with 30 in each group. The age, gender, and disease etiology were comparable between the groups. The total postoperative complication rate was significantly lower in the CUSA group compared to the surgical scalpel group (P\u2009<\u2009.05). There was no significant difference in postoperative POPF rates between the groups (P\u2009>\u2009.05). The length of hospital stay and postoperative mortality rates were not significantly different between the groups (P\u2009>\u2009.05). Conclusions: Use of the CUSA device during PD appears safe and reduces the incidence of overall postoperative complications without increasing POPF rates.

New therapies have been developed to reduce the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events in AF patients and one of the goals is to determine which of the new therapies is the most effective and safe. Several clinical trials have been showing conflicting results and recommendations for their use continue to be controversial. The investigators will follow for up to 5 years AF patients under treatment with drugs indicated for the treatment of Heart Failure (HF). The investigators goal is to study which drug can be more effective in reducing the progression to the advanced stages of HF in these patients\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAtrial Fibrillation (AF) is becoming one of the main causes of heart failure. The risk of heart failure in AF patients is the greatest in those treated with \u03b2-blockers, calcium antagonists, and digoxin. The use of loop diuretics seems to protect against heart failure. The new direct current inhibitors of Ionotropic Receptors (IRI) may be cardioprotective. Furthermore, some non-IRI drugs that have been developed for the treatment of heart failure (HF), such as Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNI) or Soluble Guanylate Cyclase (sGC) Stimulators (YCs), could also potentially prevent AF recurrence in patients already treated for the same indication. The objective of the registry is to prospectively follow for 5 years AF patients treated with IRI or non-IRI drugs indicated for the treatment of Heart Failure (HF), in order to evaluate the prognosis of patients according to the type of treatment. For the purpose, the investigators will follow a large series of patients followed in a university hospital in 2012-13. The registry aims to contribute to defining criteria for the use of these drugs in AF patients in addition to the classic heart failure drugs.

In addition, a meta\u2010analysis of small RCTs of intravenous iron infusion in patients with low ferritin levels suggest a role in improving symptoms and exercise capacity. Despite these findings, the role of intravenous iron in the routine practice for heart failure patients is not well known. Objective: This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the effi\u2010cacy of intravenous iron therapy as an adjunct to therapy in patients with reduced ejection fraction and decompensated heart failure in routine clinical practice. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patient records from September 2004 to March 2019. Records with diagnosis of heart failure and iron deficiency (ID) (ferritin < 200 ng/mL and transferrin saturation \u2264 25%) were reviewed. ID was treated with intravenous iron therapy according to the local protocol. Blood biochemistries were assessed within the past 28 days for iron deficiency. Improvement after treatment was defined by a delta percentage change of >10% of hemoglobin level above the lower limit of normal. Results: A total of 108 patients with a mean age of 68.0 \u00b1 11.3 years and a mean follow\u2010up time of 840 \u00b1 770 days were treated for ID. Iron deficiency was more pronounced in men (n = 67, 62%), patients with ischemic (n = 78, 72%) and non\u2010ischemic cardiomyopathy (n = 95, 89%), and patients with diabetes (n = 73, 68%) or hypertension (n = 63, 59%).

            "Great! Now, before we move on, I have one question related to both study arms. Why have you chosen to include two separate arms for SGLT2 inhibitors and sGC stimulators, rather than just one study arm with both drugs?",
            "That sounds reasonable. What is the reasoning behind this design? \nAbstract:\nBackground: Pregabalin is a calcium\u2010influx inhibitor, frequently used in the management of neuropathic pain. The mode of action of pregabalin has been elucidated over time \u2010 it has anticonvulsant and anti\u2010seizure properties through binding to the alpha\u20102delta subunit of voltage\u2010gated calcium channels on the nerve membrane. It inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and increases the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. As a result, it reduces the perception of pain in patients with neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action of pregabalin has been studied in multiple models and is well\u2010known. It is likely to have a similar mechanism of action in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS). We hypothesize that pregabalin will be effective in the treatment of RLS. Methods: We are conducting a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled clinical trial in 40 patients with moderate to severe symptoms of RLS. The trial aims to establish the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in the management of RLS. We will evaluate the patient's symptoms using the International Restless Legs Scoring Scale, which assesses the frequency, severity, and intensity of symptoms, as well as the quality of life (RLSQOL) impact of the disease. The treatment period will last for 8 weeks, and patients will be stratified according to their symptoms at baseline. Results: The primary outcome of the study is the change in International Restless Legs Scoring Scale (IRLS) scores\u00a0from baseline. The secondary outcome will be changes in the RLSQOL. Adverse effects, such as dizziness, somnolence, depression, and cognitive impairment, will also be assessed as safety outcomes. Conclusion: If this study shows that pregabalin is effective and safe in the management of RLS, it will provide a new treatment option for patients with RLS, especially those who have not responded to existing therapies. This study will provide valuable experimental evidence for the use of pregabalin in the management of RLS, contributing to the development of new and effective therapies for patients with RLS.",

Materials/Methods : Thirty\u2010six right\u2010dominant workers with NMN and no prior history of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were recruited to prevent the occurrence of ACTS. The subjects were randomized into three groups. All subjects performed acupressure, wrist splinting and education about appropriate ergonomic behaviors. The subjects in the acupressure group underwent acupressure after 30min of splinting for hand and wrist, the splinting group applied the wrist splinting for 10min after acupressure and the education group received only education without any treatment for 15min. Results : After 12 weeks, the incidence rate of ACS was significantly lower in both intervention groups than in the control group (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the wrist pain, median motor nerve conduction (MMNC) and the pressure pain threshold (PPT) of median and lateral epicondyle between both intervention groups except ulnar motor nerve conduction (UMNC) (p<0.001). Conclusion : 12 weeks of acupressure and splinting resulted in lower incidence of ACS than education alone with no difference in pain severity and nerve function among the groups.

Methods A high\u2010risk population of untreated CKD population (creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) who underwent AAA surgery between 2004 and 2013 was retrospectively reviewed from the National Disease Registry in Taiwan. A three\u2010point scale index was developed by including age, ankle\u2010brachial index, and hemoglobin into the model. The patients were equally allocated into test and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. The calibration and validity of the new index with or without two new parameters erythrocyte sedimentation rate and albumin (ESR/ALB) were then assessed and compared based on clinical characteristics and outcomes. Results Of the eligible 2054 patients (69.2% male, median age of 67 years); 3162 (15.3%) CKD patients had AAA (2096 and 1066 were assigned to the validation and test cohorts, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.835, 0.846, and 0.846 for the three models. The integrated discrimination improvement, net reclassification index, and the calibration showed no significant differences between the models. Compared with the baseline risk, the use of the new model containing 4 parameters (ESR/ALB) slightly increased C\u2010statistic from 0.831 to 0.837 (P = 0.445). Conclusions The new model with or without 4 parameters demonstrated equivalent accuracy in predicting the risk of untreated CKD patients with AAA."

            "Undergoing DCCV involves the administration of an appropriate dose of Suxethonium Chloride for sedation. As per the manufacturer's protocol, a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg will be given and repeated in 5 minutes if appropriate. The patient will remain intubated until the end of DC Cardioversion. At that time, the patient will also undergo Pulmonary Vein Isolation following which the Intubation tube will be removed and the patient will undergo anesthesia via a Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA). Following pre-procedural tests, the two femoral veins will be punctured with a 16G introducer sheath and an 8F pigtail catheter will be inserted at the superior vena cava under ECG observation. Two sheaths will be inserted in the two femoral veins through the introducer sheath in the same location as the 16G introducer sheath. The distance from the femoral vein puncture point to the mid-point of the two femoral veins, which is approximately 2.5 cm, is calculated using a ruler to facilitate accurate sheath insertion. A multi-point electrode catheter is used to locate the four pulmonary veins. Under the guidance of a left cavity map, the left atrial and left cardiac chambers are connected. Based on the catheter positioning and mapping, ablation will be performed at the following structures: left atrial roof, anterolateral pulmonary vein line, superior pulmonary vein line, inferior pulmonary vein line, mitral isthmus, and the left atrial posterior wall if the PV is not completely isolated. Ablation line is constructed approximately 5 mm from the PV. Bidirectional block is assessed for all ablation lines to ensure adequate isolation of the PV. During the operation, continuous intravenous anesthesia was maintained using Fentanyl and Midazolam. After successful ablation, the sheaths and pigtail catheters will be removed, local hemostasis will be performed as necessary, and the patient will be monitored in the ICU, and the ICD lead connector will be removed in the ICU, and the LMA will be removed in the ICU after the patient",

            "For intermittent phrenic nerve pacing, a quadripolar catheter will be positioned at the right ventricular apex or interventricular septum using local anesthetic and xylocaine sedation. After that, the electrophysiologist will deliver a DC shock of 200 joules for 3 seconds, which will mimic the effects of ablation but will not create any lesions. Following that, the electrode will be retracted from the phrenic nerve while being under local anesthetic and sedation. The ablation catheter will then be placed through the venous sheath at the pulmonary veins and moved at the same distance where the electrophysiologist ablated for the active comparator arm. This is to ensure that the ablation catheter won't touch the phrenic nerve to prevent any adverse effects.

            "Perfect. Now that we have all the necessary information, let's start designing the study arms. We'll begin with the active comparator arm. In this arm, patients will undergo DC cardioversion (DCCV) plus pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Additionally, an implantable loop recorder will be inserted in the pre-pectoral area with local anesthetic at least one week before randomization. Two femoral sheaths will also be inserted at the groin area in all patients on the day of the procedure prior to randomization. Is there anything you'd like to add or modify for this arm?",

Participants will receive standardised protocolised education on self-administered therapy and will undergo an in-person nurse visit followed by remote monitoring.\n\nParticipants will undergo 2 pre-screen tests to ensure they are eligible to participate in the trial, and the pre-screen tests will be reviewed by an MS expert. They will have an enrolment phone call followed by 6 telephone calls which will be conducted by a clinical nurse consultant (CNC), each occurring during different times of the day: 3 in the afternoon at 2pm (Monday, week 4, week 6); and 3 in the morning at 9am (Tuesday, Wednesday, week 8).  The initial phone calls occur at the start of the onboarding program and may include a visual support tool to confirm understanding of the therapy, and a review of any safety concerns experienced thus far during therapy. The 2 following morning phone calls are designed to assess if the patients experienced any problems with therapy. The 2 remaining afternoon phone calls are designed to ask the patient further questions on self-administered therapy education and the experience of the patient managing their therapy. It is expected the calls will last approximately 5 minutes.\n\nBackground information such as demographics will be recorded by the nurse and any data collected during these calls and pre-screen tests will be reviewed and stored by an MS expert.\n\nAll enrolled patients will receive a reminder email or SMS reminder 1 day prior to each scheduled telephone call.

This study aimed to explore the influence of COVID\u201019, social support, and socioeconomic factors on surgical outcomes after esophageal and gastric cancer surgery in PLWH versus non\u2010PLWH.METHODS: This was a sub\u2010study of a prospective cohort study conducted at multiple sites. Consecutive patients were enrolled and followed up. The primary outcome was length of stay (LOS). Univariate analysis was performed to compare the surgical outcomes between PLWH and the non\u2010PLWH group. Factors thought to be associated with LOS were added stepwise to a multivariate cox\u2010regression analysis.RESULTS: Between January 2018 and October 2019, 463 patients underwent esophagectomy and 71 patients laparoscopic gastric surgery with a total of 534 surgeries in the cohort. There were 20 PLWH (n\u2009=\u200910) and 514 non\u2010PLWH (n\u2009=\u2009265). The demographic, operative, and tumor characteristics of PLWH were identical to the non\u2010PLWH group (p\u2009>\u2009\u20090.05).

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purposes of the study are to estimate the safety and efficacy of this procedure in relieving post-chemotherapy and/or post-radiation therapy symptoms of severe pain with significant and prolonged disability not alleviated by at least 2 months of maximally tolerable oral analgesics, and to study changes in cerebral circulation and blood/brain oxygenation with this procedure. Cerebral circulation and hemodynamic measurements, magnetic resonance imaging, and evaluation of disability will be performed before and after the procedure. Additionally, cerebral venous oxygen saturation (SJV), total hemoglobin, and plasma levels of angiogenic factors in cerebrospinal fluid will be measured. The investigators hypothesize that this procedure should improve cerebral oxygen balance and therefore should provide pain relief and decreased disability.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe investigators will determine the safety and potential efficacy of transperineal transcranial direct current stimulation of a target cortical area combined with the intravenous infusion of high dose intravenous ascorbic acid (IVAA) in the treatment of intractable chronic pain due to brain pathology, such as brain metastases, following standard of care intravenous chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy, both of which are typically accompanied by the systemic administration of steroids. Patients with brain metastases are usually very sensitive to steroids. Steroid administration often results in the return of vision and cognitive function and a reduction in tumor progression and pain. However, systemic administration of steroids for a long duration can be harmful with a number of potential side effects. While pain due to brain metastases can be effectively treated by the use of oral analgesics, this option is often limited by poor neurologic status, intolerable side effects, and the risk for addiction. Brain metastases produce high concentrations of norepinephrine and interacts with the central nervous system to produce pain. High levels of extracellular norepinephrine are neurotoxic. In vitro studies demonstrate the norepinephrine in the brain metabolizes to dopamine ascorbic acid, which is thought to mediate pain. The aim of this study is to perform",

A dose of 800 mg in a 20-minute infusion will be administered in dose level (DL) 1. Based on data from the first 3 subjects in DL1, subsequent doses will be escalated in dose-escalation cohorts. After the MTD or RP2D has been identified for ROSE12 doses at 15-minute, 20-minute, 30-minute, 1 hour, 1.5 hour, and 2 hour infusions, an additional cohort of 1-subject Dose escalation will be enrolled to determine if a higher MTD or RP2D can be identified. The first subject of this DL dose escalation cohort will receive a dose of ~2,000mg. In an attempt to obtain data on both MTD and RP2D, the dose escalation will proceed to a 1700 mg dose if the DL1 dose is tolerated for 4 cycles. This will help determine whether it might be safely possible to administer weekly ROSE12 (800 mg), while simultaneously receiving Atezolizumab (840 mg) on a 3-weekly cycle, and whether this would be superior to Atezolizumab alone. Arm B: ROSE12 is administered via intravenous infusion and/or atezolizumab is administered via intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each 21\u2013day cycle.

We aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a web\u2010based program addressing mental health problems and trauma\u2010related symptoms. 143 participants (aged 11\u201318) were allocated to either a 4\u2010week intervention (Building a Strong Identity and Coping Skills [BaSICS]) or a 4\u2010week waitlist control. The intervention program aimed to teach youth aged 11\u201018 how to recognize stress\u2010related symptoms, and to encourage them to develop healthy coping skills. Our primary analysis showed that participation in the intervention was feasible and acceptable to participants. The intervention's impact on self\u2010reported mental health symptoms was similar in magnitude to the positive impact previously identified in face\u2010to\u2010face delivery. The intervention program was deemed acceptable to the majority of participants, and no serious adverse events were reported. Implementation issues may need further consideration when scaling up the intervention. These findings indicate that the BaSICS program can have a positive, enduring effect in a widely available Web\u2010based format, which could prove beneficial in promoting mental health among teenagers."

The participants will be randomly assigned to two groups, an IMT group and a control group. The IMT group will use a training device (POWERbreathe K2) for inhalation training for 12 weeks, 5 days a week, and 30 minutes per session. The volume-controlled exercise will start from 30% of the maximum inspiratory pressure to 50% at week 12, with 20-25% load at 50% maximum inspiratory pressure per week of training. The control group will not use the training device and will only go through regular medical rehabilitation programs for COPD, consisting of inspiratory exercises (breathing maneuver to improve chest expansion), training using a thoracotomy board, back muscle exercises using a balance ball, inspiratory muscle exercises using a Threshold Loading Resistance Training System (LTRTS) (threshold loading inspiratory muscle training using LTRTS for 15 minutes each session, 2 times a week), and a walking program for 60 minutes, 3 times a week.

            "I see. Thank you for your cooperation!\n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study is designed to determine the effects of supplementing the liquid diet prescribed to patients who have had colon or rectal surgery with specific concentrations of a product containing fish proteins and vitamins known as Immunonutrition. Because patients who have had colostomy surgery often have a change in their diet following surgery, the research team wishes to determine if it is safe to include the nutrients studied here in their post-operative diet. The goal is to improve the patients' response to stress by reducing inflammation in the body. The aim of the research is to answer two questions. First, when the Immunonutrition is taken by the patient's stoma following surgery, does it help the white blood cells (which are important for fighting infections) to stay protected in their own cell membrane (their defense mechanism)? Second, does it help them to stay in circulation longer than normal? If either of these effects is seen, it might contribute to a reduction in the chances of infection after colostomy surgery.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nInflammation is a key part of immunity, which is an important defence mechanism in the body. The immune system is like the army of the body and usually it defends the body against foreign invaders, including bacteria, viruses and other harmful substances. The body tries to keep the immune response under control, to ensure that inflammation is limited. If it is not controlled, chronic inflammation can have a damaging effect. It can damage healthy tissue and has been linked to various common diseases, including heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and some cancers. Certain treatments involving drugs, including radiotherapy, anti-cancer drugs and chemotherapy used prior to transplantation procedures can also cause these diseases. Another way that the drugs may contribute to inflammation is through the damage they do to the white blood cells. White blood cells (specifically neutrophils) are part of the immune defense system and are found in abundance in the bloodstream. They have the ability to fight infection. Neutrophils are known to become inflamed themselves (they swell and this causes tissue in the body to become inflamed). They also release chemicals that can cause inflammation. These chemicals have important roles in fighting infections",

This intervention aims to improve depressive symptoms in LLD patients who have not responded to traditional antidepressant therapy.\n   - Reasoning: This arm is necessary to assess the efficacy of tDCS as an adjunctive treatment for LLD.

            "That's a great question! Allocation is an important aspect of study design. In simple random sampling, each primary health care center has an equal probability of being assigned to either study arm. This approach is best suited when there is no imbalance between the two groups, such as when they are considered equal. However, when there is imbalance between the groups, it's better to use stratified random sampling, which takes into account the potential imbalance and ensures that the groups are comparable. For instance, if the study focuses on a specific disease, such as asthma or diabetes, you may want to stratify by disease type. In Sweden, we typically use the PRECEDE system (Primary, Randomized, Controlled, Equivalent Design)  to decide if there is a need for stratification in the random sampling technique .

If the patient remained to be resistant, a high dosage of the gel on affected sites once daily was allowed as an add\u2010on treatment for 7 days (period II). If pruritus persisted again the application of capsaicin gel could be repeated with a wash\u2010off period of 7 days in both period I and period II. In period I, 30% of patients showed a clinical score of 0 or 1 on the modified SAR score and complete remission was observed at the end of the course. On the other hand, during the course with high dosage of the capsaicin gel in period II, complete remission was achieved in 60% of the patients treated.

This multi\u2010center, parallel\u2010arm study will assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of MRS and FUS neuromodulation in the treatment of MiMICE. METHODS: Sixty participants aged 18 to 80 years with a diagnosis of MiMICE will be enrolled.

Meningococcal meningitis is caused by an invasion of the meninges and/or bloodstream by Neisseria meningitidis. The most common manifestation in neonates is meningitis, which is associated with fever, irritability, seizures, refusal to breastfeed, hypothermia, apnea, limb- or skin-fold petechiae, bulging fontanelles, jaundice, lethargy and impaired consciousness or seizures. These patients often have a poor outcome, and the mortality rate is high. Bacteria can be isolated from the blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. In cases of invasive meningococcal infection, septicaemia may also develop because the bacteria can spread through the bloodstream. The clinical presentation of septicaemia includes a poor general condition, including refusal to take a bottle, lethargy and fever or hypothermia. Meningococcal septicaemia is a medical emergency. Patients with septicaemia are at risk of developing hypotension",

It's important to note that the decision to initiate treatment with Saxenda\u00ae was made by the patient and the treating physician independently from the decision to participate in the study. This means that the participants' enrollment in the study does not affect or replace the initial decision to prescribe Saxenda\u00ae. It ensures that the decision to use Saxenda\u00ae was made solely on the clinical judgment of the treating physician based on their assessment of the patient's medical needs.

We are hoping to recruit 30 patients who are candidates for rotator cuff repair to be included in the study. They will be randomly allocated to two groups: arthroscopic anterior superior capsular release (ASCR) or standard acromioplasty. The primary outcome will be the change in postoperative Constant-Murley score, and the secondary outcomes will include subscapularis tendon thickness, acromiohumeral distance, fatty infiltration, superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) lesions, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) grades. \nThe control and intervention groups will be compared to determine any significant differences in the outcomes. We aim to obtain statistical and clinical significance by analyzing the data collected before and after surgery. We hope to gain insight into the effectiveness of arthroscopic ASCR in improving shoulder function, and we will conduct a statistical analysis to determine the significance of the results. \nWe anticipate that there will be some limitations to this study, such as the relatively small sample size and the potential for bias due to the unblinded nature of the trial. However, we believe that the findings from this study will contribute to the evidence base on the effectiveness of arthroscopic ASCR in rotator cuff repairs. \nOverall, our study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of arthroscopic ASCR in improving shoulder function after rotator cuff repair. By comparing the outcomes of the control and intervention groups, we will gather valuable information that can help patients and surgeons make more informed decisions about treatment options. \n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Purpose:: Treatment\nPhase:: Not applicable\nIntervention Model:: Parallel\nBlinding/Masking:: Single\nBlinded Subject:: Subject\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: /Procedure/Surgery\nIntervention Description:: Patients of both genders who meet the study criteria will be randomly assigned to the ASCR or standard acromioplasty group after receiving standardized protocol of care and education.

            "Abstract:\nBACKGROUND: Patients with cervical cancer harbour increased plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF \u2010R) 2 and low plasma levels of bone morphogenetic protein \u20107 prior to treatment are associated with poor survival after chemoradiation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between the endogenous biomarkers of VEGF \u2010R1/\u2010R2 with clinical outcomes in patients receiving cetuximab and chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for cervical cancer.METHOD: Biomarker values (VEGF \u2010R1/\u2010R2/\u2010R3) of 197 cervical cancer patients were retrospectively obtained and correlation with clinical and pathological outcomes was evaluated.RESULTS: Patients with elevated plasma level of VEGF \u2010R1/\u2010R2 prior to CRT were associated with increased VEGF\u2010A levels and were correlated with shorter progression\u2010free survival. While patients with VEGF \u2010R2 level higher than a median level prior to CRT were correlated to worse progression\u2010free survival. Patients whose VEGF \u2010R2/\u2010R3 ratio was lower than the median level prior to CRT trended to have significantly higher progression\u2010free survival rate, although this result didn't reach statistical significance. VEGF \u2010R3 was not predictive of clinical outcome.CONCLUSION: Increased plasma levels of VEGF \u2010R2 prior to CRT were associated with shorter progression\u2010free survival. However, further large randomized clinical trials investigating the prognostic significance of endogenous biomarkers of VEGF \u2010Rs are necessary for the precise treatment plan of cervical cancer patients."

The risk of fracture is 3-5 times greater in individuals with osteoporosis and 0.8- 1.0 times in those with osteopenia.

            "Thank you for your insight. If the intervention/treatment is staged resection after endoscopic stenting with Self-expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS), the participant group or arm will be staged resection after endoscopic stenting with SEMS. However, this arm may face challenges in terms of timing and effectiveness of chemotherapy initiation due to the need for additional surgery. This is where the inclusion/exclusion criteria play a crucial role in selecting appropriate patients. By carefully selecting patients who meet the eligibility criteria and are medically fit for both endoscopic stenting and surgery, we can ensure that the intervention/treatment is effective and safe. This arm will also provide valuable information on the role of endoscopic stenting in bridging the gap between the obstruction and surgery, thereby contributing to the improvement of patient outcomes in the future."

            "Thank you for the comprehensive criteria. Now, let's proceed to designing the study arms based on the information provided. We have two participant groups/arms to consider. The first one is primary surgical tumor resection with anastomosis or only tumor resection without anastomosis. The intervention/treatment for this arm is primary tumor resection. This arm is crucial as it represents the standard approach for treating obstructive left colon cancer. It allows for the comparison between patients undergoing primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis or without an anastomosis (Hartmann's procedure). This comparison will help determine the optimal surgical approach for these patients in terms of outcomes such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. What are your thoughts on this arm?",
            "That's a valid point. We can modify the intervention/treatment description to specify primary surgical tumor resection with a primary colorectal anastomosis, associated with or without a diverting loop ileostomy. This modification will allow us to analyze the impact of diverting loop ileostomy on stoma rate and quality of life. Thank you for your input! Now, let's move on to the second participant group/arm. This arm involves endoscopic stent positioning. The intervention/treatment is staged resection after endoscopic stenting with Self-expandable Metallic Stent (SEMS). This arm is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic stenting as a bridge to surgery for patients with obstructive left colon cancer. By comparing this approach with primary surgical tumor resection, we can assess the outcomes and benefits of each strategy, such as stoma rate, morbidity, mortality, and timing of chemotherapy initiation. This comparison will provide valuable information for clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment option for these patients. What are your thoughts on this arm?",

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPreterm infants are at risk for long-term pulmonary insufficiency. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has successfully been established for the acute treatment of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). However, weaning from NIV remains a challenge for many infants, which contributes to prolonged NICU stay and suboptimal neurologic outcome. The majority of preterm infants weaned to room air will undergo a phase of tachypnea during the first 48 hours; therefore, they may receive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or oxygen therapy for prolonged periods of time. Currently, prolonged need for oxygen therapy is defined as oxygen therapy >48 hrs at a flow rate >4 liters/minute of supplemental oxygen (SO2). Prolonged need for oxygen therapy is associated with high rates of neonatal morbidity (retinopathy of prematurity, invasive ventilation, death) and long-term mortality; therefore, preventing prolonged need for oxygen therapy is a major goal of NICU providers. Hypothesis: Dexamethasone administered in the first few days of life decreases overall length of O2 therapy in preterm infants with a moderate to severe degree of RDS. Study design: The investigators propose to conduct a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy trial, to determine whether neonatal dexamethasone is effective in reducing the overall length of oxygen therapy in preterm infants with moderate to severe RDS. The study would enroll 200 very preterm infants <32 6/7 weeks gestational age.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective chart review of 222 babies <36 weeks gestation delivered between January 1, 2007 and June 1, 2020. PDA closure was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography during admission and discharge. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared, and logistic regression was used to assess the association between early PDA closure and indomethacin dose. RESULTS: Of the 222 infants included in this study, 181(81.50%) had PDA closure during admission. Multivariate analysis after adjusting for covariates showed that indomethacin use during the first week of life was significantly associated with PDA closure, while postnatal age (PDA closure:17.2\u00b19.3, no PDA closure:22.7\u00b18.9days;P<0.001), the number of days of mechanical ventilation (16.3\u00b18.5,15.3\u00b110.1days;P=0.020), and the number of days of postnatal diuretic use (10.8\u00b17.8,7.5\u00b17.2days;P<0.001) were not associated with PDA closure. The incidence of PDA\u2010related complications including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (P<0.001), necrotizing enterocolitis (P<0.001), and postnatal infection (P=0.046) was significantly higher in the non\u2010closure group.

            "Yes, that is correct. I believe it would also be helpful to explain the intervention or treatment process. The low-power laser treatment using a diode laser is planned before the tooth bleaching procedure. We will use an 810 nm diode laser with a power of 0.5 Watt for the laser therapy. The tooth bleaching procedure will be performed using a 38% hydrogen peroxide gel for approximately 20 minutes. \n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Purpose:: Treatment\nPhase:: Not applicable\nIntervention Model:: Parallel\nBlinding:: Double blinded, Patient & Caregiver\nBlinded, Placebo/Sham:: Partly blinded\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: Others\nIntervention Description:: Low-power laser therapy\n(Experimental test group)\nThe preliminary laser therapy will be applied for 30 seconds using the 810 nm diode laser with a power of 0.5 Watt onto the teeth and gingiva before the tooth bleaching procedure. Laser is applied in a circular or a continuous scanning mode in the range of motion of the mandible. The laser is set to operate at a fixed frequency and power setting. This will be continued until all teeth are treated.\nTooth bleaching (experimental and comparator group)\nThe tooth bleaching procedure will be performed using a 38% hydrogen peroxide bleaching gel for approximately 20 minutes. The whitening gel will be applied to the entire surface of the teeth and left in place for the duration of the treatment. For this purpose, a silicone bleaching tray will be used for each patient. The tray holds the teeth firmly in place to ensure thorough contact and penetration of the gel. The bleaching trays will be removed after the end of treatment.\n[NOTE] Both groups received the same intervention (tooth bleaching procedure) but the placebo comparator group did not get the preliminary laser therapy before the tooth bleaching procedure.\nBoth groups will be requested to avoid all dental products containing abrasives (e.g., toothpastes, mouthwashes, etc.) for three days before and after treatment, as well as not to consume any products with the ability to stain teeth (e.g., red wine, coffee, tea",
            "Certainly. The experimental test group is exposed to a single pre-procedure laser treatment before the in-office bleaching procedure using 38% hydrogen peroxide gel. This group is then further divided into three subgroups based on the type of laser device: infrared (IR) alone, IR with a vibrating tip, or IR with a vibrating tip and coolant spray. The intervention for the experimental test group includes the low-level laser treatment, the tooth bleaching procedure, and any additional dental treatment that the patient may need, such as remineralisation or fluoride treatments. The placebo comparator group serves as the control arm for the study. The intervention for this group is solely the tooth bleaching procedure plus any additional dental care they may need. \n\nStudy Design Assignment\n=================",

Sixty healthy males (training age 1.9 \u00b1 1.6 years, age 23.3 \u00b1 3.5 years, and height 178.3 \u00b1 5.5) were randomized into a group with a small range of motion for RT (group R) and a group with an extended range for RT (group C). RT with a large range was performed from 90 degrees to 170 degrees in dorsi flexion and ankle plantar flexion, and RT with a small range of motion was performed from 120 degrees to 150 degrees in dorsiflexion and ankle plantar flexion. Changes in muscle endurance (isometric maximum voluntary contraction [MVC]), calf muscle function (power, speed, and range of motion), and surface electromyography (EMG) were measured before and 24 hours after RT. The surface EMG intensity in group C was greater than the changes in EMG intensity of group R both 20 minutes posttraining and 24 hours posttraining. Maximum power in both plantar flexion and dorsiflexion and maximum range of motion in plantar flexion during maximum muscle contraction decreased in group C. Maximum range of motion in dorsiflexion in both groups remained consistent throughout the tests. The changes in muscle power and muscle endurance in group C were higher than those in group R after RT. Calf muscle fatigue was higher in group C with a large range of motion than in group R with a small range of motion. We concluded that RT with a large range of motion induced the greatest decrease in muscle power in both plantar and dorsal flexion and muscle function in the dorsal flexor. Therefore,",

In this double blind placebo controlled trial, mothers with major depressive disorder (MDD) will receive treatment with either oral dexamethasone or a placebo after delivery. The two groups will be compared to see if there are differences in mental and physical health outcomes, and behavioral responses in the child at 6 months.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nMaternal depressive symptoms impair a mother's ability to parent safely and effectively, increasing the risk of early childhood morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic disadvantage, especially in low-income countries where mental health services are limited. Adjuvant corticosteroids may reduce depressive symptoms and accelerate resolution of postpartum depression. Unfortunately, these benefits come with serious side effects including increased childhood obesity and hypertension risk, increased maternal fracture risk, and increased risk of poor growth in preterm infants. This study will be a double blind placebo controlled trial using oral dexamethasone versus placebo administered twice daily for 12 weeks to mothers with major depressive disorder (MDD) within 1-3 weeks of delivery. The primary aim is to test the feasibility and acceptability of enrolling mothers with MDD at 1-3 weeks postpartum to this oral treatment strategy. The second primary aim is to test whether there is difference in maternal depressive symptoms and global functioning between those who receive dexamethasone versus the placebo group. Secondary aims include testing whether the intervention is associated with improvement in anxiety and stress levels at 1 and 3 months after delivery, decrease in inflammatory biomarkers at 1 month after delivery, and improved social adjustment at 3 months for the child.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Effect of Corticosteroids on Maternal Symptoms of Depression: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Trial.\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDepression, Puerperal\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n----------------",
            "Alright, I understand. Now, let's talk about some details of the intervention study: \n\nAs you mentioned, the intervention study will use a single-arm design to evaluate the effect of the stress ball on participants' anxiety during lumbar puncture. The intervention group will receive a pre-filled water-filled ball made of soft silicone, which the participant should squeeze and use for distraction throughout the procedure. The stress ball is a safe and simple intervention that has been shown to reduce anxiety in other medical procedures. You can expect to see a reduction in your anxiety levels during lumbar puncture with the use of this intervention. There are no risks associated with the use of the stress ball, except for the risk of discomfort or injury caused by squeezing the ball too hard. However, this risk is minimal, and the benefits of the intervention outweigh any potential risks. Additionally, the research team will closely monitor the patients' reactions and adverse events to ensure their safety and wellbeing throughout the study. \nYes, I understand. The study will be conducted in the pediatric sedation department, which is a specialized department at your hospital. The research team will ensure that all members of the team are appropriately trained to perform the study procedures and address any concerns or adverse events that may arise during the study. In addition, the hospital has a policy for the safe and ethical treatment of all patients, which will ensure that your safety and wellbeing are prioritized throughout the study. \nI appreciate your honesty. The questionnaire used in the study is a previously validated measure of anxiety, which has been used in other similar studies. The questionnaire consists of a series of statements that participants rate on a scale from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety. The questionnaire will be administered to participants before and after the intervention to assess the effectiveness of the stress ball in reducing anxiety. The questionnaire is a simple and reliable tool that has been shown to provide accurate and consistent measures of anxiety, and it will help the research team evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. \nI understand. The sample size for this study is set at 80 participants, which is a relatively small sample size. However, the purpose of the study is to pilot test the effectiveness of the stress ball in reducing anxiety during lumbar puncture. As this is a pilot study, a small sample size is sufficient to provide preliminary data on the effectiveness",

            "Not a problem. Here are some things to avoid when using this intervention: \n\n1. Only patients who have given informed consent to participate in the study should receive a stress ball. \n2. Make sure the stress ball is safe and appropriate for the patient based on their age and medical history. \n3. Ensure that the stress ball is not painful or uncomfortable for the patient. \n4. Do not interfere with the progress of the lumbar puncture procedure by delaying the procedure to administer the intervention. \n5. Communicate clearly with the patient about the intervention and its benefits. \n6. Monitor the patient's anxiety levels before, during, and after the procedure to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. \n\nOverall, using a stress ball as a coping strategy during lumbar puncture may be an effective way to reduce anxiety in patients and enhance their overall experience. Always follow the appropriate medical guidelines and consult with a healthcare professional before implementing this intervention."

Despite initial treatment, approximately 50% of patients will eventually relapse or develop refractory disease. Previous studies using T\u2010cell checkpoint inhibition have shown promising response rates in neuroblastoma patients, but there have been no studies evaluating the combination of T\u2010cell checkpoint inhibition and oncolytic viruses. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy in pediatric neuroblastoma patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Methods: In this pilot trial, patients will be divided into two groups. One group will receive anti\u2010PD1/CTLA\u20104 antibodies alone for six months (6MGY\u2010 001 [NCT02368401]). Another group will receive the same regimen in combination with an experimental oncolytic virus therapy (New York Medical College). The oncolytic virus therapy will consist of a combination of CDX\u2010140\u2010L and MVVX\u2010011, administered intravenously. The primary outcome measure will be the overall response rate, assessed by standard criteria. The secondary outcome measures will include disease control rate, duration of response, quality of life, and safety. Patient cohort and power analysis: Up to 11 patients will be enrolled in this study. This sample size is sufficient to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this combination treatment in this patient population. Discussion: The combination of T\u2010cell checkpoint inhibition and oncolytic viruses has shown promising results in preclinical studies. This study will provide valuable information on the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy in pediatric neuroblastoma patients with relapsed or refractory disease.",

            "Thank you! I'd like to move on to the objective of the study. Could you please provide me with the rationale and specific objective of the study? \n\nAbstract:\nSeveral investigators report that the early administration of palliative sedation in intubated patients with critical illness is associated with reduced mortality and is not associated with a lengthening of the intensive care unit stay and hospital stay. The clinical applicability is still difficult because the clinical practice is still heterogeneous on sedation methods. For sedation, a simple classification (i.e., light = no or minimal sedation), moderate = moderate sedation, deep = deep sedation) has been proposed during a consensus meeting in 1998 and by some authors. However, these classifications are not precise or applicable to individual patients and their outcome. The purpose of this study is the development of a sedation score in mechanically ventilated adult patients from the intensive care unit, to monitor and evaluate the sedation depth according to their outcome. Based on the information collected during an observational period, we intend to develop a predictive model which will include easily understood clinical factors and will allow to define a sedation threshold, a sedation goal, and to monitor and evaluate the adherence to this sedation goal. The proposed strategy will be implemented in a randomized clinical trial to assess its clinical applicability and patient safety.",

This study aims to conduct an examination of an alternative approach to mitigate aggressive behavior in prison environments through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomly assigned into three groups: VR-TrAC, Care as Usual (CAU), and Supportive Contact (SC). Participants assigned to the VR-TrAC group will undergo a 16-session training program during their incarceration. The training involves using a virtual reality system to practice emotional regulation strategies in high-risk situations, such as simulated conflict or provocation. Participants in the CAU and SC groups will receive standard care procedures and supportive contact, respectively. The study will primarily employ a single-blind, multiple-baseline design across participants. Outcomes will be measured by reducing frequency and intensity of aggression and other behavioral measures such as violence and self-injury. By evaluating the effectiveness of VR-TrAC as compared to CAU and SC interventions, this study hopes to provide valuable insights into the use of cutting-edge technologies for addressing aggressive behavior in imprisoned individuals.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nVirtual Reality Intervention for Violent and Aggressive Incarcerant Patients (VR-TrAC) [RCT]\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAggression\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Be"

            "Thank you for providing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Now, let's discuss the design of the study arms. Based on the information you've given me so far, I suggest the following study arms:\n\n1. Experimental: VR-TrAC\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the VR-TrAC group will follow the Virtual Reality Training for Aggression.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: The VR-TRAC group will undergo a 16-session training program focused on aggression control using virtual reality technology. The training is based on the Virtual Reality Aggression Prevention Training (VRAPT) protocol developed by Klein Tuente et al. The sessions are structured to target different stages of information processing related to aggressive behavior, including early and late stages. Participants will practice handling aggressive-inducing situations in virtual reality scenarios.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm is essential to assess the effectiveness of the VR-TRAC intervention in reducing aggression among the prison-based population. The structured training program using virtual reality technology allows for a controlled and immersive environment to practice aggression control strategies. By comparing the outcomes of this group with the control group, researchers can evaluate the impact of VR-TRAC on aggression regulation.\n\n2. Other: Care as Usual\n   - Participant Group/Arm: Participants assigned to the Care as Usual group will receive standard care provided in the prison setting.\n   - Intervention/Treatment: Care as Usual (CAU) in prison consists of treatments aimed at stabilizing psychological states, such as pharmacological treatment, supportive contact, or transfer to a Penitentiary Psychiatric Centre for necessary interventions.\n   - Reasoning: This study arm serves as the control group for comparison with the VR-TRAC intervention group. By including a group that receives standard care practices in the prison environment, researchers can evaluate the additional benefits of the VR-TRAC program in reducing aggression beyond what is typically provided. This arm helps assess the incremental value of the VR-TRAC intervention in improving aggression control outcomes compared to standard care practices.",

Both bone expansion techniques used 20 patients to be treated with at least five implants.METHODS: In the conventional group, (n = 11) implants were inserted into fresh extraction sockets with minimal bone coverage using a healing abutment. In the bone expansion group, (n = 9) implants were inserted with TM covered with polytetrafluoretlyne (PTFE) membrane which was placed in the buccal aspect over the mesh and was removed 5\u20108 months after implantation. The patients were reviewed 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after implant placement. Dental implant success was evaluated by the Himmelboim score which include four parameters: mobility (1), bleeding on probing (0 or 1), bone soundness on percussion (0 or 1), and peri\u2010implant probing depth (1\u20103 mm; 0 or 1). Peri\u2010implant marginal bone level (MBL) changes in distance (horizontal bone loss [HBL] in mm) and percentage (PBL in %) of all implants were used as criteria to evaluate the change of PIH and PIW.RESULTS: At 24 months, all implants in the conventional group were evaluated successful, whereas two implants in the bone expansion group were unsuccessful (loss of implant stability due to peri\u2010implantitis). HBL and PBL showed no significant difference between groups at 24 months, except for the bone expansion group in MBL measurement. The bone expansion technique showed significant bone reduction, resulting in a higher PIH and PIW after 24 months compared to before surgery, but there was no significant difference in the conventional group (P = 0.147).CONCLUSION: Both bone expansion techniques had similar success and survival rates at 24 months.

Methods: A total of 102 patients, 51 in each group, were included in this prospective randomized study. The data obtained in 2 years were included in the study, including preoperative nutritional evaluation; age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist\u2010to\u2010hip ratio (WHR), waist\u2010to\u2010height ratio (WHtR), history of smoking, alcohol consumption and use of hormones. In addition, measurements were made of fasting blood glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, high\u2010sensitivity C reactive protein, ghrelin, cholescystokinin and leptin. It was noted whether and how many preoperative comorbidities were resolved after surgery. Patients were evaluated postoperatively at 3, 6 and 12 months with fasting blood sugar and hormone values. Results: We observed that both of them were safe and effective in the treatment of obesity. While the fasting glucose levels were similar in each group at 3 and 6 months, they were found to be lower at 12 months in the group receiving duodenal switch . The decrease in insulin levels was similar between both groups at 3 and 6 months, but less at 12 months in the group taking duodenal switch. In the group of patients receiving duodenal switch, HDL levels, WC, WHR and WHtR increased significantly compared to baseline values and decreased HbA1c values \u200b\u200bfrom 9.8% to 4.69%. In the group of patients receiving sleeve gastrectomy, WC, WHR and WHtR increased significantly compared to baseline values, but HbA1c values \u200b\u200bdecreased significantly from 9.35% to 5.3%.

As this will be one of the first centers to report on the use of this combination, it will help better inform clinical practice. We will retrospectively assess a group of patients treated in the early portion of this new approved standard of care for advanced NSCLC to determine what proportion of patients experience a partial response, stable disease, progressive disease or indeterminate response.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nImmunotherapy is a new standard of care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab) are FDA-approved in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in the setting of advanced non-small cell lung cancer that is unresectable and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressing (cutoff \u2265 50%). Cemiplimab (REGN2810) is a monoclonal antibody targeting the CD137 receptor that has been found to have synergistic effect when combined with PD-1 inhibitors. In a recent phase III registration trial of cemiplimab in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy, cemiplimab significantly improved overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with PD-L1 expressing tumors (\u2265 1%). Further, cemiplimab also showed promising results in heavily pre-treated patients on phase I trials. Because of these promising results, the combination has become a new standard of care. With the recent FDA approval of cemiplimab in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of this combination in a real world medical center. This study will focus on assessing the tumor response using the RECIST 1.1 criteria to this",

Through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), this study aims to evaluate the impact of providing the ACT Raising Safe Kids program to male caregivers as compared to standard referrals. The primary outcome will be measured as reduction in child maltreatment and harsh parenting at 6 months post study. Study participants will be randomized into the ACT group and the standard referral to treatment group condition. The study will recruit fathers or male caregivers of young children between 1-5 years old from the community, from the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) or from the Los Angeles County Child Care Resource and Referral Agency (CCRR). Male participants randomized to the ACT arm will receive the 12-week parenting program delivered over video conferencing (Zoom) at different days and times by trained therapists, following COVID-19 safety protocols. In addition to the parenting intervention, this study will include three booster sessions following the last session of the program. This study will be using a two-armed parallel design (ACT arm and standard referral arm). The research team, participants and those assigned to the ACT arm will not be blinded to group intervention/treatment assignment.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nChild abuse and neglect are extremely harmful to child health and development. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the estimated annual cost of these injuries including initial and follow-up treatment, criminal justice involvement, Child Protective Services intervention, and loss of productivity was $124 billion in 2015. The cost for child abuse and neglect was more than twice the annual cost of foodborne illness ($50.1), and over 3 times the annual cost of medical treatment associated with motor vehicle crashes ($32.6 billion). However, there is a critical gap in programming for male caregivers. Men are less likely than their female counterparts to seek mental health treatment, and yet a father's involvement in a child's life is highly significant for childhood development and success.

            "What kind of patients will be included in this clinical trial? \n\nAbstract:\nINTRODUCTION: MRI is often used to evaluate the severity of spinal injury, and many spine surgeons have used inversion recovery (IR) sequence before and after surgery. This sequence is often used for evaluating a spinal cord injury because it can demonstrate and quantify spinal cord pathologies such as edema and hemorrhage. However, the optimal timing of using the IR sequence is unknown. The authors aimed to compare the change of spinal cord signal intensity in IR sequences before and after surgery.METHODS: A total of 45 patients who received spinal surgery for spinal cauda equina injury were retrospectively studied. The study included 3\u2010T MR sequences, including sagittal T2WI (Fig. 1a), T1WI (Fig. 1b), and IR (Fig. 1c,d) sequence. The signal intensity (SI) values within the spinal cord in sagittal T2WI, T1WI, and IR were independently measured by two experienced radiologists using the Cobb method. Measurements were calculated at the level of S1 and were compared between the two sides. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the two side measurements for each MR sequence were calculated. Measuring accuracy and reliability were evaluated.RESULTS: The ICCs for IR SI measurement at the level of S1 showed higher measurement accuracy and reliability than T2WI [Sagittal T2WI ICC = 0.637, Sagittal IR sequence ICC = 0.86]. When compared to the other sequences, significant differences were observed in the IR sequence (P<0.0001). For T2WI and T1WI, there was no significant difference in SI among the four sides (P=0.430, 0.914). The difference of SI among the four sides did not significantly differ in IR sequence.CONCLUSION: The IR sequence showed higher quality in terms of measurement accuracy and reliability for evaluation of spinal cord injury with 3\u2010T MR sequences. Further study is needed to determine the optimal imaging protocol for evaluating spinal cauda equina injuries.\n\n1. Introduction\nSpinal injury has various causes .

Now, could you provide me with the date the study was first approved by the responsible ethics committee? 2018-04-30 \n\nAbstract:\nObjectives: Hypertrophic scars are challenging to treat due to the increased thickness and tensile strength in the scar tissue. Ultrasound and lasers have been tried to break down scar tissues on the skin. In this study, researchers intended to check whether topical steroid cream with low\u2010dose tacrolimus, or pulsed\u2010dye laser combined with microneedling could reduce the thickness and hypertrophy of the scar better. Patients and methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 60 patients were randomly assigned to receive topical steroid cream or pulsed\u2010dye laser combination with microneedling. Both groups received their intervention for 6\u2010week, twice a week. To evaluate the efficacy of two treatments, Patient and Observers Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) and Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) were used pre\u2010 and post\u2010treatment. Results: The results showed that both treatments improved significantly both objectively (POSAS and VSS) and subjectively (VSS). The improvements were clinically significant in 82% POSAS, 93% VSS and 91% VSS. The study showed that there was no significant difference in the improvement of scar parameters between topical tacrolimus and laser combined with microneedling. The number of sessions needed to achieve results was also similar among the treatments (2.1 \u00b1 1.0 versus 2.4 \u00b1 1.3; P = 0.337). Conclusion: Topical tacrolimus and pulsed\u2010dye laser combined with microneedling are both effective and practical in the treatment of hypertrophic scars; however, we recommend laser combination with microneedling in patients with more severe scars. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial that compared two treatments based on different mechanisms of action.",

Is the trial looking at the effectiveness of a new intervention or treatment method? \n\n\nAbstract:\nCystinosis is an autosomal recessive metabolic storage disorder. It occurs in children and leads to cystine crystallization and accumulation in all vital organs, causing organ dysfunction and disease. The main purpose of this study is to determine the effect of cyclosporine on amino acid absorption from the enterocyte membrane by using stable carbon tracers in children with cystinosis. This is an interventional study. The study will include 30 children with cystinosis in the age range of 4\u201310 years. Children with cystinosis who have not previously taken or received cyclosporine during the study period will be included in the study. The participants of the study are randomly assigned to two different groups (experimental and control). Experimental group children will be given 100 mg/m2/day dose of cyclosporine (Neoral\u00ae 20 mg/ml, Novartis, USA) for 7 consecutive days. Cyclosporine administration will be suspended 3 days later. The participants of the experimental group then undergo oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and stable carbon\u201013 (13C)\u2010sucrose oral tolerance test following 24 hours of fasting. The controls will receive a similar treatment process without cyclosporine. 13 C\u2010sudrose will be given for the OGTT and stable carbon\u201013 (13C)\u2010sucrose oral tolerance test. The participants of the two groups will be followed up for 6 hours after the administration of 13C\u2010sucrose in the OGTT or stable carbon\u201013 (13C)\u2010sucrose oral tolerance test.

Participants with STEMI, ECG and treated with FTH for more than 30 minutes were randomly divided into two groups: the thrombolytic combination therapy (TCT) group and the control group (FTH alone). All patients received thrombolytic therapy with acoutrast. All patients in the TCT group received thrombolytic therapy for 12 hours. The primary outcome was the rate of complete recanalization.RESULTS: A total of 96 patients were enrolled in the study, with 48 each in the TCT and control groups. Demographic characteristics were comparable at baseline in the two groups. The thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow\u20103 flow grade after fibrinolytic therapy of acoutrast plus tirofiban is significantly higher than that of acoutrast alone (93.8% vs. 79.2%, p = 0.012).

There is considerable evidence that treatment with a beta\u2010blocking agent (BBA) reduces the risk of all CVE in hypertensive patients, but the efficacy of a BBA as the initial treatment is uncertain.METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified patients with stage 1 (140/90 mm Hg) or stage 2 (160/100 mm Hg) hypertension enrolled in a clinical trial and treated with a BBA or other agents (control). The primary end point was the occurrence of a CVE. Cox proportional hazard models yielded a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95\u20101.62) for a CVE in the control group compared with the group treated with a BBA (P=.04). The effect estimates for the various CVE were homogeneous (P=.60). The HRs in the control group versus the group treated with a BBA were HR=1.65 (95% CI 1.00\u20102.73), HR=0.96 (95% CI 0.47\u20101.97), and HR=1.26 (95% CI 0.74\u20102.14) for coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke, respectively.CONCLUSION: Our post hoc analyses suggest that BBA therapy is superior to therapy with other antihypertensive agents in the early treatment of blood pressure.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Materials and Methods: 35 patients diagnosed with nonunion of the maxillary premolar were selected and divided into two groups: bone marrow concentrate group and conventional autogenous bone graft group. The patients in the experimental group were treated with bone marrow concentrate and autogenous bone grafting, while the patients in the control group were treated with only autogenous bone grafting. The clinical efficacy, operation time, recurrence rate of nonunion, postoperative pain and other indicators were compared between the two groups. Results: The success rate of the bone marrow concentrate group (87.5%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (50%, P < 0.05); the operation time in the bone marrow concentrate group (76 \u00b1 16 min) was significantly shorter than that in the control group (180 \u00b1 42 min, P < 0.05), and the recurrence rate of nonunion in the bone marrow concentrate group was significantly lower than that in the control group (3.1% vs. 14.3%, P < 0.05). The visual analogue scale score and the consumption of analgesics in the bone marrow concentrate group were lower than those in the control group one day after operation, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Bone marrow concentrate combined with autogenous bone graft can significantly promote the healing of nonunion of maxillary premolars, reduce postoperative pain and reduce the recurrence rate of nonunion.",

Please describe it in detail. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Previous retrospective observational studies have demonstrated that lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is independently associated with subsequent pulmonary embolism. The authors examined the frequency of pulmonary embolism following DVT diagnosed by noninvasive testing (angio\u2010CT or contrast\u2010enhanced ultrasonography).PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent noninvasive testing including angio\u2010CT or contrast\u2010enhanced ultrasonography for lower extremity DVT from July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2015, was conducted. Patients were excluded for the following conditions: a known previous pulmonary embolism, a contraindication to noninvasive testing of the lower extremities, or a history of pulmonary embolism that occurred after the DVT diagnosis was made. The data collected through the review included age, sex, concomitant pulmonary embolism, symptoms, pulmonary embolism diagnosis, and outcome.RESULTS: The study population consisted of 180 patients. Among them, 14 (7.8%) had a pulmonary embolism, and 2 (1.1%) had a life\u2010threatening pulmonary embolism at the time of diagnosis. The mean duration from DVT diagnosis to pulmonary embolism in was 5.7 \u00b1 10.0 days, and all but two patients had asymptomatic pulmonary embolism, which were incidentally diagnosed on the basis of a lung CT that had been ordered as part of disease surveillance for a cancer, infection, or lung disease.CONCLUSION: Most patients with asymptomatic pulmonary embolism were diagnosed using noninvasive testing, which is not commonly used in the routine clinical setting. This suggests that asymptomatic pulmonary embolism may be diagnosed by noninvasive testing before clinical symptoms. This study provides further evidence of the need for systematic assessment of pulmonary embolism in conjunction with routine DVT evaluation.",

Participants were randomized in a 4:4:4:2 ratio to receive tiotropium (24 weeks)/serevent (20 weeks)/placebo for 6 months. Depression was defined using the Beck Depression Index\u2010II scale and was categorized as none, mild, or moderate\u2010severe. The primary outcome used in this study was patient\u2010reported QOL as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Secondary outcomes included pulmonary function and exacerbation.RESULTS: Of 9002 participants, 4138 had complete depression and QOL data that were included in this study. The mean baseline SGRQ, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced vital capacity were 51 \u00b1 26.5, 63\u00b122% predicated, and 73\u00b127% predicated, respectively. Depression was detected in 54.7% of the patients. The patients with no depression had higher mean baseline SGRQ and QOL scores than those with mild or moderate\u2010severe depression. The mean treatment effect (95% CI) for baseline\u2010adjusted SGRQ for the tiotropium\u2010 versus placebo\u2010treated patients at weeks 24 and 52 were 2.96 (2.37\u20103.55) and \u20101.61 (\u20102.38 to \u20100.84), respectively. In both time points, the effect of tiotropium was greater in patients with no depression as compared with those with baseline depression. However, the differences in treatment effect between the groups were not statistically significant. A greater proportion of the patients with baseline depression experienced exacerbations, although the differences were not statistically significant among patients receiving tiotropium/placebo (",

            "of those patients that saw a PCP for concerns of cognitive decline had cognitive tests done prior to their initial diagnosis of dementia. Clearly these studies showed that cognitive testing is being performed after the patients' symptoms have gotten worse, when treatment and educational options are limited. Primary care providers do not have the confidence or training to order and interpret basic cognitive tests (Kasper, Cox et al., 2016). Also, the Alzheimer's Society (2013) estimates that 91% of patients with memory concerns could not identify an appropriate community resource for cognitive assessments in their community.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThere are several studies that show the benefit of performing cognitive assessments at the primary care level. A study conducted by Leong et al (2010) found that patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment detected by a general practitioner (GP) demonstrated decreased cognitive decline over the course of two years when compared to those diagnosed late. Leong also showed that patients who were given a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) by a GP, then referred to neurology for expert diagnosis, had similar rates of progression to dementia compared with cognitively normal individuals, suggesting that general practitioners' are capable of diagnosing MCI accurately. Another study done by Tong et al. (2012) found that the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was just as effective as the Cognitive Screening Assessment (CSA) in detecting patients with early dementia who had not been referred to a memory specialist. Tong also showed that the CSA was an effective screening tool for detecting dementia in African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, whereas the MMSE was less effective in these populations. Research has also shown that if patients with a low Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) (score 26 or less) are evaluated by a neurologist, the diagnosis of dementia has a very high agreement with the neurologist's diagnosis (Alves-Oliveira et al., 2008). Additionally, a study performed by Kramer et al. (2010) showed that when a primary care provider (PCP) was involved in the management and care of patients with dementia, there was a reduction in the rate of institutionalization",

Our primary outcome was all\u2010cause and cause\u2010specific mortality, and secondary outcomes were adverse cardiovascular and renal events. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine 3\u2010year mortality rates and 16\u2010year mortality hazard ratios. After adjusting for age, gender, race, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, education, occupation, health insurance status, income, type of diabetes treatment, clinical management of hypertension, total cholesterol levels, body mass index, serum creatinine levels, 10\u2010year coronary artery disease risk scores, and glycated hemoglobin levels, early weight loss (\u20105%, \u201015%, and \u201030% body weight over 3 years) was not associated with overall mortality rate (3.82% in the group that lost \u20105% body weight \u2010 24.05% in the group that did not lose weight) (odds ratio 1.75 [95% confidence interval 0.65\u20104.70]; P = 0.27). Early weight loss was associated with lower cardiovascular event rates (hazard ratio 0.73, CI 0.53\u20101.01; P = 0.07) and higher renal event rates (hazard ratio 1.58, CI 1.07\u20102.33; P = 0.02). In conclusion, weight loss up to \u201030% over 3 years was not associated with either overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality and was associated with an increased risk of renal events, particularly in patients who had microalbuminuria."

            "[Abstract]\nIn this pilot randomized clinical trial, we aimed to examine the hypothesis that a short sleep extension intervention can be effective in improving sleep hygiene, sleep quality, and perceived restorative experience in young adults. Sleep extension was a daily, one\u2010week 9\u2010h sleep opportunity, and sleep hygiene was defined by participants' ability to identify and resolve perceived barriers to an adequate 7\u20109 h/night sleep opportunity. Thirty\u2010eight participants (18\u201040 years old) were randomized to receive an intensive sleep intervention and 32 participants to a delayed, one\u2010week, control intervention. To assess each intervention's effects on sleep hygiene, subjective sleep quality and perceived restorativeness of sleep, and well\u2010being, validated questionnaires were used. Sleep diaries were analyzed using the general linear model. Participants who received the intensive intervention reported improved sleep efficiency, lower sleep latency, less time awake, and increased sleep pressure, as well as enhanced perceived restorativeness and well\u2010being, compared with controls. Intensive sleep intervention improves sleep hygiene, sleep quality, perceived restorativeness, and well\u2010being in young adults.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nSleep is a complex physiological process that has a profound impact on physical and mental health . Poor sleep quality has been associated with many common physical and mental health problems, including impaired memory , weight gain , and anxiety and depression . One of the leading challenges in the management of sleep among college students is insufficient access to healthy sleep environments  and routines due to conflicting demands for sleep and academic performance, leisure activities, and social life .\nAn intervention that has gained popularity as a strategy for encouraging young adults to establish healthier sleep and lifestyles is sleep extension . Some studies  have shown that a one-week 5-h sleep opportunity can increase cognitive performance and improve overall well-being. Despite these initial findings, relatively few studies  have examined sleep extension interventions lasting from 8 to more than 14\u00a0hours. Two recent studies  both reported that a 14-h (from 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m.) sleep opportunity resulted in several benefits, including better sleep quality and increased cognitive performance. Furthermore, there is minimal evidence  on whether the effects of sleep extension are maintained. Sleep extension requires a dedicated"

Thanks for the help. \n\nEffects of sasanlimab on glucose toxicity in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [TUDM-01]\n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic metabolic illness characterized by the progressive decline of insulin\u2010producing \u03b2\u2010cells along with insulin deficiency. Treatment of patients with insulin and other glucose\u2010lowering agents has become a life\u2010long, invasive, and expensive endeavor that often leads to severe hypoglycemic events and other medical complications. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sasanlimab for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in patients that have received at least three years of conventional therapy or at least one year of immunomodulatory therapy.METHODS: This is a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, phase 2 trial in 76 patients that are either Type 1 Diabetic (T1DM) or prediabetic (insulin resistance) and with a medical history of at least two severe hypoglycemic episodes in the last year (Hypo Group), or no episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the last year (No Hypo Group). This trial will be conducted in two centers, one site in the US and one in France, and follow patients over a five year period. Our goal is to evaluate whether 6 doses of sasanlimab leads to improved glucose tolerance, as measured by a lower fasting glucose level (<126 mg/dL) and HbA1c levels (<7%) in the Hypo Group and less progression to prediabetes in the no hypo group. Moreover, sasanlimab should exhibit an acceptable safety profile when compared with placebo.DISCUSSION: Preclinically, sasanlimab has demonstrated a decrease in blood glucose, a decrease in blood insulin levels, and an increase in insulin\u2010dependent and independent insulin release. This study will be of particular clinical interest as it will allow us to assess its therapeutic utility and safety profile. This study will provide the first evidence of effective treatment for",

We have demonstrated that the administration of vitamin D in COVID\u201019 patients increases survival and reduces the probability of mechanical ventilation. In the current study, we are investigating the effect of vitamin D on coronavirus patients with severe diseases. Methods: Patients with COVID\u201019 infection who are on the ward and in the emergency department of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Rasht, Iran, from July 3, 2021 to October 15, 2021 will be randomly assigned into the intervention and control groups. In the intervention group, we give the patient three oral doses of vitamin D. Blood samples are drawn and analysed for the following laboratory markers 24 hours before and 6 months after treatment: serum creatinine, calcium, 25\u2010hydroxycholecalciferol(25(OH)D), phosphate, albumin, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count with differential, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, low\u2010density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Results: No significant difference in the above\u2010mentioned factors was discovered between the case (n=5037) and the control (n=2590) groups. After being prescribed vitamin D drops, the level of 25(OH)D in all participants, except those in the control group, rose significantly. Conclusion: In a group of patients with COVID\u201019 infection who were given vitamin D3 supplements, we did not observe favourable effects on blood parameters. A longer follow\u2010up period is required to reach any conclusive outcomes. Clinical Trial Registration: The trial was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials under the IRCTID2021120605404914N1 on June 18, 2021.",
            "Brilliant! Thank you for your feedback. Based on our discussion, it's clear that the LRAMPS and LDP procedures have distinct lymph node removal patterns and procedures that are crucial to the surgical procedures. This will provide valuable information about the outcomes of both procedures and will enable clinicians to make informed decisions about the most appropriate procedure for each patient. Our proposed study arms align with the current evidence-based guidelines for managing pancreatic cancer and have the potential to improve the surgical outcomes and quality of life for patients with early-stage left-sided pancreatic cancer. We are excited to move forward with the trial and are confident that these study arms will provide us with valuable insights into the effectiveness and safety of these two procedures.\n\nAside from lymph node removal patterns, there are also other key differences between the LRAMPS and LDP procedures. For example, the LRAMPS procedure involves the removal of Gerota's fascia and perirenal fat capsule, while the LDP procedure involves dissection behind the fusion fascia. The anterior and posterior approach for resecting the left adrenal gland in LRAMPS can also impact the outcomes of the procedure. By analyzing these differences and identifying potential risk factors, we can optimize the outcomes of both procedures and improve the quality of life for patients.\n\nOverall, the study arms that we've proposed are well-aligned with our goals and have the potential to improve the surgical outcomes and quality of life for patients with early-stage left-sided pancreatic cancer. I look forward to working with you to conduct a successful clinical trial. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\n\n1.

Effective therapies for patients hospitalized with severe infection are limited. Dexamethasone, an oral steroid which is commonly used to treat rheumatologic and inflammatory conditions, appears to reduce all\u2010cause mortality versus usual care in patients with severe COVID\u201019. However, dexamethasone doses which are commonly used to treat patients with rheumatologic and inflammatory conditions have not been studied nor recommended in COVID\u201019 patients. Methods\n=================\nNovel therapeutic approaches are needed, such as targeted inhibition of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Anti\u2010TNF agents could potentially be used as repurposed therapy for patients with severe COVID\u201019. In this study, patients with COVID\u201019\u2010related pneumonia who are unable to participate in physical therapy due to severe respiratory failure will be treated with etanercept and infliximab. This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of etanercept and infliximab for patients with severe COVID\u201019\u2010related pneumonia. Patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID\u201019\u2010related pneumonia will be identified through a hospital\u2010based screening process. Patients will be randomized to receive treatment with 50 mg weekly subcutaneous injections of either etanercept or infliximab. The primary outcome measure is the percentage of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) or who die before day 15 of hospital admission. The primary outcome measure will be compared between treatment groups using the log rank test. Secondary outcome measures are time spent on mechanical ventilation between treatment groups and incidence and severity of adverse events between treatment groups.\n\nClinical trial ID\n=================\n2007-C-0008-01\n\n\nStudy type\n=================\nIntervent",

Could you let us know how long the study duration will be? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the prognostic effects of intravascular volume therapy using colloids and crystalloids on mortality in patients undergoing urgent coronary angiography.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from 602 patients undergoing urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were analyzed retrospectively. Group 1 included patients who received fluids, Group 2 included patients who received glucose 5% and colloids in addition to fluids, and Group 3 consisted of patients who were given glucose 5%, colloids, and albumin in addition to fluids. Inverse probit regression analysis was performed using the variables of in\u2010hospital mortality grouped according to three different methods of fluid administration.RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 years. The majority (65%) were male, and the hospital mortality among patients who underwent urgent PCI was 31%. Mortality was lower in Group 3 (14.7%) than in Groups 1 (39.8%) and 2 (33.3%). The adjusted odds ratio\u00a0of hospital mortality among Group 3 was 0.205 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.100\u20100.455) when fluid volume was calculated using the fluids group as the base group. The adjusted odds ratio\u00a0of hospital mortality among Group 3 was 0.06 (95% CI 0.012\u20100.257) when fluid volume was calculated using the colloids group as the base group.CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the volume of intravascular fluids required for the correction of hypovolemia appeared to be the leading cause of low mortality.

This will help us evaluate\u00a0the effectiveness of the topical agents in terms of lesion reduction. How does that sound? \n\n-----------------\nExcellent choice! That will provide us with valuable information on the efficacy of the topical agents in reducing the size of lesions. We should also measure the change in skin texture as a secondary outcome. Texture evaluation can be subjective, so we should use validated scales or tools to assess this. This will help us better understand the clinical benefits of the topical agents from a patient's perspective. How does that sound? \n\n-----------------\nThat sounds great. Subjective assessment of texture using validated scales or tools will provide us with valuable information on the clinical benefits of the two topical agents from a patient's perspective. We should also measure the change in lesion pigmentation as a secondary outcome. Pigmentation refers to the color of the skin, and it can be difficult to assess due to individual variation. To address this, we can consider using standardized charts or photography to quantify the changes in pigmentation. How does that sound? \n\n-----------------\nThat sounds like a good idea. Standardized charts or photography will provide us with a consistent and objective way to assess changes in lesion pigmentation, which will be beneficial in drawing meaningful conclusions about the effectiveness of topical agents in this condition."

Patients with ALS experience significant reductions in the quality of sleep when compared to healthy adults. Previous research has shown hypoventilation during sleep to be a potential factor contributing to sleep quality reduction and respiratory failure in individuals with ALS. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been shown to improve sleep quality and reduce respiratory failure in adults with neuromuscular disease including ALS. Unfortunately, there are inconsistent guidelines for NPPV initiation, titration, and use in patients with ALS. Despite high rates of NPPV utilization, it is unclear whether this intervention improves overall health related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with ALS. In addition, previous studies have not assessed whether treatment initiation within these guidelines leads to improvements in sleep quality and HRQOL. This study proposes to enroll 50 adult participants who are receiving long term ventilation at our clinic (25 of whom will be randomized to an NPPV group and 25 will be randomized to a control group), in order to evaluate the effect of NPPV titrated according to recently suggested guidelines on HRQOL and sleep quality in adults with advanced-stage ALS.",

This arm will involve monitoring asthma exacerbations and assessing their severity, duration, and management. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nSevere asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the airways that is characterized by bronchospasm, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, airflow obstruction, and inflammatory cells infiltration. The prevalence of severe asthma is estimated to be 5-10% of the asthmatic population. Severity is determined by symptoms, airflow limitation, risk factors, and exacerbations as well as the patient's response to therapy. Despite optimized treatment, patients with severe asthma have an exacerbation rate of approximately two or more events per year. When severe asthma is not appropriately treated, it can lead to an increased duration of hospitalization and death.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nEosinophilic phenotype of severe asthma accounts for approximately 50-60% of asthma population, a higher frequency as compared with other countries. This phenotype can be defined by certain criteria, namely blood eosinophils \u2265150 cells/mm3, elevated fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in sputum, or elevated allergen-specific IgE to allergens that are either endemic in Egypt, or known to cause symptoms. The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, observational, 12-month study is to: Describe the characteristics, clinical profile, current management practices, and outcomes of Egyptian patients with severe asthma. The outcomes measured are: Asthma control (questionnaire), exacerbation events, asthma-related quality of life, lung function, and the use of oral corticosteroids.

The results from this study will help healthcare professionals understand the management of severe asthma in Egypt and identify areas for improvement in asthma treatment.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground and rationale This longitudinal observational study aims to prospectively establish the prevalence of oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, blood eosinophil count \u2265 150 cells/mm3 and atopy among a cohort of Egyptian patients with severe asthma. The study involves three different study arms or groups. Study Arm 1 will estimate the prevalence of oral corticosteroid use in Egyptian severe asthma patients using national database of asthma patients attending the National Asthma Program (NAP) centers in different governorates of Egypt. Study Arm 2 will aim to determine the prevalence of blood eosinophil count \u2265 150 cells/mm3 in Egyptian severe asthma patients based on the baseline data during recruitment to the NAP in 2021 conducted by the Egyptian National Tuberculosis Program (NTBP). Study Arm 3 will attempt to identify the prevalence of atopy among a subset of Egyptian severe asthma patients by analyzing skin prick test results and blood IgE levels that were collected during the same NAP 2021 recruitment as mentioned in study arm 2. Primary objectives: Primary objective is to estimate the proportion of severe asthma patients on oral corticosteroid (OCS) in a cohort of NAP asthmatics in 2021.

Tissue\u2010of\u2010origin predictor gene sets were analyzed by comparing non\u2010small cell lung and 10 other normal tissues. Among the NSCLC samples, 45% (27/60) harbored EGFR mutation and most of them showed good prognosis. Twenty\u2010six percent (16/60) was found to have the same EGFR mutation. A novel EGFR/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was discovered to be aberrantly activated in the majority of EGFR wild\u2010type NSCLC. The expression of key genes of this pathway was validated by immunohistochemistry in an independent panel patient tissue array. Among 215 NSCLC samples, 60% was found to have positive expression in JAK2. Both expression of JAK2 and phosphor\u2010YSTAT3 was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. In the meantime, our findings also showed a remarkable correlation between JAK2 with the expression of EGFR and MET. In conclusion, a novel pathway involving the synergistic regulation of EGFR\u2010MET\u2010JAK2/STAT3 signaling was found to be essential in NSCLC. Targeting JAK2 might be an alternative strategy for patient with EGFR wild\u2010type non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer.",

In the future, the treatment of advanced or metastatic colorectal carcinoma with RAS wild-type (WT) may be revolutionized by novel molecularly targeted agents. Targeted agents and antibodies against epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) have changed the treatment paradigm for many patients with advanced colorectal cancer (ASCO 2015, Colore2016). However, KRAS mutant cancers still have poor outcomes and are resistant to treatment, despite having been targeted with inhibitors of RAS-like and PI3K-like pathways. Novel approaches to overcome this resistance are needed, and one potential approach is to target the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancers. Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system. NK cells have the ability to mount an attack against cancers in a manner that is more innate than that of T cells. There is a paucity of NK cells targeting KRAS-mutant CRC tumors. KRAS mutant cancers contain higher levels of immunosuppressive molecules (Colore2008, EGCO2013) because the tumor cells make certain cytokines (Colore2008; Colore2013) and secrete immunosuppressive molecules such as galectin-9 via exosomes in the tumor microenvironment (EGCO2013).  Exosomal galectin-9 can have negative effects on NK cells. Anti-Galectin-9 antibody treatment may restore immune function against KRAS-mutant colorectal carcinomas. A phase 1 clinical trial is needed to determine the safety of a CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor t-cell) strategy targeting KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer with exosomal galectin-9 as the target antigen.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA First-In-Human Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Anti-Tumor Antibody Dependent Cell Cytotoxic Activity of KRAS Mutant",

Background There is growing interest in the effects of mindfulness interventions among patients after hip fracture. The aim of\u00a0this study is to examine the effect of a six\u2010week MBI on mindfulness, depression and quality of life. Method A pragmatic, double\u2010blind, randomized controlled trial of two parallel groups was conducted between October 2016 and June 2017. Four physiotherapists were trained in MBI (n = 52). Sixty\u2010one patients after hip fracture were randomized to 1:1 ratio to a MBI group (n = 33) and a control group (n = 28) after being hospitalized for a hip fracture. Outcomes, including depression, mindfulness, perceived stress, and quality of life were assessed at baseline (T0) and after the MBI program (T1) and after 3 months (T2). Two patients dropped out after randomization. Results The MBI intervention showed a significantly greater improvement in patients' mindfulness (d = 1.11, p < .001), depression (d = 0.70, p < .001), and perceived stress (d = 0.09, p < .001), compared with the control group. The intervention also showed a significantly greater improvement in quality of life (d = 0.77, p < .001). Conclusions The results of this study suggest that MBI is associated with greater mindfulness, less depression, less perceived stress, and better quality of life in patients after hip fracture. It is essential to use validated mindfulness measures, such as the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, to conduct future studies in this area.

The exclusion criteria will be age < 18 years, protected adults (guardianship, under curators), and deprived of liberty. It is important to note that anti-PF4/H antibody test needs to be positive. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will ensure that only eligible patients with suspected HIT and positive anti-PF4/H antibody test and no protected status or deprivation of liberty are included. \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: Heparin\u2010induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a common thrombotic disorder that can lead to serious complications. The diagnosis of HIT is based on clinical suspicion and a positive laboratory test for anti\u2010platelet factor 4 (PF4) heparin antibodies (aHIT antibodies). However, the diagnosis can be challenging, as aHIT antibodies can be transient and have low positive predictive value. Platelet/leukocyte aggregates (LPAs) have been proposed as a valuable tool for the diagnosis and management of HIT. To date, there are limited studies on the phenotypic characteristics and activity of LPAs in patients with HIT. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to characterize and quantify LPAs in patients suspected of having HIT, with a positive anti\u2010PF4/H antibody test method. Methods: This is a prospective, case\u2010control, observational study. All adult patients suspected of having HIT who have a positive anti\u2010PF4/H antibody test will be included in the study. The patients will be classified as HIT type II or type III based on their clinical presentation and treatment. Blood samples will be obtained from patients at the time of suspected HIT and at specific time points during hospitalization. The blood sample results will be analyzed using FlowCAST to evaluate LPAs. The size, pattern, surface markers, and activity of LPAs will be assessed. LPAs size will be categorized as large (> 2 \u03bcm), medium (1 to 2 \u03bcm), or small (< 1 \u03bcm). The surface markers analyzed will include P\u2010selectin, TRAIL R2, CD63, LFA1, TRAIL R1, and B2M. LP",

Experimental: Group 1: Picture-based prevention education and an educational course\n- Participant Group/Arm: This group will receive both picture-based prevention education and participate in an educational course.\n- Intervention/Treatment: The participants will have access to picture-based prevention education, which can help them visually understand the importance of hand care and protection. Additionally, the educational course will provide them with more in-depth knowledge and skills on how to prevent hand eczema effectively.\n- Reasoning: This study arm is reasonable as it allows for a comprehensive approach to educating and training the participants on hand eczema prevention. By combining both visual aids and a structured course, participants are more likely to retain and apply the information provided, leading to potentially better outcomes in terms of reducing the incidence and severity of hand eczema.\n\n2. Experimental: Group 2: Picture-based prevention education only (no educational course)\n- Participant Group/Arm: This group will only receive picture-based prevention education without participating in an educational course.\n- Intervention/Treatment: The participants will have access to visual aids for understanding and preventing hand eczema but will not receive the additional training provided in the educational course.\n- Reasoning: This study arm is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of picture-based prevention education alone in preventing hand eczema. By isolating this intervention, researchers can determine its impact on the outcomes compared to the group that receives both visual education and a course. This arm helps to assess the specific contribution of visual aids in preventing hand eczema among hospital cleaners.\n\n3. Placebo Comparator: Group 3: Placebo (control)\n- Participant Group/Arm: This group will serve as the control group and will not receive any picture-based prevention education or educational course.\n- Intervention/Treatment: The participants in this group will not have access to the interventions provided to the experimental groups.\n- Reasoning: This study arm is essential to establish a baseline for comparison with the experimental groups. By having a control group that does not receive any intervention, researchers can determine the true impact of the picture-based prevention education and educational course on preventing hand eczema. This arm helps to control for any external factors that may influence the outcomes and allows for a more accurate assessment of the interventions' effectiveness.",

In the absence of a suitable suture material, the use of adhesives is an attractive method to stop bleeding. Tisseel is used widely in the management of vascular trauma, and has been shown to be effective in minimizing blood loss during coronary artery bypass grafting. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of Tisseel with that of conventional suture materials for the management of a 4\u2010mm arterial tear in patients who undergo elective total knee arthroplasty.METHODS: Between November 2004 and January 2006, 48 patients were enrolled in the prospective, randomized study. Patients were randomly assigned, intraoperatively, to intravenous administration of either Tisseel (control group, n = 24) or a conventional suture material (suture group, n = 24). The primary outcomes measured were the immediate effectiveness in stopping bleeding (assessed by using the Visual Analog Scale, modified by us as an objective assessment method for vascular injuries. VAS scores < 3 were considered as a favorable outcome), the time taken for hemostasis (measured in seconds using a stopwatch), and the blood loss until the surgical team was satisfied with the hemostasis (in milliliters, assessed by the operating surgeon).RESULTS: The average age of the patients in the control group was 58 years (range, 50 to 66 years) and that of the patients in the suture group, 56 years (range, 49 to 64 years; p > 0.05).

            "Great! Are there any secondary purposes to the study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe primary aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive three-armed multicentre RCT of the effect of the addition of peri-operative low dose aspirin in patients over the age of 60 undergoing major oncological upper gastrointestinal surgery including laparoscopy. Secondary aims include the analysis of adverse events and cost-effectiveness to evaluate whether this intervention should be implemented in practice, as well as providing further analysis on whether this could act to ameliorate the current problem of post- operative pancreatic fistula formation. Prophylactic use of pancreatic stent has long been advocated when there is planned pancreatic transection as this is thought to reduce the incidence of pancreatic fistula. However, this has never been investigated in a controlled fashion, with evidence being based on retrospective analysis. We therefore aim to investigate whether low dose aspirin can be used as a prophylactic intervention or whether high dose aspirin in combination with standard of care will confer benefit in the same population.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAlthough the use of pancreatic stent is standard of care in patients undergoing pancreatic transection during surgery for gastro intestinal malignancy. Evidence supporting this comes from a retrospective review by Seo et al1 who demonstrated a reduction in post-operative pancreatic fistula with standard of care pancreatic stenting. A prospective RCT of pancreatic stenting versus endoscopic ultrasound guided biliary drainage versus standard of care in high risk patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy is currently ongoing (NCT01883208).

            "Okay, that sounds interesting! Now, let's discuss who is eligible for your study. Who will be your participants or study subjects? \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVE: To summarize the effects of two different suture materials (SYMMCORA\u00ae and V\u2010Loc\u00ae) for vaginal cuff closure after total hysterectomy.METHODS: Single\u2010blinded, observer\u2010blinded randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups, either SYMMCORA\u00ae or V\u2010Loc\u00ae. After total hysterectomy, the cuff was closed using one of the two suture materials. Two independent observers assessed the vaginal bleeding at 1 week after total hysterectomy using visual analogue scale (VAS) and evaluated the occurrence of endometriosis. Subsequently, subjects' satisfaction and sexual function were assessed.RESULTS: A total of 47 women were included. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of patient's age, body mass index, menopausal status, or duration of surgery. VAS scores were lower in the V\u2010Loc\u00ae group (3.19 \u00b1 0.92 vs. 2.45 \u00b1 1.86; P = 0.016) 1 week after total hysterectomy, with no significant differences between the groups in the occurrence of endometriosis (29.8% vs. 15.6%; P = 1). Sexual function scores were similar between the two groups (15.45 \u00b1 6.83 vs. 18.07 \u00b1 7.23; P = 0.275). Satisfaction scores were higher in the SYMMCORA\u00ae group (4.08 \u00b1 0.91 vs. 3.66 \u00b1 1.57; P = 0.058) but not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the use of V\u2010Loc\u00ae instead of SYMMCORA\u00ae for the vaginal cuff closure in total hysterectomy may result in less vaginal bleeding and higher patient satisfaction, with no impact on the rate of endometriosis.",
            "The phase is not mentioned in the information provided.\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPost-marketing surveillance are post-marketing studies where the primary objective is to monitor safety, in addition to the observation of effectiveness and to document further the indication area. These kinds of studies have one more feature regarding others study types. Post-market surveillance are conducted after the product (pharmaceutical, device, etc.) has been marketed in Germany, so it is not mandatory to obtain prior authorization for the study by the Ethic Committee\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBleeding disorders, which can result in vaginal bleeding outside the menstrual cycle, may indicate serious pathologies in the uterine cavity. Vaginal bleeding disorders affect approximately 15% of women in the reproductive age. The causes may differ, such as: endometrial atrophy, hyperestrogenism, hormonal contraceptives, use of NSAIDs, use of IUD (intra-uterine device), miscarriage, anovulation, pregnancy-related causes etc. Vaginal bleeding disorders are treated according to the cause. A hysterectomy may be recommended for cases with large volumes of vaginal bleeding. Hysterectomy is the surgical procedure by which the entire uterus is excised. Although the laparotomic or abdominal approach is the most ancient surgical technique, today the most common and widespread is the laparoscopic approach. In this type of intervention, it is possible that the uterus and appendages are removed due to surgical complexity, but it is also possible to preserve the ovaries and part of the cervix. The most common reasons for laparoscopic hysterectomies are uterine myomas (55%), adenomyosis (30%), chronic pelvic pain (21%), and severe endometriosis (10%). Currently, during a vaginal hysterectomy, two types of sutures are used in order to suture the vaginal cavity: Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl\u00ae) and Polyglactin 910 / Glycolide Co-polymer 30 (Vicryl Rapide\u00ae).

Could you please provide me with the study hypothesis or research question? \n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical application of three clinical methods in the treatment of moderate and severe periodontitis in mandibular third molars.STUDY DESIGN: Sixty patients were randomly divided into three treatment groups: standard phase 1 treatment, conventional phase 2 therapy, and mini\u2010invasive therapy. The success rates of those three treatment methods were compared and related factors were analyzed.RESULTS: According to the clinical and radiographic outcomes, the rate of treatment failure was significantly higher in the standard phase 1 treatment group than in the other two groups (26.6% vs. 0% vs. 11.1%; p = 0.035). No statistically significant differences were seen in the success rates between the conventional phase 2 therapy group and the mini\u2010invasive therapy group (85.2% vs. 90.5%; p = 0.703). Analysis of the related factors showed that those factors have no significant influence on patients' outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Periodontal treatment, including all phases, for impacted mandibular third molars using the mini\u2010invasive therapy approach can achieve a success rate comparable to the standard phase 1\u20102 treatment.",

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nPatients in China were suffering from chronic kidney disease from more than 9.3% of people in 2018, the burden of chronic kidney disease on health is very large. 1.22 million patients underwent dialysis in 2020, 300,000-400,000 patients died in the absence of dialysis. The morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease in China ranked first in the world, especially in patients with end-stage renal failure and long-term renal transplant immunosuppressive therapy after patients undergoing hemodialysis cannot be recovered, in this case, the only treatment that can delay death is renal transplant. However, kidney transplantation is rarely used in China due to a shortage of donor and low donation rate in China. Renal transplantation can prolong the life of patients, so we hope to collect urine and blood samples of patients undergoing renal transplantation and study their immune function and inflammatory cytokines, in order to find the optimal immune prevention and treatment program.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAs it is known to all, that in general, after allogeneic organ transplantation (the patient's organ receives another donor's organ), an immune response is generated in which the patient's own immune system recognizes and attacks the transplanted cells due to the recognition of difference between the donor and the host. 50% of all transplant patients suffer from the acute and chronic inflammatory responses, which are also the cause of most transplant failures. 18% of liver transplantation patients need emergency retransplantation within two years, and about 40% of liver transplant patients develop recurrence of primary disease within two to ten years. The success rate of liver transplantation is only 50% after five years.

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nTo evaluate the effect of an online self-help program on the social network of patients with depression\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPatients with depression often experience significant social isolation and may engage in less social activity. This social isolation is associated with poorer treatment outcomes. An online self-help program was developed to overcome social isolation of patients with depression. Internet-based self-help can be an effective method in the treatment of social isolation and can improve patient's social network, which may subsequently improve their treatment outcomes. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate online self-help interventions on the social network of patients with depression. Methods: Patients with Depression (n = 50) recruited between 1 Mar and 22 May 2019, were randomly allocated to a program arm (n = 25) or control arm (n = 25). Participants in the program arm received an online self-help program at weekly intervals for 12 weeks. Weekly questions about social network were collected and a final questionnaire related to social network. Data of social network were collected at screening, after completing 4 weeks of self-help program and at week 12 with a 6-month follow-up. Social network scores were based on the Social Concerns and Resources Scale (SCAR-S) (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.94). Participants in the control arm received clinical care as usual. The main outcome measure was social network scores and changes in social network scores.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nSocial Networks in Patients With Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Online Self-help Program\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDepressive and Associated Disorders\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Behavioral: Online self-help program\n* Other: Control\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Meeting the diagnostic criteria for major depression (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Diseases (DSM-5) criteria) and moderate to severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) \u2265 15) or depressive disorder according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI",
            "Studies of the efficacy and safety of acetylcysteine, a mucolytic agent that is commonly used to treat respiratory diseases, have shown that acetylcysteine therapy may result in increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress, leading to further harm to patients. Therefore, antioxidants such as melatonin have been proposed as potential co-treatments to mitigate the adverse effects of acetylcysteine. This two-arm, investigator-initiated, randomized, blinded study investigated the effects of melatonin co-treatment on the lung function of acetylcysteine-treated patients with primary graft dysfunction following lung transplantation. Patients were randomized to either the acetylcysteine + melatonin or acetylcysteine-only groups. The results showed that acetylcysteine + melatonin therapy significantly improved pulmonary function measured by partial pressure of oxygen, compared to the acetylcysteine-only therapy. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of adverse effects such as nausea, respiratory difficulties, or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In addition, no significant differences were observed in blood and urine parameters related to reactive oxygen species production, lung injury, and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that melatonin co-treatment may not be effective in mitigating the adverse effects of acetylcysteine therapy on patients with primary graft dysfunction following lung transplantation. However, further studies are needed to determine the optimal co-treatment regimens and their effects on long-term outcomes in this patient population."

The effect of continuous regional analgesia on postoperative cognitive dysfunction has not been well studied, with varying results. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of cervical plexus catheter for upper extremity analgesia combined with a general anesthetic on cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods: Fifty ASA I\u2010II elderly patients undergoing elective isolated CABG were included in the present study. In group G, a standard general anesthesia (GA) was applied in all the patients, while Group P, in addition to GA, received continuous upper extremity cervical plexus blockade. Postoperative cognitive functions in both groups were assessed using the Korean version of the mini\u2010mental status examination (MMSE). Cognitive dysfunction was defined as MMSE <=27 and delirium was defined as an 8\u2010point change in the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Results: In group G, 74% of the patients showed cognitive dysfunction within 3 days after surgery, while no patient in group P presented cognitive dysfunction during any of the observation periods. The incidence of delirium in group P was significantly lower than that in group G (18% vs. 80%, respectively, P\u2010value < 0.001). The incidence of delirium was correlated with age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (P < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative delirium was independent of the presence of other risk factors. The occurrence of postoperative delirium was a significant risk factor for prolonged postoperative extubation time (P = 0.035).

Can you elaborate on this group? \n\nAbstract:\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of an intervention based on the principles of evidence\u2010based medicine (EBM) during prenatal ultrasound diagnosis with respect to reducing negative affects and anxiety symptoms. METHODOLOGY: An experimental\u2010control trial was conducted. A total of 147 pregnant women were randomly assigned to EBM or control groups (54 and 53, respectively) which met the following criteria: 18\u201040 years of age; undergoing a first\u2010trimester ultrasound for a routine pregnancy confirmation; no previous history of pregnancy losses; and non\u2010exposure to any pregnancy loss information. The EBM intervention included lectures, brochures, and audiovisual presentations describing the most frequent causes of sporadic early pregnancy losses. A questionnaire including the prenatal attachment questionnaire, the Spielberger state\u2010trait anxiety inventory, the Prenatal Fear Questionnaire, and the EBM knowledge test was administered before and after the intervention. The SPSS 22.0 statistical package was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The chi\u2010square test showed that the variables \"age\", and \"educational status\" between the two groups were not statistically significant (p>0.05). The t\u2010test indicated differences between the prenatal attachment questionnaire, and between Spielberger state\u2010trait anxiety inventory and EBM knowledge tests of prenatal attachment questionnaire scores before and after the intervention (p<0.05). This is the first study concerning EBM education among pregnant women.",

Given the disproportionate burden of alcohol consumption in AA's, the investigators are examining the effectiveness of an evidence-based brief, behavioral health counseling intervention (the Community Assessment and Referral Evaluation - or CARE) to address alcohol use and its negative health consequences among AA's. The purpose of this project is to compare three brief alcohol intervention approaches (CARE, CARE + Referral, and CARE + Linkage to Care). The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving male and female AA's, recruited from high risk, non-treatment-seeking venues. Participants will be randomized into one of the three intervention approaches, receive the intervention for one week, receive their standard of care, and will be followed up via questionnaire after six months. Participation in the study will last approximately 18 weeks, which includes a one-year follow-up. The objective of this project is to determine if the CARE + Referral or CARE + Linkage to Care interventions are more effective in reducing alcohol consumption and other related outcomes when compared to the CARE intervention only. Hypothesis: The CARE + Referral to Care and CARE + Linkage to Care interventions will be more effective in reducing AA participants' self-reported alcohol consumption, drinking frequency, self-reported health outcomes at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-recruitment when compared to the CARE intervention only. Further, the investigators hypothesized that participants randomized into the CARE + Referral to Care and CARE + Linkage to Care interventions will report a higher level of motivation to change their alcohol drinking behavior than those assigned to the other interventions.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe investigators will recruit 270 male and female AA's from high-risk, non-t",

Primary outcomes were to determine the safety and efficacy of treatment with zoledronic acid in regard to the prevention of bone events.The primary endpoint was time to first bone event, and the secondary endpoint was cumulative incidence of bone events.Results: A total of 347 patients were randomly assigned to the placebo group (n = 176) or the zoledronic acid group (n = 171). The median age was 55.7 years. Baseline characteristics were not statistically different between the two groups. Patients\u2019 characteristics and baseline bone density did not differ with respect to age, body weight, bone metastases, tumor stage, race and site of origin, and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. One bone event was diagnosed after treatment with placebo, and seven occurred during treatment with zoledronic acid (p = 0.70). There were no differences in cumulative 2\u2010year bone events when comparing treatment arms (placebo 7.4%, zoledronic acid 14.3%, p = 0.79). Conclusions: Treatment with zoledronic acid does not appear to reduce the number of bone events in patients with metastatic disease.

We will monitor their progress in the nursing curriculum, but they will not receive any additional training or intervention related to sexual health. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCurrently, the management of peri-implantitis is based on the removal of the peri-implant bacterial load (biofilm) through the root planing procedure and then waiting for spontaneous healing, or antibiotic administration. Several researches with the application of enzymes and other drugs have reported promising results, However, these treatments are invasive and have a higher cost than non-invasive therapies. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate new non-invasive approaches in periodontitis treatment. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used with promising results in this regard. It is based on the administration of a photosensitizer and subsequent exposure to a light source at a specific wavelength. When the photosensitizer absorbs light, it releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill and destroy the peri-implant bacterial load. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of PDT to reduce bacterial load around implants with peri-implantitis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nWe intend to evaluate the ability of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to reduce bacterial load around implants with peri-implantitis. For this, an initial sample of 18 patients with implants with a score on the modified Mombelli scale (score 3 and / or 4) will be taken. Two measurements of bacteria in the oral cavity will be performed, one before the treatment and the other one month after. For the first measurement, a sterile sponge will be placed around the most critical implant and then inserted into the oral cavity for five minutes. After that, we will collect it and send it to the laboratory for anaerobic culture and count of total aerobic and anaerobic colony-forming units (CFU) (performed by a microbiologist). For the second measurement, we will repeat the same procedure, but this time the implant will be disinfected using a denture brush and 0.2% chlorhexidine. In this case, chlorhexidine will be applied one week before and after the",

During 10\u2010week double\u2010blind treatment, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, cholesterol, triglyceride and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio were decreased significantly. The incidence of cardiac events was not significantly lower in the group receiving hydrochlorothiazide. Serum magnesium increased significantly with hydrochlorothiazide, and serum potassium fell slightly in both groups. The mean absolute decrease in SBP with perindopril was +18 mm Hg and not significantly different between the hydrochlorothiazide\u2010treated patients (17 mm Hg) and those who received placebo (20 mm Hg). The mean absolute decrease in diastolic blood pressure was +7 mm Hg with hydrochlorothiazide combination dosage and not significantly different from that with placebo (7 mm Hg). Despite a significant decrease in renal vascular resistance with combination therapy, the change in glomerular filtration rate was similar in both treatment groups. In conclusion, combination treatment with perindopril\u2010hydrochlorothiazide is a viable option to achieve blood pressure lowering in patients who remain hypertensive despite receiving double\u2010blind perindopril alone.",

The protocol will start with a qualitative approach of incontinent patients over 65 years, in order to detect the needs for urological care. Thereafter, the pharmacological management of the pharmacist will be described as a pilot study.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nUrinary incontinence is the loss of urine that is often involuntary and associated with negative impact on social and emotional functioning. Urinary incontinence is characterized by different types of urinary leakage, with or without urgency. With regard to ageing it is an increasingly important topic given the higher life expectancy. In addition pharmacotherapy plays an important role in the management of urinary incontinence. However, the management of urinary incontinence in Belgian Internal Medicine departments is not yet known or described. Therefore, a better understanding of the patient's needs regarding urological care is the first step towards the management of urinary incontinence in general practice. As part of this pilot study, a survey will be conducted on the number of patients with incontinence who visit the internal medicine outpatient clinic. Moreover, we would like to assess the prevalence of incontinence and the impact on the quality of life of this problem in this population. Additionally, an estimate of the prevalence of various types of incontinence will be established. Finally, the impact of a clinical trial on the quality of life will be assessed and patients will be asked if they would recommend the care they received to people in a similar situation. The aim of this study is also to define the treatment options and to describe the prescription patterns of the most commonly used drugs for overactive bladder.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nURICENT, a Clinical Trial for Urinary Incontinence in Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic - Protocol\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nIncontinence, Urgency, Voiding Interval and Dwelling, Etiology and/or R",

And its feasibility for use in the clinic, to determine clinical parameters such as pain, healing time, inflammation, blood flow, and oxidative tissue activity. As a research method, a non-randomized trial was conducted at the Foot Clinic and Vascular Surgery of the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Pathology. The research will be carried out on diabetic patients with clinical ulcers at phase 1 of healing (post-vascularization ulcer), with lower extremity revascularization in the last 3 months, with a duration of less than 45 days. The patients will be evaluated for pre-laser (baseline T0): clinical evaluation, Doppler ultrasound, and photography. Post-laser (T1), after 3 sessions (1 session/day - total 3 days) and follow-up (T2 - 15 days after the last treatment).

A treatment surface of 15cm2 will be used. The treatment will be applied according to the following parameters: the irradiation area will be covered by an aluminum foil, which will protect the laser target from any ambient light. The laser beam will be applied to the surface of the target by a plastic probe, which will be in continuous contact with the target. During application, the probe and the target will be continuously irrigated with normal saline.

The primary outcome of the study is to decrease the frequency of missed birthweight by incorporating a 3D ultrasound application focused on fetal body composition. The study will address these specific aims: Aim 1: To determine whether the addition of a 3D ultrasound application for body composition assessment of the fetus decreases the frequency of missed birthweight among high-risk singleton pregnancies with previous missed birthweight. Aim 2: To determine whether the addition of a 3D ultrasound application for body composition assessment of the fetus decreases the frequency of missed birthweight among low-risk singleton pregnancies of women \u2265 19 years old. Aim 3: To determine whether the 3D ultrasound application for body composition assessment of the fetus is feasible in low-risk pregnancies of Black women as compared to White women.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nHigh-risk pregnancies are being identified earlier and are receiving closer monitoring. However, 55-75% of missed/unexpected birthweights (MBW) are in low-risk pregnancies; most of which are among Black primiparous women, the most vulnerable patient-population. We have developed an application of 3D ultrasound that provides an accurate measurement of fetal body composition, and thereby predicts the fetal birthweight with 89 of accuracy in singleton pregnancies, at 36 weeks gestation. We will test whether the application can lower the rate of MBW in low-risk pregnancies by incorporating this technology into standard of care pregnancy care. This single-center random",

Would you please provide me with the name of the arms for this trial? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nCystic Fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disorder in the UK affecting approximately 1 in 2500 live births. More than half of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients develop liver disease. To date, only Orkambi (ivacaftor), which was licensed in the UK in 2015, is available for CF patients with a G551D mutation in the cystic fibrosis gene. Although it reduces liver disease in animal studies, it has been shown not to be effective in adults with mildly impaired lung function (FEV1 >80%). Thus, there is a need for therapeutic options in patients who have mild lung disease and who are unable to continue taking Orkambi. In contrast, triple co-morbidity and poor lung function are major predictors of liver disease progression. In addition, most patients who develop cirrhosis with portal hypertension are elderly, with very advanced lung disease and multi-morbidity. Thus, it comes as no surprise that there is a marked drop-out rate in clinical trials in CF patients requiring liver transplantation. Consequently, liver disease in patients with severe lung disease and co-morbidity is often overlooked. In a subgroup of CF patients with mild lung disease who are unable to continue long-term treatment with Orkambi, triple co-morbidity (i.e. cardiac, renal or hepatic disease) predicts faster liver disease progression. Triple co-morbidity may also be associated with changes in serum calcium homeostasis, which have been shown to modulate bone remodeling and may have implications for bone health in the CF population. It is possible that triple co-morbidity is associated with a specific bone phenotype in CF patients with mild lung disease, but none of the published data in the literature has been reported yet. The investigators' research has the following objectives: 1) To describe the phenotypes of CF patients with mild lung disease and triple co-morbidity. 2) To investigate the impact of triple co-mor",

After adjusting for age, yearly DBP changes, and changes in other cardiovascular risk factors, a further ANOVA analysis showed a significant difference in the magnitude of aortic regression between patients in the subgroup of low initial yearly DBP changes and those in the subgroup of high initial yearly DBP changes (507.5 \u00b1 54.8 and 567.8 \u00b1 47.1 mm Hg versus 857.5 \u00b1 74.4 and 843.0 \u00b1 78.9 mm Hg for low and high initial yearly DBP changes, respectively; P < 0.001). In addition, the aortic regression was not observed within 5 years of treatment among patients in the high initial yearly DBP change subgroup.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nLower initial DBP levels are associated with more aortic regression in response to antihypertensive monotherapy in the 8\u2010year Hypertension Detection and Follow\u2010up Program. These data indicate that the magnitude of aortic regression over 5",
            "Great. Now, let's discuss the type and phase of the intervention. Are you planning to use drugs as the intervention? \n\nAbstract:\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore the feasibility and outcomes of an intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention in patients with primary insomnia. A total of 112 randomly selected participants diagnosed with a primary complaint of difficulty with falling asleep or difficulty with staying asleep were recruited for the study. All participants received 8 weeks of intensive CBT therapy, which included weekly personal therapy sessions and sleep education modules. Results from the 112 participants showed significant reductions in sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and nocturnal awakenings and significant increases in sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and sleep duration after the intervention period. These outcomes indicate a reduction in sleep onset and overall improvement in the quality of sleep. The use of such intervention strategies may be clinically useful in the treatment of primary insomnia.",

However, the microvessel ultrasound examination can only be performed once a week, whereas patients with chronic wounds may require more frequent monitoring to optimize treatment regimens. Skin biopsies, on the other hand, can provide a more intimate look at tissue response to treatment, but the results may not be indicative of the overall wound healing process.

The investigators hypothesized that a simple, inexpensive mindfulness\u2010based intervention could significantly improve outcomes in patients with symptoms following critical illness. A prospective, single\u2010blind, randomized, single\u2010center trial of adult ICU survivors with persistent symptoms following a critical illness. Participants were randomized into an intervention or active control group while in the hospital. Both groups completed self\u2010reported questionnaires before discharge, at 30 days, 90 days, and 6 months postrandomization. The primary and secondary outcomes included symptom burden, PTSD, anxiety, depression, fatigue, dyspnea, and quality of life. Patients in the intervention group participated in 2 30\u2010minute mindfulness sessions during their hospitalization and were given home worksheets. The control group received standard care for emotional and cognitive distress. Of the 53 participants enrolled, 32 were randomized to the intervention group and 21 to the active control group. Participants in the intervention group completed an average of 1.7 (SD 1.5) sessions in the hospital (range, 0 to 6 sessions), while 80% were given their worksheets. There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups on any of the primary or secondary outcomes. Participants in the intervention group demonstrated improved levels of depression, anxiety and stress, and fatigue at 90 days post\u2010randomization, but only fatigue remained significant at 6 months post\u2010randomization. The results of our study were disappointing. Although mindfulness has been shown to be effective as an intervention on mood and cognition in other studies, this simple, inexpensive intervention was found to be ineffective in treating patients with persistent symptoms following critical illness. Further research is warranted to investigate the efficacy of a more intensive, longer\u2010term mindfulness\u2010based intervention.",

This arm is important to assess the performance of the 18-FDG PET scan as a standalone imaging modality for staging lobular breast carcinoma. By comparing the outcomes of this arm to the combined imaging arm and the 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET scan alone arm, we can determine the relative performance of 18-FDG PET scan in staging accuracy.

We then developed and evaluated an automated lymph node detection system with 1000 image frames taken from colonoscopy videos of 100 cases of colorectal cancer. METHODS: From the 100 cases selected, 587 image frames were collected from 1126 lymph nodes and 397 frames from other regions of the colon, which were randomly divided as training, validation, and testing sets. A convolutional neural network was developed and trained on the training set using the randomized search method. The trained network was then utilized to classify the entire test set. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the system were 85.6% and 95.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our approach for lymph node detection from colonoscopy videos is a promising method. Further studies are required to improve the performance of the detection system, including expanding the data set, optimizing the parameters, and increasing the model's robustness.

Methods: We randomly assigned 120 patients with RAS (stenosis\u226570%) to selective RAP angioplasty (n=60) or bilateral RAP angioplasty (n=60). We evaluated creatinine levels preoperatively (pre\u2010angioplasty) and on follow\u2010up 3 months (post\u2010angioplasty) and 12 months postoperatively (24 months). Patients underwent creatinine testing at the same intervals after angioplasty. Serum albumin and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and urine were also evaluated preoperatively. Follow\u2010up was performed for a mean 19.14(\u00b12.25) months (range 17 to 21 months). Results: The mean preoperative creatinine levels was 0.98 in the selective and bilateral group, respectively. Three\u2010month postoperative creatinine levels ranged from 0.87 to 1.07. There were no significant differences in renal function levels between the selective and bilateral groups during the study period. Serum albumin and BUN levels were similar in both groups. None of the patients suffered urinary leakage or urinary tract infection. One patient in the selective group and two in the bilateral group experienced bleeding at the arterial puncture site and were transfused with a unit of packed red blood cells. There were no other serious adverse events. Conclusions: Both the selective and bilateral group experienced stable renal function after operation, with no cases of acute renal failure or chronic renal insufficiency. Selective PRA is a safe and effective surgical procedure for the treatment of asymptomatic RAS. \u00a9 2017 Yonsei Medical Journal."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as atherosclerosis, is a major risk factor for stroke and death in people with schizophrenia. Accelerated aging in patients with schizophrenia and mood disorders is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Increased oxidative stress and low\u2010grade inflammation are important mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CVD and the aging process. An experimental study using cell cultures as a model for inflammage revealed a reduction in cardiovascular disease\u2010related biomarkers and an increase in autophagy under combined treatment with Quercetin and Dasatinib. Quercetin and Dasatinib have antioxidant and immuno\u2010modulatory effects, although in vitro models this effect is relatively subtle. A pilot study using Quercetin and Dasatinib on patients with schizophrenia and accelerated aging should confirm the hypothesis that such therapy can reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors and potentially improve cognitive symptoms, functional impairments and quality of life. Methods. Study design and methodology: Participants with schizophrenia and comorbid mood disorders and subclinical accelerated aging, determined by a score of less than 140 in the T-2000, will be recruited. The primary endpoint is a reduction of the CDAI biomarkers (including ApoB; DPP4, IL-8; Lp-PLA2) by more than 10%. Secondary endpoints include the improvement of functional impairments (GDS), cognitive function (MoCA), quality of life (EQ-5D) and wellbeing (ESS). The effect of the combination therapy will be assessed using statistical procedures from longitudinal analysis. Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate whether a combination therapy of Quercetin and Dasatinib is effective at reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with schizophrenia and accelerated aging. \n\nIntroduction\nCardiovascular disease (CVD), such as atherosclerosis, is a major risk factor for stroke and death in people with schizophrenia (1,2).

Three cohorts were included with increasing doses of dexamethasone concentrations starting from an initial dose of 100 mg/ml (DX100). The primary endpoint was the number of participants who reported an increase of at least 30% and a minimum of 12 on a visual analogue scale (VAS) as a result of the treatment. Here, we demonstrate the effect of high dose dexamethasone injections on biomarkers of local inflammation, including prostaglandin (PG)E(2) and proteomics in the joint fluid of patients with knee OA.. Methods: We recruited a total of 30 participants (group DX100; n\u00a0=\u200910, DX250; n\u00a0=\u200910 and DX500; n\u00a0=\u200910). DX100 contains 100 mg of dexamethasone in 1 ml of normal saline solution (n.s), DX250 and DX500 contains 650 mg of dexamethasone in 1 ml and 1.2 ml of n.s., respectively. A dose of 10 mg of dexamethasone was then added to the 1.2 ml group. In total, 2.4 ml of dexamethasone injection was administered intra\u2010articularly in each participant. Blood and synovial fluid (SF) samples were taken before (baseline) and on\u00a0day 1 and day 21. We measured the concentrations of PGE(2) and performed proteomics analyses on the SF samples.

Multiple myeloma(MM), as a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia, originated from a single plasma cell clone, characterized by clonal proliferation of tumor cells and the secretion of monoclonal antibody, accounting for 1.4% of newly diagnosed malignant tumors in China. The most common clinical manifestations include bone destruction, hypercalcemia, anemia, and recurrent or persistent infection with repeated low immunity. Therefore, in the past decade, China's medical society has been advocating early diagnosis and early treatment of myeloma to reduce mortality and improve survival. The common treatments of multiple myeloma include oral proteasome inhibitors(CPI) combined chemotherapy, immunotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy. The combination of PD-1 (PD1) monoclonal antibody and CPI can inhibit tumor progression by blocking the T cell checkpoint pathway and further triggering anti-tumor immune responses. At present, however, there are no clinical trials of this combined treatment in patients with newly or untreated multiple myeloma. In addition, at present, there are no clinical studies of this combined treatment in the elderly patients with multiple myeloma. This study plans to explore the safety, efficacy and immunotherapy mechanism of the combination of PD-1 blocking antibody atezolizumab and CPI bortezomib,carfilzomib in the first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, which has certain clinical value.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nPhase I and Phase II Study of Atezolizumab Combined With Chemical Toxicity in the First Line Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nMultiple Myeloma"

Previous research has established the important role of psychological factors in eczema, with particular focus on stressors in the child's social environment of preschool and primary school age. To date, no information is available regarding psychological and inflammatory stress biomarkers in the adult eczema population. In this study, we intend to investigate these biomarkers, and perform a small-scale interventional trial. Our hypothesis is that adult eczema patients experience psychological stress in daily life, and that this chronic stress burden is associated with reduced QL, sleep disturbances, poor allergy control, and compromised skin barrier function.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAdult eczema patients, referred to the medical outpatient clinic at Department of Dermatology and Allergy (VU-mc, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) are invited to participate. During baseline, patients are asked to complete questionnaires, provide a blood and nail clip sample for epigenetic and inflammatory markers, and an adhesive skin patch is placed on the upper arm for at least 48 hours. After baseline, patients are randomized in two groups, with 1:1 allocation for active supplementation versus placebo, and 1:1 allocation for a 10 day period of 3 versus 1 tablet per day. The intervention is an L-Phenylalanine dietary supplement, 3 tablets/day with a 1:1 ratio L to L plus 5x the daily recommended dose vitamin B6. The supplement is being administered for 10 days at patients' homes. After the 10-day intervention period patients are asked to complete additional questionnaires and come back for follow-up, where the skin patch is removed and an additional blood and nail clip sample are obtained. For the placebo group, they undergo identical testing during the intervention period, but do not take the supplement. This study is exploratory, aiming to evaluate whether there is",

            "That's a good suggestion.\n\nScientific basis behind the study design:\n\nPulp therapy is a treatment that aims to maintain a viable tooth. It involves removing the carious tissue and pulp from the affected tooth and applying a filling material to protect the remaining tooth structure. Pulp therapy is commonly used to treat tooth decay in children's primary molars, which can cause pain, infection, and tooth loss if left untreated.\n\nSodiumhexametaphosphate is a mineral that has been used in various medical and dental applications due to its antimicrobial properties and ability to promote calcium deposition. It has been tested in several studies as a pulp capping material and has shown promising results.\n\nMTA, or mineral trioxide aggregate, is a cement material that has been extensively used in dentistry as a root-end filling material and as a barrier to prevent infection. It has been proven to be effective in reducing bacteria and promoting tissue regeneration.\n\nBoth materials have their own advantages and limitations, and clinical studies are needed to compare their effectiveness in pulp therapy.\n\nPrimary research objective:\n\nThe primary objective of our study will be to assess the success rate of pulp therapy using sodiumhexametaphosphate as a pulp capping material in primary molars with deep carious lesions.\n\nHow will this be done?\n\nChildren who meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to one of the two study arms using a randomization method. Children in the experimental arm will receive pulp therapy using sodiumhexametaphosphate as the pulp capping material, while children in the control arm will receive pulp therapy using MTA as the pulp capping material. The study will use the modified Ross R4 system to classify the teeth, and the pulp chamber will be sealed with a temporary filling material. The children's pain levels will be evaluated before and after the procedure using a visual analog scale (VAS). The success of the pulp therapy will be assessed at six and 12 months post-procedure using X-rays and clinical examinations.\n\nSecondary research objectives:\n\nIn addition to assessing the success rate of pulp therapy using sodiumhexametaphosphate as a pulp capping material, we will also investigate the following secondary objectives:\n\nEvaluate the quality of the temporary filling",
            "I'm glad you've thought of this already. That's a really important question. We need to make sure that the sodiumhexametaphosphate solution is not only effective but also safe to use as a pulp capping material. We should plan to conduct a safety assessment as a part of the research. \n\nIntroduction\nPrimary tooth loss can be detrimental to the overall health of children due to the adverse effects of space loss and bone resorption. Furthermore, the need to pull primary teeth early can negatively impact a child?s ability to eat and speak, and increase the risk of infections and orthodontic complications. Therefore, effective dental care is essential to maintain the health of children?s primary teeth. Pulp capping therapy is a widely used non-invasive procedure for primary teeth with deep carious lesions that can avoid the need for extraction. This procedure involves sealing the exposed pulp through the application of an inert material that creates a protective barrier over the pulp and prevents further bacterial invasion. The ideal pulp capping material should be safe, biocompatible, and capable of inducing hard tissue formation to replace the lost tooth structure. Methacrylate (MTADENT) is a commonly used pulp capping material, but it has certain limitations such as its complex preparation and possibility of toxicity due to unreacted monomers. Alternative pulp capping materials are needed to address these limitations.[\n1:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7804171/] \nResearchers have proposed the use of sodium hexametaphosphate (NaHP) as a potential alternative pulp capping material. NaHP is a polyphosphate which is commercially available as a liquid and powder, and has a long history of safe use in medicine. It has been used as a bone graft extender due to its ability to induce the formation of hydroxyapatite, a major component of bone and tooth. Recent studies have shown that NaHP can be effective in promoting hard tissue regeneration, and may be a viable alternative to MTA for pulp capping.[\n2:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30352701/] \n[\n3",

Thank you for your time and interest in this study.\n\n\nIntroduction\nPrimary tooth decay, or dental caries, is a serious disease that affects millions of children worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 47% of school-aged children have dental caries in the primary teeth, making it one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood.[1] Severe pulpal involvement as a result of carious lesions is a common reason for referral to a pediatric dentist. Traditionally, children with pulpal involvement require pulp therapy or root canal treatment. However, these procedures often involve the use of dental anesthetics, which may be inconvenient and uncomfortable for both the child and the parent. Non-invasive pulp therapy, or vital pulp therapy, has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. This approach aims to maintain the viability of the pulp tissue and avoid the need for extensive dental procedures.\nOne of the most commonly used materials for vital pulp therapy is mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). MTA has been widely used for sealing pulp chambers and root canals, as well as for repairing periapical defects.[2] However, its use for vital pulp therapy in primary teeth has remained controversial due to its poor adaptability and handling characteristics. In addition, MTA has been associated with several disadvantages, including prolonged setting time, the need for an extra visit for removal, and post-operative pain and discomfort. [2] [3]\nSodiumHexametaphosphate (SHMP), a chemically-derived, synthetic phosphoric acid compound, has been proposed as an alternative material for vital pulp therapy in primary teeth. SHMP has several advantages over MTA, including its biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, and good sealing properties. [4] [5] SHMP has been shown to be effective in sealing pulp chambers and root canals in primary teeth, and it has been used as a root canal sealer in permanent teeth. However, its use for vital pulp therapy in primary teeth has not been well-studied.\nPrevious studies have shown that SHMP is effective in controlling pulpal inflammation and",

It is characterized by atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries and is the most significant complication of Atherosclerosis. It is one of the most commonly identified cardiovascular illness, and as a result, it is a significant economic burden on health spending, especially in developed countries like the United States. In addition, CAD also leads to a high mortality rate and a low quality of life. However, the factors that contribute to CAD have yet to be fully comprehended. Currently, statins, aspirin, and clopidogrel are the main pharmacological treatment options for CAD, but these drugs also come with some issues, including contraindications, side effects, and poor medication adherence. Therefore, the researchers believe that an in-vivo \u03b2-Lactamase producing probiotic, which could maintain intestinal homeostasis by enhancing the intestinal barrier function and improving the gut microbiota, has great potential to improve CAD. This clinical trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus rhamnosus AE007, which is an in-vivo \u03b2-lactamase-producing probiotic. The study will enroll 50 subjects with CAD and provide them with a daily dose of probiotic or placebo for 12 weeks.

However, there is still limited research on this specific topic. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the risk factors affecting AVF establishment and the impact of AVF establishment on atrial fibrillation. This was a single\u2010center, prospective study with 330 patients who underwent AVF establishment between January 2019 and January 2021. The baseline, preoperative, and one\u2010month follow\u2010up data of the patients were collected and evaluated. After establishing AVF, 43.9% of patients in the cohort developed atrial fibrillation. Cox proportional risk multivariate analysis showed that the incidence of atrial fibrillation was associated with increased blood pressure. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, female gender, left ventricular ejection fraction<55%, and increased left ventricular end\u2010systolic diameter were independent risk factors for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: The incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing AVF establishment was 43.9%. Cox proportional risk and multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female gender, left ventricular ejection fraction <55%, and increased left ventricular end\u2010systolic diameter were independent factors affecting the occurrence of new\u2010onset atrial fibrillation.

This arm will provide valuable information on the potential benefits of cemiplimab in this specific patient population.\n\nStudy Arm 2:\nParticipant Group/Arm: Patients with stage II to IV (M0) CSCC who are candidates for surgery but have an increased risk of recurrence and/or risk of disfigurement or loss of function.\nIntervention/Treatment: Cemiplimab 50 mg/mL supplied as a sterile liquid in single-use glass vials.\n\nReasoning: This study arm serves as a control or reference group to compare the outcomes of the patients receiving the higher dose of cemiplimab in Study Arm 1. By including a lower dose arm, researchers can assess the dose-response relationship and potential differences in efficacy and safety between the two doses. This arm is essential for evaluating the optimal dose of cemiplimab for the treatment of CSCC patients.",
            "It's great that you find the study arms reasonable. One additional factor to consider is the duration of treatment. We have specified a treatment period of up to 12 weeks in Study Arm 1. Would you like to suggest any changes or adjustments to the treatment duration?",
            "That sounds like a good plan. With the information you've provided, we have successfully designed the study arms for your clinical trial. Here they are:\n\nStudy Arm 1:\nParticipant Group/Arm: Patients with stage II to IV (M0) CSCC who are candidates for surgery but have an increased risk of recurrence and/or risk of disfigurement or loss of function.\nIntervention/Treatment: Cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 12 weeks (up to 4 doses), or until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or withdrawal of consent.\n\nStudy Arm 2:\nParticipant Group/Arm: Patients with stage II to IV (M0) CSCC who are candidates for surgery but have an increased risk of recurrence and/or risk of disfigurement or loss of function.\nIntervention/Treatment: Cemiplimab 50 mg/mL supplied as a sterile liquid in single-use glass vials.\n\nThese study arms will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different doses of cemiplimab in treating CSCC patients.

To assess the efficacy of preemptive ketorolac in the prevention of postoperative pain after laparoscopic appendectomy in an outpatient clinic. Study design. A randomized, controlled, single\u2010blinded trial. Setting. A university hospital. Methods. We included 100 patients of either gender who underwent elective laparoscopic appendectomy under general anesthesia. After induction of general anesthesia, the patients were randomly assigned to receive either saline injection (control group) or injectable 30 mg of ketorolac (study group). Visual analogue scale (VAS) values and consumption of post\u2010op analgesic medication (oral ibuprofen) were recorded at 2, 4, and 6 hours and the need for rescue pain medication during the 24 hours following surgery. Post\u2010op quality of life (QoL) was also studied using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) and EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QOL questionnaires. Results. Both VAS scores and ibuprofen consumption were significantly lower in the ketorolac group at 2, 4 and 6 hours and rescue analgesic doses were significantly lesser in the ketorolac group. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference in the QoL of the two groups. Conclusion.

Intraperitoneal infection is of particular concern in patients undergoing curative-intent surgery for rectal cancer, where it is the main contributor to postoperative morbidity, especially in the form of anastomotic leakage. Infection control is a key component of rectal cancer surgery, including prophylactic use of antibiotics. Currently, the standard of care for the prevention of intraperitoneal infection in patients undergoing colorectal surgery is the intravenous administration of a single dose of broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately prior to incision. It has been suggested that intra-peritoneal lavage with antibiotic solutions may provide improved pharmacokinetic levels and reduce rates of infection. In addition an intraperitoneal bolus of antibiotics to augment topical delivery of drug would further reduce rates of infection. In vitro data has shown that colon cancer cells are susceptible to infection but not immune to it. This study aims to determine if a novel intravenous-peritoneal delivery system is feasible and safe and would allow sustained delivery of antibiotics to the peritoneal space in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nFeasibility of Intravenous to Peritoneal Antibiotic Delivery System in Rectal Cancer Surgery\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCarcinoma, Adenocarcinoma\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Antibiotic\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Over the age of 18 ASA Grade I to III Previous to surgery.

What kind of participants are you looking for? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the effect of postoperative rehabilitation exercise with chemotherapy to postoperative rehabilitation exercise alone on improving quality of life, recovery of skeletal muscle function, and functional exercise capacity in breast cancer patients. The hypothesis that we are testing is that the use of a combined exercise program of aerobic and resistance training after neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces functional decline, functional limitations, and improves quality of life.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBreast cancer is a hormone-dependent malignant tumor with more than 1 million new cases reported annually worldwide. About 70% of breast cancer patients treated with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy are reported to experience substantial physical and psychological side effects of chemotherapy. Exercise is an effective way to overcome chemotherapy-induced side effects and is a promising tool for improving physical and emotional health. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of exercise on postoperative recovery of skeletal muscle function and physical exercise capacity in breast cancer patients treated with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to the study and control groups. During the study, all patients received a three-phase exercise program in the study (aerobic and resistance training of the upper and lower human body in the supine position) with the intensity of 60%-70% of VO2max. Patients continued to exercise for 12 weeks after chemotherapy. The exercise program consisted of 20 minutes of dynamic upper and lower body exercises, followed by upper and lower body resistance exercises. The study included 44 women diagnosed with breast cancer. All patients who completed the research program were included in the final analysis. This study has completed follow-up and all data is available.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nInfluence of Postoperative Rehabilitation Exercise With Chemotherapy on Skeletal Muscle Function, Physical Exercise Capacity, and Quality of Life in Women With Breast Cancer Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCarcinoma of the Breast\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Exercise training\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n================",

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether preoperative chemotherapy is required in pTSMC patients with advanced EC. Methods A total of 142 patients with ESC and a pathological diagnosis of lymph node metastasis (LNM) were enrolled in this study. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with resectable EC were randomized to receive preoperative chemotherapy (neoadjuvant therapy) or surgery alone (operative treatment). Neoadjuvant therapy consisted of three cycles of paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (100 mg/m(2)). The response rate was evaluated by measuring the lesion's diameter by barium esophagography before and after neoadjuvant therapy. The response was defined as either (1) complete response (CR), (2) partial response (PR), (3) stable disease (SD), or (4) progressive disease (PD). Patients achieving CR were excluded from this study. The remaining patients were then divided into PD and PR subgroups. Postoperatively, resected tissue was stained with HMB45 to detect micrometastasis. The proportion of patients who developed macrometastasis or micrometastasis in each subgroup was compared using the chi2 test. RESULTS From March 2014 to January 2018, 142 patients were enrolled, 50 in the PD and 49 in the PR subgroups. In the neoadjuvant therapy group, pre\u2010 and postoperative CR rates were 4% and 18%, respectively, resulting in a response rate of 33.3%. There were no significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative proportions of patients who developed nodal metastasis in the PD subgroup (66.6% vs. 63.3%, respectively, P=0.411). By contrast, in the PR subgroup, the proportions of patients",

Could you provide me with more information about the objectives of the study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe primary purpose of this study is to create a cohort of patients with chronic pain and addiction. The investigators plan to enroll individuals who present to the Emergency Department that have a history of chronic pain lasting over 12 weeks. The investigators will collect basic data on the participants at time of intake from a patient survey. These individuals will be followed for 30 days to describe any differences between patients with chronic pain and addiction compared to chronic pain without addiction. The investigators hypothesis is that these patients will display more addictive symptoms, higher pain levels, and more functional impairments.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nChronic pain is defined as pain lasting greater than 12 weeks. As many as 33% of emergency department (ED) patients suffer from chronic pain. In these individuals, substance use may be used as self-medication as a means of coping with the pain. Studies have shown that 9% of chronic pain patients diagnosed with opiate use disorder (OUD) were prescribed and dispensed a chronic pain prescription as an opioid. Unfortunately, the use of opioids in chronic pain patients with OUD is contraindicated. The study will create a cohort of patients with chronic pain and addiction presenting to the ED. The investigators will collect basic data on the participants at time of intake from a patient survey. These individuals will be followed for 30 days to describe any differences between patients with chronic pain and addiction compared to chronic pain without addiction. The investigators hypothesis is that these patients will display more addictive symptoms, higher pain levels, and more functional impairments. The investigators hypothesize that this is due to the presence of OUD. The investigators plan to use the Opioid Addiction-Related Outcome Symptom Index (OROSI) and the Opiate use related impairment scale (OURIS) to compare patients with chronic pain and addiction with chronic pain patients without addiction for functional impairment, opioid use, opioid dependence, and drug-related problems. The investigators also plan to use the Revised Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Syndrome Symptom Survey (RevFCPSSS) to determine pain",

Participation in clinical trials is a vital aspect of advancing our understanding of the disease and developing effective treatments. However, patient participation in clinical trials can be influenced by various factors such as gender, age, and ethnicity. To ensure the representation and perspectives of diverse patient groups in clinical research, it is crucial to address these factors and understand the unique experiences and needs of specific demographic subsets. \nMethodology: In this study, we aim to explore the participation trends of Scleroderma patients in clinical trials in order to gain insights into the barriers, motivations, and experiences of different patient groups. The study will focus on specific demographics such as gender, age, and ethnicity. By examining data collected from different clinical trials, the study will provide a comprehensive overview of the participation rates of these groups and identify any disparities or trends that may facilitate targeted interventions and support initiatives to increase patient engagement.

The secondary purpose is: \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nGastrointestinal disorders including functional dyspepsia (FD) or non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) are common symptoms whose pathophysiology is poorly understood and often challenging to diagnose. Few studies have attempted to assess the impact of the intestinal microbiome on upper gastrointestinal disorders. This is in part due to technological constraints in the past, such as the lack of appropriate sample collection for microbiological analysis, or the fact that no simple, easily accessible and inexpensive collection techniques have been available to collect a sufficient amount of intestinal contents that is representative of the microbiota in question. Recent technological advances using omics-based techniques based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to study the microbiome in a comprehensive manner. By collecting endoscopic samples after duodenal aspiration with a novel endoscopic duodenal aspiration tool developed by our group, we aim to identify a link between the gut microbiome and upper gastrointestinal disorders. Gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) have also been increasing, and the intestinal microbiome has been known to be involved in the development of symptoms; however the composition of the microbiome in CD, which is not limited to the intestinal tract, has not previously been investigated. As a result, the research will be the first of its kind to explore the potential role of the GI microbiome in the pathophysiology of NCCP, NUD and FD and how it could be involved in these conditions. The results of this research may lead to the development of targeted therapies that can directly relieve symptoms and improve patient outcomes.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe objectives of this study are as follows: Objective 1: To compare the microbiome of the upper gut of patients with upper gastrointestinal disorders (upper GI disorders including non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP: chest pain not caused by cardiovascular disease), non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD: nonspecific abdominal pain or discomfort) and functional dyspepsia (FD:",

This study compares the clinical and socioeconomic outcomes in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors +/\u2010 methotrexate therapy. We also compared the cost\u2010effectiveness of various combination therapy options. In this US\u2010based postmarketing observational study, 102 consecutive patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (54 patients) or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors + methotrexate (n = 48) were compared to 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors + methotrexate. Compared with the psoriatic arthritis group and the rheumatoid arthritis group, patients with psoriatic arthritis started tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy earlier in their disease course, had less joint disease at baseline, and were more likely to be white. At 6 months, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors + methotrexate therapy improved patient assessments of pain and disease activity. Clinical improvements were evident with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors alone in most patients. No differences were evident in long\u2010term outcomes between the groups, including work status, comorbid conditions, hospitalizations, surgeries, and costs between patients with psoriatic arthritis and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Based on societal willingness to pay for 1 unit gain in health utility, the incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratios were $448, $638, and $2115 per quality\u2010adjusted life\u2010year in the psoriatic arthritis patient groups receiving tumor necrosis factor inhibitors alone, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors + methorrexate, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors + methotrexate, respectively.

Participants who are 65 years and above and are diagnosed with osteoporosis or osteopenia will be eligible for the study. \n\nWe propose to recruit 48 participants and randomise them equally into the exercise and resistance training groups. Participants in the exercise group will receive an exercise program that includes aerobic exercise and resistance training, while participants in the resistance training group will receive a resistance training program only. \n\nThe exercise program will consist of warm-up and cool-down exercises, followed by progressive aerobic exercise, and strength training exercises for the major muscle groups. The resistance training program will follow a similar structure, but the resistance training exercises will focus on strengthening the major muscle groups. Participants will attend a supervised session for three months, and then continue with the program on their own for another six months. \n\nWe will measure aerobic capacity using a graded treadmill test, physical function using the Short Physical Performance Battery, quality of life using two questionnaires (EQ-5D and PROQOL-A), and other outcomes such as nutrient intake, mood state, and musculoskeletal health using different tests and questionnaires. We will also take measurements of bone mineral density using peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or bone densitometry. \n\nWe will collect the data before the intervention, at the end of the intervention, and six months after the intervention. \n\nThe primary outcome measure will be aerobic capacity, which will be measured using the graded treadmill test. We will also compare changes in physical function, quality of life, and other outcomes between the two groups. \n\nOur study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of exercise and resistance training in improving aerobic capacity and physical function in elderly patients with osteoporosis or osteopenia, and will also help to inform clinical practice and guidelines on the",

            "Great. Now, let's move on to the third study arm. We can increase the dose of TQH2929 Injection to 5 mg/kg. This will help us determine the maximum tolerated dose. Is that acceptable to you? \n\nIntroduction\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in colorectal cancer and is a promising target for cancer treatment. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as cetuximab, erlotinib, gefitinib, panitumumab and ZD1839, have been developed based on the molecular targeting mechanism by binding to the EGFR's extracellular domain to inhibit the growth of colorectal cancer cells, and have been shown to improve the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced malignant tumors. TKIs are mainly oral drugs, which can improve the quality of life of patients because of their easy use. However, more importantly, the side effects of TKIs are mild and manageable, while the side effects of chemotherapy are more obvious and can not be relieved during the treatment. TKI is expected to become a third-generation targeted drug.\nIn the past 20 years, TKIs have become the first choice in the treatment of tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, advanced breast cancer and thyroid cancer. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against EGFR, was the first TKI approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). And the research on monoclonal antibody drugs against EGFR has gradually increased. For example, amatuximab, a recombinant humanized chimeric monoclonal antibody, has clinical efficacy for the treatment of mCRC, and has been approved as an anti-EGFR antibody in the European Union (EU). And in the clinical treatment of mCRC, targeted therapy has become a new treatment paradigm.\nHowever, the effect of the above drugs is not satisfactory, which has a profound impact on the patient's treatment cycle, so it has been paid more and more attention to find more effective targeted drugs",

The present study aimed to evaluate the validity of using unblinded designs in clinical trials using an example of a trial on two drugs. Methods: The study included 70 healthy volunteers, randomly allocated to two treatment groups (Group A and Group B). Group A was unblinded and received both drugs and group B was partially blinded and received placebo until Day 3 and the active drug until Day 7. The main outcome measures were peak drug concentration and drug half\u2010life. Results: The pharmacokinetic parameters of drug Cmax were statistically significant in both groups (P = 0.034), but there was no significant difference between them (P = 0.356). AUC0\u2010t was significantly higher in group A than group B (P = 0.022), while half\u2010life of the drug was similar between the two groups (P = 0.663). The study participants in the two groups were completely satisfied with the clinical trial and had similar suggestions for improving the study. Conclusions: These results indicate that unblinded trials with single blinded components can provide reliable and accurate findings in some settings, but some limitations should be taken into account such as the difficulty of blinding in practice.

Care in this trial will be compared between patients who use the decision tool versus usual care. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of the Spanish Decision Support Tool for Maintenance Therapy in the setting of stage III ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The study team will also be evaluating how the tool impacts other decision making outcomes such as the ability to recall information, perceived importance of factors, level of patient participation in making decisions, and regret about the decision made. All study participants will be surveyed at the time of study eligibility and at the completion of the research visit. For Spanish-speaking participants, data collection and intervention will be conducted in Spanish at their own preferred location, and we will aim to provide all materials in Spanish to ensure cultural and linguistic sensitivity.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nGynecologic oncologists at MD Anderson often initiate a maintenance strategy using a 5- factor scale to grade patients' risk for recurrence. These scale's include a patient's age at diagnosis, stage of disease at diagnosis (i.e. 1A, 1B, or 2), and response to therapy after platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e. complete or partial remission). Each of these factors is assigned a score to form the 5- factor risk score (ranging from 0 to 11). Patients with the lowest risk scores (scores of 0 to 2 0- 2 points) will be advised to proceed with surveillance or observation. Patients with risk scores of 4 or 5 points will typically undergo additional surgery and chemotherapy, if indicated. However, patients with risk scores of 3 points are those in gray zone where evidence-based guidelines do not provide enough clarity regarding next steps for patients and caregivers. Based on the clinician-initiated risk score, there are three options: 1",

Maintenance therapy after first-line treatment is often used to prevent cancer recurrence. However, decisions about maintenance therapy are complex, and shared decision making (SDM) is essential to ensure that patients' preferences and values are considered. Spanish-speaking patients are more likely to have low health literacy and face barriers to cancer care, making SDM even more critical in this population. This study aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a SDM tool for Spanish-speaking patients considering maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer. \n- Spanish: Fondo: El c\u00e1ncer de ovario es la principal causa de muerte de c\u00e1ncer en mujeres. El tratamiento de mantenimiento despu\u00e9s del tratamiento inicial a menudo se utiliza para prevenir una recidiva del c\u00e1ncer. Las decisiones sobre el tratamiento de mantenimiento son complejas, y el proceso de decisi\u00f3n compartida (PDC) es esencial para asegurarse de que las opiniones y valores de los pacientes se tomen en cuenta.

Do you think children should also be included in the study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to explore the impact of a lifestyle intervention program on children with asthmatic symptoms. The study aims to examine the relationship between child asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in the context of a healthy and active lifestyle among obese children. The intervention program will consist of physical activity, nutritional counseling, and smoking cessation counseling. The intervention program will be tailored to the individual needs of each child and will be delivered by a team of healthcare professionals including a physician, a dietitian, and a smoking cessation counselor.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nObesity is a complex and multifactorial disorder that affects a large population of children and adolescents. Overweight and obesity can lead to various health problems, including respiratory illnesses such as asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that manifests with airway inflammation, bronchial obstruction, and respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a common asthma symptom, and it is defined as a decrease in lung function after exercise. EIB can lead to exercise-induced asthma symptoms (EIA), which may limit physical activity in children. Physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle and can improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle function, bone strength, and psychological well-being. Nutritional counseling can help children with obesity by promoting healthy eating habits, reducing caloric intake, and increasing physical activity. Smoking cessation counseling can also help children and adolescents quit smoking and reduce the risk of asthma and other respiratory illnesses.The intervention program will be administered for a period of 12 weeks. The control group will continue to receive their routine treatment and care. The program will be monitored by a team of healthcare professionals, including a",

Methods: A total of 119 women recruited from University and private clinics between March 2014 and December 2015. This randomized, wait list controlled trial recruited a total of 119 women with a primary diagnosis of BPS/IC. Eligible women were randomly allocated to an active sEMG biofeedback group (n = 43), a wait list control group (n = 40), or a sham biofeedback group (SEMGBF; n = 36). The main outcome measure was the International Common Terminology Criteria for ICC/BPS (CUT: 11\u2010point rating tool) and BPI\u2010DI (patient\u2019s perception of pain intensity). Secondary outcome measures included the Pelvic Floor Effectiveness (PFE) Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale for pain and bladder symptoms. Results: Mean change in CUT and BPI\u2010DI scores between Baseline and 6 months following treatment favored the active sEMG intervention compared to the wait list control group and sham biofeedback (treatment effect).

            "24-Ouyang Wan for the Treatment of Menstrual Pain\n\n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Studies have shown that 24\u2010Ouyang Wan (24\u2010Oy), a multi\u2010component traditional Chinese medicine, has an effect on menstrual pain. However, the clinical efficacy has not been compared directly with that of NSAIDs. Therefore, this study was performed to compare the clinical efficacy of 24\u2010Oy and diclofenac potassium (DCP).METHODS: This randomized, controlled, double\u2010blind trial compared the clinical efficacy of 24\u2010Oy with that of DCP for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea (PD) in women over 18 years. Ninety\u2010five volunteers were enrolled and were randomly divided into the DCP group, the 24\u2010Oy group, and the placebo group using the random number table method, each group including 31 people. The total effective rate of 24\u2010Ou Yan Wan was compared with that of DCP.RESULTS: The total effective rate of 24\u2010Ouyang Wan was significantly better than that of DCP was 93.5% and 71.0%, respectively. The total effective rate of 24\u2010Ouyang wan was similar to that of the placebo group, 96.8%. The efficacy of 24\u2010Ou Yan Wan was significantly more effective than that of DCP (P < 0.05). The adverse reactions to the two treatments were all mild, and no severe adverse reactions occurred in both groups.CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of 24\u2010Ou Yan Wan is effective and safe, which can relieve the pain caused by PD, and it has some advantages in the comprehensive treatment of PD.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR\u2010IPR\u201016009940.\n\nThe trial application of the trial plan was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated TCM Hospital of Jinan University to protect the clinical data of the subjects, protect the data quality, and avoid data loss.\nThe original data will be stored in a specific computer and will not be copied except for paper printing and data backup.\nThe data will be archived",

            "Study Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nAge and gender are known to affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs, as well as the metabolism of drugs. It can be expected that the amount of blood that can be collected will also be sex-dependent. It has been found that women have a lesser total body water volume, are smaller, and have a lower hematocrit than men. In this trial, we will compare the blood sampling between adult males and adult females to examine whether there are differences in the volume of blood that can be collected, as well as blood loss rates during the procedure, in order to enhance the feasibility of the study.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nAdult female subjects were excluded from previous TASCEC trials because it was anticipated that the volume of blood that could be collected would be significantly lower than in adult male subjects. However, since it has been found that women have a lesser total body water volume, are smaller, and have a lower hematocrit than men, it can be expected in fact that the amount of blood that can be collected will also be sex-dependent. Based on the assumption that differences in blood sampling amount and female physiology are similar to those of men and women in the general population, we believe that collecting a sufficient amount of blood from a female patient will not pose a significant problem, as long as the following requirements are met: At least 10ml per kg body weight is collected; The amount of blood that can be collected from the patients should be calculated as 1600ml minus 20% blood loss, taking into account the size of the patients' bodies and the weight of blood loss, and blood from patients should be collected as long as the amount of blood drawn is sufficient; If the amount of blood drawn is insufficient, it should be used as a donation to the blood bank, and the subject's blood must still meet the 10ml per kg body weight collection criteria. As an extension to the above criteria, it is also recommended that blood be collected from female patients until 1200ml of blood is drawn and used as a donation at the blood bank, and that women continue to use the rest of the blood to meet the 10ml per kg body weight collection criteria. If the blood volume of a female patient is less than 2000ml, the investig",

The early rehabilitation program was a structured physical exercise protocol that consisted of resistance training and home\u2010based exercises to be completed three times per week for eight weeks. Both groups received traditional conservative treatment for 8 weeks. The outcome measures, including overall survival time, adverse reactions occurred during rehabilitation treatment, as well as physical function and quality of life (QOL) postoperatively were analyzed in this study. A total of 73 LAD patients who had undergone VATS anatomic segmentectomy were included in the study and divided into two groups according to the treatment they received. There was no difference between the two groups regarding the baseline characteristics, but the patients in the rehabilitation group had significantly decreased levels of pain, cough, and fatigue at 2 and 4 weeks after VATS anatomic segmentectomy compared with those in the control group (both P < 0.05). There was a slight trend toward a longer median overall survival time in the rehabilitation group (12 months vs 10 months, P = 0.595), and the rehabilitation group also had significantly better quality of life measures (score > 1) at all time points (2 weeks: 54.1% vs 27.7%, P < 0.05; 4 weeks: 88.9% vs 62.9%, P < 0.05; 8 weeks: 79.7% vs 44.9%, P < 0.05). The incidence rate of adverse reactions was similar between the two groups (36.7% vs 45.8%, P > 0.05). The early rehabilitation program did not increase the rate of adverse reactions but rather improved QOL after VATS anatomic segmentectomy.Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This includes inhaled antibiotics that fight off different types of bacteria that can infect people with CF. However, the efficacy of antibiotics becomes problematic if the same specific antibiotic is used for too long a period. It can lead to the development of drug resistance and the possibility of an infection returning. A new inhaled antibiotic called AZD5938 requires a loading dose that should be given for at least 14 days, and then a maintenance dose twice per week. The purpose of this study is to describe the implementation and evaluation of this new regimen in two CF centers. This single-center open-label study will enroll subjects with mild-to-moderate pulmonary exacerbations who satisfy the protocol-defined criteria. Study subjects will be assigned to Group A (loading dose for 14 days and maintenance dose twice per week) or Group B (loading dose for 28 days and a maintenance dose once per week). The effectiveness of the new regimen will be compared with two different dosing regimens currently used at the study sites (standard: loading dose for 14 days and maintenance dose twice per week, standard B: loading dose for 28 days and a maintenance dose twice per week) in terms of the recurrence of pulmonary exacerbations in six months following study entry.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nPilot Study of the Implementation and Evaluation of Adaptation of Antibiotic Dosing Regimens for Inhaled Antibiotic Treatment in Cystic Fibrosis\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nCystic Fibrosis\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Tobramycin\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Age over 2 years, and able to perform pulmonary function tests Exclusion Criteria: Subjects with severe acute exacerbations or those who",

            "Our study seeks to leverage social norms and behavioral economics concepts to facilitate vaccine behavior change. To accomplish this, we have employed a unique combination of strategies that target both the healthcare provider and the parent/caregiver. As part of the provider-level intervention, we have partnered with clinic administrators to develop a data benchmarking system that highlights missed opportunities for vaccination and tracks progress over time. This data benchmarking system creates a sense of social accountability, motivating providers to recommend vaccines more consistently. Additionally, we have developed training and education materials that equip providers with the skills and knowledge needed to effectively address vaccine hesitancy and promote vaccine uptake. \n\nFinally, the interactive, online-based vaccine education materials help parents/caregivers to engage with and understand the benefits of vaccination. By making vaccines more easily accessible, we aim to reduce barriers to care and encourage vaccine acceptance among individuals who may not be reaching a provider for routine care. \n\n \n\nTogether, these strategies aim to address the multi-faceted factors that contribute to vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccination rates in the pediatric and adult primary care populations. \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Vaccination hesitancy and refusal are rising concerns worldwide, particularly among parents of young children. MultiCare Health System, a healthcare network in the Pacific Northwest, has implemented various interventions to increase vaccination rates, such as offering patient incentives like gift cards. Despite these efforts, vaccine acceptance rates remain below the recommended levels, particularly for influenza and tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) vaccines. The MultiCare Health System, in collaboration with Washington University in St. Louis, is planning a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of provider- and parent-level interventions on vaccination behavior. Methods: A cluster randomized pilot trial of pediatric primary care clinics will evaluate the effectiveness of a provider-level educational intervention and a targeted parent-level intervention on improving vaccination rates. Healthcare providers are provided with training and data benchmarking to promote vaccine acceptance in their patients. Parents/caregivers receive targeted information and reminders via MyChart, including a social norming component and an opt-in option for personalized vaccine reminders. The primary outcome measure will be receipt of an influenza or Tdap vaccine during the 6-months post",
            "The participant group/arm for the control standard care arm consists of ten comparable general clinics, with five for pediatric care and five for adult primary care, from all MultiCare facilities. The intervention/treatment for this arm includes standard care, which consists of regular vaccination reminders and materials delivered through the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. Standard care does not include additional training or outreach efforts.",

            "Alright. The participant group/arm for the experimental group intervention arm consists of six comparable general clinics, with two for pediatric care and four for adult primary care, from all MultiCare facilities. The intervention/treatment for this arm includes the enhanced electronic reminder mechanism, data benchmarks for clinic managers or providers, and addressing missed opportunities and doubts/hesitancy about immunization through various methods such as team training/meetings, pamphlets, physician-led speeches in online videos, and group messages via MyChart on the clinic level.",
            "Sure. This study arm is necessary to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive group intervention on improving vaccine confidence and vaccination rates in a community healthcare setting. By selecting six comparable clinics from different regions and implementing various components such as electronic reminders, data benchmarks, and training/meetings, we can assess the impact of these interventions on vaccination outcomes. This arm allows for a structured approach to address barriers to vaccination and improve vaccine confidence within the healthcare system.",
            "For the control standard care arm, three facilities will serve as the control group under routine care. They will receive no additional interventional activities regarding vaccination, except for MultiCare's usual vaccine promotion practices. This arm will allow us to compare vaccination outcomes between the intervention group and the control group, determining the incremental benefit of the group intervention on vaccine confidence and vaccination rates compared to standard care practices.",

This will be done by demonstrating an upper bound of the upper bound of the two sided 95% confidence intervals (2 UBCCI) for the difference in ACR20 response rate between both treatment arms is less than 10%. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 100% TNF inhibitor biosimilar candidate ABI Q2W versus reference 100% TNF inhibitor Humira\u00ae.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nCurrent European guidelines for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recommend using different anti-rheumatic drugs and/or anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents if the objectives defined for each individual patient were not met with the previously used drug(s) (i.e. dose adjustment, dose interruption and/or discontinuation) or when the previously used drug shows a loss of efficacy after a stable period (i.e. disease flare) .

            "A brief summary in lay language\n=================\nBackground and aims: Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) are increasingly being used to evaluate efficacy and quality of life in clinical trials and clinical practice,  but it can be difficult to collect complete PRO datasets due to patients' burden of data collection, fatigue, and motivation. We have already developed a web-based patient-assisted technology which improves the data quality and completeness of daily monitoring by reducing the data entry burden on patients. The goal of the present study is to validate the daily monitoring web application against ECG monitoring. The investigators will compare self-reported data  versus  24-hour ECG monitoring  by comparing patients' reported sleep time  and physical activity,  with the actual ECG data. Study methods: A secondary analysis is conducted as part of a randomized, double-blind controlled trial of heart rhythm-guided bridging rhythm control therapy vs. usual care. In a sub-study of 100 subjects, patients aged 18-79 years with atrial fibrillation are randomised to daily monitoring with smart-ecg (mobile app) combined with a daily self-administered questionnaire or ECG monitoring and a daily self-administered questionnaire. In this study we will compare self-reported data, that is data entered by the patient,  with the ECG-monitored data, and calculate the sensitivity and the specificity of the patient-reported outcomes. Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS and R. This secondary analysis will be conducted in 2022/2023.\n\nStudy Rationale\n=================\nPatient-reported outcomes (PROs) in cardiology, in the form of either self-administered questionnaires or daily self-monitoring are increasingly used to collect symptom burden, side effects and the impact of the treatment. However, there are some challenges in collecting high quality data. First, there is often a high burden of data collection, either by completing weekly  questionnaires or by using patient-assisted technology, where patients need to perform additional steps of data analysis and reporting. This might result in lower levels of patient motivation to participate or complete the datasets. Second, there is risk of patients' reporting fatigue caused by the repetitive nature of the data entry. This may lead",

Forty\u2010two patients with sarcoptes scabie infected with dermatitis caused by chronic itching were randomly divided into two groups of twenty\u2010one each. The first group was given Nimorazole 2%, the second 4% cream for a month. In both groups the treatment started with the use of 2 capsules of Permethrin 5% cream, once between the hours of 9 and 11 pm and a second two days later. To evaluate the evolution of the lesions, the patients were examined at days 0,15, and 30 after treatment. The result was considered negative when the lesions were absent or when the lesions reduced by more than 90%. There was a significant difference between both groups (p <0.05), the 4% group was superior to the group that had been treated with 2%, the difference was not statistically significant between the number of lesions at the beginning of the treatment, however, there was a significant reduction in the number of lesions in both groups. The presence of lesions tended to decrease in both groups and no adverse effects were found in both groups. In both groups there was a good response to treatment but this was more evident when using the new formulation of Nimorazole 4%."

However, these models of care have not achieved optimal disease control and many patients experience poor quality of life. Patient-centred continuous care (PCCC), also known as case management, may be an effective approach for managing the needs of people with multiple chronic conditions. Case management involves developing a long term plan of care for individuals with complex chronic conditions or those who are frequently admitted to hospital. Health care and community social services are linked together in an attempt to improve care quality and continuity of services. The intervention is a single blinded feasibility study of an individualized care plan supported by care coordinators, with an inbuilt process evaluation of the uptake and implementation of the programme. The primary focus is on patients with COPD and cardiovascular diseases with a history of repeat hospital admission or an ED attendance. There will be 3 phases to the care pathway: Phase 1 will involve the development of a care plan for all participating patients. At this stage, care planning sessions will be facilitated by the care coordinators, and will be followed up after one month. The sessions will be held in either the ED or community venue. The sessions will be at least 1 hour in length and will involve key members of the multidisciplinary team, the patient and their carer/family. Phase 2 will begin with a home visit by one of the care coordinators to address any outstanding issues that need resolving. This will be followed up by a series of monthly care plan follow-up calls. Phase 3 of the project is a repeat visit to the ED and 6-month follow up.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nProcedures used to provide care for patients with complex chronic disease have traditionally been organized according to an episodic model of care.

            "Study Overview\n=================\n\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nFibre, a high protein content food source, has potential as a therapeutic for obesity. It has been demonstrated in animal studies and short-term studies in healthy humans that fibre reduces the risk for obesity and obesity-related diseases by slowing the rate at which glucose is released from a meal into the blood. In addition, it has been shown that glucose release is lowered when a protein and a high-glycaemic index (GI) carbohydrate are consumed in combination with fibre and the resulting hypoglycaemic effect is dose-dependent when fibre is supplemented by approximately 20 g. Protein, which has been shown to reduce energy intake for hours after a meal in humans, may reduce hunger and subsequently compensate for the reduced caloric intake caused by the fibre supplement. However, the effects of the combined influence of fibre and protein on glucose release and energy intake have not been investigated, and it remains unknown whether the effect of fibre on glucose release is enhanced when combined with protein. In the current study the effect of the supplementation of a fibre-rich flour (Fitoplan\u00ae) to a high-GI carbohydrate-containing breakfast with or without protein will be evaluated by an acute study in healthy humans. The effect of the breakfast on the glycaemic response will be measured by the area under the insulin and the C-peptide curve as an indication of the insulin sensitivity. In addition, the effects on energy intake, appetite control, satiety and gut hormones will be evaluated from a food intake perspective. The investigators hope that by establishing that Fitoplan\u00ae lowers the glycaemic response when combined with protein, new possibilities for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases will be generated.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nObesity is a result of excess energy intake and lack of physical activity, and is generally defined as BMI > 25 kg/m2. People who are obese are at a higher risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Reducing energy intake is important for weight loss, but a reduction in portion size does not always result in a change in body weight",

A treatment of obesity that could be implemented by OUD patients at home and be used as an add-on therapy to other interventions is highly desirable. Acupressure is one non-pharmacological approach. Its effect in obesity patients is not well established so far. Hypothesis/Research question: The research question is to evaluate the effectiveness of auricular acupressure used as add-on treatment to usual care on weight reduction in patients with OUD. Material and methods: 2-center prospective, randomized, controlled, pilot study. Study design and procedures: The patients included will be randomized to auricular acupressure (experimental group) or no auricular acupressure (control group). Body weight and body mass index (BMI) will be measured at baseline, week 6, and week 12. Displacement will be assessed by a blinded review of MRI measurements at baseline, week 6, and week 12. The main outcome is BMI after 6 and 12 weeks. In addition, general safety and tolerability of the intervention will be assessed.

The study was designed to verify whether low\u2010dose metoprolol is effective in preventing angina (secondary end point), in addition to the incidence of other relevant cardiac end points (primary end point).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred twenty patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing transradial coronary catheterization were randomized to receive either metoprolol or placebo. The end points were angina, hemodynamic instability, hypotension requiring treatment, and any other serious adverse events.RESULTS: Significant differences in angina were observed in the overall group, metoprolol patients, and patients who underwent diagnostic catheterization for angina symptoms (p <0.05; OR, 3.21; 95% CI, 1.10\u20109.45). Angina was the only cardiac end point to show a significant difference. Hypotension requiring treatment, hemodynamic instability, and any other serious adverse events were similar in both study arms.CONCLUSIONS: Low\u2010dose metoprolol is effective in preventing angina but not hemodynamic instability, hypotension requiring treatment, or any other serious adverse events during transradial coronary catheterization.

Upon failure of chemotherapy, patients may also receive FOLFIRI, FOLFOXIRI, and irinotecan-based therapies for extended treatment. Upon failure of standard chemotherapy regimens, patients may receive anti-angiogenic drugs which target the VEGF pathway. Furthermore, immune checkpoint blockers targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathways have demonstrated promising efficacy in advanced colorectal cancer treatment in the past decade.\nFruquintinib is a novel oral anti-angiogenic inhibitor that targets VEGFR-1-4, and has shown remarkable efficacy with manageable safety in advanced colorectal cancer patients. A combination therapy of fruquintinib and PD-1 antibody has been used in some studies, showing improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to monotherapy for both drugs.\nFurthermore, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as sintilimab, a PD-1 antibody, have shown satisfactory efficacy as monotherapy in the treatment of patients with unresectable colorectal cancer. According to a recent Phase 2 study, the PFS of sintilimab monotherapy exceeded 8 months in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who failed to respond to previous therapies.\nTherefore, we aim to demonstrate the value of combination therapy of fruquintinib and sintilimab in advanced colorectal cancer patients in the present study.\nNumber of Arms:: 1\nTarget Number",

What's the main objective or purpose of the trial?\n\nAbstract:\nNutrition intervention has an important role in health and disease and plays a more important role, in general, in patients with cancer. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a nutritional support device (Nutrition Fuel) on body weight and on physical activity performance at the end of treatment in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, compared to a standard nutritional support (oral nutritional supplements). Methods: A single\u2010center, participant\u2010 and assessor\u2010blinded, randomized, controlled trial will be performed. After signing the informed consent form and following a screening visit, 98 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatment will be randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to receive oral nutritional supplements or the Nutrition Fuel device following inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study will consist of: 4 weeks for the run\u2010in period, 8 weeks for the intervention period (including 3 follow\u2010up assessments) and 8\u201012 weeks for the follow\u2010up period (including 1 follow\u2010up visit). Physical activity will be measured using a valid questionnaire that contains questions about physical activity outside of a structured program and through physical activity during a 24\u2010hour period. Patient\u2010related outcomes for assessing the quality of life of patients will be collected using the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQC30) and the EORTC QLQ\u2010BR23 questionnaire. The evaluation of physical activity will be carried out using the EORTC QLQ\u2010PR25 questionnaire using a 7\u2010day recall period. Anthropometric characteristics and blood analysis will be evaluated. The primary objective of the study is to assess the ability of Nutrition Fuel, a new nutritional support device, to increase physical activity in breast cancer patients compared to an oral nutritional supplement (ONS). Secondary objectives: 1) Evaluate the impact of Nutrition Fuel on the physical and mental well\u2010being of subjects compared to oral nutritional supplements; 2) Compare Nutrition Fuel and ONS on weight gain and body composition after the administration of 4 cycles of different chemotherapy regimens (Adjuvant chemotherapy A; Anthracyclines for adjuvant chemotherapy B and Anthracycline-free chemotherapy C); 3",

Mitomycin C is an antimitotic agent that inhibits the proliferation of cells and reduces the inflammatory reaction in the nasal cavity. When applied in an appropriate environment, the prognosis of the above patients is good, and the quality of life is obviously improved. This study was designed to evaluate the clinical importance of changes induced by mitomycin C nebulization in patients with nosological diseases and the impact on the quality of life. Patients' clinical data and health-related quality of life (HRQL) information were collected. The patients were divided into three groups, including patients with nasal polyp(NP) and refractory chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp(CRSwNP), patients with nasal polyps(NP) alone, and healthy volunteers(Con),according to the specific symptoms of these patients. All patients received percutaneous mitomycin C nebulization treatment (group 1: NP and CRSwNP group (N=15); group 2: NP alone group (N=15);group 3: Healthy control group (N=15). HRQL was evaluated by 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome test 20 (SNOT-20) and Nose-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (NSQOL). Follow-up was performed 3 months after the intervention. Comparisons of clinical and instrumental data and the scores of SNO-20 score and NSQOL score were made at the initial assessment and the after treatment assessment.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Impact of Percutaneous Mitomycin C on Nasal Diseases and the Quality of Life\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nNasal Patency Obstruction\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Mitomycin C\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria"

Now, let's summarize the design of each study arm. \n\nThe Education Group:\n\n15 participants will receive the same training presentation on intercultural nursing that is given to the control group. However, instead of ending the presentation there, they will proceed to complete activities aimed at enhancing their cultural intelligence and competence.

This will help them to critically analyze and reflect on different cultural perspectives, building on their previous training. \n\nControl Group: The control group will only receive the training presentation and will not engage in any further activities. This will serve as a comparison to determine the effectiveness of the bibliotherapy approach. \n\nData Collection:\n\nData will be collected at baseline (before the intervention) and at the end of the intervention (3 months later) using a pre-test/post-test design. The main outcome measure will be cultural intelligence and competence, which will be measured using validated questionnaires and surveys.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nThe data will be analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, including t-tests, independent samples t-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The findings will be presented in the form of mean differences, paired t-tests, and other appropriate statistical methods. \n\nEthical Considerations:\n\nWe will follow the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and obtain informed consent from all participants. The study protocol will be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Confidentiality and anonymity will be maintained throughout the study. Participant safety will be prioritized, and the study protocol is designed to minimize any potential harms or risks.\n\nTimeframe:\n\nThe intervention will last for 3"

Based on the details of your proposed study design, here are a few considerations for the study arm for TNB Identity Affirmation (IA) Condition:\n\n1) The intervention will consist of composing a personal narrative using personal examples and anecdotes that describe the participants' unique experiences of personal stigma, feelings of not belonging, and exclusion based on their TNB identity. \n\n2) The objective of the intervention is to promote self-acceptance and reduce negative self-perceptions by sharing personal stories that highlight the experiences and challenges faced by TNB individuals. \n\n3) The duration of the intervention will be 15-20 minutes per day for three consecutive days. Participants will be asked to write their narratives on paper or in a digital format, such as a word processing document or Google Doc. \n\n4) To enhance the impact of the intervention, participants will be encouraged to share their written narratives with a supportive peer or community member who has a positive and affirming view of TNB identities, such as a counselor, support group member, or close friend. Sharing their stories can provide valuable feedback and support, which may help participants process their experiences and emotions more effectively.\n\nI hope these suggestions prove helpful in designing your study arm.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.\n\nBest Regards,",
            "For the IA + Strengthening Social Connections (SSC) Condition, participants will engage in the same TNB Identity Affirmation writing activity as the first arm, followed by composing a letter of gratitude to someone who has provided meaningful support. The letter should articulate specific appreciations and reflections on how that support has impacted their life. \n\nFor example, if someone in the study has a close friend who has consistently stood up for their identity, participants could write a letter to that friend thanking them and acknowledging the impact of their support. If they have a supportive parent or family member, they could write a letter expressing their gratitude and appreciation for their acceptance and understanding. This intervention aims to strengthen social connections and gratitude, both of which are important factors in promoting well-being.\n\nDifferentiation between the Experimental: IA alone and the Experimental: IA + SSC.\nThe Experimental: IA Condition aims to assess the impact of TNB Identity Affirmation intervention on reducing internalized transphobia and promoting well-being specifically related to TNB identity. This arm involves reading a vignette and then writing in response to the TNB Identity Affirmation prompt.

            "Thank you, we will take your suggestions into consideration. 1 Introduction: Aeruginosa is the most common bacterial cause of chronic pulmonary infection in patients with bronchiectasis. Antibiotics play a key role in their treatment but increasing resistance is often observed (1). Antimicrobial treatment of Pseudomonal infection in these patients is further complicated by the fact that the pathogenicity and morbidity of C. aeruginosa depend on its quorum-sensing (QS) system and the development of hypermucoviscous (HM) phenotype (2). 2 Methods: A total of 135 patients were hospitalized in ICUs due to respiratory failure in August 2015 and September 2016. The 50 most severely ill were randomly selected to participate in a prospective clinical study and were stratified using the Pseudomonas Infection Severity Index (3). The patients were monitored for 45 days, until discharge from hospital or death. 3 Results: Patients with HM pseudomonas had a poorer prognosis, with 28-day mortality of 40% versus 10% in patients with non-HM Pseudomonas, which was significant (Fisher exact test p = 0.04). A positive correlation exists between serum C-reactive protein and the Pseudomonas infection severity index (PISI) score, as well as the severity of underlying disease (r2 = 0.24, p = 0.02) among the 50 patients in the study (Figure 4). By combining information on HM status and clinical score, we developed a prognostic model for 28-day mortality. The 50 ICU patients were stratified into 5 risk groups which are characterized by 2 prognostic factors: non HM pseudomonas status (1 or 0) and PISI score (5 levels from 12 to 50) (Figure 1). In this model, patients with HM pseudomonas and a PISI score of more than 30 had the worst prognosis, with 28-day mortality of 47%, and death was the primary cause of death in 85% of these"

However, it is a challenging problem, and the majority of patients will experience chronic low back pain, which affects daily life. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of lumbar fusion for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation revealed that early results may be suboptimal compared to conservative treatment, and patients with lumbar fusion had a markedly higher rate of complications than those with microsurgical discectomy. Furthermore, the fusion procedure frequently leads to degeneration in the adjacent segments.

This study is a single-center, double-masked, randomized controlled study. Patients were randomly divided into surgical groups (G1 and G2) for gasless suture vitrectomy and standard gas vitrectomy, and the follow-up continued for 3 months. The main outcome indicators were the retinal reattachment rate at 1 month, the recurrent detachment rate, and the reattachment time within 1 month. The efficacy and safety indicators were observed and compared between the two groups.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is an examiner-masked randomized controlled trial. The pre-hospitalization of the randomization allocation is randomized, non-blinded, with randomized block sizes of 2, 4, 6, or 8. The random allocation list was generated by SAS 9.4, stored and managed by the data management center of Zhejiang Ophthalmology Hospital, and not provided to any individual with trial-related functions. After informed consent is obtained by the operator or doctor who will operate the patient, randomized block allocation was used to randomly divide patients into two groups. According to the randomized order, patients who satisfied the screening criteria were randomly assigned to either group. 15 cases of sutureless gasless vitrectomy for retinal detachment repair were planned to be enrolled in G1 group, 15 cases of traditional gas vitrectomy for retinal detachment repair were planned to be enrolled in the G1 group, and 10 cases were scheduled to be withdrawn when 5 patients were lost to follow-up or refused follow-up or failed retinal reattachment repair.

The app was developed together with Japanese pulmonary arterial hypertension patients and health care professionals, and is designed to support the management of information collected during RHC. The app consists of two parts. First, a reminder notification function for recording symptom changes and medication compliance by the patients. Second, a visualization tool for showing the information collected by the patients to the physicians. The visualization tool visualizes RHC data together with the recorded symptom changes and medication compliance to provide a comprehensive view of the patients. This comprehensive view will support physicians in decision making, such as the need for follow up and additional treatment, as well as in patient education and shared decision making. With this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the acceptance and usefulness of the app developed to support the management of RHC results in Japanese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The investigators also aim to evaluate the impact of the app on the patients' quality of life (QOL), treatment strategy, and symptom severity.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Prospective, Multicenter, Single-arm Study to Confirm the Acceptance and Effectiveness of an App for Supporting the Management of Right Heart Catheterization (RHC) Results in Japanese Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (NCT050670100)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nPulmonary Hypertension, Right Ventricular Functional Class III, Pulmonary Hypertension, Right Ventricular Functional Class IV, Pulmonary Hypertension, Right Ventricular Functional Class II, Pulmonary Hypertension, World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class \n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: App\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Have signed"

Are you ready? \n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe aim of this study is to develop an educational game for adolescent girls with mental health comorbidities.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nMental health problems are one of the most common health problems and adolescence is known to be a period of increased risk for mental health problems. Adolescence is the transition from a more dependent child-adult relationship to a relationship with the ability to make own choices. In order to make this transition, a more independent and competent position of the adolescent compared to childhood is essential. Therefore, it is important that adolescents get the support and information needed to master this transition and to be able to make the right choices. An important part of self-control lies in being able to learn from both positive and negative experiences. Previously, many studies have shown an increased risk for anxiety and depression in children with type 1 diabetes. It is also known that social isolation and the search for peer support have a great influence on the management of the symptoms of anxiety and depression. It is essential that children, and especially adolescents, learn the ability to master the feelings they experience. This is especially true for this group, which may otherwise experience social isolation as a result. This is where video games / digital learning environments can bridge the gap in a way that appeals to children, making it easier to learn important coping skills and improve self-control. This is an ongoing problem around the world, and therefore an easy-to-use and widely applicable tool would be invaluable for this group of adolescents around the world. The aim of this study is to develop an educational game on the topic of mental health, based on existing research on the effects of games in a scientific format, and to test the game during a pilot study. The game should provide the user with information about mental illness, and should also include activities for learning coping strategies. This design should lead to an improved understanding of the adolescent's abilities and help the user prepare for the future, and ultimately help the user take better care of themselves and thereby increase their well-being. The aim is for the game to be available to as many as possible with a positive effect on mental health and thus be well-used by all who may"

            "Alright, let's move to the next question. What are the expected outcomes or results of this study? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nIn the United States, prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with an estimated 191,930 new cases and 33,330 deaths in 2020. Over the last 2 decades, there has been a paradigm shift from primary radical prostatectomy to active surveillance with the goal of preserving urinary continence, erectile function and quality of life. Because the prostate is located in the pelvic cavity, there are currently many limitations to standard imaging in imaging prostate cancer. For example, with MRI of the pelvis, although it is currently considered the gold standard imaging exam for local staging and nodal metastases, it has low sensitivity for identifying microscopic disease recurrence. With regard to cross sectional imaging, CT scan and bone scan both have low sensitivity, and often only identify large lesions. PET-CT scan offers much better sensitivity than CT scan alone, but it is a nuclear imaging and can only visualize the bone. Choline PET/CT is a relatively new technique that combines a low dose metabolic and functional (PET) scan with a high quality anatomic CT of the pelvis. The use of this technology is promising as it provides more information than MRI, CT, or PET alone, and can detect prostate cancer both in the pelvis and in distant bone involvement. While previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of choline PET/CT in detecting prostate cancer, its use has not been prospectively validated through a randomized controlled trial. In our institution, we routinely use choline PET/CT for both primary work-up in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and as a surveillance tool to assess disease recurrence in the postradiotherapy setting. We hypothesize that the use of routine post-radiation choline PET/CT will result in improved 10-year survival in men with high risk prostate cancer.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Impact of Routine Post Radiation Choline PET/CT on Biochemical Failure-free Survival: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial",

We report herein a case of transient ischemic attacks as the sole neurologic manifestation of CNS injury following the use of the Inspire Device (ID) for obstructive sleep apnea management.\nMETHODS: A 66\u2010yr\u2010old man underwent removal of palatine tonsils and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) for obstructive sleep apnea. Two months later he underwent an Inspire implant. A few days after the procedure, the patient developed left facial numbness, dysphagia, vertigo, and aphasia that lasted for a few weeks. Audiovisual and somatosensory evoked potentials, neuropsychological testing, brain magnetic resonance imaging, neck and chest computed tomography, and 72\u2010h Holter monitoring were performed and found to be normal.\nRESULTS: Given the time course of events, the relationship of the procedure to the new neurologic symptoms was considered to be possible. A subsequent sleep study showed stable, nonsignificant obstructive events while using the ID device. Following the removal of the Inspire Device, the patient's preprocedure neurologic deficits resolved.\nCONCLUSIONS: This report highlights this rare complication after ID surgery. The association between neurologic dysfunction and the use of the Inspire Device suggests that patients considering ID surgery should be counseled on the possible (possibly remote) neurologic adverse effects.",

            "Study design is a crucial aspect of any clinical trial. It provides the framework for conducting the trial in a systematic and efficient manner, allowing you to generate reliable and valid results. By taking the time to carefully design your study, you can improve your chances of conducting a successful clinical trial and obtaining unbiased and generalizable results.\n\nStep 1: Determine the objective of your trial\nThe first step in designing your clinical trial is to determine the specific objective of your trial. For example, are you trying to assess the efficacy of a new treatment? Or are you trying to compare two different treatments? Once you know the objective of your trial, you can design the study to meet that objective.\nOne of the most common objectives of a clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a new treatment. To do this, you will need to design a clinical trial with sufficient statistical power to detect a difference between the new treatment and the standard treatment. You will also need to define the outcome measures that will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the new treatment.\nAnother common objective of a clinical trial is to compare two different treatments. To do this, you will need to design a clinical trial with a randomized, controlled design. This means that patients will be randomly assigned to one of the treatments, and the outcome measures will be used to compare the two treatments.\nRegardless of the objective of your trial, it is important to have a clear and specific objective before you begin the design process. \nStep 2: Identify the appropriate participants for your trial\nThe next step in designing your clinical trial is to identify the appropriate participants for your trial. This includes defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial. Inclusion criteria are the characteristics that a patient must have in order to be eligible for the trial, while exclusion criteria are characteristics that would exclude a patient from participating in the trial.\nFor example, let's say you are trying to evaluate the efficacy of a new treatment for depression. You might set the inclusion criteria as adults aged 18-65 with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, who have not responded to at least one antidepressant treatment. On the other hand, you might set the exclusion criteria as patients with a history of bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms, or electroconvulsive therapy within the past year.\nIt is important to have clear inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to ensure",

This approach will provide valuable insights into the efficacy and impact of MRI-guided radiotherapy on different types of cancer. \n\nStudy design and objectives for multi center, prospective, national, multinational, non-randomized, cohort study\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: Radiotherapy (RT) is a key component in the treatment of various cancers. The goal of radiotherapy is to deliver high doses of radiation to the tumor site while minimizing damage to adjacent normal tissue. However, the impact of hypoxia on the outcome of patient undergoing RT remains unclear. MRI sequences that enable the mapping of intra\u2010tumoral hypoxia have shown potential for improving treatment planning and delivery. In this national project, we aim to generate a prospective database of intra\u2010tumoral hypoxia maps via MRI sequences in patients undergoing RT. We anticipate this database will facilitate research on the correlation between intra\u2010tumoral hypoxia and RT outcomes. Methods: This national project is a multicenter, prospective, observational study conducted in seven French institutions specialized in RT. Four subcohorts will include patients undergoing RT for prostate cancer, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, and kidney cancer. Patients will undergo pretreatment MRI with T2*, DWI, and multi\u2010echo \u2010 EPI gradient echo sequences to enable the calculation of the diffusion coefficient in different directions and to generate an ADC map. Results will be compared between the different sequences and with tumor volume. The primary endpoint is the assessment of hypoxia in these different regions using 18FDG\u2010PET.

This trial is a proof-of-concept randomized controlled study of rapid improvement in depressed severe mental illness treated with subanaesthetic ketamine. The aim of the study is to investigate the short-term effect of subanaesthetic ketamine on the rapid reduction of depression in severe mental illness, and to explore the feasibility of conducting a larger cluster randomized control ketamine depression clinical study. 92 patients 18 years of age or over from four mental hospitals were recruited in the study. The patients were randomly allocated to receive antipsychotic drugs alone or antipsychotic drugs combined with subanaesthetic ketamine infusion treatments. In the intervention group, patients received an infusion of ketamine at the rate of 0.3-0.4 mg/(kg*min) for 40-50 minutes, and patients in the control group were treated with antipsychotic drugs alone twice a day.

We hope it all goes well. \n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this is to find out whether 3-naphtol (3N) and bile acids influence the microbiota and composition of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in mice.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBiliary lipids are involved in the pathophysiology of several liver diseases, such as biliary cirrhosis or primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). These biliary lipids have a role to play in the formation of gallstones or in the progression of liver fibrosis. The composition of biliary lipids is determined to a large extent by their composition of the gut microbiota (microbes in the gut): the gut microbiota is capable of synthesizing a number of bile acids, or inactivating others. At present, it is unclear to what extent the microbiota is involved, but the microbiota is considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of biliary-induced diseases. One approach in this regard is to use short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are considered an important energy source for intestinal epithelial cells and play an important role in regulating the function and composition of the gut microbiota. The production of SCFAs by the microbiota is dependent on the composition of biliary lipids. In the study, it will therefore be examined to what extent biliary lipids, and more specifically 3-naphtol (3N), alter the gut microbiota. For this reason, a metagenomic analysis was included in the study. Metagenomics is a sequencing technology that allows the analysis of several molecules at the same time. The microbiome can therefore be studied more fully with this technology.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEffects of 3-naphtol or Ox Bile Acids on the Gut Microbiota and on Short-chain Fatty Acids Composition in Mice\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nPrimary Biliary Cholangitis, GI Complications\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Dietary Supplement: 3-napht"

Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent endoscopic procedures for the treatment of NABS between January 2020 and December 2022 at our institution. Patients were divided into two groups based on the endoscopic treatment method: endoscopic micro\u2010plasma ablation (EG\u2010MPA) group (n=8) and conventional endoscopic therapy (CET) group (n=11). The success rate, treatment\u2010related adverse events, and need for re\u2010intervention were compared between the two groups at 6 and 12 months post\u2010procedure. Results: The mean interval between liver transplantation and endoscopic procedure was similar in both groups (5.9+/\u20102.0 months vs. 5.1+/\u20102.3 months, p=0.709). The mean stricture diameter at the time of endoscopic procedure was also similar between the two groups (12.0+/\u20104.0 mm vs. 12.5+/\u20103.6 mm, p=0.874).

For the other arm, participants will receive the IAL\u00ae-F OVD, right? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: This multi\u2010center, randomized, clinical trial was designed to compare the results of surgery on patients with bilateral cataracts. Methods: Fifty patients with bilateral cataract were enrolled at 2 medical centers in Colombia and randomly divided into two groups of 25 patients each. The first group (A) underwent bilateral cataract extraction under regional anesthesia in different sessions, while Group B underwent bilateral cataract extraction under general anesthesia using a topical anesthetic. Surgical techniques included capsulorrhexis, phacoemulsification with bimanual cataract extraction and implantation of an intraocular lens, all performed using Storz (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). The primary outcomes were post\u2010operative adverse reactions, corneal clarity and endothelial cell count, intraoperative complications, surgical time and subjective and objective outcomes during the first 72 hours after surgery. Results: Patients in Group A received a regional anesthetic during surgery compared to general anesthesia with a topical anesthetic in Group B. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding ocular adverse effects and complications, with 52% of patients in Group A and 48% of patients in Group B presenting with ocular adverse effects. Regarding subjective and objective findings, 48% of patients in Group A and 32% of patients in Group A presented with a decrease in visual acuity 24 hours after surgery (p=0.11). The number of corneal cells counted 48 hours after surgery was lower in Group A with 1743.3 cells compared to 2071.5 cells (p=0.001). Conclusion: Topical anesthesia during cataract surgery is just as adequate as regional or general anesthesia, and offers all the advantages of topical anesthesia, without the need for general and regional anesthesia.",

As an extra reminder, one arm will have the FIDIAL PLUS OVD, a 1.8% sodium hyaluronate solution, and the other arm will have the IAL\u00ae-F OVD, an animal-derived 1.8% sodium hyaluronate equivalent to FIDIAL PLUS.\n\nAbstract:\nPURPOSE: As one of the largest eye surgeries, cataract surgery is critical to the health of our eyes. To protect the intraocular structures during surgery, an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) is often used to provide a clear field of view and prevent intraoperative complications. The present study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of a bacterial\u2010derived OVD, FIDIAL PLUS, compared to an animal\u2010derived OVD, IAL\u00ae\u2010F (the active comparator), used during cataract surgery. METHODS: A total of 132 patients with cataract were included in the study. The participants were assigned to two groups randomly: FIDIAL PLUS group and IAL\u00ae\u2010F group. Participants in both groups were subjected to cataract surgery with the application of one drop of 1.8% sodium hyaluronate OVD before the surgery. Clinical outcomes and the incidence of adverse effects were measured and compared in the two groups. RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 66.5 \u00b1 8.82 years. The data indicate that the IOL (intraocular lens) positioning was not only comparable in both groups (6.99 \u03bcm in FIDUAL PLUS group and 8.84 \u03bcm in IAL\u00ae\u2010F group) but also significantly better than that in the previous study with IAL\u00ae\u2010F (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). The mean anterior chamber cell (0.001 for FIDIAL PLUS group and 0.103 for IAL\u00ae\u2010F group) and anterior uveitis (0.008 for FIDIAL PLUS group and 0.109 for IAL\u00ae\u2010F group) were significantly better in the FIDIAL PLUS group than the active comparator, and the"

As for the superficial cervical plexus block, it is performed by injecting a similar solution into the cervical plexus in the neck region. This block is intended to further reduce pain in the shoulder and arm area, and may also help prevent diaphragmatic paralysis. These two blocks when combined are expected to provide more effective postoperative pain relief while reducing the risk of breathing difficulties associated with cervical and brachial plexus blocks. \n\n[STUDY] \nInclusion Criteria: Diagnosed with shoulder arthropathy.\nScheduled to undergo shoulder arthroplasty surgery.\nAmerican Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status classification of I-II-III\nAge 18-80 years.\nAmerican Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status classification of ASA I-II-III\nNot pregnant.\nNot previously performed a cervical plexus block.\nNot previously performed a suprascapular nerve block.\nNot previously prescribed a painkiller.\nAgreed to the study protocol.\nExclusion Criteria: ASA physical status classification of > III\nPediatric participants under 18 years of age\nPregnant participants\nComplications of shoulder arthropathy: rotator cuff tear and superior labrum anterior to posterior tear.\nAllergic to local anesthetics\nA history of phrenic nerve paralysis\nParticipation in any other research study [/STUDY]",

Part 1 of the study will enroll participants with previously untreated FL, while part 2 of the study will randomize participants with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory FL to receive either odronextamab or chemotherapy alone. Odronextamab is a novel CD38-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets CD38, which is overexpressed on malignant B cells in FL, and delivers a cytotoxic payload of the anti-cancer drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) was selected as a comparator chemotherapy regimen due to its established use in the treatment of FL in the relapsed/refractory setting and in the initial response of many patients with advanced-stage FL who go on to proceed with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (auto-HSCT). For part 1 of the study, participants in the odronextamab arm will receive odronextamab in combination with CHOP for six cycles followed by maintenance therapy with odronextamab for up to 12 months; participants in the CHOP arm will receive CHOP for six cycles. Part 2 of the study includes participants with advanced-stage FL, who will be randomized to receive either odronextamab in combination with CHOP (Arm 1) or CHOP alone (Arm 2) in a 1:1 ratio. The primary objective of the study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in the odronextamab arm versus the comparator arm. \n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------",

In addition, we evaluated the predictive validity of the ICD\u2010U codes for gout via a predictive risk assessment model based on the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI).CONCLUSION: ICD\u2010U codes for gout showed good agreement with ICD\u20109\u2010CM codes despite an altered coding structure and terminology. The ICD\u2010U codes may be a useful tool for the diagnosis and treatment of gout in clinical practice.INTRODUCTION\nDespite the introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), coding discrepancies persist between different code sets. The I54 code for gout was revised from the 9th revision to the 10th revision of ICD (ICD\u201010\u2010CM) and further revised in recent years (ICD\u201010\u2010CM\u2010U, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification-Update). These changes in coding terminology might cause coding discrepancies between the code sets, posing a challenge for physicians when using electronic clinical data systems. Therefore, it is important to validate the validity of ICD\u2010U codes for classifying patients with gout",

The aim of the present study is to determine whether 4 days of treatment with the drug H2299 prior to kidney transplant surgery is also effective in preventing the body's immune response. If this study is successful, the drug H2299 could offer treatment opportunities for patients affected by the side effects of the drug MZB-011 (Zortress) as well as kidney transplant patients not receiving MZB-011 (Zortress).

[INTERVENTION]The target patients were 14 or more American Society of Anesthesiologists, patients with a scheduled operation within two days and undergoing elective shoulder arthroscopy. In addition, 21 to 70 years of male and female patients with BMI less than or equal to 30 kg/m2 were selected. Exclusion Criteria: Patients undergoing revisions or multiple joint surgery (i.e., knee joint repair after rotator cuff repair). History of allergy to local anesthetics, chronic disease, psychiatric complication, chronic pain, history of alcoholism or drug abuse, long-term use of opioids, history of previous shoulder surgery, history of axillary surgery or bleeding tendency. Those with a history of peripheral neuropathy of the upper limb or the arm paralysis of upper extremities Other patients who the investigator judges to be inappropriate for the study. The exclusion criteria of the subjects were as the following: patients with a preoperative NRS  score of 3 or more; patients who used opioids within seven days before surgery; patients who took strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducer drugs within 14 days before surgery; patients without complete medical records; and patients with a history of upper limb surgery. Participants will be randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Patients will be allocated to continuous subscapularis nerve block group or continuous local infiltration  (LI) group at a rate of 1: 1. For treatment, interscalene block was performed according to standard procedures in the interscapular intermuscular space. 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine was injected at injection points located at the junction",

Methods: Forty\u2010eight patients were randomised to two different treatment protocols 24 and 36 treatments. Treatments were performed with the Foot\u2010Axle\u2010System (FAS), using a modified Taylor and Becker goniometer. Radiological measurements were assessed at 2 \u2010 and 5 \u2010 years by an independent observer and clinical measurement were assessed at 2 \u2010 and 5 \u2010 years. Results: 50 of 60 patients were available for the evaluation, 25 in each group. A significant difference between the groups after 2 and 5 years regarding clinical measurements was found (p\u2009<\u20090.01). A significant difference between the groups after 5 years regarding radiological measurements was found (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Radiological measurements showed only a small increase in the difference between the groups during the fifth year of treatment.

The study aims to find out whether a new diagnostic tool used to identify the presence of a tumour following surgery reduces the need for repeat visits and second surgery. The proposed work would also allow us to assess the efficacy of this diagnostic test as well as the patients satisfaction with the diagnostic and communication tools used to obtain a tissue diagnosis.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground The management of patients with breast cancer has changed over the last 10 years following a move from empirical adjuvant systemic therapy for all patients to a personalised approach depending on the stage of the disease, the molecular characteristics and the patients treatment preference. This process has resulted in the need for the oncology team to obtain a histopathological diagnosis on surgical specimens prior to adjuvant treatment planning. However, obtaining a histopathological diagnosis prior to surgery would be clinically easier and more beneficial to the patient, by reducing their length of hospital stay and anxiety. However, currently there is no adequate testing modality in use at the moment that can quickly and accurately diagnose the presence of a tumour on a surgical specimen. At present the patient would need a second procedure using vacuum assisted excision to retrieve specimens. The advantage of this study is the ability to study the pathological characteristics, using a molecular diagnostic tool, in the setting of the clinical management of patients with breast cancer to determine whether they benefit from this technology in the setting of clinical care. It is not a pre-defined research trial and will be open for up to ten years. The study aims to recruit 500 patients aged 18 years and above presenting with a clinical diagnosis of a breast cancer primary and subsequently managed in the breast surgeons clinics at St James's University Hospital and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTWH). Patients of all stages and with multifocal disease may be eligible to enter this study. Patients with locally recurrent disease or metastatic disease will be excluded. The patients will be followed up for 3 years and the data will allow us to assess the efficacy of this diagnostic test as well as",

            "That's a great idea. \n\n1. The prevalence and prognostic factors of invasive fibroma of the abdominal wall\nAbstract:\nBackground: Invasive fibroma of the abdominal wall (IFAW), which is also known as aggressive fibromatosis (AF), has a high recurrence rate due to the aggressive biological behavior of the tumor. Previous studies have shown that IFAW has a wide range of clinical presentations with various histopathological features. However, the epidemiology and long\u2010term prognosis of IFAW are not well understood. Thus, further investigation is required to identify the predictive factors for recurrence and to define optimal treatment strategies. Methods: In this study, 108 patients with IFAW were included and followed up for a median of 142 months (range, 2\u2010273). Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment strategies, and recurrence were analyzed. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify predictive factors for recurrence. Results: The overall local control rate and distant metastasis\u2010free survival at 5 and 10 years were 80.8% (65/81) and 78.0% (36/46), respectively. Tumor thickness \u22656 cm at presentation was associated with a poor local control rate with an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.60 (95% CI, 1.44\u201014.61, P = 0.008). On univariate analysis, younger age (< 65 years), female sex, and a shorter follow\u2010up period were negatively associated with the local control rate. On multivariate analysis, tumor thickness \u22656 cm was the only predictive factor for local recurrence. No association was found between treatment modality and local control rate (HR, 3.87; 95% CI, 0.76\u201019.8, P = 0.114). In addition, all IFAW patients had a 10\u2010year overall survival rate of 74.4%. Conclusions: IFAW appears to be an indolent disease with an excellent overall survival rate in most patients. However, tumor thickness is an important baseline factor that is associated with local recurrence",
            "That's a good suggestion. We can compare the clinical characteristics, follow-up outcomes, and costs of surgical treatment with the control group to understand the effectiveness and safety of this treatment option. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Biosimilar drugs are generally considered to be similar to their originator products, with comparable efficacy and safety. However, there have been limited reports comparing the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of different types of biosimilars. The aim of this study was to compare the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of bevacizumab and biosimilars in the treatment of non\u2010small cell lung cancer. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on a multi\u2010center prospective cohort study of advanced NSCLC patients who received at least two cycles of first\u2010line treatment with bevacizumab or biosimilar drugs in the Shanghai Cancer Center from June 2016 to December 2018. Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression\u2010free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed in patients treated with bevacizumab and biosimilars (Avecizumab, Teva Biosimilars/MSD China). The immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of bevacizumab and biosimilars were compared. RESULTS: 78 patients receiving bevacizumab and 78 patients receiving Avecizumab were included in this study. Compared with bevacizumab, there was no significant difference in the ORR and DCR of Avecizumab. The median PFS of patients receiving bevacizumab/Avecizumab was 4.9/9.5 months, and the median OS of patients receiving bevacizumab/Avecizumab was 17.8/19.0 months, with no significant difference between the two groups. Although the incidence of ADA positive was increased in patients receiving bevacizumab, there was no significant difference in the incidence of anti\u2010drug antibody formation between bevacizumab and Avecizumab. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups",

It includes exercise training, education, risk factor modification, healthy lifestyle counseling, and stress management. However, the effectiveness of CR varies depending on the program and patient characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of tele\u2010CR (TCR) in individuals with cardiovascular disease (CV) in comparison with an onsite program. Methods: Fifty participants with cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to a 12\u2010week TCR group or an onsite CR group. The exercise training component of TCR consisted of home\u2010based exercising using a fitness monitor and virtual meetings. Demographic data, physical activity, risk factor modification, and quality of life were evaluated at baseline, four weeks and twelve weeks. Results: There was a significant difference in mean heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) after four and twelve weeks of exercise compared with baseline. There were no statistically significant changes in the percentage of high\u2010density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, Body Mass Index (BMI), and quality of life after four and twelve weeks. After four and twelve weeks of intervention, the TCR group had fewer low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (<100 mg/dl) than the onsite group (n1=13 vs n2=7) (p<0.05). Additionally, the TCR group had fewer moderate\u2010 or high\u2010risk CV factors than the exercise\u2010control group (p<0.05). Conclusions: We found that TCR was superior to an onsite CR program in terms of reducing CV risk factors. Further studies will be needed to evaluate the long\u2010term effects of TCR on cardiovascular risk factors and patient outcomes."

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in four Italian hospitals. Women from two hospitals were randomly assigned to individual and group mental coaching or the control. The groups were balanced on age, family history of BC, presence of comorbidity, social\u2010economic conditions and self\u2010evaluation of QoL (SF\u201036). The coaching consisted of psychoeducation and the use of mental imagery. Women treated at two other hospitals served as controls. They filled out a questionnaire at the beginning and at six weeks and Q\u2010swb for breast cancer was calculated at the beginning, discharge and six weeks. RESULTS: The sample included 56 women randomly allocated to mental coaching (individual n=27; group n=29). QoL of patients undergoing group coaching was significantly and positively influenced by improvement in Q\u2010swb scores related to the symptom \"fear of recurrence of breast cancer\" at both times (from 3.92\u00b11.87 to 6.52\u00b11.74; p=0.001, d=1.27) and \"feelings of insecurity and uncertainty\" (from 10.66\u00b13.57 to 15.28\u00b15.14; p=0.003, d=1.51) after six weeks.

This arm will help us assess the impact of a low flavonoid diet on maternal mental health, cognition, and blood pressure compared to a high flavonoid diet. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nMany pregnant mothers experience anxiety and mood swings during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This study aims to investigate the effects of a high flavonoid diet on maternal mental health, cognitive function, and blood pressure.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground: Many pregnant mothers experience anxiety and mood swings during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Various studies have shown that maternal mental health, cognitive function, and blood pressure can affect fetal and neonatal outcomes. Flavonoids, a group of naturally occurring compounds found in fruits, vegetables, tea, and chocolate, have been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Some flavonoids, such as cocoa flavanols and tea polyphenols, have been shown to improve cognitive function and blood pressure regulation in healthy adults. In addition, a recent pilot study found that a high flavonoid diet improved maternal mental health during pregnancy. Objectives: In our study, we aim to investigate the effects of a high flavonoid diet on maternal mental health, cognitive function, and blood pressure. Methodology: This study will be a randomized controlled trial. Approximately 80 pregnant mothers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The high flavonoid group will receive a daily flavonoid supplement containing 1000 mg of cocoa flavanols and 500 mg of tea polyphenols. The low flavonoid group will receive a daily flavonoid supplement containing 5 mg of cocoa flavanols and 25 mg of tea polyphenols. Maternal mental health, cognitive function, and blood pressure will be assessed at baseline, mid-pregnancy, and postpartum. Primary outcome measures: Maternal mental health (using the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) Cognitive function (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Stroop Color-Word Test)",

This arm will allow us to compare the effects of both an enhanced diet (in either the high flavonoid or low flavonoid group) to standard care on maternal mental health, cognition, and blood pressure. \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if a dietary supplement for pregnant women can improve maternal mental health and cognition, and reduce blood pressure, compared to standard care. Specifically, the study aims to: Enroll 120 pregnant women and track their mental health, cognition, and blood pressure before and after intervention. Divide the participants into 3 groups: a high flavonoid diet group, a low flavonoid diet group, and a control group. Each group will receive a different intervention for 8 weeks. Compare the results of the 3 groups to determine the effectiveness of the dietary supplement on maternal mental health, cognition, and blood pressure.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe primary outcome of the study is maternal mental health as measured by the Edinburgh Depression Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The secondary outcome measures are cognition, as assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and blood pressure, as measured by the Sphygmomanometer. The study involves a pre-intervention assessment, 8-weeks of intervention and a post-intervention assessment. During the intervention, participants in the high flavonoid diet group will receive a daily protein supplement containing flavonoid-rich ingredients, such as dark chocolate, blueberries, and green tea. Participants in the low flavoronoid diet group will receive a daily protein supplement containing low-flavonoid ingredients, such as white chocolate and blueberries without the skin.

            "Okay, and what is the duration of each treatment group? \n\nAbstract:\nStudy Objectives: Cognitive deficiencies and negative behaviour are common in autism and autistic patients with intellectual disabilities are likely to be inadequately supported at school. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of training on the ability to transfer learned skills to a different environment and the ability to generalise learned skills to other similar tasks and to improve negative behaviour. Methods: We are comparing a Cognitive behaviour training approach, in which patients are trained to complete a complex task, with two single interventions. The first is a multisensory, interactive, computer\u2010mediated activity where children are asked to touch, grasp, roll and hold a ball and to select specific colours. The second is a more general interactive, computer\u2010mediated activity, in which patients are asked to match balls with different images. Patients will be divided into two groups. After the initial training period, the intervention will be randomly allocated. The follow\u2010up will take place after three and eight weeks of intervention. We intend to enrol more than 90 participants in total, aged 4\u201318 years and with a diagnosis of autism and a significant cognitive impairment. Discussion: The primary outcome will be the ability to transfer acquired skills to a new environment, secondary outcomes will include the improvement in generalising learned skills to a similar task and overall behaviour management of the participant. Conclusion: The findings of our study will have considerable implications for the design of interventions for autism spectrum disorders. In our opinion, this study represents a unique contribution to the literature on learning and cognitive deficiency in autism.",

            "OK, so this trial compares the use of technology to manage hypertension, along with standard care, versus standard care alone. Is that correct? \n\nAbstract:\nBackground: In the United States, only 30% of blood pressure measurements occur in healthcare facilities and 75% of patient blood pressure measurements occur in clinics or hospitals rather than at home. This contributes to the current paradigm of clinic blood pressure being higher than home blood pressure. We designed a mobile patient monitoring program that uses a digital solution in conjunction with standard care to lower blood pressure. Methods: The aim of the program is a 20% improvement in the 3\u2010month median systolic blood pressure measured in an Ambulatory Care Testing (ACT). Patients with prehypertension, Stage 0\u20101 hypertension, or Stage 2 hypertension are randomized to either receive standard care alone or in conjunction with a digital solution that connects users to healthcare professionals and facilitates patient self\u2010care. A digital solution consists of a connected app, scale, and cuff. The scale connects wirelessly to the mobile application and then to a user\u2010friendly dashboard, which is a web application through which healthcare professionals monitor patient progress, as well as provide real\u2010time care advice across all stages of treatment. Randomization is stratified by baseline blood pressure (<140 mmHg systolic, 140 mmHg to 159 mmHg systolic, and >=160 mmHg systolic). The patients and physicians involved in the project are located in South Korea. The results of the trial will be published in a scientific forum. A pilot with 30 participants per strategy group is being executed. Discussion: We anticipate that this project will improve hypertension care by using technology in the form of a digital solution and connected health. The trial will validate whether digital solutions augment the efficacy of standard care.",

How is enrollment progressing? \nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThis study aims to conduct a phase 2 randomized, multicenter study to explore the effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with congenital heart disease under investigation for possible transplantation. The primary endpoint of the study will be to evaluate the frequency of viral infections in patients receiving IVIG compared to the frequency of viral infections in patients receiving standard treatment. The secondary end points are all-cause mortality, the incidence of infections not caused by viruses and the occurrence of acute rejection of the heart transplant.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThe investigators will randomize a cohort of 120 patients \u03b2:2 (60 patients in each group) to receive either intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as treatment (intervention group \u0391) or standard care (control group B) at 1:1. The patients will be evaluated daily in the hospital, up to the time of transplantation. In particular, the investigators will evaluate the appearance of any cardiovascular or non-cardiac complications for 30 days after transplantation, and in case of cardiac-related complications or re-hospitalization, the investigators will evaluate the status of the recipient, the graft function, and the graft biopsy. The investigators will also monitor the results of biomarkers of inflammation or markers of vascular and immune dysfunction, namely: soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), soluble vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), thrombomodulin (TM), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).

It shows typical skin lesions on the upper extremities and sometimes on the neck and trunk. The most common feature in GAE involves guttate lesions, which are red, scaly plaques with small crusted cracks. Patients with GAE often complain of disproportionately painful, burning, itching, and sometimes even pruritus. The use of oral retinoids in the past was considered the standard first\u2010line therapy of GAE, although corticosteroids and various newer biologics were also reported to show efficacy. There is no single therapy that has been studied or approved for GAE. We hope to conduct a placebo\u2010controlled trial to evaluate the effect of remibrutinib for GAE in a phase 3 setting. This report is a planned research. Methods: The study will have two open\u2010label phases followed by a double\u2010blind randomized trial. The safety and preliminary efficacy will be assessed in the open\u2010label phase I. This will be followed by a randomized double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled phase. The planned sample size is 176. 78 healthy subjects will be randomized to receive either remibrutinib (Arm 1: 70mg capsule orally once per day (QD), Arm 2: rembrutinib 70mg capsule orally twice a day [BID] after a breakfast and dinner, Arm 3: rembarutinib 25mg capsule orally QD, and Arm 4: rembrutinib 25mg capsule orally BID), which will be escalated from 4mg QD to 25mg in Phase 2. Omolizumab was a monoclonal antibody for interleukin\u20105 (IL\u20105), which was approved by the FDA in 2014 for severe eosinophilic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria.

            "Let's discuss the recruitment strategy to ensure sufficient and relevant participant sampling. \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a potentially debilitating skin disease characterized by chronic, pruritic hives that can persist for months or even years. Approximately 1%\u20102% of the adult population is affected by CSU, and it is often preceded by the more acute form of urticaria, acute urticaria. Remibrutinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with oral bioavailability, shows greater selectivity for Janus kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/2) compared with other janus kinases (JAK3 and JAK TYK2), tyrosine kinase 2 (Abl2), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3). These kinases play a role in the pathophysiology of urticaria through the JAK3/STAT pathway and immune complex\u2013mediated pathways. Therefore, we conducted a phase 3b trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of remibrutinib as an oral treatment for pruritic hives in participants with CSU, in which remibrutinib was administered in both monotherapy and in combination with omalizumab.METHODS: This was a phase 3b, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted in adults with CSU, defined as urticaria with or without angioedema that had been present for\u00a0\u22653 months with wheals lasting\u00a0\u226524 hours. Participants were randomized to receive remibrutinib 25 mg (as two 12.5\u2010mg tablets) or matching placebo twice daily (b.i.d.), either as the only active medication or in addition to omalizumab (300 mg/month, subcutaneous injections). Following an initial 24\u2010week treatment period, a 6\u2010week maintenance period with placebo treatment was followed by a 16\u2010 or 24\u2010week extension period in which all active treatment arms were switched to remibrutinib b.i.d. in combination with om",

An epidemiological study showed that the occurrence of CRC is strongly related to diet, especially to high dietary calories and fat intake. The relationship between inflammatory factors and CRC is still controversial. According to previous studies, an increase in serum inflammatory-related indexes is related to poor prognosis in CRC patients. Therefore, the study aims to demonstrate the relationship between serum inflammatory-related indexes and disease outcomes in Chinese CRC patients.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignant tumor worldwide, and it accounts for about 10% of the incidence of malignant tumors every year. The incidence of CRC is higher in developed regions, and with the improvement of living standards and changes in eating habits, the incidence of CRC is increasing in developing regions . The incidence and mortality of CRC in China have also risen rapidly in the past decade , and it has become a health and medical problem that endangers human health. The occurrence of CRC (mainly CRC in the left colon at present) is strongly related to dietary patterns (such as high dietary energy and fat intake) . Inflammatory cells, cytokines and acute phase reactants in serum in patients with CRC are positively correlated with adverse clinical outcomes . The results of animal experiments confirmed that a high-fat diet could induce intestinal inflammation and intestinal tumors . Inflammatory factors play an important role in the occurrence and development of CRC. They can promote the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells, promote angiogenesis, and inhibit apoptosis, ultimately leading to the malignant progression of CRC . Previous studies have also shown that high dietary fat intake and dietary energy intake are associated with CRC risk . The risk of CRC increases with the increase of dietary fat intake. The reason for increased CRC risk may be that dietary fat intake increases the risk of protracted inflammation in colon epithelial cells or even increases the risk of"

This makes daily activities difficult and can impact quality of life. Many individuals with cervical dystonia take Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA). Botox is effective in reducing muscle spasms, but some individuals have difficulty controlling their facial expressions. We wanted to explore a new way to treat cervical dystonia, with fewer side effects. METHODS: At a neurologist's office, 10 adults with cervical dystonia received an injection of 100 units of botulinum toxin in their necks for six weeks. Participants maintained a diary of their symptoms, and the researchers assessed the patient's improvement at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks.RESULTS: Overall, 10 patients enrolled in the study, 3 of whom dropped out due to discomfort or poor results. Participants 4, 5, and 6 withdrew from the study due to poor symptom control. A total of seven patients completed treatment. One patient had a temporary change in her facial expressions. Three patients were slightly bothered, but no significant side effects were reported. There were no cases of swallowing difficulty.CONCLUSIONS: It took about a week for the Botox injections to reach their maximum effect. This approach to injecting may reduce the likelihood of swallowing complications. This is a new technique that we are currently refining. We will conduct a larger study to determine whether this approach is effective for those with cervical dystonia.",

One hundred and nineteen patients with NYHA functional class III or IV heart failure were randomized 1:1 to either 60 mg ibudil (n = 59) or 0.9% normal saline (NS; n = 60) for up to 12 weeks. Primary efficacy variables were time to clinical worsening, defined as unplanned hospitalization for decompensated heart failure, or death from cardiac cause.RESULTS: The ibudil group showed a trend toward improved time to clinical events (416+/\u2010458 vs. 345+/\u2010391 days; P = .08). The ibudil group had a shorter length of hospital stay compared with NS (26.8+/\u201025.5 vs. 28.1+/\u201036.9 days; P = .24) and time to hospitalization after unplanned visits (P = .007), compared with NS. CPK was significantly higher in the fibinolysis\u2010related group (P = .01). Two patients in the ibudil group and two patients in the NS group had nonfatal myocardial infarction. No significant differences were seen for cardiac endpoints and mortality. There was a trend toward more dysrhythmias in the NS group. Cardiac safety outcomes were similar to those reported previously in studies of high\u2010dose and short\u2010term ibudil administration.CONCLUSIONS: Ibudil does not reduce time to clinical events in patients with CRCHF. However, it appears to reduce length of hospital stay and early rehospitalization in the presence of low clinical risk. Ibudil also offers safety and tolerability comparable with NS. Further evaluation for the efficacy of ibudil in selected groups such as patients with NYHA functional class III heart failure or those with cardiac dysrhythmias is warranted."

What do you think? \n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe overall purpose of this study is to assess the clinical utility of the Q-Sertai (sertraline) algorithm for early detection and management of depression in primary care. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the algorithm compared to a standard of care algorithm. This proposed study is an investigator initiated, 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial of the sertraline algorithm (treatment) compared to standard care provided by the primary care provider (usual care). Approximately 216 adult participants experiencing chronic primary care depression, defined as a score of 10 or higher on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at a screening visit, and a clinical visit within the previous 12 months, will be recruited from 10 primary care clinics in the United States and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the sertraline algorithm or usual care treatment during the 4-week evaluation period and for 8 weeks after, if treatment is needed. All participants will be enrolled in a 3-month follow-up for the final 8 weeks of the study and asked to complete questionnaires and provide blood samples.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBackground Research has shown that primary care is the most common initial point of health care entry for the vast majority of chronic depression cases in the United States. The majority of adults with chronic depression are not screened for depressive symptoms, and those who are identified can experience significant delays in care. This study will evaluate the sertraline algorithm for early detection and treatment of depression in primary care, an algorithm which is based on a validated depression questionnaire. The algorithm takes around one minute to administer and has two options for depression diagnosis and treatment. If a participant is diagnosed with depression, the algorithm immediately prescribes sertraline at a low dose and has the participant return to their primary care provider for evaluation.

            "How is Gelofusin designed to be used in the treatment of pressure ulcers? \n\nMethods\n=================\nThis is a randomised control trial aimed at 70 patients divided into two groups with 35 patients in each group. One group will be given Gelofusin, whereas the other group will serve as a control. Treatment with Gelofusin will begin after cleaning the wound and debridement.\nPatients will be evaluated at baseline, then on the 4th, 8th, and 12th days of application.\nThe wound area and depth will be evaluated, and wound closure will also be evaluated using a digital photography system.\n\nDetailed Description\n=================\nStudy Plan Gelofusin for the treatment of pressure ulcers Pressure ulcers (or bedsores) are among the most important medical problems of patients admitted to hospitals. Bedsores often become a complication following bedridden or long-term sitting due to coma or spinal cord injury. Prevalence is reported to be between 5% and 37%. Due to the prevalence, it can take the form of a silent epidemic. Most of the drugs used in the treatment of pressure ulcers are local anti-inflammatory agents such as zinc sulfate. In addition, some studies have shown that the use of these types of drugs can accelerate wound healing. Gelofusin is a synthetic low-molecular-weight haemoperfusin (fibrin glue) containing protamine and has a fibrin-like structure. It is thought to remove toxic substances and increase the activity of antiproteases by binding to cationic toxins, activating angiogenesis and stimulating fibroblast migration and proliferation, while accelerating the synthesis and release of collagen. Gelofusin has been used in the treatment of pressure ulcers in adult patients. To date, the efficacy of Gelofusin in the treatment of pressure ulcers has not been completely proven. To date, only 3 similar studies have been reported and no study has been conducted on the efficacy of Gelofusin in the treatment of pressure ulcers in paediatric age groups. The primary outcome of this work is to investigate whether topical application of Gelofusin speeds up the healing of pressure ulcers in children. In addition",

            "Sure! We can include control groups for comparison. For example, we could use traditional dental implants or titanium frameworks as control groups to see if there are any differences or advantages in using the PEKK framework. As for variations of the intervention, we could potentially explore different types of PEKK frameworks. For instance, we could compare different sizes or shapes of the PEKK framework, or incorporate different surface textures to see if they affect bone integration or patient comfort. It's also worth considering the use of different materials such as other biocompatible materials for the framework or alternative approaches for dental reconstruction. These modifications can help us understand the potential benefits and limitations of the PEKK framework, and optimize its design and effectiveness. Let me know what you think about these suggestions. \n\nAbstract:\nTo evaluate the outcomes of the experimental study arm, we can use a variety of assessment methods. Clinical and radiographic examinations can be performed to assess the stability, function, and health of the implants and adjacent tissues. We can also evaluate patient\u2010reported outcomes such as satisfaction, pain, and quality of life using validated surveys or questionnaires. Other methods may include histological analysis of biopsy samples, biomechanical testing of the framework, or evaluation of the tissue integration by measuring the bone density or bone\u2010to\u2010implant contact (BIC). The choice of assessment methods will depend on the specific outcomes we want to evaluate, as well as the resources and feasibility of the study. It's important to select methods that are reliable, valid, and relevant to the research question and objectives. By using multiple methods, we can obtain comprehensive and objective information about the effectiveness and safety of the PEKK framework, and maximize the credibility and impact of our findings.",

A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the utility of the CGM technology in an integrated preoperative assessment clinic for diabetes mellitus (DMC) patients. Participants with diabetes (n = 40) were randomized to two study arms: CGM technology or standard preoperative care. In the CGM group the patient wore a CGM device continuously throughout their hospital stay and in the standard care group the patient received standard preoperative care for glucose management. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants with blood sugar levels within the target range (70\u2010180 mg/dL) at 3\u2010hours postoperatively. Other endpoints included blood sugar levels and glucose management interventions during the perioperative period, and adverse events related to the use of CGM. Results: The overall use of CGM technology was feasible and effective in achieving optimal perioperative glycemic control.

It's important to note that since this is an open-label study, there won't be a control group receiving a placebo or standard of care treatment. This design choice is justified by ethical considerations, as all patients in the trial have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic idiopathic dermal hypersensitivity reaction, and withholding treatment could be harmful to their health. Additionally, previous studies may have already established the safety and efficacy of dupilumab, making it unnecessary to include a placebo group.",

            "The ideal frequency of the semi-structured interviews will depend on a few factors. It's important to consider the nature of the interviews, the duration of the study, and the availability and scheduling preferences of the participants. Based on these considerations, conducting semi-structured interviews at regular intervals throughout the study may be optimal. This approach would allow us to capture a broader range of perspectives and experiences during the patient's treatment journey. \nHowever, it's essential to find a balance between the frequency of interviews and the burden placed on the participants. We should aim to strike a balance between obtaining meaningful data and not overburdening the participants. One approach could be to conduct interviews initially and then at key points during the study (e.g., after the first treatment, at the end of first line treatment, after surgery, after adjuvant, etc.). This way, we can capture the patient's experiences and feedback at different stages of their treatment journey. We can also modify the frequency or timing of the interviews based on participant feedback and the progress of the study.\nUltimately, the decision on the frequency of semi-structured interviews will depend on the study objectives, participant feedback, and the availability of resources.

In addition, it has been reported that RT may potentially aid in the prevention of obesity in older adults and that RT could be considered as an effective approach to delay disability in these individuals. Thus, exercise offers the potential to improve physical performance and prevent loss of muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older individuals.\nFalls are common in older adults, and they are the leading cause of accidental injury and death worldwide. In Portugal, it was estimated that 30% of older adults fall at least once every year. Among the various types of exercise modalities, the combination of strength training, aerobic exercise, and stretching is recommended for older people. Studies have shown that resistance exercise training is safe and well-tolerated in a broad range of individuals. However, its efficacy has not yet been fully elucidated.\nThe aim of the current study was to determine preliminary efficacy indices and safety of the Resistance Exercise Training Program for Older Adults (REPON\u2010OA) using VIVIFRAIL\u00ae, a validated, low-cost home-based training program, to reduce risk factors and maintain functional capacity in adults ages 60 years and above.\nParticipants\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (protocol number:\u00a02.688.990).

            "Excellent. Now, let's discuss the objectives and hypotheses of the study. What are the primary and secondary objectives of the study? \n\nIntroduction\nAging has been linked to a loss of muscle mass and function, leading to a phenomenon known as sarcopenia. While sarcopenia is not a disease, it increases the risk of death, disability, and frailty in older adults. It is estimated that the prevalence of sarcopenia will increase substantially in the next 30 years due to increasing life expectancy and a rapidly growing aging population. According to the World Health Organization, falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, with 646,000 individuals aged 60 and older dying as a result. Additionally, as sarcopenia progresses, these falls may result in life-long functional decline. Furthermore, frailty and falls are estimated to be responsible for up to 50% of nursing home admissions in older adults.\nSarcopenia is characterized by a progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and function that leads to the impairment of activities of daily living (ADLs) and increasing the likelihood of disability in older people. A decline in both muscle strength and physical performance in aging is well-known, but recent research suggests that the loss of skeletal muscle function begins much earlier, which is even more severe. Additionally, it is suggested that people who lose muscle mass will need more intensive management over time to prevent the development of sarcopenia and frailty. Aging affects the entire body, but it is especially pronounced in the elderly. Sarcopenia is associated with a decline in cognitive function, physical activity (PA), and quality of life (QOL) in older adults. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that exercise has a role in improving cognitive functionality, PA levels, and QOL. Therefore, the American College of Sports Medicine, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, and the American College of Endocrinology have emphasized the significant role of aerobic exercise on cognitive functions, which highlights the need to implement intervention programs that promote PA to maintain QOL and mental health.\nExercise therapy is considered an important intervention in the management of sarcopenia. In 2019, the American College of Sports Medicine, the European Network for Investigation and Therapy of Sarcopenia"

The most important question for clinicians to address is: Could I safely substitute a single anti\u2010PD\u20101 agent (atezolizumab or nivolumab) rather than the combination of a PD\u20101 and a CTLA\u20104 monoclonals to improve efficacy and reduce toxicities? The preliminary analysis from CheckMate 067 demonstrated that Atezolizumab + Dacarbazine (ATD) had 38% pts ORR compared with 51% ORR with Dacarbazine plus Ipilimumab (D + I). D + I was associated with a significantly increased risk of grade 3/4 G3 toxicities, including pneumonitis (7.5%), colitis (0%), GI fistula (0%), GI hemorrhage (0%), and pancreatitis (9%). The incidence of grade 3/4 skin toxicity with Atezolizumab is lower than nivolumab or ipilimumab, therefore, substitution of atezolizumab was associated with reduced risk of G3/4 toxicities. Based on these data, we conducted our trial to evaluate Atezolizumab + Dacarbazine (ATD) against D + I in the first\u2010line treatment of advanced melanoma. Methods: In an open\u2010label, multicenter, randomized, phase II study, we investigate the clinical difference between ATD and D + I in the first\u2010line treatment of advanced melanoma. All patients will receive the assigned treatment for up to 4 cycles then continued to receive Atezolizumab monotherapy until PD or intolerable toxic effect.

All biopsies will be performed under local anesthesia and sedation, as per standard clinical practice. \n\nIntervention/Treatment: Procedure: Conventional biopsy \n- The use of endobronchial forceps under local anesthesia during standard bronchoscopy. The procedure will be performed in accordance with current guidelines, taking into account the patient's age, comorbidities, and risk of complications.The main limitation of standard bronchoscopy is the inability to perform visual assessment of peripheral airways for diagnosis. \n\nThe control arm will help to better understand the diagnostic yield of peripheral airway biopsy compared to conventional bronchoscopy, as well as provide information on the diagnostic yield of conventional bronchoscopy.",

The aim was to reduce the contamination of microorganisms that cause respiratory diseases and to demonstrate the impact on the clinical and bacteriological diagnosis of RTIs. All ambulatory patients consulting for acute RTIs were included. They were randomly assigned into three groups: control group (C), disinfecting mouthwash group (D), and disinfecting toothbrush group (T), who were given a brush with a disinfection gel or a mouthwash to rinse with for seven days, respectively. The total number of microorganisms (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M.catarrhalis/oral streptococci group) recovered from nasopharyngeal swabs was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and clinical outcome was assessed at follow\u2010up by a physician blinded to diagnosis and treatment. Three hundred seventy\u2010five patients were included in the study and 67.1% were infected, but only 9.4% were considered clinical infections at baseline. However, 62.1% of the patients recovered at day 10 compared to 45.1, 50.2, and 52.4% for T, D, and C, respectively. The bacteriological clearance was 22.5% with D, 10.7% with T and 13.9% with the C. After seven days of treatment, PCR showed that 5.2% of the patients with pneumonia harbored S. pneumoniae and that the risk of pneumonia associated with the presence of MRSA in the nasopharyngeal was highly significant (OR=10.63; 95% CI: 1.76\u201064.60; p=0.012).

DESIGN: A randomized, open\u2010label clinical trial was designed for 80 male and female patients undergoing major open elective colorectal surgery, aged over 60 years and ASA class I or II, at the Hospital Cl\u00ednic in Barcelona, with planned overnight stay of at least 48 hours. Patients were randomized using a randomized block generator, with simple blinding and 1:1 allocation ratio, into two groups: those receiving the night\u2010time use of an air\u2010cooled gel pillow with a cool gel surface and those using a standard, flat pillow that remained closed. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of patients' comfort as reflected by the General Comfort Scale scores at 12 and 72 hours. Assessment of postoperative outcomes, as well as patient sleep quality, evaluated by the Richmond Campbell Sleep Scale, were also performed. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 73.66\u00b15.41 years in the gel\u2010pillow group and 74.06\u00b16.09 years in the standard\u2010pillow group.

            "[DESIGN]\n\nA randomised, double-blinded crossover study\n\nAbstract:\nOBJECTIVE: Exercise has been shown to improve memory processing speed (MPS) in healthy elderly, which is important as reduced MPS is an early sign of pre\u2010Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (AD) and has been shown to be associated with cognitive decline. The aim was to examine the effect of different aerobic exercise intensities on MPS in healthy older adults.METHODS: Eligible participants were non\u2010AD\u2010demented elderly (> 55 years) with a Mini\u2010Mental State Examination < 23. They were randomized to 12 weeks of home\u2010 based training with either low\u2010impact step machine 50 min/day, three\u20104 times/week 60\u201070 % of heart rate maximum, (LITE), or low\u2010load resistance training 45 min/day, three\u20104 times/week. Pre\u2010 and posttraining, MPS was measured using the Stroop test, and cognition was assessed using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).RESULTS: A total of 60 participants (mean age 71.9\u00b15.8 years (SD), 90% women) were included and analyzed. MPS improved in both groups after intervention (all p < 0.02), more so for the cognitive and colour\u2010word tests in the LITE\u2010group. Corrected scores on the colour\u2010word test increased with 1.68 (p = 0.02) and 1.46 points (p = 0.05), respectively. Uncorrected scores increased with 3.1 and 3.02 points, respectively, in the LITE\u2010 and REX\u2010group (all p < 0.02). The RBANS total, visuospatial/construction, and memory index improved significantly in both groups (p < 0.05), as well as overall cognitive score and language. No effect of intervention was demonstrated on psychomotor speed and executive function.CONCLUSIONS: Exercise improved MPS in non\u2010AD\u2010demented elderly, and further increase was seen with LITE. Our findings indicate that exercise might improve basic cognitive function, but may",

The experimental condition will consist of listening to a 40-minute music intervention, while the control condition will entail listening to a 40-minute neutral background sound. The music intervention will be designed and selected based on participants' musical preferences. The control condition will involve listening to a neutral background sound, such as the sound of rain or a waterfall. Participants will be randomized to either the experimental or the control condition. The study will be conducted at the UAB Comprehensive AIDS Center in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nInvestigate the efficacy of music-based interventions for mood and stress reduction in people with HAND. HAND often causes difficulty with the attention domain, but there is little understanding of which cognitive systems are impaired in HAND patients. Additionally, the effects of neuropsychological interventions targeting specific cognitive domains on patients' everyday functioning are unknown. Music is known to activate several brain areas, including those involved in mood regulation, motor control, and emotion recognition. Moreover, many people find music to be a soothing and relaxing experience that can help them cope with stress and enhance their mood. It is, therefore, possible that music-based interventions could help to manage HAND symptoms. The proposed study seeks to test the efficacy of music-based interventions on emotion recognition and motor control in people with HAND. 92 adults with HAND will be recruited from the UAB Comprehensive AIDS Center in Birmingham, Alabama. All participants will undergo a 1-hour neuropsychological assessment that will assess their executive functioning, attention, language, memory, mood, and stress levels. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the music intervention or the control condition. Participants in the music intervention group will be asked to listen to a 40-minute playlist of their choosing. Participants in the control condition will be asked to listen to a 40-minute neutral background sound, such as the sound of rain or a waterfall, to control for the non-specific effects of auditory stimulation",

Can you tell me more about the intervention or the study treatment in detail? \n\n2022-09_002234\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nMalnutrition, an important problem in diabetic patients, is defined as loss of muscle mass, reduction of body weight, and loss of function. Malnutrition is also associated with poorer prognoses in these patients. This can lead to inadequate nutritional status, loss of appetite, low food intake, and increased protein catabolism, all of which can worsen glucose management and metabolic control. The purpose of the present clinical trial is to examine the effect of oral nutritional therapy combined with calorie restriction on blood glucose levels in diabetic patients undergoing enteral nutrition treatment. Patients with Type 2 diabetes will be recruited for the study and will be assigned to receive either 1) oral nutritional supplement (ONS) plus calorie deficit diets or 2) the standard hypocaloric diet. Blood glucose levels will be measured at the beginning of the study and after 14 days.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Effect of Adding Oral Nutritional Supplement to Calorie-restricted Diet in Type 2 Diabetes Patients With Malnutrition: A Randomized, Open, Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nMalnutrition\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Dietary Supplement: Calorie deficit diets\n* Dietary Supplement: Oral nutritional supplement\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Type 2 diabetes Patients who consume oral nutritional supplements or insulin within the past two months Patients with blood sugar <200 mg/dL who underwent calorie-restricted dieting Patients with BMI <23 kg/m2 who have normal cognitive function and are able to self-administer a meal plan Exclusion Criteria: Type 1 diabetes and dementia Gastrostomy, surgery, or malignancy within the last 6 months",

The specific objectives of the study are to 1) determine the effects of HMB consumption on muscle protein synthesis and degradation following a single dose; 2) assess effects of HMB consumption on appetite, body composition, training performance, resting energy expenditure, mood, and food consumption in trained subjects while dieting while resistance training; 3) determine the effects of HMB consumption on body composition following the intervention.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nParticipants will undergo a preliminary screening visit to evaluate anthropometric and physical information at the completion of the screening, body composition will be measured by dual energy x-ray absorption (DXA). They will then undergo a visit to the laboratory for familiarization (i.e., learn about the equipment and procedures to be used while visiting the laboratory for data collection) and body composition assessment, as well as muscle anabolism assessment, which will be repeated (muscle samples during an intravenous infusion). Following familiarization with procedures, participants will consume their normal food intake and record intake until the next visit. During the second visit, participants will undergo the following: blood collection for testing blood composition, blood glucose, insulin, and serum free fatty acids (FFA's); a fasted blood draw to examine blood chemistries and blood constituents; intravenous insulin and arginine infusion; and muscle anabolism assessment. The investigators will calculate insulin sensitivity based on blood glucose and insulin measurements, and a muscle biopsy",

Methods: We conducted a single\u2010institute, retrospective review of elderly (age \u2265 70 years) patients who underwent elective pulmonary resection, excluding those with a pre\u2010existing history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial pneumonia. One hundred and one patients who were younger than 70 years of age were also randomly selected from the database as the control, using the block\u2010length method with a 2: 1 allocation ratio. We retrospectively analyzed several features of pulmonary complications between these groups, including the number of patients who had EPPCs and the specific complications in detail. Results: The median follow\u2010up time was 25.7 months in the younger and 14.5 months in the older groups. Twenty\u2010seven older patients developed EPPCs, 24 of whom (58.3%) showed an uncomplicated course, with the remaining 3 (7.8%) requiring re\u2010intubation. By comparison, 30 (30.8%) of the younger patients developed EPPCs, and 9 (18.5%) required re\u2010intubation for complications. Although older patients tended to have more EPPCs, these differences were not statistically significant. The percentage of patients with bronchopleural fistula (BPF) or air\u2010leak syndrome (ALS) was significantly lower in the older group (22.6% vs. 48.0%, P = 0.027). A trend toward a higher frequency of respiratory failure developed in older patients after surgery (5.33% vs. 25.03%, P = 0.059). Conclusion: Our results indicate that elderly patients have a high rate of severe EPPCs. These findings demonstrate the importance of proper management of older patients to prevent severe surgical complications.",

Can you provide me with the primary outcomes and secondary outcomes? \n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction: The incidence of lung cancer is on the rise, as is the rate of resection for lung lesions. However, lung cancer surgery, characterized by long operating time and significant blood loss, is always considered a major challenge. Although thoracoscopic surgical resection of lung lesions has gradually replaced the open resection of lung lesions, the surgical efficiency of thoracoscopic surgery is generally lower than that of open surgery because of technical difficulties caused by insufficient instruments and high dependence on the operating space for operation. In order to improve the surgical efficiency of thoracoscopic surgery, we designed an endocytic surgical robot system (ESSRS): an intelligent surgical robot system, and we hope to explore the value of this new surgical technique in the treatment of lung cancer. Methods: Thoracoscopic robotic lung surgery was performed on two patients who underwent segmentectomy with ESSRS; their surgical data and intraoperative hemodynamic indicators were collected and compared with the surgical data and intraoperative hemodynamic indicators of 12 patients who underwent conventional thoracoscopic lung surgery. Results: The operative time was (111 \u00b1 20) min for the 14 patients treated with ESSRS and (140 \u00b1 30) min for the 12 patients treated with conventional thoracoscopic surgery. The total blood loss in the two groups was (100 \u00b1 20) ml and (150 \u00b1 30) ml, respectively, P=0.019. The comparison of preoperative and postoperative lung function indicators showed that the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second of the two groups were significantly improved after operation (P<0.05). The forced expiratory volume in 1 second of the two groups was significantly improved after 3 months of operation (P<0.05) Conclusions: Compared with conventional thoracoscopic surgery, robotic lung surgery can be performed with better efficacy. It is worth noting that although robotic surgery can promote postoperative lung function recovery, the specific",

During RTS segmentectomy, the surgeon will use the Signia Stapler to assist in creating a clear view of the lung lobe and its surrounding structures. Specifically, the stapler will be utilized to cut and seal blood vessels and other tissue, resulting in more precision and control over the entire surgical process. This device is intended to reduce the risk of bleeding, improve surgical efficiency, and provide a higher level of precision and control compared to conventional surgical techniques that involve scissors and ligatures.The Da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend Energy Device with SureForm Stapling is a bipolar energy device that uses advanced technology to provide superior visualization and precision during RTS segmentectomy, reducing the risk of tissue trauma and damage to surrounding structures. Additionally, this device offers a range of surgical tools that allow for more flexibility and control during the surgical procedure, enabling the surgeon to achieve the desired outcome with greater accuracy and efficiency.The study will be conducted in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a single-site participation. The inclusion criteria for this study will include participants suffering from stage I, II, or IIIa non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are candidates for RTS segmentectomy with curative intent, as determined by their surgeon. Exclusion criteria will include patients with clinical evidence of distant metastases, incurable coagulopathy, systemic vascular disease or vasculitis, or other contraindications to thoracic surgery.Informed consent will be obtained from all participants prior to enrollment in the study.

(CAV). Design: Our cohort is composed of 98 men, followed up for at least 3 years. Inclusion criteria were: presence of CAV diagnosed during varicocele search, no obstruction in the testicular vas, normal FSH and LH blood levels, age 25\u201035, and azoospermia defined by testis biopsy and excluding Y chromosome carriers (SRY positive). Interventions: All patients underwent microscopic testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) to avoid sperm extraction trauma and possible risk of developing an orchitis. We analyzed the seminal parameters and performed epididymospherex in all patients; a second mTESE was performed for those who did not meet this criterion. Patients underwent sperm separation techniques after two mTESE. After IVF, we evaluated the development of the embryos, and transfer of 1 to 5 embryos was performed. All frozen embryo transfers were done without a transfer catheter. Main outcome measures: Azoospermia cure measured after sperm retrieval by mTESE through an anastomosis of the testicular artery to the epididymis. Results: At baseline, the patients had an average age of 31 years, with 86% of the patients being college graduates; the majority (94%) were single. The duration of follow\u2010up was 40.4 \u00b1 15 months. The average number of interventions was 2 per participant (1.3 mTESEs and 0.7 extraction of the epididymis). After epididymospherex, a cure rate of 93.8% was achieved. Of the 80 patients included in the embryo transfer cycle,"

We undertook a multicenter, randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, phase 4 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the peripherally acting, \u03b11 adrenergic antagonist doxazosin (4 mg once daily) in men with CNBP/CPPS and OAB symptoms (NCT04738826). Methods: Men aged 18\u201065 years with CNBP/CPPS and OAB signs/symptoms were enrolled in 20 sites in the United States. After a 2\u2010week screening period, patients were randomized with a 2:1 ratio to oral doxazosin 4 mg once daily versus matched placebo for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline in prostate symptom score (PSS) at week 12 with pain subscale. Secondary end points included changes from baseline in IPSS, IPSS quality of life, International Prostatics Symptom Score, and the proportion of men with complete resolution of voiding symptoms, based on an absolute decrease in IPSS of > = 3 compared with baseline, and men reporting no voiding symptoms. Results and Conclusions: Ninety\u2010two patients were randomized to doxazosin (n=63) and 39 to placebo. Baseline pain score in the doxazosin arm was 2.4 (median; range 1\u20103).

Methods: Consecutive female breast and axillary\u2010related malignant and benign patients, aged 18 years and older, who underwent complete removal of the tumor, the adjacent tissue, and/or the lymph nodes were assigned to be operated under general anesthesia (GA; n=50), spinal anesthesia (SA; n=50), and local anesthesia (LA; n=50). The quality of life and anxiety of each group were evaluated using the Generalized Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the State\u2010Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before surgery (preoperative), on the first postoperative day (POD1), 3rd postoperative day (POD3), and the 7th postoperative day (POD7). Also, 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery, the GHQ and STAI were again performed, and the pain using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was also evaluated. The postoperative pathological examination was evaluated at 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery. Then a comparison of the variables was made. Results: During the study, the GHQ and STAI scores during surgery did not differ between the groups (p> 0.05). In the 6th and 3rd month follow\u2010ups, on the other side, there were no differences in the physical disabilities score and the VAS score (p < 0.05). However, anxiety (p < 0.05) and the quality of life score (p < 0.05) showed significant differences in the physical and mental fields between patients who received general anesthesia and patients who received local anesthesia (p < 0.05).

In a previous study, an intravitreous injection of steroids and an intravitreous injection of anticancer drugs was proven safe and effective in diabetic macular edema subjects; However, the therapeutic effect is limited and repeated injection is required. The incidence of side effects such as posterior subcapsular cataracts and intravitreous fibrosis is on the rise and affects the visual prognosis of diabetic macular edema subjects in the future. Therefore, we plan to establish a combined 0.5% fluocinolone and 4mg ranibizumab intravitreous injection solution to reduce the number of repeated intravitreal injections, reduce the amount of drug and toxicity to the eye, reduce follow-up visits to improve patient compliance, and explore the safety of the drug. The application of this intravitreous injection solution will allow patients to receive targeted intravitreal injection therapy for diabetic macular edema, reduce the economic burden of patients, and allow patients to choose the best treatment option according to their own needs.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nThis is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 0.5% fluocinolone intraocular suspension and 4mg ranibizumab (Lucentis) were formulated into intravenous injection solutions by our drug manufacturing company. They are stored in a low-temperature refrigerator, and are used within a storage time of 72 hours. The efficacy was followed up for 24 weeks.

Some studies showed the correlation of the level of inflammatory cytokines with disease activity in SLE. Many studies investigated the level of inflammatory cytokines in patients of SLE as whole, or by organ involved. However, few previous studies explored the level of these cytokines in SLE patients with lupus headache and its correlation with disease activity.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nLupus headache remains the most common headache subtypes in patients of SLE. Previous study showed that SLE patients with lupus headache have more organ involvement than other SLE subgroups (i.e., arthritis, renal) and those patients with a high activity of headache tend to have more organ involvement than patients with a low activity. However, these results were not supported by a case-control study conducted by Sugimoto et al. Their research showed that lupus headache and organ involvement (especially renal involvement) are not correlated, there were 3 patients with renal involvement in their lupus headache group. Previous researches found that serum level of IL-6 in lupus headache group were significantly elevated than those in non- headache group. Kuwabara et al showed similar level of serum level of IL-6 in both headache group and no headache group. These studies found that serum level of IL-6 was not correlated with lupus headache. Kuwabara also found that IL-6 level has no correlation with disease activity, the patients in this study were divided into 2 groups according to the level of disease activity assessed by SLEDAI (SLE disease activity index), which might lead to underpowered or misclassified results. Thus, the role of inflammation in the etiology of this headache subtype is still obscure. Therefore, we designed this study to measure the levels of several inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6, IL8, IL23, IL-17, and TNF- \u03b1) in patients with lupus headache"

Assessment of adaptation is important because it provides valuable information about functioning in various areas of life. This study explores how individuals with autism (ASD) and ADHD or the combination (autism plus hyperactivity) perform on these measures of adaptation.METHOD: In this study, we will compare the ABAS\u20103 and ABAS\u20103:SE scores of 60 individuals with autism with the scores of a reference population. The ABAS\u20103 and ABAS\u20103:SE are administered in a research setting using a standardized procedure.RESULTS: The mean scores of both groups can vary significantly as a result of the severity of the condition and the influence of ADHD. However, the majority of the differences appear to be due to the presence of ADHD.CONCLUSION: We conclude that this study has further improved the accuracy of the scoring and interpretation of ABAS\u20103 and ABAS\u20103:SE scores in individuals with autism.",

Cryotherapy treatment is a simple, cost\u2010effective, and noninvasive method for treating warts. Cryotherapy, also known as cryosurgery, involves using extreme cold to freeze and destroy warts and preliminary studies showed that it is a safe and effective treatment. However, it was also shown that this treatment has a high recurrence rate. In order to better understand the factors associated with recurrence after cryotherapy and optimize treatment strategies, our study aims to evaluate the long\u2010term effect of cryotherapy in treating common and plantar cutaneous warts. We also aim to evaluate the association between sex, age, size and number of warts, duration of treatment and recurrence rate. This study is a prospective, single\u2010site, single\u2010arm, single\u2010investigator, observational study. Fifty patients with common or plantar cutaneous warts will undergo cryotherapy sessions every 2 weeks until complete clearance, with a maximum of six sessions. We will follow up with them at 3 months after treatment completion to check for any recurrence. The therapeutic efficacy will be evaluated by measuring the size and number of warts at different time points. The objective of this study is to evaluate the long\u2010term effect of cryotherapy in treating common and plantar cutaneous warts and to explore the factors associated with recurrence after cryotherapy treatment.",

We will also collect blood samples at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment to analyze serum Galectin-3 levels.

Although the incidence of GWs is unknown, there are an estimated 1 million new cases per year, and the average age of diagnosis is 25. The available data on this condition are limited, and few studies have been conducted to evaluate the factors associated with clearance and time to clearance of GWs. Thus, we aimed to conduct a pilot study to assess the predictors of clearance in patients with GWs. This observational, single\u2010center, pilot study included 50 patients who were treated with a combination of cryotherapy and topical piroxicam cream for up to 6 sessions. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the time needed for complete clearance of GWs. The baseline features and treatment outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The time to clearance and the factors associated with successful treatment outcomes were evaluated. Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were compared between the 2 groups, with a P value of 0.05 indicating statistical significance. P\u2010values from the univariate and multivariate analyses were compared using the chi\u2010square test. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were included in the final analysis, with an average age of 42.36 years. The mean number of GWs at baseline was 2.8 (range, 1\u201018), and the mean size of the lesions was 2.2 cm2.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of dual tracer technique (dye and radiocolloid) in detecting sentinel lymph node draining in melanoma.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were grouped into three based on the type of the tracers used during dual tracer technique of SLNB in melanoma. The sensitivity (ability to detect the sentinel lymph node) and false negative rate of the lymphoscintigraphy, blue dye, and dual tracer techniques for detecting sentinel lymph node were compared.RESULTS: Of 242 patients, 64, 72, and 106 patients received single tracer technique with lymphoscintigraphy, blue dye, and dual tracer technique of 99mTc sulfur colloid and isosulfan blue, respectively. The sensitivity of detecting sentinel lymph node was 100% in lymphoscintigraphy, 96.9% in blue dye and 95.3% in dual tracer technique which was not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: The dual tracer technique had better sensitivity in detecting sentinel lymph node draining in melanoma when compared to single tracer technique with lymphoscintigraphy or blue dye injection.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nLympho-scintigraphy is an important part of the SLNB procedure. It can accurately locate the first draining lymph node by identifying the region of maximal concentration of radioactivity around the injected tumor site. This method detects the metastatic involvement in sentinel lymph node by taking serial images and observing the lymph node for any increased activity. The false negative rate has been found to be more than one fourth of the negative sentinel lymph node procedures. On the other hand, the false negative rate of the",

Does that sound accurate? \n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND: Warts in 9 million Americans in 2001 and are an ongoing health concern. Objectives: Cryotherapy is the most common treatment modality used in dermatology to ablate superficial warts; however, recurrence is common. Studies suggest galectin\u20103 may play a role in viral replication as well as cellular immune responsiveness to virus infection. We hypothesize that serum galectin\u20103 levels may correlate with clinical outcomes of common warts treated with cryotherapy. Methods AIM: 1. Compare serum galectin\u20103 levels between common warts and healthy controls 2. Evaluate if baseline levels of serum galectin\u20103 correlate with treatment success or failure. Data Analysis (SPSS 27): Continuous variables were analyzed using T\u2010tests or the Mann\u2010Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using \u03c72 or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. A multiple logistic regression model was used to analyze the impact of baseline serum galectin\u20103 on time to treatment failure in our cohort. Kaplan\u2010Meier survival curves were constructed to assess relapse of disease in all patients treated with cryotherapy. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify baseline serum galectin\u20103 as a potential marker for treatment failure (treatment failure \u2010 time to treatment failure due to wart recurrence). The primary outcome measure was time to treatment failure (treatment failure: persistence of more than 50% wart area after two consecutive cryotherapy treatments). Results: The mean baseline serum galectin\u20103 level was not significantly different in healthy controls compared to individuals with common warts: healthy controls (1.90 ng/mL) versus individuals with common warts (2.68 ng/mL) (P=0.077). There was a statistically significant difference in serum galectin\u20103 levels between individuals with complete success (4.06 ng/mL)",

However, biomarkers for predicting the progression of HPV infection are limited. We sought to determine the accuracy of measuring the serum levels of Galectin\u20103 in the detection of progressive HR\u2010HPV infection. Methods and Findings: We carried out a hospital\u2010based prospective study in the UK, enrolling 261 consecutive women newly diagnosed with HR\u2010HPV infection. Serum Galectin\u20103 levels were measured at baseline and every 6 months for 2 years. We measured the difference in baseline levels between two groups: those who progressed to cervical dysplasia (CD), high\u2010grade CD, or cervical cancer (HPV+) and those who maintained normal cervical cytology (HPV\u2013) and low\u2010grade CD (HPV+CD). At time of study end after a median follow\u2010up of 24 months (range 1\u201335 months), 38/206 (18.4%) women diagnosed with CD progressed to high\u2010grade CD or cervical cancer, while the remaining 168/206 (81.6%) remained at the same levels of cervical cytology. The overall positive detection rate was 76.5% (95%CI 65.5\u201383.4) in the HPV+ group and 23.4% (95%CI 12.8\u201337.5) in the HPV\u2013/low\u2010grade CD group (p < 0.01).

Our hypothesis is that higher baseline serum galectin\u20103 levels are associated with shorter overall survival (OS), progression\u2010free survival (PFS), and time to treatment failure (TTF). We present a pilot study conducted at Aichi Cancer Institute to test this hypothesis. [METHOD] Between January 2019 and September 2020, 45 patients were enrolled. All patients had newly diagnosed advanced mRCC treated with first\u2010line TKIs. This study was not originally registered in a public trial registry; only registration is planned and underway. Baseline blood sampling was required before the start of treatment. Immunohistochemical staining for galectin\u20103 was performed using the tissue microarray of primary mRCC tissue. OS, PFS, TTF, and the time from TKI treatment for each patient were recorded. Associations between baseline serum galectin\u20103 level and clinical outcomes was assessed by Kaplan\u2010Meier and log\u2010rank tests.
