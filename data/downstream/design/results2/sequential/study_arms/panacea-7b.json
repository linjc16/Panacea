            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, I recommend an experimental group where participants receive 1) behavior change counseling through 3 self-management workshops and 2) information regarding chronic low back pain and self-management. This will allow us to assess the impact of the interventions on patient activation. How does that sound?",
            "Excellent! And for the third study arm, participants can undergo 4 sessions of brief motivational interviewing (BMI) by a registered nurse (RN) to address personal barriers and activation to self-manage chronic low back pain. This will help assess the added benefit of BMI on top of the self-management program. What are your thoughts?",
            "Perfect! We have designed three study arms:\n\n1. Other: Control: Participants will have a baseline visit and a follow up visit, but no intervention.\n2. Experimental: Self-Management: Participants will engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks with no contact with either the nurse care manager or study team contact between the 1-month and 3-month followup assessments.\n3. Experimental: Group Self-Management + Behavior: Participants will engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions.\n\nThese study arms will allow us to test and evaluate the effectiveness of both the self-management program alone and the combination of self-management and health behavior change counseling."

            "Great! Now, for the second study arm, we could have participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks. This will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-management program alone in improving patient activation and outcomes related to chronic low back pain. What do you think?",
            "Excellent! For the third study arm, we could combine the self-management program with health behavior change counseling. Participants in this arm would engage in the same self-management program for 6 weeks and also receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing. This combined intervention aims to further enhance patient activation and engagement in self-management strategies. What are your thoughts on this?",
            "Perfect! Here are the full study arms for the trial:\n\n1. No Intervention: Control\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants receive no intervention.\n\n2. Active Comparator: Self-management program (SMP)\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks.\nIntervention/Treatment: Behavioral: Self-management program\n- An evidence-based 6-week SMP led by a registered nurse. The SMP is based on the Arthritis Self-Management Program and the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program.\n\n3. Experimental: Self-management program (SMP) with Health Behavior Change Counseling (HBCC)\nParticipant Group/Arm: Participants engage in a nurse-led evidence-based web-enabled group self-management class for 6 weeks and receive three telephone-based health behavioral change counseling sessions based on the principles and practices of motivational interviewing.\nIntervention/Treatment:\n- Behavioral: Health Behavior Change Counseling\n  * A telephone-based intervention employing principles and practices of motivational interviewing.\n- Behavioral: Self-management program\n  * An evidence-based 6-week SMP led by a registered nurse. The SMP is based on the Arthritis Self-Management Program and the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or if you have any other questions related to the clinical trial design."
