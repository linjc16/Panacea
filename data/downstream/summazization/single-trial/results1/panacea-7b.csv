This study aims to understand the psychosocial factors (defense and psychological processes) and personality traits that may underlie NP, focusing on the role of early and adulthood traumatic experiences in predicting the onset and maintenance of NP, and the effects of NP on life, emotions, social relationships and the quality of life of the subjects. Thus the investigators will examine the psychosocial predictors of the onset and progression of Chronic Migraine (CM), Fibromyalgia (FM) and Vulvodynia (VU), in an effort to identify a common core of psychosocial characteristics in individuals who suffer from these disorders, despite showing quite different pain behavior. Given the heterogeneity of the three pathologies expressed by NP, it is necessary to investigate the characteristics that may differentiate them with reference to the type of personality, defense mechanisms, childhood traumatic events, and central sensitization. Ultimately, the study aims to identify subgroups of individuals who suffer from NP, based on similarities and differences in psychological variables, in order to tailor the best therapeutic practices for each patient."

Pressure injuries, also known as pressure sores, are a medical condition that affects elderly or bedridden patients. The formation of these wounds occurs for several reasons, such as long periods of sitting or lying down without adequate tissue perfusion. The goal of this study is to investigate the prevention effect of a modern mattress system compared to a standard mattress system. The standard mattress system is a viscoelastic mattress with an orthopedic foam system. In the experimental group, a modern mattress system with a support surface with vibration (massage) features, a cube/block system, and a ventilation system is used. To determine the risk of pressure ulcers, the patients' Braden Scores are calculated daily upon admission. The patients are then followed for four weeks, and their pressure ulcer risk is recorded on a daily basis. The pressure ulcer area is calculated with a square centimeter ruler using the Pressure Ulcer Observation Form. The number of patients without pressure ulcers is monitored in both groups, and the number of patients with a Braden Score of 13 or higher is compared statistically between the two groups. The investigators predict that bedridden patients using a mattress system with a support surface that reduces the pressure, vibration, and air exchange will have less pressure ulcer formation. These mattresses with cube/block systems have a greater area of low pressure that offers lower pressure to the patient, which may have a positive effect on prevention of pressure ulcers. The mattresses with cube/block systems are more expensive and cost approximately 400 more euros than the standard mattress, but the prevention of pressure ulcers and subsequent complications may lead to cost savings within a short time."

Children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) aged 10-12 will be included in the study. The children will be randomized into 2 groups as the experimental group and the control group 2 days a week by a cardiologist who is not involved in the study. The experimental group will perform moderate exercise for a total of 60 minutes for 12 weeks with AR glasses. The control group will not receive any intervention. The exercise group, consisting of 30 children, will be given a single session of AR games, followed by a session of exercise in the first session. At the end of the first 4 weeks, another control session will be given, followed by another exercise session. In the second 4 weeks, the control session will be replaced by a single AR game session and then a new session of 7 days. In the third 4-week period, a control session will be held on the 1st, 3rd and 5th days, and each period will end with an exercise session. This process will be continued for 12 weeks in total. Anthropometric measurements such as body weight, height, subcutaneous fat mass, body composition analysis, and blood biochemistry values will be taken from the children at the beginning of the study, during the progress of the study in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th weeks, and after the completion of the study. The quality of life scale will be applied to the children at the beginning of the study, at the end of the 4th and 8th weeks of the study, and after the completion of the study. By dividing the children into two groups and including them randomly, an experiment will be organized for the 12-week period where 30 children with type 1 diabetes will have different exercise applications. The exercise to be applied by the children in the first 4 weeks after the initial application will be evaluated in the study with AR glasses. The application will be changed in the second 4-week period and continued. This change will be made as follows: In the 6th week of the application, 1 control session will be held on the first day and the application will be changed on the second day. This sequence will be repeated for the 7th day. On the 5th day, a control session will be held in the 1st week, a single AR exercise session will be held in the 2nd week, a control session will be held on the 3rd day, and a single exercise session will be held on the 4th day. Thus, the children in the exercise arm will have a total of 10 exercise sessions and 6 control sessions during the 12-week period. By this method, it will be tried to prevent adaptation and increase motivation, and it will be ensured that the exercise is not boring for the children.."

This study is conducted to investigate the patients' preferences for the treatment options of overactive bladder. In Australia, where a third of the population is born overseas, diversity in treatment preference can be seen. The aim of this study is to evaluate the importance of treatment-related characteristics and their impact on patient preference for treatment. Therefore, a discrete choice experiment is designed. The participants will be asked to choose between two therapeutic options, each option comes with its own characteristics. The characteristics represent the different features of the therapies, such as cost, effectiveness, treatment frequency, recovery time after treatment or its side effects. Participants will be randomised and offered two options in two rounds. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of participants choosing either option. The differences in mean characteristics rated between groups will also be evaluated. The data will be anonymized and encrypted and stored in a central database. The statistical analysis of the discrete choice experiment will utilise the R software package, the gnnet2 package and the mlogit package for the calculation of the parameters. This study will provide the first data on the preferences of a diverse OAB patient population towards different treatment options."

Additionally, in Smokers, the investigators will investigate the relationship between specific and general PIT effects and both questionnaire-assessed chronic and acute stress. The investigators hypothesise that general PIT effect found in the single-lever PIT task is more strongly associated with the general PIT and less strongly associated with the outcome-specific PIT effect in the full PIT task. The investigators also hypothesise that increased chronic stress enhances effects of both general and outcome-specific PIT. However, if there are significant stress-induced effects, the investigators will conduct an additional post-hoc power analysis that will determine the necessary sample sizes to observe significant stress-induced differences across the three study arms. These additional sample sizes should be added. We will calculate the needed sample size for this exploratory analysis based on the power analysis. The investigators will include sufficient participants for the exploratory analysis in each study arm. These additional sample sizes (approximately 60) will be added to both the AUD and HC study arms."

Cleft lip and palate are the most prevalent congenital defect of the head and neck. When the palatal shelves and the medial nasal process fail to fuse together between the fourth and eighth weeks of development, unilateral cleft lip and palate results. Lip muscles are disrupted and abnormally inserted to the columellar base on the non-cleft side and from the alar base on the cleft side. The nasal floor and alveolus on the cleft side may be deficient or absent. Several approaches, including quadrangular flaps, triangular flaps, and rotation-advancement procedures, were established in the middle of the twentieth century. The most popular triangular technique which relies on mathematical calculations to lessen vertical lip contracture is the Tennison-triangular Randall's approach. The Cupid's bow is distorted, the white roll up is pulled up by scar contracture and the philtral column is vertically situated, which is modified Millard's technique. To restore the natural facial appearance and functional structure, the objectives of the cleft lip repair are to create a symmetrical lip without any scar and vertical lip contracture. Anthropometric Evaluation of surgical technique and comparison of cleft and non-cleft sides are two benefits of measuring surgical outcome The anthropometric measurements which are evaluated is Lip height, Lip length, Philtral length, Lipsub Nasal length, Columelldistance which measures the difference between the base of the nose and the labial commisure. The qualitative evaluations is to analyzed facial aesthetics and appearance impairment using scales, indices, scoring systems and rankings. Both direct and indirect technique can be used to perform the measurements and qualitative evaluations. To evaluate the anthropometric measurements of the Cleft lip patients 21 patient of unilateral cleft lip had mishra technique repair and 21 patient of unilateral cleft lip had modified Millard technique repair using the Skelettal class I normative standard values. The measurements are taken on the non-cleft side of the patient and will be compared with the cleft side. Both direct and indirect technique will be used. The qualitative evaluations are measured by comparing it with its opposite non-cleft side, skeletal class I normative standard values, and the control group."

Background: Diverticular disease is a common condition in western countries with relatively uncommon complications, fistulae, complicating diverticular disease occurs in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease. Herein we describe a case of a single-digest fistula (sDF) due to sigmoid diverticulitis, a long-standing problem in which there are more questions than answers. Intra-cavity endoscopy of sDF was performed by one of us (NK) to help define the extent of pathology and its effect on short bowel syndrome.. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of endoscopic treatment of sDF by using endostitches and clips . Research question: Is Endoscopic Management Of Controlled Colo-cutaneous Fistula As A complication of Acute Sigmoid Diverticulitis Effective? Hypothesis: Yes The Endoscopic Management Of Low Output Recurrent Colonic Fistula After Anterior Resection For Rectal Cancer Is Effective. Design: All consecutive patients with the symptoms of sDF and confirmed by preoperative radiological studies (CT scan) were approached. After endoscopic evaluation patient was randomised into two groups treatment group and no treatment group with the aid of random numbers table method. The random allocation was made independently by the clinical research fellow who did not take part in patient care. Statistical analysis: The data were expressed as number (percent), mean (standard deviation), median (minimum,maximum) or mode as appropriate. The data collected was subjected to statistical analysis using chi square / fisher exact / T- test, and Mann Whitney test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: One hundred and ten patients who attended the general surgery outpatients clinic and satisfied the above criteria were approached. One patient refused to participate. One patient didn't have radiological support . The remaining 102 patients were randomized.. A fistula between a sigmoid loop diverticular point and the ileocecal valve was found endoscopically in 86 patients, while the fistula was between the sigmoid diverticular point and the caecum in 16 patients. There were no statistically significant difference between sDF and iDF in relation to age and gender. There were no significant difference with respect to underlying disease factors and the site of the fistula in both groups. Sixty-four patients were managed after 3 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Twenty-eight (43.8 %) patients were managed conservatively out of which 24 (40.3%) responded well to conservative measures. Six (9.7%) patients in the no treatment group required immediate surgery. One patient had perforation of the jejunum and the presence of a high output fistula that was not able to heal conservatively. Five patients developed recurrent symptoms in the form of sepsis during the early period after discharge, and they required emergency laparotomy . All fifty-six patients who submitted endoscopic management had a decrease in volume of drain (61 +/ - 12 versus 395 +/ - 13.3 mL; p< 0 .005) and white cells count of drain (257 +/ - 112 versus 124 +/ - 40.8 mm3/ h; p< 0.005). During the follow up period, nine patients who submitted endoscopic management develop recurrent symptoms in the form of sepsis and required emergency laparotomy, but no patient has developed recurrence of the fistula. The recurrence of fistula was also evaluated one month after operation in the treatment group. No recurrence of the fistula was seen in the treatment group during the follow up period. A high recurrence rate of the fistula (64.3%) was observed in the conservative group and it was statistically higher than that of the treatment group (40.3%; Chi square test: p< 0.001). No significant morbidity was recorded in the treatment group. The overall mean duration of hospital stay in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of conservation group (12 +/ - 3.1 versus 18.3 +/ - 10.3 days; p< 0.005). The mean hospital stay in patients who received intravenous antibiotics was 27 +/ - 5.3 days; it was significantly lower than 33 +/ - 6.8 and 41.3 +/ - 14.3 in"

The purpose of this study is to identify patients where observation is feasible after a diagnosis of oropharyngeal cancer with HPV + status that warrants adjuvant therapy following transoral surgery. The investigators hypothesize that patients who are clinically selected to receive observation after treatment with transoral robotic surgery can be observed with the understanding that salvage would be pursued in the case of recurrence. The investigators aim to enroll 120 patients. Patients on the experimental arm will be under observation only. Patients enrolled in this arm will be monitored for toxicity, Quality of Life (QoL) and outcomes evaluation. Suspected locoregional recurrence based on physical examination, imaging or increasing ctDNA will undergo completion of workup at the discretion of the University of Maryland Head and Neck tumor board. LRR will be offered salvage treatment based on recommendations from multi-disciplinary discussion. Salvage therapy (surgery and/or radiation with or without chemotherapy) could be offered. Salvage therapy will not be given if local failure or recurrence were demonstrated due to the presence of the disease. Treatment-related toxicities are known and well characterized, but the extent of short and long-term complications associated with observation following TORS is not yet known. Patients on the experimental arm of the study will serve as a control group and will receive the standard of care. Patients in this arm will undergo adjuvant treatment per standard of care (Radiation with or without chemotherapy). Radiation therapy alone usually will be given and chemotherapy will be given as determined by the treating physician. Patients will be offered the option of concurrent chemotherapy if deemed appropriate by the physician. Chemotherapy options include weekly carboplatin AUC2 and paclitaxel 50mg/m2, every 3 weeks. Radiation therapy will consist of 60 gray in 30 fractions over 6 weeks. Chemoradiation therapy can be administered concurrently or sequentially as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Blood and tissue samples will be collected. Blood and tissue sample tests include ctDNA test (blood test for diagnostic and surveillance purposes measuring expression of Cell free HPV tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood, Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) test."

The purpose of this randomized phase II trial is to compare hypofractionated breast radiotherapy with a short and high (26Gy) dose per fraction (ultra-hypofractionation) versus a standard fractionation regimen, either partial breast irradiation (PBI) or whole breast irradiation (WBI, also called APBI). PBI is a hypo-fractionated treatment regimen for early breast cancer with a reduced treatment time of approximately one week. Recent evidence from randomized prospective trials is in favor of PBI as it allows better quality of life with no decrease in oncologic outcomes. However, some concern about the risk of local recurrence has persisted since no meta-analysis has been able to establish the risk due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and the impossibility of comparing PBI and WBI. The investigators believe that the reduction in treatment time and the low toxicity rate of daily fractionation allow the hypofractionated regimen to be safely compared with the standard fractionation regimen. The main hypothesis of this trial is that ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in either PBI or WBI is as effective in terms of oncologic control with less acute and late toxicity compared to the standard fractionation regimen. Specifically, the investigators aim to demonstrate that ultra-hypofractionated PBI and WBI are as effective as the standard fractionation regimen (26 Gy/50 Gy) with less toxicity and less financial burden on the health care system. Additionally, the investigators will assess patient-reported outcomes (PRO) (quality of life, body image, psychosocial burden and satisfaction with treatment), complication rates and late toxicities. After 5 years of follow-up, the investigators' hypothesis is that ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in either PBI or WBI is as effective as the standard fractionation regimen (26 Gy/50 Gy) with less toxicity and can be offered after breast-conserving surgery and adequate nodal staging in all patients with early operable breast cancer."

There is accumulating evidence from experimental studies and clinical trials, indicating that physical exercise promotes physiological, functional, and neuropsychiatric benefits. Physical exercise can change health conditions such as cardio-respiratory fitness, blood pressure and heart rate. Physical exercise can reduce the expression of chronic diseases, increase life expectancy, increase the resistance of the body to infections, improve bone development, improve motor, cognitive, and emotional functions, promote improvement in brain blood flow and improvement in brain neurochemicals, increasing the production of neurotrophic factors.
Physical exercise during hemodialysis is being shown to improve the quality of life of these patients, reduce some cardio-neurological risks, and influence the hemodynamic responses of patients, making the intervention with physical exercise very promising for chronic renal patients. However, many patients on hemodialysis are subjected to a variety of difficulties, which may prevent exercise.
This research project aims to carry out a Longitudinal Cross-over Clinical Trial, considering a sample of 32 chronic renal patients, to observe physiological changes, which can be measured during a virtual game environment, compared to the effects of physical exercise in the usual format in these patients, while dialyzing. The main objective is to understand the impact of virtual reality games on various variables of interest in the management of Chronic Renal Disease (Chronic Kidney Disease - CKD). In this context, there is a hypothesis that virtual reality games have a greater effect on the modulation of heart rate variability than conventional physical exercise. The study will be done from January 2021 to December 2021."

Synopsis: The gut microbiome has been implicated in several medical disorders including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, ulcerative colitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux and gallstone disease. Gut microbes may either promote or impede the progression of many disorders and therefore have significant clinical implications for patients affected by them. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without but there are only a handful of small scale studies linking these differences with the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. Preliminary results from these studies suggest an association between gut microbiome diversity (the richness of the number of species present in the gut) and gallstone disease and that specific species may confer risk for symptomatic gallstone disease. Researchers are currently unaware of what these microbes are and whether these differences have any effect on the progression of gallstone disease or its complications. Therefore, this study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including those who develop complications following diagnosis and those who develop complications following cholecystectomy. It is intended that this work will help to identify the differences in gut microbiome in patients with gallstone disease compared to controls and link this to the development of complications. The knowledge gained from this study will allow researchers to devise strategies to reduce the number and severity of complications in patients with gallstone disease and ultimately result in a better patient experience and reduced use of NHS resources. This study is crucial in the first step in understanding differences in the gut microbiome that are linked to gallstone disease. The findings from this study will provide the evidence to support future larger scale studies or trials to determine interventions which can be used to reduce the development of complications in patients with this disorder.

Inclusion criteria: All adults (age >18 years of age) patients diagnosed with gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging at an East Kent University Foundation Trust Hospital. Patients of any gender, ethnicity or socio-economic background are eligible as well as pregnant women. Patients undergoing both open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be included.

Exclusion criteria: Patients less than 18 years of age and patients who do not have capacity to consent to involvement in the study.

Summary: Gallstone disease is a common condition that affects up to 15% of the population. Many patients with gallstone disease experience varying severity of symptoms including abdominal pain and bloating, which can result in considerable disruption to patients lives in addition to increased costs to the NHS. Cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment for symptomatic gallbladder disease. However, surgery carries risks including bleeding, infection and injury to surrounding structures. Whilst the procedure is minimally invasive in a large proportion of patients, complications are still common and result in increased length of hospital stay as well as readmittance in the postoperative period. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with"
