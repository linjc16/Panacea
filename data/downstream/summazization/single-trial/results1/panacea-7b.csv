This study aims to understand the psychosocial factors (defense and psychological processes) and personality traits that may underlie NP, focusing on the role of early and adulthood traumatic experiences in predicting the onset and maintenance of NP, and the effects of NP on life, emotions, social relationships and the quality of life of the subjects. Thus the investigators will examine the psychosocial predictors of the onset and progression of Chronic Migraine (CM), Fibromyalgia (FM) and Vulvodynia (VU), in an effort to identify a common core of psychosocial characteristics in individuals who suffer from these disorders, despite showing quite different pain behavior. Given the heterogeneity of the three pathologies expressed by NP, it is necessary to investigate the characteristics that may differentiate them with reference to the type of personality, defense mechanisms, childhood traumatic events, and central sensitization. Ultimately, the study aims to identify subgroups of individuals who suffer from NP, based on similarities and differences in psychological variables, in order to tailor the best therapeutic practices for each patient."

Pressure injuries, also known as pressure sores, are a medical condition that affects elderly or bedridden patients. The formation of these wounds occurs for several reasons, such as long periods of sitting or lying down without adequate tissue perfusion. The goal of this study is to investigate the prevention effect of a modern mattress system compared to a standard mattress system. The standard mattress system is a viscoelastic mattress with an orthopedic foam system. In the experimental group, a modern mattress system with a support surface with vibration (massage) features, a cube/block system, and a ventilation system is used. To determine the risk of pressure ulcers, the patients' Braden Scores are calculated daily upon admission. The patients are then followed for four weeks, and their pressure ulcer risk is recorded on a daily basis. The pressure ulcer area is calculated with a square centimeter ruler using the Pressure Ulcer Observation Form. The number of patients without pressure ulcers is monitored in both groups, and the number of patients with a Braden Score of 13 or higher is compared statistically between the two groups. The investigators predict that bedridden patients using a mattress system with a support surface that reduces the pressure, vibration, and air exchange will have less pressure ulcer formation. These mattresses with cube/block systems have a greater area of low pressure that offers lower pressure to the patient, which may have a positive effect on prevention of pressure ulcers. The mattresses with cube/block systems are more expensive and cost approximately 400 more euros than the standard mattress, but the prevention of pressure ulcers and subsequent complications may lead to cost savings within a short time."

Children with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) aged 10-12 will be included in the study. The children will be randomized into 2 groups as the experimental group and the control group 2 days a week by a cardiologist who is not involved in the study. The experimental group will perform moderate exercise for a total of 60 minutes for 12 weeks with AR glasses. The control group will not receive any intervention. The exercise group, consisting of 30 children, will be given a single session of AR games, followed by a session of exercise in the first session. At the end of the first 4 weeks, another control session will be given, followed by another exercise session. In the second 4 weeks, the control session will be replaced by a single AR game session and then a new session of 7 days. In the third 4-week period, a control session will be held on the 1st, 3rd and 5th days, and each period will end with an exercise session. This process will be continued for 12 weeks in total. Anthropometric measurements such as body weight, height, subcutaneous fat mass, body composition analysis, and blood biochemistry values will be taken from the children at the beginning of the study, during the progress of the study in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th weeks, and after the completion of the study. The quality of life scale will be applied to the children at the beginning of the study, at the end of the 4th and 8th weeks of the study, and after the completion of the study. By dividing the children into two groups and including them randomly, an experiment will be organized for the 12-week period where 30 children with type 1 diabetes will have different exercise applications. The exercise to be applied by the children in the first 4 weeks after the initial application will be evaluated in the study with AR glasses. The application will be changed in the second 4-week period and continued. This change will be made as follows: In the 6th week of the application, 1 control session will be held on the first day and the application will be changed on the second day. This sequence will be repeated for the 7th day. On the 5th day, a control session will be held in the 1st week, a single AR exercise session will be held in the 2nd week, a control session will be held on the 3rd day, and a single exercise session will be held on the 4th day. Thus, the children in the exercise arm will have a total of 10 exercise sessions and 6 control sessions during the 12-week period. By this method, it will be tried to prevent adaptation and increase motivation, and it will be ensured that the exercise is not boring for the children.."

This study is conducted to investigate the patients' preferences for the treatment options of overactive bladder. In Australia, where a third of the population is born overseas, diversity in treatment preference can be seen. The aim of this study is to evaluate the importance of treatment-related characteristics and their impact on patient preference for treatment. Therefore, a discrete choice experiment is designed. The participants will be asked to choose between two therapeutic options, each option comes with its own characteristics. The characteristics represent the different features of the therapies, such as cost, effectiveness, treatment frequency, recovery time after treatment or its side effects. Participants will be randomised and offered two options in two rounds. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of participants choosing either option. The differences in mean characteristics rated between groups will also be evaluated. The data will be anonymized and encrypted and stored in a central database. The statistical analysis of the discrete choice experiment will utilise the R software package, the gnnet2 package and the mlogit package for the calculation of the parameters. This study will provide the first data on the preferences of a diverse OAB patient population towards different treatment options."

Additionally, in Smokers, the investigators will investigate the relationship between specific and general PIT effects and both questionnaire-assessed chronic and acute stress. The investigators hypothesise that general PIT effect found in the single-lever PIT task is more strongly associated with the general PIT and less strongly associated with the outcome-specific PIT effect in the full PIT task. The investigators also hypothesise that increased chronic stress enhances effects of both general and outcome-specific PIT. However, if there are significant stress-induced effects, the investigators will conduct an additional post-hoc power analysis that will determine the necessary sample sizes to observe significant stress-induced differences across the three study arms. These additional sample sizes should be added. We will calculate the needed sample size for this exploratory analysis based on the power analysis. The investigators will include sufficient participants for the exploratory analysis in each study arm. These additional sample sizes (approximately 60) will be added to both the AUD and HC study arms."

Cleft lip and palate are the most prevalent congenital defect of the head and neck. When the palatal shelves and the medial nasal process fail to fuse together between the fourth and eighth weeks of development, unilateral cleft lip and palate results. Lip muscles are disrupted and abnormally inserted to the columellar base on the non-cleft side and from the alar base on the cleft side. The nasal floor and alveolus on the cleft side may be deficient or absent. Several approaches, including quadrangular flaps, triangular flaps, and rotation-advancement procedures, were established in the middle of the twentieth century. The most popular triangular technique which relies on mathematical calculations to lessen vertical lip contracture is the Tennison-triangular Randall's approach. The Cupid's bow is distorted, the white roll up is pulled up by scar contracture and the philtral column is vertically situated, which is modified Millard's technique. To restore the natural facial appearance and functional structure, the objectives of the cleft lip repair are to create a symmetrical lip without any scar and vertical lip contracture. Anthropometric Evaluation of surgical technique and comparison of cleft and non-cleft sides are two benefits of measuring surgical outcome The anthropometric measurements which are evaluated is Lip height, Lip length, Philtral length, Lipsub Nasal length, Columelldistance which measures the difference between the base of the nose and the labial commisure. The qualitative evaluations is to analyzed facial aesthetics and appearance impairment using scales, indices, scoring systems and rankings. Both direct and indirect technique can be used to perform the measurements and qualitative evaluations. To evaluate the anthropometric measurements of the Cleft lip patients 21 patient of unilateral cleft lip had mishra technique repair and 21 patient of unilateral cleft lip had modified Millard technique repair using the Skelettal class I normative standard values. The measurements are taken on the non-cleft side of the patient and will be compared with the cleft side. Both direct and indirect technique will be used. The qualitative evaluations are measured by comparing it with its opposite non-cleft side, skeletal class I normative standard values, and the control group."

Background: Diverticular disease is a common condition in western countries with relatively uncommon complications, fistulae, complicating diverticular disease occurs in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease. Herein we describe a case of a single-digest fistula (sDF) due to sigmoid diverticulitis, a long-standing problem in which there are more questions than answers. Intra-cavity endoscopy of sDF was performed by one of us (NK) to help define the extent of pathology and its effect on short bowel syndrome.. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of endoscopic treatment of sDF by using endostitches and clips . Research question: Is Endoscopic Management Of Controlled Colo-cutaneous Fistula As A complication of Acute Sigmoid Diverticulitis Effective? Hypothesis: Yes The Endoscopic Management Of Low Output Recurrent Colonic Fistula After Anterior Resection For Rectal Cancer Is Effective. Design: All consecutive patients with the symptoms of sDF and confirmed by preoperative radiological studies (CT scan) were approached. After endoscopic evaluation patient was randomised into two groups treatment group and no treatment group with the aid of random numbers table method. The random allocation was made independently by the clinical research fellow who did not take part in patient care. Statistical analysis: The data were expressed as number (percent), mean (standard deviation), median (minimum,maximum) or mode as appropriate. The data collected was subjected to statistical analysis using chi square / fisher exact / T- test, and Mann Whitney test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: One hundred and ten patients who attended the general surgery outpatients clinic and satisfied the above criteria were approached. One patient refused to participate. One patient didn't have radiological support . The remaining 102 patients were randomized.. A fistula between a sigmoid loop diverticular point and the ileocecal valve was found endoscopically in 86 patients, while the fistula was between the sigmoid diverticular point and the caecum in 16 patients. There were no statistically significant difference between sDF and iDF in relation to age and gender. There were no significant difference with respect to underlying disease factors and the site of the fistula in both groups. Sixty-four patients were managed after 3 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Twenty-eight (43.8 %) patients were managed conservatively out of which 24 (40.3%) responded well to conservative measures. Six (9.7%) patients in the no treatment group required immediate surgery. One patient had perforation of the jejunum and the presence of a high output fistula that was not able to heal conservatively. Five patients developed recurrent symptoms in the form of sepsis during the early period after discharge, and they required emergency laparotomy . All fifty-six patients who submitted endoscopic management had a decrease in volume of drain (61 +/ - 12 versus 395 +/ - 13.3 mL; p< 0 .005) and white cells count of drain (257 +/ - 112 versus 124 +/ - 40.8 mm3/ h; p< 0.005). During the follow up period, nine patients who submitted endoscopic management develop recurrent symptoms in the form of sepsis and required emergency laparotomy, but no patient has developed recurrence of the fistula. The recurrence of fistula was also evaluated one month after operation in the treatment group. No recurrence of the fistula was seen in the treatment group during the follow up period. A high recurrence rate of the fistula (64.3%) was observed in the conservative group and it was statistically higher than that of the treatment group (40.3%; Chi square test: p< 0.001). No significant morbidity was recorded in the treatment group. The overall mean duration of hospital stay in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of conservation group (12 +/ - 3.1 versus 18.3 +/ - 10.3 days; p< 0.005). The mean hospital stay in patients who received intravenous antibiotics was 27 +/ - 5.3 days; it was significantly lower than 33 +/ - 6.8 and 41.3 +/ - 14.3 in"

The purpose of this study is to identify patients where observation is feasible after a diagnosis of oropharyngeal cancer with HPV + status that warrants adjuvant therapy following transoral surgery. The investigators hypothesize that patients who are clinically selected to receive observation after treatment with transoral robotic surgery can be observed with the understanding that salvage would be pursued in the case of recurrence. The investigators aim to enroll 120 patients. Patients on the experimental arm will be under observation only. Patients enrolled in this arm will be monitored for toxicity, Quality of Life (QoL) and outcomes evaluation. Suspected locoregional recurrence based on physical examination, imaging or increasing ctDNA will undergo completion of workup at the discretion of the University of Maryland Head and Neck tumor board. LRR will be offered salvage treatment based on recommendations from multi-disciplinary discussion. Salvage therapy (surgery and/or radiation with or without chemotherapy) could be offered. Salvage therapy will not be given if local failure or recurrence were demonstrated due to the presence of the disease. Treatment-related toxicities are known and well characterized, but the extent of short and long-term complications associated with observation following TORS is not yet known. Patients on the experimental arm of the study will serve as a control group and will receive the standard of care. Patients in this arm will undergo adjuvant treatment per standard of care (Radiation with or without chemotherapy). Radiation therapy alone usually will be given and chemotherapy will be given as determined by the treating physician. Patients will be offered the option of concurrent chemotherapy if deemed appropriate by the physician. Chemotherapy options include weekly carboplatin AUC2 and paclitaxel 50mg/m2, every 3 weeks. Radiation therapy will consist of 60 gray in 30 fractions over 6 weeks. Chemoradiation therapy can be administered concurrently or sequentially as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Blood and tissue samples will be collected. Blood and tissue sample tests include ctDNA test (blood test for diagnostic and surveillance purposes measuring expression of Cell free HPV tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood, Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) test."

The purpose of this randomized phase II trial is to compare hypofractionated breast radiotherapy with a short and high (26Gy) dose per fraction (ultra-hypofractionation) versus a standard fractionation regimen, either partial breast irradiation (PBI) or whole breast irradiation (WBI, also called APBI). PBI is a hypo-fractionated treatment regimen for early breast cancer with a reduced treatment time of approximately one week. Recent evidence from randomized prospective trials is in favor of PBI as it allows better quality of life with no decrease in oncologic outcomes. However, some concern about the risk of local recurrence has persisted since no meta-analysis has been able to establish the risk due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and the impossibility of comparing PBI and WBI. The investigators believe that the reduction in treatment time and the low toxicity rate of daily fractionation allow the hypofractionated regimen to be safely compared with the standard fractionation regimen. The main hypothesis of this trial is that ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in either PBI or WBI is as effective in terms of oncologic control with less acute and late toxicity compared to the standard fractionation regimen. Specifically, the investigators aim to demonstrate that ultra-hypofractionated PBI and WBI are as effective as the standard fractionation regimen (26 Gy/50 Gy) with less toxicity and less financial burden on the health care system. Additionally, the investigators will assess patient-reported outcomes (PRO) (quality of life, body image, psychosocial burden and satisfaction with treatment), complication rates and late toxicities. After 5 years of follow-up, the investigators' hypothesis is that ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in either PBI or WBI is as effective as the standard fractionation regimen (26 Gy/50 Gy) with less toxicity and can be offered after breast-conserving surgery and adequate nodal staging in all patients with early operable breast cancer."

There is accumulating evidence from experimental studies and clinical trials, indicating that physical exercise promotes physiological, functional, and neuropsychiatric benefits. Physical exercise can change health conditions such as cardio-respiratory fitness, blood pressure and heart rate. Physical exercise can reduce the expression of chronic diseases, increase life expectancy, increase the resistance of the body to infections, improve bone development, improve motor, cognitive, and emotional functions, promote improvement in brain blood flow and improvement in brain neurochemicals, increasing the production of neurotrophic factors.
Physical exercise during hemodialysis is being shown to improve the quality of life of these patients, reduce some cardio-neurological risks, and influence the hemodynamic responses of patients, making the intervention with physical exercise very promising for chronic renal patients. However, many patients on hemodialysis are subjected to a variety of difficulties, which may prevent exercise.
This research project aims to carry out a Longitudinal Cross-over Clinical Trial, considering a sample of 32 chronic renal patients, to observe physiological changes, which can be measured during a virtual game environment, compared to the effects of physical exercise in the usual format in these patients, while dialyzing. The main objective is to understand the impact of virtual reality games on various variables of interest in the management of Chronic Renal Disease (Chronic Kidney Disease - CKD). In this context, there is a hypothesis that virtual reality games have a greater effect on the modulation of heart rate variability than conventional physical exercise. The study will be done from January 2021 to December 2021."

Synopsis: The gut microbiome has been implicated in several medical disorders including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, ulcerative colitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux and gallstone disease. Gut microbes may either promote or impede the progression of many disorders and therefore have significant clinical implications for patients affected by them. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without but there are only a handful of small scale studies linking these differences with the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. Preliminary results from these studies suggest an association between gut microbiome diversity (the richness of the number of species present in the gut) and gallstone disease and that specific species may confer risk for symptomatic gallstone disease. Researchers are currently unaware of what these microbes are and whether these differences have any effect on the progression of gallstone disease or its complications. Therefore, this study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including those who develop complications following diagnosis and those who develop complications following cholecystectomy. It is intended that this work will help to identify the differences in gut microbiome in patients with gallstone disease compared to controls and link this to the development of complications. The knowledge gained from this study will allow researchers to devise strategies to reduce the number and severity of complications in patients with gallstone disease and ultimately result in a better patient experience and reduced use of NHS resources. This study is crucial in the first step in understanding differences in the gut microbiome that are linked to gallstone disease. The findings from this study will provide the evidence to support future larger scale studies or trials to determine interventions which can be used to reduce the development of complications in patients with this disorder.

Inclusion criteria: All adults (age >18 years of age) patients diagnosed with gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging at an East Kent University Foundation Trust Hospital. Patients of any gender, ethnicity or socio-economic background are eligible as well as pregnant women. Patients undergoing both open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be included.

Exclusion criteria: Patients less than 18 years of age and patients who do not have capacity to consent to involvement in the study.

Summary: Gallstone disease is a common condition that affects up to 15% of the population. Many patients with gallstone disease experience varying severity of symptoms including abdominal pain and bloating, which can result in considerable disruption to patients lives in addition to increased costs to the NHS. Cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment for symptomatic gallbladder disease. However, surgery carries risks including bleeding, infection and injury to surrounding structures. Whilst the procedure is minimally invasive in a large proportion of patients, complications are still common and result in increased length of hospital stay as well as readmittance in the postoperative period. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with"

Study design: 2 cohorts, consisting of sepsis patients with and without SALD, were selected for the investigators to further compare and analyze the patients' clinical data, characteristics, outcomes, and biochemical markers.
Objectives: This study is an observational, retrospective cohort study, focusing on evaluating correlation between APRI and SALD in adult patients with sepsis.
Study population/sample: The MIMIC IV database for sepsis patients was downloaded from physionet. We performed a review, after which we selected the cases most relevant to our study. Inclusion criteria in the MIMIC IV database for sepsis patients included the following: 1) adult sepsis patients (≥18 years) and 2) first hospitalization and first ICU admission. Exclusion criteria were: 1) all types of chronic liver disease; 2) viral hepatitis; 3) primary acute cholangiopathies; 4) cholecystitis; 5) hepatic infarction; 6) liver necrosis; 7) liver trauma; 8) length of ICU stay< 24 hours; 9) Patients without simultaneous AST and PLT data in the first 24 hours after ICU admission.
There were 87 234 patients in our database. Ultimately, 326 patients with APRI data and simultaneous AST and PLT data were enrolled.
Data collection and extraction: The database(MIMIC IV), which contains patient demographics, characteristics, and hospital data, was used. The biochemical markers were also assessed, both in the database and by additional laboratory testing. The extracted indicators include age, weight, gender, comorbidities, infection site, disease severity scores, vital signs, treatment received, blood parameters and clinical endpoints.
The MIMIC IV database for sepsis patients was downloaded from physionet (http://www.physionet.org) at 19:06 on Jan. 7, 2019. It contains detailed, longitudinal EMR data for sepsis patients in three adult ICUs from 2008 through 2012 in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
Data analysis: APRI and incidence of SALD will be evaluated using logistic regression analyses. We will use 0.5 of APRI as a cut-off to discriminate the association between APRI and SALD. The APRI and clinical indices were dichotomized into a high APRI group (APRI > 0.5) and low APRI group (APRI ≤ 0.5). The SALD group is used for comparison, and the non-SALD group is used as the control group. Risk differences will be calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals for differences.
Logistic regression will be performed to evaluate the association between incidence of SALD with APRI, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidity, infection site, disease severity scores, APACHE II, and initial serum hemoglobin levels. Odds ratios, along with 95% confidence intervals for differences, will be calculated.
Expected results: APRI is a simple, inexpensive, and widely available marker of liver disease. It is calculated by (AST(IU/L)/ upper limits of normal)/PLT(k/uL)×100. We hypothesized that APRI will be elevated in patients with SALD, regardless of etiology. In the current study, patients with higher APRI values will be more likely to develop SALD as compared to those with lower APRI values. Additionally, APRI > 0.5, which we set in our study, will be predictive of SALD. Finally, patients with elevated APRI levels will experience higher mortality rates compared to those with low APRI levels."

This trial focuses on assessing the immunogenicity of the Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain recombinant novel coronavirus protein vaccine in subjects with different immunization programs to provide data on the clinical development of Omicron BA.4/5-Delta recombinant humanized SARS-CoV-2 protein vaccine at the same time as the Omicron variant circulates in the United States and Europe. This trial consists of two parts: a 0-1-month study group and a 0-6-month study group. Participants aged 18 and above who agree to the terms and conditions of the study will first receive two doses of the Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain recombinant novel coronavirus protein vaccine, and the researchers will observe and record adverse reactions and the production of COVID-19 protective antibodies. If they decide to continue participating in the study, a blood sample will be taken 3 months after the final vaccination. If the number of participants reaching this stage meets the requirements, the blood will be collected and tested at 6 months after the final vaccination."

The trauma of birth can increase the risk of physical, psychological and social complications for mother and baby. In order to minimize the trauma of birth, skin-to-skin contact, which means putting the newborn naked to the mother's chest for the first hours after birth, is one of the practices recommended by the World Health Organization since 1991. Although it was stated that skin to skin contact between baby and mother affects the mother's bonding to the child and the mother's attachment, there are conflicting studies on the subject. In this study, we aimed to examine the impact of early skin-to-skin contact on the perception of traumatic birth of mothers.
In addition, skin-to-skin contact and face-to-face breastfeeding practices, which are thought to affect the bond between mother and baby positively, are expected to increase. In this study, the hypothesis that early skin-to-skin contact has a positive effect on the bond between mother and baby and the perception of birth trauma will be investigated."

The incidence of chronic low back pain following lumbar discectomy is approximately 35%, and the use of intraoperative analgesia is one of the most important treatment strategies for this problem. The sacral erector spinae plane block is an ultrasound-guided block technique that allows the administration of local anesthetic to the sacral nerve roots adjacent to the spine. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of sacral erector spinae plane block on opioid consumption and post-operative pain in patients undergoing lumbar disc hernia surgery. The patients were divided into two groups randomly. Fifty-four patients underwent lumbar disc hernia surgery under general anesthesia. Following completion of the surgery, patients in the first group received sacral ESPB, while patients in the control group received local anesthetic 10% solution into subcutaneous tissue. The patient satisfaction and total tramadol consumption were recorded 24 hours after surgery. The groups were comparable regarding to age, weight, and durations of surgery. It was found that the erector spinae plane block reduced intraoperative and post-operative pain and significantly reduced opioid consumption."

Development and validation of a multimodal imaging measure of lumbar myofascial pain (MP) as a useful clinical tool and a sensitive predictor of the myofascial pain response to treatment. Our goal is to develop a practical and inexpensive portable device consisting of a single multimodal ultrasound scan that determines the degree of myofascial pain as a composite of trigger point (TP) echogenicity, thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) and multifidus muscle (MF) stresses, and MF dynamic strain tensor and tissue viscoelasticity. During this project, the researchers will gather baseline MP data from 200 enrolled patients with cLBP and conduct a 16-week outcome period involving 15 home exercises and active management education.
Study Participant Group/Arm: 200 patients will be enrolled in the study: 40 Healthy Normal individuals, 120 individuals with chronic low back pain who meet the NIH definition of myofascial pain without TPs, 120 individuals with chronic low back pain who meet the NIH definition of myofascial pain with latent TPs, and 120 individuals with chronic low back pain who present with active trigger points.
Study Intervention/Treatment: Standardized clinical examination to classify the participant into MP-related categories (normal, MP without TPs, MP with latent TPs, and MP with active TPs)."

Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques have been used in various contexts, including education. Some educators and practitioners believe that NLP can help children develop their communication skills, self confidence, and self awareness and improve their learning outcomes. Some NLP techniques adapted for children include: (1) Anchoring involves linking a particular emotional or sensory state with a physical stimulus, such as a touch or a visual cue. For example, a teacher might use a specific gesture or word to help a child feel more confident before a test. (2) Reframing: This technique involves helping a child see a situation or problem differently. For example, a teacher might help a child reframe a difficult math problem as a fun challenge. And (3) Meta-modeling: This technique involves helping children become more aware of their language patterns and the language patterns of others, which can improve communication skills and self awareness. The study aimed to evaluate whether NLP techniques enhanced schoolchildren's performance at school, concentration, and attention, and decrease hyperactivity in ADHD children.
The study involved 120 children divided into two groups, the experimental and the control groups. Both groups received training on how to study. The children in the intervention group additionally received training on how to use NLP techniques."

Structured clinical examination is a key part of medical students' training, and it is widely acknowledged as a means of assessing the knowledge and ability of students in terms of decision-making. However, despite the efforts made to standardise the OSCE process, it still has several flaws, such as the variability of the trainers and students, the lack of standardisation between the OSCE evaluators, the time constraints due to the large number of ECOS per exam, and the need to cover a large number of subjects in a short time.
The aim of this research project is to optimise the performance of students during the emergency department (ED) internship, and to improve the final grade for OSCEs at the end of their studies by creating an OSCE-oriented ECOS training module in the ED.

Methods: 
The first step of the study will be to carry out a pre-test survey within 4 emergency departments in Paris. This will be followed by the creation of the ECOX module, the evaluation of the quality of it and the assessment of the students' mastery of the content in terms of know-how and psychological status. The ECOX module is made up of a box filled with ECOX grids (a series of clinical scenarios and a time limit), a poster outlining the main elements of the emergency department and essential patient data, post-it notes to facilitate the application of the ECOX method and improve patient follow-up, a booklet summarizing the main criteria of each emergency unit, and a checklist indicating the main items to be included in the ECOS by service or unit.
The ECOX module will be evaluated by using the SIRS questionnaire to gather student feedback on usability and user experience. A survey of the ED trainers will also be conducted to determine whether the implementation of the ECOX box has enhanced their own work. During the ECOS, the evaluators will also check in with the students to assess their mood as part of the psychological status, based on their STAI- Y scores.

Expected results: 
By completing this course, the research project aims to obtain results that show whether the ECOX module can be considered a useful tool for training medical students in the ED. It will assess its success based on improvement in the final OSCE rate and on feedback from students and teachers.
If the ECOX method proves relevant and effective, it could be used for the training of other categories of students, such as nurse practitioners and interns."

Background : Motor Neuron Disease (MND) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with high morbidity. It is considered a medical emergency that is progressive, severe and life threatening. The diagnosis of MND is made on a combination of clinical findings including signs and symptoms related to dysfunction of the motor system, and supported by neurophysiological investigations and imaging techniques that do not show any other abnormalities attributable to other diseases causing motor impairment. Most people with MND die from respiratory failure, and this can be a slow process that can last from a few months to years. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been shown to improve exercise capacity, sleep quality, and quality of life in some cases, and has been implemented as a standard treatment for MND in adults. Intriguingly, however, the effect of ventilation and the decision to offer it in the outset has not been systematically studied in MND. Patients and their families suffer from the physical, psychological and social changes that occur both with the disease itself and as a consequence of the decision about long term ventilation. Currently, the decision about the treatment with long term ventilation is made in a non - standardized way in clinical practice, with the focus on preventing respiratory failure. When patients and their families experience respiratory failure or discomfort, it can become a medical emergency that requires acute medical support and, possibly, intubation and mechanical ventilation that has both short and long term consequences for the patients and their partners and children. In most cases, however, the decision for ventilation is made because of a deteriorating quality of life, and before this can happen, the patients and their partners should be informed about the pros and cons of this treatment.
Objective : To examine objectively the effects of long-term ventilation support and the support of health care professionals on the quality of life of ALS patients and their families and to explore reasons for their decision making with regards to the treatment.
Methods : Long-term ventilation support will be defined as ventilation that is not intended to be used temporarily (e.g. during acute respiratory insufficiency), but planned to be used continuously and for an extended period of time. Patients with or without such treatments will be included in an active clinical intervention cohort study. Inclusion criteria for patients: A clinical diagnosis of probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria. Progression of the illness leading the consulting physician to offer NIV or NPPV in the outset of the disease. Can communicate in Norwegian. Inclusion criteria for partners of ALS patients: Partner of a patient that suffers from ALS with progression of the illness leading the consulting physician to offer NIV or NPPV in the outset of the illness. Can communicate in Norwegian. Inclusion criteria for children: Children from 8 years and older having a parent who suffers from ALS with progression of the illness leading the consulting physician to offer NIV or NPPV in the outset of the illness. Can communicate in Norwegian. Exclusion criteria for patients, partners and children of ALS patients: 1.Potential participants with cognitive impairment or dementia.
The following outcome measures will be used in the study: The primary outcome is the change in overall quality of life, measured by the Quality of Life Scale, which will be completed by the patient, his/her partner, and his/her children. Other outcome measures include quality of life measured by the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire, health-related quality of life measured by the Kidsscreen-27 and self-reported measures of health perceptions, psychological distress and burden of caregiving. In addition, patients' symptoms and survival will be recorded up to 2 years. Discussion: This project will contribute to the knowledge about the effect of long-term ventilation support in MND and the effect of this treatment with respect to quality of life, psychological distress and burden of caregiving. It will contribute to the knowledge base on patient care and decision-making in ALS and improve the quality of care in ALS. This in turn may improve the well-being of patients and help them to decide, based on more information, whether or not they wish to start with long-term mechanical ventilation, and how these decisions will affect them and their family. If ventilation has a positive effect of the quality of life, but not the symptom burden, it is possible that ventilation support can be a useful treatment for both patients and their families. If mechanical ventilation has a negative impact on the quality of life, it is reasonable to consider other methods of treatment, or to discontinue treatment if symptom burden increases.
This project will contribute to the quality of care"

Chronic subdural hematomas (cSDH), due to head trauma, have an estimated annual incidence of 1 per 1000 population. Though most cases will resolve following surgical evacuation of the hematoma, post-operative degradation in clinical status is common and it is often a challenging clinical dilemma in regard to optimal management.
Studying EEG signatures may help predict post-operative neurologic function. In general, post-traumatic spreading depolarization (SD) events are associated with post-operative worsening in patients with a cSDH. The primary goal of this study is to use EEG measures to differentiate between SD and non-SD associated cSDH.
Specifically, we will compare three EEG measures of SD associated cSDH: 1) frequency of SD, 2) duration of SD, and 3) volume of brain tissue involved with SD. These measurements will be compared to neurological outcomes (disability, cognitive function, and health related quality of life). The secondary outcome of this study is to assess the association of EEG SD events, when present, with clinical outcomes in patients undergoing surgical evacuation of cSDH.
By correlating EEG-related characteristics of SD in cSDH with outcomes as assessed by functional and cognitive measures post operatively and longer term outcomes, this study will provide insights into post-operative neurologic status and may impact clinical decision making and rehabilitation planning. Since EEG will be employed, our study will not impact the current standard of care. The proposed study aims to provide fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms of neurologic deterioration in patients with cSDH. The proposed study has several advantages: 
1. This study aims to provide important information to aid in clinical decision-making. SD events may be associated with deleterious neurological outcomes in patients with cSDH, and elucidating this may influence the decision to either observe or proceed with surgical drainage. Thus, this study will contribute to patient care and outcomes.
2. Because EEG monitoring is an easy and relatively inexpensive method, this study will provide a valuable tool for future studies investigating this same question.
3. This research is focused on patients with acute, as well as chronic, subdural hematomas. This is important as most studies have used only patients with chronic cSDH.
4. This study is relevant to most neurosurgical practices in the United States, where cSDH is a common occurrence in patients seen in the emergency room.
5. This study will be the first to directly relate clinical outcomes and patient-centered measures in patients undergoing surgical evacuation of cSDH.
6. Results of this study will be immediately implementable."

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic pathology characterized by relapses of neurological symptoms and a progressive worsening of neurological impairment leading to physical and cognitive disability. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool to monitor the disease and to assess the therapeutic efficacy of MS treatments. In our routine practice at the Toulouse Neurology Hospital, we prescribe regular follow-up MRI in patients with MS.
Ocrelizumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was designed as an interferon-β re-evaluation treatment in MS and more especially in Relapsing Remitting MS. Clinical trials have proven its efficacy in treating MS and its role in slowing down the cognitive decline and the physical disability.
This anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody has been distributed for more than 5 years in France for the treatment of MS. The ocrelizumab injection is a continuous treatment with initial 3 treatments per year, followed by one injection per year for two more years in patients with active MS.
Since its introduction in 2017, we have noted that the initial treatment was effective, but in some cases, clinical deterioration was observed after a year of follow up. These progressive diseases, which occur despite treatment with ocrelizumab, pose new concerns for the patient and the neurologist.
Consequent to this observation, the manufacturer has been contacted to allow an earlier intervention, with the option to inject again every 6 months. 
For the patient and the neurologist, the use of less than 3 annual administrations would be preferable to a monthly injection on one hand and to a weekly injection during 4 years on the other hand. For the patient, the treatment of MS has a significant impact not only on their physical and cognitive impairment but also on their family and social life. This impact can have several consequences such as an inability to work and travel and a substantial psychological impact. The medical treatment of MS must therefore be as effective as possible as well as well tolerated and accessible to all patients.
The aims of this study include:
To compare the evolution of two different frequency regimens of ocrelizumab for maintaining the absence of clinical relapses
To compare the treatment efficacy, the appearance and persistence of new T2 active lesions and new gadolinium-enhanced lesions on MRI after 2 years of treatment
To study the long-term impact of a semestrial treatment on clinical and biological activity in MS.
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the non-inferiority of the semestrial administration of ocrelizumab to the annual administration to maintain the absence of clinical relapses and avoid the formation of new MRI lesions on cerebrospinal MRI. Non-inferiority is defined as the absence of new active MRI lesions in 30 % of patients treated with the semestrical administration.
All patients included in this cohort are followed in the MS department of the CHU de Toulouse. They can benefit from MRI with a dedicated 3T device in the MRI center of the CHU de Toulouse.
The primary outcome will be the comparison of the absence of radiological disease activity at 2 years.
The second outcome will be the comparison of the absence of clinical relapses at 2 years."

Colorectal cancer has the second leading position among the major cancer types and remains the third most common of cancer diagnosis in our country, with the highest occurrence in men. The main treatment for the radical resection of tumors in the colon is a segmental resection where the section of the section of colon is removed together with tumor. This resection is performed according to the rules of the oncologists - oncologic principles (CRC principles).
The primary objective of radical resection is to obtain a tumor-free margin, which should be more than 1 mm, in terms of clinical oncology terminology is called ""R0"", i.e., resection for cure or complete remission.
For small non-invasive colonic adenocarcinomas, there are discussions for the use of minimal invasive procedures, which can be performed without removing full sections of the colon. This type of procedure is called Organ Sparing, Organ Preserving or non-standard procedures, e.g. endoscopic submucous dissection (ESD). In our study, we describe a minimal invasive procedure called the Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) which provides endoscopic and laparoscopic methods for performing a minimally invasive procedure for small colonic adenocarcinomas. In this study we will evaluate if it can be used in patients who are frail and over 75 years old.
The investigators hypothesize that CELS can be performed with regard to oncological principles and lead to increased patient-reported recovery. The investigators also need to determine whether the new technique has a higher risk of cancer recurrence compared with the traditional colonic resection with an intact mesenter.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
74 patients will be included in a two-armed prospective randomized controlled trial at the Dept. of surgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. Patients above 75 years of age or otherwise judged frail and fit to undergo elective colon resection for small (T1N0) colonic adenocarcinoma located in the proximal colon. Patients will be screened and examined pre-operatively by an oncologic MTD. Eligible patients will be randomized to either the CELS or the standard colonic resection group. In both the CELS and the standard colonic resection procedures, all procedures will be performed under general anesthesia and according to current oncological principles. The CELS group will undergo the hybrid endoscopic laparoscopic procedure, whereas the standard surgery group will have the colonic section removed using oncological principles. Assessment of postoperative morbidity and mortality, change in patients' functional capacity and quality of life, and assessment of histopathological risk factors and long-term oncological outcomes will be performed.
The investigators believe that the study design follows the criteria of good clinical practice. All patients will receive comprehensive information and provide informed consent. The trial has been approved by the Regional Ethical Committee and the Danish Data Protection Agency and is supported by grants from The Danish Cancer Society and the Copenhagen University Hospital Research and Innovation Team. It is registered in the Danish Clinical Trial Registry."

-----------------
Background:
Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are a heterogeneous group of over 70 disorders resulting from a defect in a specific type of muscle protein, such as neurofilaments, dystrophin, laminin, potassium channels, collagen proteins, troponin or creatine kinase. People with neuromuscular diseases may have difficulty in breathing. Spinocerebellar ataxias, the most common inherited ataxias, are another cause of neurogenic lung weakness. People with neurogenic lung weakness are more likely to have infections, lung damage leading to scarring or bronchial dilatation, and eventually require ventilatory support or are at risk of dying from respiratory-related cause. The treatment of lung damage is based on removal of secretions through airway clearance techniques and drugs to reduce infection and inflammation in the airway. The airway clearance techniques employed consist of simple cough techniques and chest physiotherapy, like percussion, forced expiration, and postural drainage. Aerosol delivery, that is, the delivery of drug into the airway during breathing, is often used. Aerosol delivery can be in the form of inhalation or nebulisation. Nebulisation involves turning a liquid medication into a fine mist that can be breathed in with regular breathing. Nebulised saline can help to clear secretions in the lungs and reduce the risk of infections by acting like a natural expectorant to thin secretions. People with neuromuscular diseases are at risk of breathing in too much salt into their lungs. This is called hypertonic saline poisoning, and requires admission to hospital for treatment with intravenous fluids and close monitoring. It is not known whether more frequent nebulisation of saline may lead to more salt in the lungs of people with neuromuscular diseases. This is likely to depend upon how much is breathed in, and the balance between the beneficial effects of nebulised saline and the risks of breathing in too much salt.

Objectives:
The objective of this study is to determine the amount of salt in the airway of people with NMD or neurodisability, following nebulisation of saline using different concentrations."

Gliomas are the most common tumors of the central nervous system, accounting for 20% of all brain tumors. Despite the many advancements, therapy remains challenging in many patients, particularly those with malignant, ""high-grade"" gliomas. Because of their invasive nature, these tumors are not able to be completely removed by surgery. For this and other reasons, radiation and chemotherapy are often given after tumor removal in an effort to eradicate any remaining tumor cells. Tumors are metabolically active, and use more energy from the food consumed, compared to normal brain. This increased activity can be visualized by a standard metabolic imaging approach, ¹⁸FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, there are only a few PET scanners, and many patients do not have access to them. This means that patients often have to wait months or years after their tumor removal for their first PET scan. This is usually not enough time for clinicians to make decisions on the effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy. This problem is particularly important in young or elderly patients who may have difficulty undergoing MRI scans or in those with medical conditions that are worsened by lying in the MRI scanner. They may need surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to be started as quickly as possible, leading to potential overtreatment in some cases and delay in therapy in others. The investigators believe that a new metabolic imaging approach using an MRI based approach, ""aMRI"" may offer advantages to both patients and physicians. The investigators have developed a powerful new metabolic measurement technique (named kᵢₒ*V) that can be used during MRI scans, in the same device used for structural MRI scans. This has been successfully used in animals to differentiate benign and malignant brain tumors in normal brains, but has never been evaluated in human subjects. The investigators first need to confirm that this method is robust and reproducible in human subjects, and compare it with the current standard of care, PET.
Based on its promising results in the above mentioned studies, the investigators have developed an MRI based approach to measure brain activity at 3 tesla in various disease states and in normal subjects. This includes:
- Patients with gliomas
- Metabolic profile before brain surgery
- Metabolic profile after brain surgery
- Metabolic profile in different conditions of the brain in which glucose metabolism is altered (normal subjects, diabetic patients, acute stroke patients) and
- Metabolic profile in different brain diseases (seizures, neurocutaneous syndromes, autism, etc.) and normal subjects.
For gliomas, the investigators will measure brain activity using the new aMRI approach in comparison to the current gold standard of PET. In patients with glioma, a tumor or ""lesion"" is an abnormal mass or area, detected on standard brain images, that is likely to be due to tumor. Surrounding healthy brain tissues normally show increased metabolic activity (shining bright in ¹⁸FDG PET) in response to the tumor, and this is thought to be due to the tumor cells ""feeding"". However, while the tumor is metabolically active, many of the normal-appearing, surrounding tissues which are thought to have the potential to eventually form tumor are still able to maintain good blood flow and provide nutrition. In addition, some normal-appearing tissues may not provide enough nutrition to maintain normal function and can therefore undergo some degree of damage, which can lead to problems with memory and thinking. The investigators will test their hypothesis that the MRI based approach, aMRI, can differentiate between the normal appearing tissues in the brain that are good and those that are bad, and thereby, identify new treatment targets in brain cancers. The investigators will also test whether the activity difference between the tumor and normal-appearing tissues is different in different forms of the disease, including benign and malignant types, and the type that is more or less likely to be sensitive to the standard chemotherapeutic drugs that are used currently in patients with brain cancer.
The investigators believe that this research project will make important contributions to improving the evaluation of brain cancer and development of new treatment strategies by directly comparing the MRI based approach to the current standard PET scans."

Heart failure (HF) is a major global health problem affecting approximately 64.3 million patients worldwide. HF and its chronic symptoms and progressive symptoms are associated with an estimated annual healthcare expenditure of $30.7 billion in the United States alone. Despite advances in pharmacological and device therapy, heart failure continues to have a poor prognosis with 50% risk of hospitalization or death within the first 6 mo after diagnosis, and average 5-year mortality remains at 50%. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) that maximizes evidence-based pharmacotherapy, including use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), beta-blockers (BB), aldosterone antagonists (AA), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), reduces morbidity and mortality in HF patients. Patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) have the most consistent and prominent benefit when GDMT is optimized. A key issue surrounding GDMT underutilization is the recognition that in primary care practice, the number of guideline-specified pharmacotherapy doses that require an up-titration, addition of a new class of treatment, or discontinuation of contraindicated medications can be substantial due to patient heterogeneity. Further, although current heart failure therapies (eg, ACEI, BB) help patients with HFrEF, there are recent developments in novel therapies including SGLT2i and ARNI. ARNI provides benefit over ACEi/ARB in terms of reducing the combined endpoint of death from any cause and hospitalization for heart failure. However, there is limited evidence on the use of novel GDMT therapies in real world settings especially in HFrEF population, when compared to ACEi/ARB. It is increasingly clear that multi-prong approaches (combination of strategies) are needed to further optimize GDMT among patients with HFrEF in primary care settings.
The purpose of this intervention study is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF seen in primary care practices. We hypothesize that the addition of (1) multiprong clinical decision support (CDS); (2) focused education; and (3) physician and pharmacist referral options, (4) enhanced by electronic patient note reminders and patient portal messages to enhance clinician and patient awareness of key HF guidelines, and (5) targeted at different primary care practitioners' (PCPs) behaviors and preferences will lead to GDMT intensification in patients with chronic HFrEF receiving primary care. The investigators are also interested in identifying specific combinations of interventions that result in the best improvement in guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in these settings.
This study is a single-blinded randomized parallel group study with a non-randomized factor (education versus delayed education) and will be conducted on 6 outpatient cardiology clinics within the Geisinger Clinic system. Approximately 4000 (1600 per practice clinic) patients with chronic HFrEF ≥ 18 years of age will be allocated via a stratified block randomized design into no intervention (control), multiprong CDS, multiprong CDS with pharmacist referral, and focused education at the clinic level. Patients in these four study arms will not interact with each other and will follow their individual study arms' randomization over a 12-month period.
To achieve balanced allocation of practices by cardiologist preference for pharmacist referral (P = 0.40) and cardiologist preference for electronic patient note reminders/patient portal messages (P = 0.70), the investigators will stratify by specialty (cardiologist or non-cardiologist) and by cardiologist referral habits over the previous 12-month period to estimate a 45%/45%/10% proportional distribution of clinics within these categories to the following arms (intervention/control, respectively): (1) no intervention, (2) multiprong CDS, (3) multiprong CDS+referral, (4) education.
Clinics will be randomized to one of the four study arms, after which each 24-month period within a clinic will be randomized to either early or delayed education rollout.

The intervention will involve adding multiple forms of BPAs in the electronic medical record (EMR). One will be an interruptive BPA that includes a GDMT order set"

The prevalence of urologic stones is about 10-12% in the general population which causes ureterocolic junction obstruction in about 1/3 in the course of time. When endourologic procedures fail to fragment this stone completely or it fragments the other segment of ureter obstructing the other side or is completely dislodged into one collecting system which then obstructs the whole urethra. In patients who have developed ureteric stone for the first time the possibility of spontaneous passage of these stones is about 40-50%. In cases where the stone is less than 6 mm chances of spontaneous passage is about 80% but in larger stones chance of spontaneous passage is about 30-40% of patients.
Stone clearance by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has improved significantly in the last two decades, with success rate and stone‐ free rates reaching 95% with new generation lithotriptors. However in patients with upper ureteric stone size ranging from 6-15 mm, despite the success rate, there is still 25-50% residual stone volume in the ureter after ESWL only. It is believed that alpha blockers play an important role in the treatment of ureteric stones, by augmentation of ureteric blood flow, relaxation of the peri ureteric fibrous tissue and hence facilitate stone fragment dislodgment and spontaneous passage.
Hence the investigators hypothesize that in patients with upper ureteric stones of size ranging from 6-15 mm the addition of tamsulosin therapy to the ESWL treatment protocol would lead to higher stone clearance by ESWL after one week of procedure as compared to ESWL alone."

Tracheal stenosis following a percutaneous tracheotomy is quite common and the surgical treatment of tracheal stenosis is usually successful. However, it is often associated with significant postoperative morbidity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the new non-invasive interventional treatment strategy with the cryoprobe and the Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC). 17 patients (17 women, mean age 60.7 ± 16.7 years) with a tracheal stenosis after percutaneous tracheotomy underwent a transarterial cryoprobe ablation plus APC. During or after the intervention, a self-retracting tracheal dilator (self-retainer) was inserted in the trachea. The stenotic site was examined endoscopically (directly after the intervention by a laryngologist and one month later during fiber optic bronchoscopy by a thoracic surgeon). The laryngeal-tracheal area was then imaged using computed tomography (CT). In all cases, the self-retainer was kept in place for about 6 months, up to tracheal and tube removal. All patients underwent decannulation after intervention, with a maximum follow-up period of 12 months. In all of the 17 patients enrolled in the study, the self-retainer was positioned correctly and retained its position, enabling complete decannulation with no complications after the intervention. One patient died from cardiac arrest at 3 months (no direct involvement of the technique). There was no significant deterioration in glottis morphology during the follow-up period. All patients were successfully decannulated. In conclusion, transarterial cryosurgery combined with APC plus the insertion of the self-retainer in the trachea appears to be an effective and safe treatment for tracheal stenoses resulting from a previous tracheotomy."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) frequently involves comorbid psychoneurotic symptoms such as anxiety, depression, borderline personality characteristics, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and other issues that affect a large proportion of the autistic population. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of psychiatric medication for psychoneurotic symptoms in patients with ASD, after establishing a therapeutic environment through psychoanalysis and other behavioral interventions. The study is divided into two groups, where one includes participants undergoing psychoanalysis and the other is a control group for comparison. Participants in the psychoanalysis group receive a 6-month-long weekly treatment of sertraline, duloxetine, and cognitive/behavioral therapies. The control group receives only medication treatments. Based on the results of our study, we anticipate improvement in the quality of life for those individuals with ASD who experience comorbid psychoneurotic symptoms after completion of medication and psychodynamic psychoanalytic treatments."

Contraception counseling is a critical component of family planning services with an emphasis on both clients’ experiences and providers’ quality of care. Evidence of poor contraceptive counseling is widespread, with multiple methods for measurement and many different aspects to consider. Conventional clinical measures for assessing quality of family planning counseling and its determinants could be used to support reproductive health. In 2017, Holt, Dehlendorf, and Langer created a framework for contraceptive counseling quality grounded in quality of care and human rights principles and research in healthcare communication. Based on this framework, Holt et al. developed and validated the Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale, which covers three interrelated aspects of counseling quality: information exchange, interpersonal relationship, and disrespect and abuse . The scale comprehensively measures aspects of the counseling process related not only to information receipt but also individuals' experiences having the opportunity to participate in the method selection process and the degree to which they had positive and trusting experiences with the provider . Associations between quality of contraceptive counseling and characteristics of clients, such as age, education, and reproductive status, could represent significant health disparities and indicate the need for research. This study will seek to understand quality of family planning counseling utilizing the validated and client-centered based QCC Scale as experienced by reproductive aged women in El-Dakhla District, New Valley. Furthermore, it will investigate their associated factors either client, provider, or visit factors. Data will be collected through a semi-structured interview administered questionnaire which includes: Socio-demographic characteristics of women Family planning practice: This will include number of living children, current use of FP method and its type, and suggested causes of discontinuation of FP, previous contraceptive use, and reason for the visit 3-Facility factors such as gender of providers, qualification of providers, type of the health facility (mobile clinics???) 4-Quality of contraceptive counseling (QCC) scale: it is a 22-item scale which measures the quality of care received by women during family planning visits. It includes : 1) information exchange, 2) interpersonal relations, and 3) disrespect and abuse in contraceptive counseling. The information exchange subscale consists of ten items, the interpersonal relationship subscale consists of seven items, and the disrespect and abuse subscale consists of five items. Item responses were given on four-point Likert scales. Response categories for positively worded items were completely agree (4), agree (3), disagree (2), and completely disagree (1). Response categories for negatively worded items were yes (1), yes with doubts (2), no with doubts (3), and no (4). Composite subscale and total scores were calculated as mean scores . Items of QCC scale: Information exchange factor During the contraception consultation, I was able to give my opinion about what I needed. I received complete information about my options for contraceptive methods. The provider knew how to explain contraception clearly. I had the opportunity to participate in the selection of a method. I received information about how to protect myself from sexually transmitted infections. I received information about what to do if a method fails (e.g., broken condom, forget a pill, feel an IUD is poorly placed). I could understand how my body might react to using contraception. I could understand how to use the method(s) we talked about during the consultation. I received information about what to do if I wanted to stop using a method. The provider explained to me what to do if I had a reaction to a method (e.g., allergies, nausea, pains, menstrual changes). Interpersonal relationship factor I felt the information I shared with the provider was going to stay between us. The provider gave me the time I needed to consider the contraceptive options we discussed. The provider was friendly during the contraception consultation. I felt the health care provider had sufficient knowledge about contraceptive methods. The provider showed interest in my health while we talked about contraception. The provider was interested in my opinions. I felt listened to by the provider Response Options: Completely agree - 4 Agree - 3 Disagree - 2 Completely disagree - 1 Disrespect and abuse factor The provider pressured me to use the method they wanted me to use. I felt the provider treated me poorly because they tend to judge people. I felt scolded because of my age. The provider looked at me or touched me in a way that made me feel uncomfortable. Response Options: Yes - 1 Yes with doubts"

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality, affecting young to middle-aged individuals with a devastating impact on their quality of life. Standard medical management aims at symptom control and the identification of potential triggers for fluctuations. In spite of various disease progression models, the identification of suitable therapeutic targets in order to personalize therapies is hampered by the variable course of the disease and incomplete understanding of the biological pathways associated with MSA. As a consequence, the optimal management of individuals with MSA is still defined by a multidisciplinary approach, but its implementation can be demanding, particularly in geographically dispersed populations. The impact of the disease, including autonomic, motor, and cognitive dysfunction can affect the quality of life of the patients, as well as the caregivers of the patients. The burden of caregiving is associated with physical and psychological morbidity.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a multidisciplinary, personalized treatment plan, based on a predefined standardized operational protocol and adapted to individual needs, in order to improve quality of life and reduce caregiver burden in individuals with MSA. With the advancement of technological solutions, this study will integrate telemedicine components with mobile palliative solutions, to improve access and continuity of care in an aging population. We plan to recruit 46 individuals with MSA fulfilling all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria for this trial. The study will follow a randomized, parallel design. At baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months after the baseline visit, the individuals with MSA will undergo a comprehensive clinical, psychological and neuro-rehabilitation assessment. The individualized treatment plan, including telemedicine and mobile palliative care offer, and therapy adaptations will be made based on the individualized assessment of therapeutic needs and healthcare preferences, and monitored throughout the 18 months study period. Twenty-three patients will be randomized to receive additional monthly and on-demand neurological, psychological, physio-, occupational and speech therapy telemedicine visits (based on individual needs). The therapeutic interventions will be documented, and the monthly follow-up visits will allow for the monitoring of caregiver burden and the identification of barriers to compliance. The study will be evaluated in terms of effect on the baseline to 18 months-change in the EQ-5D-5L score, the MSA-QoL score and subscores, UMSARS (video-based, rater-blinded assessment of the UMSARS motor score and Hoehn & Yahr changes over the study period), and the individual healthcare preferences of individuals with MSA and their informal caregivers. Based on our previous work on telemedicine in MSA, we expect to improve the coordination of care, adherence to the therapeutic plan and the overall quality of life within the 18 months of this study, to be eventually integrated as a standard component into the management of the disease. Successful management of the disease associated with improvements in quality of live and support in the informal caregivers will have a direct impact on the daily practice of healthcare professionals involved in the care of people with MSA. The proposed clinical trial will contribute to a comprehensive approach for the development of a new, patient-centered, evidence-based model of management in individuals with MSA.

The primary objective of the study is to identify molecular mechanisms and genetic profiles that contribute to growth response to growth hormone (GH) therapy in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS). ISS is a common condition, affecting approximately 2-3% of the paediatric population. Clinicians face the challenge of having to assess the likelihood of response to GH therapy among children with ISS before starting the treatment. The main consequence of a non-responder (poor responder) outcome is the withdrawal of an ineffective therapy, associated with significant costs, both personal and system-based.
The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that ISS has a partly, but nevertheless, genetic basis. However, this genetic basis might be heterogeneous and thus may vary among children with the same condition/phenotype. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the molecular profile (measured through genetic variants) will provide additional information for clinicians to predict treatment response after initiation of GH therapy.
We will compare the genetic profiles between good responders and poor responders to identify the differences in the frequency and count of genetic variants per gene/pathway that contribute to the different response to GH. The study expects to enrol 600 children with ISS, 300 good responders and 300 poor responder. Each participant will provide one non-invasive biological sample. The main outcome measure is the frequency and count of genetic variants per gene/pathway, which will be determined by a panel of genetic panels and the ISSomics® test (R&O Genetics GmbH).
To facilitate the dissemination of the study results, the participants will be asked to allow the use of data and bio-samples for future research purposes in anonymized and de-identified format."

Patients status post aneurysm coiling are prone to sleep disturbances, and sedative drugs given to improve sleep quality may cause complications such as respiratory depression, delirium, and prolonged ventilator dependence. The presence of the neurocheck (standard of care neurological examination) is an important cause of sleep disturbances by waking patients frequently during the night. This study will determine if adjusting the timing of the neurocheck has a significant impact on sleep quality as well as the incidence of acute neurological sequelae post aneurysm coiling. Informed consent will be obtained after recruitment on the inpatient medicine or neurology service. This study will enroll 29 patients. Based on past data, an expected median of 18 hours will be required for participants in the study.
The hypothesis is that decreasing the frequency of routine neurochecks from every hour to every other hour will result in an improvement in sleep quality and no significant change in the incidence of neurological sequelae."

Oropharyngeal and laryngeal carcinomas account for 90% of newly diagnosed head and neck cancer (HNC) in Denmark. In the United Kingdom in 2018, 3800 new HNC patients were diagnosed and 1940 died. In the US in 2018, 64,670 new cases were diagnosed and 13,780 died. A main risk factor for HNC is tobacco smoking, along with alcohol consumption and diet. Recently, the human papilloma virus (HPV) has emerged as a significant risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC). OPSCC is highly curable if treated, while laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, and oral cavity HNC are generally of a more advanced and poorer prognosis.
To improve patient outcome, accurate and reliable staging of HNC is crucial. Tumor extent at presentation is important for treatment decision-making, prediction of clinical outcome, and can also affect quality of life. Several risk groups and staging systems have been developed and are widely accepted. For HNC, staging of the neck is primarily based on clinical and endoscopic examinations of the patient.
Despite the availability of clinical and endoscopic staging, the diagnosis of HNC is frequently dependent on imaging, specifically CT and/or MRI scans of the head and neck. The radiologists use the scans to evaluate the primary tumor location, lymph node involvement, and presence of extranodal tumor extension (ENE). The radiologists assess the ENE on the CTs by looking for ""loss of circumscribed demarcation"" between the primary tumor and the lymph node. This is based on the assumption that the normal lymphatics are demarcated and therefore normal lymphatics should not cross. Thus, the presence of ENE relates to the loss of circumscribed demarcation of the lymphatic architecture.
This is the first multicenter study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists' assessments of ENE compared with the gold standard obtained via histopathology (the presence of ENE on the neck specimen, pathologic ENE [pENe])), as well as analyzing the prognostic significance of ENE. This study will serve as the basis for the development of a standardized reporting system for ENE.
For the purpose of this project, the investigators will define ENE as a tumor extension which appears to extrude the capsule of a lymph node or anatomical barrier. Radiologically, this is identified as ""loss of circumscribed demarcation"" between the tumor and the lymph node. The presence of this radiological finding will be defined as radiologic extranodal extension (rENE).
This is a retrospective, multi-institutional, international study based on data from consecutive patients treated for head and neck cancer. All patients eligible for inclusion must have sufficient imaging and clinical data available; this includes neck scans with or without contrast and either histopathology or clinical follow-up. The investigators will identify data from consecutive patients treated for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, carcinoma of unknown primary, laryngeal, or hypopharyngeal cancer and be over the age of 18. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria must be treated with curative intent via surgery, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy or a combination within the study inclusion period (1/1/1999-12/31/2020). Radiologic and clinical data available within a 3-month timeframe before the start of treatment must be available.
The investigators will only include HNC for this study if data of the imaging and the histopathology (primary or metastatic lesions) are available and if they could be traced back to a report of pENE. All patients should have at least two years of follow-up, or death. It is not necessary that all patients included in the study have ENE on the neck specimen (pENE) as only patients with sufficient imaging and clinical data can be included in the study. The study will include patients with pENE and patients without pENE in one single cohort. Patients treated palliatively at first presentation and patients presenting with recurrent disease will not be included.
Follow-up data will be requested from the participating centers and include data on recurrence, localization of recurrence, overall survival, and disease-specific survival.

Bone biopsy (BB) is the gold standard for diagnosing osteomyelitis in diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO)1. However, its use remains underused for various reasons. These include availability in some centers, high costs, and delays for conventional bone biopsies (conventional BB: surgical or radiological) which could lead to the loss of limb. In a few years, we have set up a simple blind biopsy procedure (Bedside BB) that involves a physician performing a biopsy through healthy skin at the bedside of the patient with DFU suspected of DFO. This procedure is effective, safe and has already been developed in more than 200 patients with DFO in the university departments of diabetology of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). Since its inception, more than 60 publications have studied the effectiveness of this new procedure in DFO: its safety, its equivalence to conventional biopsies, its sensitivity and its specificity in microbiological results. In order to extend the results of these preliminary and observational studies and to make Bedside BB a standard, the investigators have recently evaluated the feasibility of an randomised controlled trial comparing the safety and effectiveness of Bedside BB versus conventional biopsies. To evaluate the effectiveness, they have designed a multicentre open-label controlled non-inferiority trial. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the equivalence in treatment outcomes between Bedside BB and surgical conventional bone biopsy in patients with DFO. The investigators will recruit 200 patients with diabetes and DFO. The main endpoint (primary endpoint) is the remission of DFO without the need for surgery. The investigators aim to demonstrate non-inferiority of Bedside BB vs surgical conventional bone biopsy. The other secondary endpoints include clinical efficacy, microbiological results including sensitivity to antibiotics, costs evaluation, and quality of life evaluation. 

Inclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria: Patients with diabetes aged >18 years with a foot ulcer at least 3 weeks old and suspected of DFO Patients of either sex Aged >18 years,
Patients with diabetes,
Patient had at least one of the following sign suggesting DFO according to IWGDF 2019 guidelines.

African Americans (AA) are less likely to receive quality end-of-life (EoL) care. For example, goals of care conversations, which are critical discussions between clinicians, patients, and families near the end of life, are less likely to occur for AAs than for Whites, and preferences are less likely to be followed when they do occur. Instead, families are more likely to be labeled as difficult if their decisions are incongruent with clinicians' recommendations. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences of structural racism. Efforts to address disparities need to address multiple factors such as patient-level cultural identity and EoL care values, interpersonal- and community-level norms for EoL communication and treatment, and healthcare institutional contexts for delivering EoL care in a setting affected by institutional racism. Our research group began to address this need with 'African American Community Speaks', a proof-of-concept prototype of a community-developed training program for clinicians caring for AA older adults with serious illnesses. The program originally focused on rural Southern older AAs and is not broadly generalizable across the US due to geographic differences in culture, attitudes, and communication preferences among AA persons in the US. Thus, we propose to adapt our prototype program to urban-dwelling Southern and Northern older AA adults using our established platform of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) in two geographically diverse regions: Birmingham, Alabama, and the Bronx, New York. To create the new training program called 'Caring for Older African Americans', our team of experts in CBPR, medical sociology, and clinical trials will work with local Community Advisory Boards to: 1. Conduct a comparative ethnographic study of urban dwelling AAs in the North and South to describe AA community values and preferences related to EoL care; 2. Adaptation of our prior community-developed training program by integrating community-developed storytelling videos for empathizing with experiences of racism in EoL care, guidelines for culturally concordant EoL care delivery, and adapting an existing implicit bias management program to goals of care communication; and 3. Conduct a cluster randomized trial in which we will randomize training times to 1 of 4 start dates using a stepped wedge design to accommodate the training of all clinicians and to mitigate the effect of secular trends. Patients' personal experience of racism will be measured using the discrimination subscale of the Group Based Mistrust Scale. The primary outcome will be patient/family's perception of therapeutic alliance using The Human Connection Scale. Secondary outcomes will be family-reported goal-concordant care, and clinicians' knowledge of cultural values, awareness of implicit bias, and confidence to change practice. This innovative effort will be the first training program that: 1. addresses culturally concordant care, systemic racism, and implicit bias management, the three key elements in enhancing the provision of equitable care; and 2. is designed and implemented in full partnership with two distinct AA communities in the South and the North of the US."

Head and neck cancers are the sixth most common cancer common worldwide causing more than 380,000 deaths each year. More than 90% of these cancers are carcinomas epidermoids arising from the mucosal surfaces of the cavity oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx. Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck are classically correlated with risk factors linked to excessive consumption of alcohol and tobacco and have a rather poor prognosis (mainly HPV negative patients). However, the incidence of Head and Neck cancers in patients without alcohol-smoking risk factor has continued to increase in recent years, in relation to more and more frequent HPV contamination. Evolution of oral sexual practices seems to be one of the explanations for the progression of these cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and oral cavity HPV positive.

Objectives :

Objectives according to the nature of the intervention.
To assess the genetic profile of biopsy performed for the HPV + oropharyngeal or oral cavity squamous cells carcinoma.
To assess a better survival in HPV positive tumors as measured by:
1. the absence of distant and local metastases at 6 months after surgery
2. an overall survival of 1 year after surgery
3. an overall survival of 2 years after surgery

Expected results :
- Analysis of the profiles of expression and genetic analysis of oropharyngeal or oral cavity HPV positive and negative tumors in comparison with their clinical, pathological data in order to highlight molecular targets.
- Identification of new genetic targets associated with the clinical and / or metastatic evolution.
- Identification of new markers for more individualized treatments and / or monitoring.
- Knowledge of the resistance mechanisms of HPV negative tumors to cisplatin and radiotherapy based on the gene expression profile and / or genetic alteration.
- Know how to perform biological analysis of tumor tissue specimens.
- Improved understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of oropharyngeal or oral cavity head and neck squamous cell carcinoma."

The prevalence of chronic diseases in developed countries is increasing, and their economic impact on the healthcare system is high. Chronic diseases have a high prevalence in Western countries. Healthcare costs in the United States of America alone are 7.8 million dollars, and the prevalence of chronic health conditions in England costs over 71 billion pounds a year. In France, an epidemiological study found that 60% of the population has several chronic diseases, some of which require regular medical appointments. In addition, these sick patients often have jobs that require them to meet deadlines and targets or are subject to a hierarchical regime, which can lead to burnout, defined as a chronic loss of motivation and an increase in job dissatisfaction, particularly if there is a discontinuity between efforts and rewards. Healthcare professionals are also part of these sick patients, and the effects of their job and burnout are increasingly recognized, especially among physicians with professional qualification. The economic cost of work burnout is considerable for the company, which is forced to retrain employees. Workers who are frequently absent from work because of burnout often lead to low productivity and less quality care for patients. Anxiety or depression is not uncommon in healthcare professionals, with a prevalence ranging from 5% to 29%. Chronic health conditions can also have an impact on employees' emotional state. Psychological burnout can lead to depression, anxiety or substance abuse, thus influencing a workers' quality of life and productivity.
There is an urgent need to assess a sick employee's health status and psychological quality. Some tools exist today to evaluate the emotional state of a person but often rely on self-declarations which may alter the results. In addition, some questionnaires are very exhaustive and long, making it difficult for patients to answer them. An alternative would be to introduce more visual tools that avoid the tediousness of a long questionnaire, the patient answers being less subjective. Visual analog scales have proven reliable in a few studies. These scales are easy to use, they do not require a lot of education of patients and often patients do not have to answer to open questions. This scale could quickly assess and track the evolution of the patient's well-being. Visual analog scales, if they can be validated, could be used as a complement to the regular questionnaire of healthcare professionals. The investigator aims to implement a questionnaire assessing the emotional state of the employee to better understand whether the company should provide more psychological support, thus preventing burnout. The investigator does not aim to redo existing questionnaires or to create a new tool to assess psychological state. The main goal is to create a simple, visual and understandable tool to quickly assess well-being. In addition, the investigator does not aim to assess a sick employee's physical state (other questionnaires can already exist for this) but to focus on their emotional one and their relationship with their job, in order to prevent burnout and decrease the risks of an emotional disturbance that may worsen their quality of life."

Background: Alveolar ridge augmentation procedures are performed for the regeneration of the alveolar process. The aim of our study is to evaluate and compare the soft and hard tissue dimensions of alveolar ridge augmentation procedures with the use of different barrier membranes in the presence of different grafting materials.
Inclusion criteria: To be included, participants need to be older than 20 years old, without any contraindication for invasive dental procedures, indicated for dental implants if needed, having healthy oral soft and hard tissue (probing bleeding index <20%, and plaque index <20%), a minimum keratinized tissue height, and not needing a simultaneous bone augmentation surgery. All participants need to be willing and sign the consent form.
Exclusion criteria: Poor oral hygiene maintenance, uncontrolled periodontal disease, heavy smoking (smokes >20 cigarettes per day), uncontrolled diabetes, and alcohol abuse are all considered exclusion criteria.

For this split-mouth study, 80 patients with mandibular bilateral tooth extraction will be randomized in three groups:
Group 1: tooth extraction with an alveolar ridge preservation.
Group 2: two-stage alveolar ridge preservation with vascularized connective tissue graft in combination with autologous bone particle.
Group 3: one-stage alveolar ridge preservation with vascularized connective tissue graft in combination with autologous bone particle.
All participants will undergo an intraoral CT-scan at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks, and 6 and 12 months postoperative. In addition, the soft tissue dimensions will be assessed using STereoLithography files are superimposed and recorded by Cone-Beam Computed Tomography data at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.
The main hypothesis is that two-stage alveolar ridge preservation procedures with vascularized connective tissue graft in combination with autologous bone particle results in smaller alveolar bone and soft tissue dimensions in comparison to one-stage alveolar ridge preservation with vascularized connective tissue graft in combination with autologous bone particle.
The secondary hypothesis is that the soft tissue dimension of alveolar ridge preservation groups differs at different time points in comparison to the spontaneous healing group.

This study will compare the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in women who have had removal of Essure® contraceptive implants and in control patients who have had benign laparoscopic gynecological surgery. The pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1B, IFN-gamma, IL-17A) will be analyzed in the peritoneal fluid withdrawn. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines will be compared in the three groups of patients: Essure group (patient who underwent removal of the Essure® contraceptive implant), Control group with no endometriosis/adenomyosis (patient who underwent benign laparoscopic gynecological surgery and with no diagnosis of endometriosis or adenomyosis) and Control group with endometriosis/adenomyosis (patient who underwent benign laparoscopic gynecological surgery and with diagnosis of endometriosis or adenomyosis). For the first time, this study should bring new evidence concerning possible inflammatory processes in patients who have a removal of Essure® and it may help to understand the causes of adverse health effects observed by some women after the implantation of these devices."

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE: The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world hard, and older and vulnerable persons are more likely to get very ill when infected, and have the highest morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. Many patients stay on the ICU/hospital for weeks. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore geriatric rehabilitation will be very likely required.
Geriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study to get insight into the course of functional and medical recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe.
The secondary objective is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organisation of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive.
STUDY DESIGN: The study follows a pragmatic and observational design, and study-related data will be collected via a web-based data collection system on routine healthcare information from rehabilitation patients, which has no effect on their treatment and care in rehabilitation.
PARTICIPANTS: This pan-European study involves cooperation between several countries across the world. Participants are patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection that recovered from their infection and are admitted to geriatric rehabilitation for a rehabilitation treatment.
DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES: The information about demographics (age), gender and diagnoses will be collected from the patients’ own charts or from medical records of their referring general practitioner or hospital records. The information collected from their own charts will only include existing data, no additional procedures need to be performed to collect these data.
The following data will be collected at admission: demographics (year of birth/age, gender, premorbid residency), and if routinely collected data is available: level of ADL functioning (using the Barthel Index (BI) scale 0-20), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L scale 0-1), frailty (mMSE/SNAQ/NRS/MUST/Clinical Frailty Scale), cognition (MMSE/Demtect/ MOCA), mood/anxiety (/GDS/HADS), muscle strength (MRC biceps/quadriceps), fatigue (VAS scale), dyspnoea (VAS scale) and pain (NRS scale). Additional information that we receive in anonymised or descriptive way is the number of hospital readmissions, the length of stay in GR, discharge destination and ADL, quality of life, frailty, BMI, nutrition, cognition, mood/anxiety, fatigue, dyspnoea, pain, mobility/balance, muscle strength, and comorbidity/diagnostics will be documented at discharge.
In case of follow-up data, data will be collected for quality of life, fatigue, dyspnoea, nutritional status, frailty, post-traumatic stress syndrome and comorbidity and diagnostics.
All patient data are anonymised.
POTENTIAL BENEFITS: Rehabilitation care is designed to improve the overall situation of the patient in the short and longer run. By optimising the rehabilitation care for COVID-19 patients the quality and speed of their recovery can be improved.
In conclusion, the results of this study will lead to better insights in the course of recovery of post-COVID-19 patients and can give more insight in the treatment modalities employed, and can lead to better and more targeted rehabilitation care for this group. In 2019, the European Union developed the Joint Programming Platfora 2 ‘Preventing Mobility Disability and Promoting Mobility in Older Adults’. The goal of the platform is to coordinate and improve intersectorial cooperation, which is of paramount importance to improve the outcome of rehabilitation. We hope this study will contribute to this effort that seeks to improve the evidence base for the benefits of rehabilitation in the European Union."

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a health threat worldwide, with high morbidity and mortality among kidney transplant recipients. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is currently available in most countries. Immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2, however, is suboptimal in kidney transplant recipients. This impaired immune response is related to the use of immunosuppressive agents. Studies have demonstrated that patients that use everolimus instead of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) have a higher immune response after vaccination. Vaccine response against Varicella Zoster Vaccine (VZV) is also impaired in patients that use everolimus instead of MMF. Both the COVID-19 vaccine and the VZV require an optimal immune response to be fully effective. Therefore, we hypothesize that kidney transplant recipients who replace their MMF by everolimus, have an increased capacity to mount a specific immune response to both vaccines. The purpose of the ""PREPARE-iVAC"" trial is to evaluate replacement of MMF by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients on immunosuppression after vaccination. The main focus will be COVID-19 vaccination and vaccination against herpes zoster, but we will also investigate humoral and cellular immunity against varicella zoster. Moreover, we will evaluate safety of using everolimus instead of MMF in kidney transplant recipients. The hypothesis is that those who receive everolimus achieve better vaccine response, as measured by specific antibody concentrations and virus neutralising capacity, as compared to the MMF/MPA group."

Patients with chronic cervical spondylosis or neck pain are commonly prescribed with non-specific treatment approaches, such as local heat treatment and neck/shoulder strengthening exercises. Nevertheless, despite common implementation, evidence of the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions is uncertain, given the small number of low-quality studies in the literature. Some studies have demonstrated the efficacy of neck stretching in reducing neck pain and improving neck range of motion in this population. However, there is little information on the efficacy of stretching specific upper fibers of the trapezius muscle. Consequently, this study is designed to determine if stretching the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle (specific group), in addition to neck stretching, neck strengthening and heat treatment, is more efficacious than standard physical therapy (neck muscle strengthening and heat treatment) in reducing pain intensity and improving neck range of motion, and reducing neck disability in patients with chronic cervical spondylosis."

The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation. It is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). While there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. It is expected that the research team will find that the performance variables improve after receiving the treatment by means of the Tecartherapy. In addition, this study, the first of its kind on its subject, may be of interest to other sports entities to apply these techniques in their therapeutic routines, as well as in new rehabilitation protocols in sports practice. At the same time, the design of the protocol does not allow for biomarker analysis in blood samples, so no sample has been included for their collection, and therefore no blood tests will be carried out."

Background: Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can cause infertility due to the presence of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. It is also associated with changes in the microenvironment of the ovary as well as alterations in oocyte quality. In addition, Endometriosis is associated with the presence in the blood of a cell free DNA, it is therefore considered as a marker of inflammation. Objective: The main objective of this study is to evaluate the role of cell free DNA as a marker of oocyte maturation, fertilization, and implantation in patients with endometriosis."

The purpose of this study is to compare treatment outcomes of fully edentulous patients with maxillary IODs secured by bars or Locators. The primary outcome is the change in peri-implant marginal bone level 10 years after placing the overdenture. Other outcome measures will include implant and overdenture survival, peri-implant mucosa health and patients' satisfaction.

Maxillary IOD are a reliable alternative to a conventional denture and provide good retention, stability and esthetics. Several retention systems are available including bars and Locators. Bar-retained IODs are considered the gold standard, but are expensive and require a high degree of patient compliance. Solitary attachments or Locators serve as an alternative. However, these attachments are more economical, but they often need replacement and may not be as durable as bars.

This study will include 74 patients who were treated with IOD supported by four implants 10 years ago. The primary outcome measure will be peri-implant bone level. Additionally, implant and overdenture survival, peri-implant mucosa condition and patient satisfaction assessed with a questionnaire will be evaluated. These variables are of great importance when comparing outcomes of treatment with different IOD attachment systems.

This is a non-randomized study with no masking. The sample size calculation resulted in at least 74 patients being required for sufficient power. No interventions are planned.

The results of this study will contribute to the choice and use of IOD attachment systems, which will result in better treatment for patients."

Seniors with mild to moderate dementia have a poor prognosis. There is no treatment or cure for dementia. Family and community support are limited, but an innovative non-pharmacological intervention may help.
This research project (R01AG067388) studies the effectiveness of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) for individuals living with dementia. CST is a low cost and highly disseminable intervention that has been demonstrated to be feasible and efficacious in several RCTs and randomized controlled open trials across the globe. The study investigators have demonstrated it can be offered effectively in the USA. CST has been well-received by people with dementia, their caregivers, and clinicians and is the preferred therapy by Canadians and Americans with cognitive impairment.
The study investigators will implement this therapy in a clinical randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive CST or maintain with usual care. The investigators hypothesize that CST will improve cognitive and other functional status of individuals living with dementia.
Those enrolled into the study will receive a referral from their health care providers for 14 weeks of CST. The CST classes will be led by physicians and other health care professionals in their neighborhood clinics. The intervention classes will be tailored to the specific needs of each participant while utilizing the CST manual. CST manual has been highly standardized across 32 countries. The investigators will closely monitor study progress and report the number of participants recruited, reasons for recruitment failure, and any adverse events associated with the treatments. Primary Outcome Measure: Baseline and 6 months cognitive assessments by study investigators using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) exam, or the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
Secondary Outcome Measures: Patient Acceptance (measured by participant recruitment acceptance rate, attendance rate, and attrition rate). The investigators will also track adverse events and monitor participant satisfaction.
This research project is expected to last 5 years and will involve 1000 participants."

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common gastroenterological disorders with a reported prevalence of 10% to 20% percent in Europe and the USA and less than 5% in Asia. It manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett´s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). In the diagnosis of the reflux disease the DeMeester score is used as a measure of esophageal acid exposure time. Important differential diagnosis are benign functional disorders of the esophagus such as is functional heartburn or functional dysphagia. Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. The results are inconsistent: In younger patients (18 - 40 years) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) the prevalence of anxiety and depression is higher than in those without GERD. There is an independent association between GERD, anxiety and current depression. Patients with anxiety are more likely to experience GERD symptoms and these symptoms seem to be more severe in anxious patients. Anxiety and depression intensify symptom perception. Patients with GERD have a higher incidence of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances than those without GERD, and there is an association between psychosocial disorders and an increased risk of anxiety. Thus, there is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders, which has been discussed as the psychoemotional effects of GERD. GERD is considered to be an independent source of stress.

In the present study the hypothesis is that anxiety is significantly associated with positive DeMeester scores indicating pathologic reflux disease. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study with one measurement time on admission for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease referred to the Reflux and swallowing problems center of the Clinic for General and Visceral Surgery of the University Hospital Cologne, Germany, between January 2020 and July 2021. All patients were screened for anxiety and depression using the HADS questionnaire.

The HADS questionnaire is completed to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores. Furthermore, the modulation of anxiety on the severity of reflux symptoms such as fullness, heartburn and dysphagia is examined."

Objective: 
The diagnostic system based on ColonCAD - EYE (CAD-EYE) developed by Artificial Solution for a better detection of colorectal lesions (previously adenomas and suspected later ones; hereafter called colonic lesions) during the colonic examination. CAD-EYE improves the quality of colonic lesions detection by a 30% increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR).
The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of CAD-EYE compared to colonoscopy in screening for neoplastic lesions in Lynch syndrome.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria: 
Eligible patients will be included if they have a confirmed mutation for Lynch syndrome and a colonoscopy.
Exclusion criteria of the study: 
Patients undergoing total colectomy with ileoanal or ileosigmoid anastomosis, those with a history of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, patients with allergy or intolerance to PEG et Ascorbyl, and those unable to undergo fractionated colonic preparation are excluded.
Methods: 
A prospective randomized study will be conducted, including 8 centers, including 4 academic, 2 private and 2 university hospitals. 420 eligible patients will be enrolled and randomized to one of 2 study arms: 
o The CAD EYE group will undergo a colonic examination by a CAD-EYE-equipped colonoscope, under white light vision, with the CAD-EYE system switched on throughout the procedure. The physician's and CAD-EYE's predictions of histologic pathology of the colonic lesions will be reported separately;
o The CE group will undergo a colonic examination by chromo-colonoscopy with indigo carmine (IC) under white light. The physician's predictions of histologic pathology for the removed polyps will be reported. 
In the CAD EYE group, when polyps are detected, these will be identified with the DOT mode of the colonoscope, and photographs taken and reported. Polyp location, size with and without biopsy, will be reported by the physician. The endoscopist will remove all adenomas or suspected later lesions immediately by snare polypectomy.
Polyp location, size with and without biopsy, will be reported by the physician. The endoscopist will remove all adenomas or suspected later lesions immediately by snare polypectomy. 
Results: 
The primary objective of the study is to compare the detection rate of adenomas and serrated lesions in the 2 study arms (CAD-EYE vs. CE). 
The study also aims to evaluate CAD-EYE and CE predictive abilities for specific lesions and resect and discard strategy by comparing CAD-EYE histologists prediction to the physician's histologists prediction and the histological anatomopathological report. The performance of the CAD-EYE automated detection system assessed by its sensitivity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value will be compared to its automated prediction in comparison to colonoscopy indigo carmin chromo-colonoscopy. 
Colonoscopy time will be analyzed under the 2 study arms as well. 
The study should provide proof of the effectiveness of CAD EYE in the detection of colonic adenomas and serrated lesions in Lynch syndrome patients. The implementation of CAD EYE will also improve the predictive ability of the physician for this lesion. 
CAD EYE is expected to facilitate the adoption of a resect and discard strategy during colonoscopies in Lynch syndrome patients by improving the diagnostic specificity of the procedure. 
Finally, the system has a potential to reduce colonoscopy average procedure time. 
Expected results: 
Results of this study will provide a new tool to better detect colonic lesions in Lynch syndrome patients, while reducing the colonoscopy duration and the number of lesions taken care off.

Our primary objective is to demonstrate that use of enteral contrast in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with adhesive small bowel (ASBO) obstruction is associated with a lower rate of operative lysis of obstruction (operative LYO) compared with those who do not receive contrast. To assess the efficacy of our primary outcome measure, we will conduct a prospective observational study of patients admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of ASBO. The study will be conducted at five members of the Western Pediatric Surgical Research Consortium. The study will examine 314 patients with a diagnosis of ASBO and a trial of non-operative management (NOM) at discharge in order to prospectively compare the outcomes between these two groups. The primary study outcome measure is the operative LYO of ASBO. The primary endpoint will be the number of patients undergoing operative LYO based on contrast use during the hospital stay. We will also compare the length of hospital stay between the two groups. This study will provide information to guide future decisions regarding the use of contrast in the management of ASBO.
Our study design will enroll patients who present with ASBO, a trial of NOM on admission, and enteral contrast will be given with a repeat contrast study at 8-12 hours. For this study, an attending pediatric surgeon will diagnose an ASBO and choose to manage this patient by trial of NOM, a treatment decision we believe is most appropriate for young patients with suspected ASBO. All of the enrolled patients will be included as part of an outcome measure comparison. In order to assess the efficacy of the contrast protocol based on contrast use in the management of ASBO, we will compare the outcomes between patients who were enrolled in a study for early use of contrast and patients who were not. All of the enrolled patients will be included as part of the outcome measure comparison.
The primary study outcome measure will be operative LYO, defined as the need for surgery due to the failure of non-operative management.
This study is important to determine which patients with ASBO are best managed through a trial of NOM, and which patients are better managed by immediate operative LYO. The impact will be direct with an anticipated shift in the management of ASBO.
This prospective, multi-center, observational study will determine the relative efficacy of enteral contrast use and non-operative management in the pediatric population. While we do not anticipate any adverse outcomes from contrast administration being utilized at the six participating sites at the current time, we will monitor adverse events related to contrast administration prospectively to gather more evidence to guide the use of contrast in this setting.

Bronchiectasis is a chronic disease characterized by thickening of the bronchial walls, chronic cough, sputum production and prone to recurrent infections. Many factors can be associated with bronchiectasis: congenital abnormalities can affect the bronchial development, immune inborn deficiencies cause chronic infections and lung damage, while external insults can cause the inflammatory changes that lead to bronchial wall destruction. Patients with bronchiectasis present with non-reversible airway obstruction. However, in contrast to asthma, the improvement in airway obstruction in response to bronchodilators in bronchiectasis is less clear. Bronchodilators are still among the most common therapies used in bronchiectasis despite the lack of a clear effect on disease progression and treatment of airway obstruction. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in bronchiectasis might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. Theoretically, in bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry testing can potentially cause changes in lung function for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether bronchodilator response is influenced by the time between spirometry and bronchodilator inhalation. This will be determined by performing bronchodilator response test (BDT) in the following order: 1) 30 minutes of regular spirometry followed by 4 puffs of salbutamol; 2) 30 minutes later the same procedure with placebo will be performed. The secondary objectives are: a. To determine if bronchodilator response in various specific subset of bronchiectasis (cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), primary immune deficiency (PID), idiopathic bronchiectasis) differ from each other. b. To determine if bronchodilator response in patients with higher degree of bronchiectasis severity differ from patients with less severe bronchiectasis disease. c. To determine if bronchodilator response is influenced by age and gender of the participant. d. To determine if bronchodilator response in specific subset of bronchiectasis (cystic fibrosis, PCD, PID) is influenced by FEV1 level (FEV1 >80 versus <80) as measured by best FEV1 measured in the 6 months prior to the day of the study. e. To determine if bronchodilator response is influenced by the history of pseudomonas (positive or negative as determined by sputum cultures). f. To determine if bronchodilator response is influenced by personal history of allergy. g. To determine if bronchodilator response is influenced by baseline FEV1 (FEV1 >80 versus <80) as measured by all FEV1 scores obtained in the 6 months prior to the day of the study. 80 is the established cutoff as the difference between age adjusted predicted values to distinguish severe COPD."

Sex has long been a predictor of various physiological responses, including pain sensitivity. Studies have demonstrated that males and females differ in pain sensitivity, response to nociceptive stimuli, nociceptive processing in the central nervous system and the effect of hormones on pain perception. Gender identity is an important social determinant of health, shaping personal experience of the world, exposure to stressors and the impact of these on various physiological processes including pain modulation. Despite this, transgender individuals continue to experience more pain and poorer quality of life as compared to gender majority individuals. This is especially relevant to the health care system with transgender patients reporting difficulty accessing healthcare, often being misgendered, subject to discrimination and facing a multitude of mental health challenges. The aim of the proposed study is to study the effects of sex, gender identity and hormones on pain perception."

The aim of this research is to test the feasibility of providing an inpatient, stroke multidisciplinary technology enriched rehabilitation programme. The multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme will test the feasibility and appropriateness of using a technology enriched space within the hospital stroke unit. This will examine the acceptability and appropriateness of increasing time spent in rehabilitation activity delivered to inpatients in the acute/sub acute stage of their rehabilitation from an average of 1.6 hours a day, to around 4 hours a day, within a specially designed room which contains, wearable/mobile technology equipment, such as robotic devices, adapted treadmills, virtual reality, smartphones and tablet computers. The study will measure the dose and time spent in rehabilitation activity using wearable activity monitors. Semi-structured interviews will be completed with hospital staff and participants to assess the acceptability of the intervention. It is hoped that the work completed in this study will provide a method of delivering the recommended 4 hours of therapy a day, which should be achievable within a hospital stroke unit. This is essential given the current staffing shortfall of 30% in stroke rehabilitation. Results of the project will determine the potential for wider implementation of technology enriched rehabilitation within acute and sub acute hospital stroke units."

Background: Dyspnea induced by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a major determinant of suffering in ALS patients. The only palliative treatment for respiratory failure is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which compensates for failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea. The persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy). To date, several studies have evaluated the effect of IVR on dyspnea in respiratory patients. However, studies conducted in populations other than ALS have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of IVR. Several studies have shown the interest of auditory distraction through music on dyspnea. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort (scale A1 of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire) of patients with ALS at the stage of respiratory failure treated by NIV. Method: This will be an open-label, monocentric, randomized, controlled cross-over clinical study. ALS patients will be recruited during their respiratory evaluation carried out as part of their usual care provided in an ambulatory setting (day care hospital) in the Pneumology Department of Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital. The study consists of two sessions, each of 15 minutes, separated by a 30-minute break. The IVR session will be based on medical hypnosis, with a tablet (Samsung) equipped with Healthy Mind software, a virtual reality headset (GAMIDA), and headphones (Bose). The music therapy session will be based on the choice of music that the patient likes. The Random Order software (CleanWeb) will be used to determine the order of the intervention at the inclusion stage.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequent bacterial infection among women, and antibiotic treatment, most of the time broad-spectrum, is associated with an increase in the risk of resistance. Since the majority of women with lower urinary tract infection (UTI) are managed by general practitioners (GPs), this study aims to promote the use of susceptibility testings (ST) among GPs, by providing a new report that recommends a targeted antibiotic therapy, and thereby reduce the consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Since the early 2000s, the use of specific antimicrobials targeted at susceptibility profiles in GPs practices has been shown to lead to a reduction in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Bronner et al., 2006). More recently, the same approach, involving the use of selective reportings (SR) to promote ST in GP practices, was associated with a significant reduction in antibiotic prescribing in French primary care (Berenger et al., 2012). This SR approach is implemented from 2013 in all laboratories in France thanks to an inter-professional consortium in charge of its production (Consortium Interprofessionnel de Délai de Livraison des Rapports de Résistance). Indeed, the implementation of standardized targeted reporting by all clinical laboratories could be a major milestone to reduce the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in French primary care settings.
We hypothesize that a selective reporting among general practitioners would further reduce the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed among patients with E. coli UTI. We plan to compare four levels of treatment of E. coli UTI based on E. coli susceptibility, and their impact on the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Furthermore, given that the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic consumption may vary according to practice and patient characteristics, we plan to identify potential modifiers and mediators of this impact. Finally, we plan to measure the effect of this intervention on the rate of directed antibiotic de-escalation.
We will carry out a randomized controlled clinical trial among all GPs who receive ST from the LabOuest network (a public laboratory), and among women with E. coli UTI for which ST is performed in these laboratories over a one-year period. The sample size is estimated to 20 000 women.
This study is innovative in that it aims to optimize the use of ST by providing physicians with a recommendation that can lead directly to prescription of narrower-spectrum antibiotics."

Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells. Patients with acute ischemic stroke included in the study will be randomly assigned to low-dose sodium valproate group, high-dose sodium valproate group and placebo group. Besides receiving conventional treatment for stroke, 10mg/kg sodium valproate, 20mg/kg sodium valproate or normal saline were given intravenously for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The investigators evaluate whether sodium valproate can improve clinical outcomes and increase peripheral CD177+ neutrophil levels."

The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of a MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach can be superior or have an equal impact to existing standard weight loss tools. Our initial hypothesis is that this type of virtual coach can help in achieving a faster rate of weight reduction and may even improve quality of life. Additionally, we hope that the virtual coach may increase patient satisfaction. As there are no published, peer-reviewed articles on the use of virtual coaches in a surgical preoperative weight loss regime for obese patients, this study will provide the first insights into the use of virtual coaches in this population and add to the literature of aiding weight loss through digital resources."

Endodontic treatment failure remains one of the most common challenges for dentists even in the era of advanced materials and technologies. The root canal treatment protocol of the Vietnamese Dental Association, which requires sealing the root canal system after root canal preparation, resulted in a higher pain relief rate than the previous method by the Vietnam Ministry of Health, which does not seal the root canal system after root canal preparation. However, pain is still an issue that affects the patients' quality of life. The root canal sealer was used to reduce the number of visits for root canal treatment and to reduce the discomfort for the patients, thus reducing the treatment cost and the patients' inconvenience, which is one of the goals of the new national oral health strategy 2015-2020. The root canal sealer is expected to reduce or eliminate bacterial infections that trigger inflammation in tooth tissue. Currently, both calcium silicate-based sealer and epoxy resin-based sealer are clinically effective in the control of pain and in reducing complications from root canal treatment such as swelling, fistula, etc. Moreover, the application of the root canal sealer could provide a stronger and more resistant seal, preventing the occurrence of cracks in the root canal system. The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness in term of pain control and treatment outcomes of calcium silicate-based sealer versus epoxy resin-based sealer used for root canal obturation with the same endodontic treatment protocol with the support of an electronic operating microscope in a single visit."

Background: Complementary and Integrative Medicine (CIM) is a popular supportive approach among cancer patients. It has become necessary to integrate CIM modalities in cancer care. The use of homeopathy may be particularly beneficial for symptom management. Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the process of integrating homeopathy as a supportive approach to improve symptoms of cancer patients on an outpatient basis. Methods: Adults with cancer who are 18 years and older, who will undergo an integrative oncology consultation at the Division of Oncology and Hematology, Rambam Health Campus, will be invited to participate in the study. They will be invited to complete an interview that will focus on exploring the reasons for their interest in homeopathic treatment, as well as validated questionnaires to assess their quality of life. Patients that agreed to the interview will further be offered the integration of homeopathic remedies to their care. They will be followed up one month after integration. The question of the retention rate of patients in the follow up visit will serve as a measure of outcome and feasibility of the approach. The main endpoint of the study will be feasibility of homeopathic support as a supportive approach according to the completion of the questionnaire and retention rate of participants at the one month follow up visit. In addition, the main changes in the quality of life questionnaire will be recorded. Qualitative analysis of the interviews will be performed in order to better understand the reasons and experience of the patients.

Thrombophlebitis remains a major complication of vascular catheterization, whether central or peripheral. Septic form in particular represents 25% to 30% of catheter infections and 5% to 20% of catheter failures, leading to catheter removal and, consequently, an increase in the number of invasive procedures required during antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis of thrombophlebitis, and in particular septic thrombophlebitis, requires a combination of clinical, biological and ultrasonographic signs. Doppler, usually performed during hospitalization, is the most relevant and recommended imaging examination to confirm the presence of thrombosis. However, it has never been specifically evaluated in the diagnosis of septic thrombophlebitis. Our primary goal is to determine the proportion of patients with septic thrombophlebitis with a positive venous Doppler ultrasound on days 8, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90. Our second objective is to assess the predictive factors for 30-day septic thrombophlebitis and for the disappearance of venous Doppler ultrasound signs of septic thrombophlebitis at 1 month."

Background: Relapsed/refractory (r/r) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) remains a significant clinical challenge with a need for novel treatment options. Achieving deep responses or a cure is more challenging in patients with r/r cHL. CD30 targeted therapies have improved the treatment of r/r cHL. In the past year, an anti-CD30 bispecific antibody (bsAb), Odronextamab (ODX), has been used in combination with lenalidomide (RDx) in patients with r/r CHL. RDx produced deep, durable, single-agent responses in patients with r/r cHL, and the addition of ODX to the regimen has resulted in a more favorable response compared to the standard of care RDx-based regimens (RR10, RD13, ORR of 83% vs 30%; median PFS of 44 vs 4 months) in the ongoing TEMPO2 study (NCT03503279). This study has generated interest in testing the safety and efficacy of ODX in combination with lenalidomide for r/r indolent lymphomas.
Objective: To perform a pivotal Phase III randomized clinical trial to further explore the safety and efficacy of ODX in comparison to R2 in patients with r/r indolent lymphomas.
Design: This study was initiated based on the ODX development plan and rationale for RDx treatment in r/r indolent lymphomas (FL/MZL) and its potential to provide a new treatment option for patients with these conditions. This study is designed as a two arm, Phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter study. The study arms will contain an experimental arm with odronextamab + lenalidomide (ODX), and the R2 arm, consisting of two consecutive blocks of R2 (rituximab and lenalidomide) followed by lenalidomide monotherapy until progression or end of study (EoS). Dosing for the study will be based on previous reports of ODX in Phase I trials. Data supporting the dosing and schedules for lenalidomide and rituximab in both study arms are well known.
Specific studies have been designed to better understand the pharmacokinetics of ODX in this setting of r/r FL/MZL.
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether ODX in combination with lenalidomide (ODX+LD) is superior to rituximab in combination with lenalidomide followed by lenalidomide monotherapy (R2/LD, R-blocks followed by lenalidomide; R2) with regard to the best overall response rate according to the 2018 Lugano classification for follicular lymphoma at end of study (EoS) visit, in patients with R/R indolent lymphoma (FL and MZL).
Inclusion Criteria:
1 Age 18 to ≤ 90 years, male or female
2 Patients with r/r follicular or marginal zone lymphoma (FL/MZL)
3 Patients must be refractory or have progression after at least 2 prior lines of systemic treatment
4 Patients must have measurable disease on cross sectional imaging"

Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory diseases affecting the soft tissues and the underlying bone and periodontal ligament, which support the teeth. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by gingival inflammation, periodontal breakdown, and bone resorption in the periodontal tissues. Ozone has antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties that have been suggested to be effective in the treatment of gingival and periodontal diseases. Ozone treatment has been recommended not only for the prevention and management of periodontitis, but also to reduce bleeding on probing and gingivitis in healthy patients. Although ozone therapy could improve periodontal health, the available literature is still not clear about the mechanism of action and the extent of ozone antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, there is a lack of evidence for the treatment of periodontitis with ozone alone. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of immediate ozone application on the reduction of the gingival inflammation and the severity of periodontal breakdown, the reduction of the amounts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Tannerella forsythia counts as compared to the levels seen after non-surgical periodontal treatment alone. The present clinical randomized controlled trial involves 24 patients for each study group divided into 2 groups: an Ozone group and a control group. All the patients will be evaluated for plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, periodontal probing pocket depths, and the amounts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Tannerella forsythia counts in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) at different study time points (baseline, after non-surgical periodontal treatment, 1st and 3rd months after treatment). The ozone group will receive 3 times of gaseous ozone immediately after non-surgical periodontal treatment. The control group will receive non-surgical periodontal treatment only.  This study will provide a better understanding for the treatment of periodontitis with ozone alone, based on the current and potential future practice."

Pterygium is a benign degenerative disease of conjunctival tissue. The aim of this study is to identify cell proliferation markers (CD44, PCNA and E-cadherin) in surgically removed pterygia compared to conjunctival tissue from normal control patients. The researchers hypothesized that pterygium cells express different cell proliferation markers compared to normal conjunctival tissue. Conjunctival samples will be taken from patients with pterygium and normal conjunctiva samples from 30 healthy individuals. The immunohistochemical and histopathological staining findings will be reported using a light microscope and an image analysis system. The study will contribute to better understanding of the pathogenesis of pterygium and help in developing new therapeutic strategies for treating the disease."

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) account for 5-15% visits to primary care, 3-15% hospital admissions and 4-11% deaths. Both young healthy adults as well as frail vulnerable elderly suffer from RTIs. The former are known to have a stronger immune response to vaccinations, leading to high protection rates. In contrast, the latter have been reported to carry a high burden of RTI-related mortality despite being vaccinated with RTI-preventing vaccinations. A likely reason for this is their severely weakened immune system, even after RTI vaccination, allowing RTI-induced immune suppression to develop to such an extent that vaccination is no longer effective. The nose/nasal cavity is recognized as the main site of RTI development, as the majority of RTI-causing pathogens enter the respiratory tract through the nose. Thus, the immune response in the nose is the first line of defense against RTI-causing pathogens. CD8+ T cells are the main cell type mediating clearance of RTI-causing pathogens in the nose. In the last years, we have performed several pilot projects showing a marked decrease in CD8 T cell frequency in the nose of healthy aging adults. Our most recent pilot studies indicate that this decrease is even more profound in frail older adults and even more so after RTI development. We here propose a longitudinal controlled study aiming 1) To unravel the underlying mechanisms and consequences of the loss of T cells and/or other immune cell populations that is responsible for the increased RTI susceptibility in older individuals; 2) to assess the added value of repeated (seasonal) sampling during 5 months to assess immune response dynamics to SARS-CoV-2, a well-known respiratory pathogen that is also responsible for large numbers of nosocomial infections, and; 3) to dissect the role of sex-differences in RTI susceptibility in both young healthy adults and frail older adults. The data obtained in our proposed project will contribute to designing more effective RTI prevention strategies in older adults."

Background: Liver cirrhosis is the most important cause of ascites in clinic. Cirrhosis can progress by development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).  SBP leads to development of portal hypertension in addition to development of portal systemic shunt with progression of the disease until the patient develops terminal hepatic outcome. 
The diagnosis of SBP relies on laboratory test that includes presence ≥250 polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL)/mm3 in the ascetic fluid in absence of surgical and treatable causes of intra-abdominal infections. However SBP  is associated with several predictive factor of poor outcomes of SBP. 
Methods: The study will include fifty cirrhotic patients with ascites. In the study there are two parts and two study arms. Study arm 1 will include 25 cirrhotics with ascites who will be treated with ceftriaxone intravenously for 5 days. The second study arm will be another 25 cirrhotic patients with ascites who will not receive ceftriaxone for 5 days. 
Blood samples from all participants will be taken in the first and fifth day of starting treatment and also on the fifth day if not developed SBP symptoms. The labs studies include platelets to lymphocytes ratio (PLR) and monocytes to lymphocytes ratio (MLR). This research will be conducted in the Tanta University Hospital, Hepatology and gastroenterology department. 
Analysis will be done on both groups (treated and untreated) to evaluate the effect of ceftriaxone treatment on survival rate of the cirrhotic patient with ascites. 
Expected Results: The results will be expressed in percentage and mean (standard deviation). 
Comparison between the groups in each time ( first day and fifth day) will be made using the student t-test. Also we will compare the difference between the last day (after five days from starting treatment) in the treated arm and the untreated. 
This study will help in predicting the response to treatment in cirrhotic patients with SBP."

Dyspnoea is a common symptom in the Emergency Department (ED). Despite the relatively high incidence of serious underlying conditions such as heart failure, pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, the diagnostic accuracy of these diagnoses might sometimes be low in the ED. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) might increase the diagnostic accuracy, but the findings of previous studies might be affected by selection bias. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether POCUS performed by a variety of emergency physicians improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with dyspnea.
Inclusion criteria: Adult patients presenting to the ED within the highest or second highest triage category with dyspnea or hypoxia will be eligible for the study.
Intervention: An emergency medicine specialist or resident will according to a structured protocol perform POCUS focusing on the heart, inferior vena cava and lungs. The foundings will be handed over to the initial physician with responsibility for diagnosing and the diagnosis will be dichotomised into being or not being the reason to present to the ED. The estimated likelihood of the diagnoses (heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, asthma exacerbation, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, pleural fluid and pericardial fluid) is documented before and after POCUS has been performed. Bloodsamples will be drawn after inclusion to assess biomarkers (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count). Chest imaging (X-ray or CT) will be performed at the ED physicians discretion according to routine diagnostic work-up.
Study type: Convenience sample prospective observational study.
Expected results: The investigators estimate that POCUS increases the diagnostic accuracy of underlying serious conditions in patients with dyspnoea. The investigators expect that the additional examination with POCUS will lead to a changed estimated likelihood of the six above mentioned diagnoses.
Ethics and dissemination: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration and have ethical approval from the Regional Ethics Committee in Lund.
The results of the study should be published in peer reviewed scientific journals and submitted to a national or international conference. The findings should also be disseminated to clinicians in the ED and to other emergency physicians in Sweden and in other countries.

Breast Cancer is a heterogeneously different disease in terms of pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, disease progression and response to therapy, as well as prognosis and survival. While local management of breast cancer may provide adequate treatment in early stages, locally advanced breast cancers must be treated with surgery followed by combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy to improve long-term survival. In this setting radiation reduces the risk of local residual disease, recurrence, and distal metastases up to 10 years after radiation. Despite the benefits of radiotherapy there is little to no consideration of the effects on the patients' quality of life (QoL) while planning and delivering radiation therapy. Previous studies have shown that adjuvant therapies have a lasting and long-term impact on the quality of patients' lives, with more severe effects in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation. Radiation dose to the heart has been shown as a major contributor to cardiac complications in radiotherapy for left-sided breast cancer. Patients with left-sided breast cancer are therefore particularly at risk for radiation-induced coronary artery disease. Breast cancer patients who have undergone radiotherapy to left breast can experience reduced function of the heart muscle on the side of the breast receiving radiation, even many years after the treatment. The increased risk for cardiovascular disease is of particular concern for breast cancer survivors. Thus, the dose of radiation to organs outside the target, such as the heart, is important to consider in breast cancer therapy. Although recent advances in high precision radiation therapy have improved the targeting and consequently the reduction of dose to organs outside of the treatment target, the radiation dose to the heart continues to be a major concern. A number of strategies have been developed to keep the radiation dose to the heart as low as possible. Most recent developments involve respiratory techniques that enable radiation oncologists to position patients to maximize tumor target coverage and minimize cardiac exposure by utilizing the distance between the moving heart and the adjacent breast tissue during deep inspiratory breath holds. Patient cooperation to enable the radiation oncologist to achieve these goals is critical, but it is dependent on patients' respiratory skill and mental and psychological well-being. The investigator's preliminary results demonstrate that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, reducing radiation dose to the heart. However, DIBH training regimens may not fully address patients' mental stress and anxiety that interfere with their ability to perform deep inspiration breath holds optimally. Preliminary data in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance and anxiety and comfort. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis by determining the impact of these training techniques in the context of radiation therapy for left-sided breast cancer on heart dose reduction. While radiation oncologists are aware of cardiac concerns, they lack tools to facilitate these psychological aspects of care in the context of radiation therapy. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R) will improve patients' DIBH performance skills and further reduce heart dose, while alleviating anxiety and stress and improving quality of life during and after radiation therapy. The results of this proposal will contribute to the development of novel patient-centered training and integrative health regimen to further improve the success of advanced technology-based cardiac dose reduction in breast cancer therapy, and improve cardiac health in breast cancer survivors."

Background (Rationale): Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with very low 5-year survival rates across all stages. Over 100,000 patients are diagnosed with PC in the U.S. With an estimated 45,750 PC death toll (male 22,400, female 23,350), the estimated pancreas cancer death is higher than the breast cancer and colon cancer combined, and the incidence is expected to grow in coming years due to an aging population, obesity rates and the high prevalence of heavy smoking. Unfortunately, the current treatment options for patients with resectable PC do not produce durable disease control once a tumor has recurred. While chemotherapy helps reduce the chance of disease recurrence and improves survival, this effect is typically short lived.
The interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) pathway, an inflammatory pathway, plays an important role in tumorigenesis, cancer progression, angiogenesis and metastasis. Activation of this pathway is associated with aggressive, metastatic and treatment-resistant cancer. Inhibitors of the components of the pathway can prevent migration, invasion and the proliferation of cancer cells in several preclinical cancer models. Canakinumab (ACZ885), a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-1beta, and tislelizumab (BGB-A1217), an immuno-oncology therapy that can enhance a patient's own anti-cancer immune responses and enable the patient's T-cells to target cancer cells, offer new therapeutic approaches for PC. The combination of nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and a IL1beta-targeting antibody in a neoadjuvant setting has the potential to improve outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed resectable PC. The goal of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a combination of tislelizumab, canakinumab, Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with newly diagnosed resectable pancreatic cancer.

The objective of this research is to design and test a step wedged implementation of a digital supported intervention using family and youth peer navigators. The study aims to improve access to mental health navigation, resources, and a wellness app, which can improve outcomes for children (ages 12-22) with mental health needs. The study is taking place in Los Angeles, specifically in 10 schools selected for their racial and ethnic diversity, and in 10 primary care clinics in Riverside County, where 20% of families have no health insurance and 62% are at or below poverty levels. The study will utilize a Participatory Design process to co-design a digital tool and peer navigation strategies. Once designed, all schools and clinics will enter a care as usual period for 1-3 years and then cross over to receive the app and peer navigation.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the role of pioglitazone in vascular Sphk1 expression and of the proteome and transcriptome remodeling mediated by S1P in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in individuals with diabetes mellitus and with a history of heart disease for the last five years. Research hypothesis: Pioglitazone can induce vascular transcriptional and proteome remodeling through S1P action; the action of S1P can be monitored by increased expression of S phk1 and increased S1P content in isolated HDL. It is expected that pioglitazone increase 10-fold Sphk1 expression and S1P content in isolated HDL. Pioglitazone 45 mg/day for five days after hospital stay, will be administered to the randomized patients from the cardiac surgery outpatient clinic."

The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the glucose lowering effect of 3 new coated bead (CB) formulations containing glucose, caffeine, maltodextrin, magnesium stearate and colloidal silica (APH-001A, APH-001-B, APH-001C) is more pronounced compared to a CB coated with the same excipients but without the glucose and caffeine components (APH-001D). Furthermore, it is hypothesized that these beads are more effective compared to a different type of uncoated beads coated with the same excipients with glucose and caffeine components (APH-001E).
In order to examine this hypothesis, the secondary endpoints are listed as follows:
1. Maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration time curve (with or without a meal) of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and caffeine after administration of 3 new CB formulations of glucose, caffeine or plain glucose coated beads in 5 periods of the study under fed conditions.
2. Testing of the pharmacokinetic parameters of a 3 g glucose bead coated with 90 mg maltodextrin, 50 mg magnesium stearate and 400 mg colloidal silica (APH-001A) against a 5 g glucose bead coated with 1480 mg maltodextrin, 800 mg magnesium stearate and 5600 mg colloidal silica (APH-001D).

Patients with OSA often suffer from hypertension. A large-scale retrospective observational study found that the prevalence of OSA in hypertension patients with daytime sleepiness or sleep disturbances was more than 80 percent. There is a close relationship between 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure in OSA patients, 24-hour systolic blood pressure increased by 5.2 mmHg and 6.5 mmHg in uncomplicated OSA patients and OSA patients with hypertension. The blood pressure in daytime sleepiness and sleep disturbances are the most serious, but the rhythm pattern of 24-hour blood pressure is often irregular, and there is no large scale prospective study on this. The blood pressure improvement of OSA patients during the treatment of OSA may be mainly the normalization of blood pressure rhythm. The purpose of our study is to observe changes in blood pressure rhythm of OSA patients after 3 months of treatment with CPAP device. We want to compare the blood pressure after 3 months of treatment between the inpatient care and telemedicine, and then to determine whether CPAP device treatment can effectively improve the out-of-time blood pressure rhythm of OSA patients after 3 months treatment, and to explore the effective intervention mode, so as to improve the clinical prognosis of OSA patients, promote the use of telemedicine, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), consisting of at least one apnea (cessation of respiration for at least 10 seconds) or at least 5 hypopneas (at least 50% decrease in airflow and arousal), ≥5 but <15/h, and/or a 4% decrease in oxygen saturation. The 3-month follow-up will be done at the sleep center, and the blood pressure rhythm will be measured and questionnaires will be completed. If the blood pressure after treatment improves significantly (decreased ≥15 mmHg), patients will undergo a follow-up for a further 6 months by telephone to monitor the recurrence of hypertension and the changes in blood pressure rhythm. A total of 55 OSA patients in each arm will be required to recruit, so 110 patients (55 in each arm) will be recruited in our study."

Background: The use of analgesics for pain management after the operative delivery of a baby by cesarean section is widespread. However, the success of the analgesic is partly dependent on the manner in which medications are administered, including how the delivery of the medication is communicated to the patient. However, even when administering an effective analgesic, patients may continue experiencing significant pain. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is that verbal communication plays an important role in how the patient will perceive the analgesic efficacy. The current study aims to investigate whether enhanced verbal communication about the administration of medication can modify pain perception following cesarean section, and whether the efficacy of analgesic medication varies with an enhanced pain management training. Methods: The study will be carried out in the maternity ward at Carmel Hospital. The study population will include patients who are about to undergo an elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. The recruitment will be done pre-surgery. Following consent, participants will receive an explanation about how to assess pain and will fill out the research questionnaires. Communication is the independent variable in this study, which has 2 levels - the increased communication arm (intervention) and the normal communication arm (standard of care). Each arm will include 40 patients who will be randomly divided between the arms. The dependent variable is the treatment efficacy, based on the changes in the intensity of the patient's pain one hour after the administration of analgesic. Assessments will be performed one and two hours following spinal anesthesia and 12 hours following cesarean section.

The objective is to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical care via telephone through the Celeste randomized clinical trial, with 200 elderly patients with controlled blood pressure, allocated to in-person or telepharmacy groups. The data will be collected at baseline and during the follow-up of the 3 months of the study. The intervention strategy consists of the standardization and documentation of pharmaceutical care in the experimental group, carried out by a trained pharmacist through telephone contact with the patients. An educational intervention is applied, with counseling, therapeutic reconciliation, clinical monitoring and resolution of medication-related problems. The data collection tools have pre-defined criteria for inclusion of patients in the project. It is proposed to create a database for collection, management and control of information, providing tools for analysis of socio-demographic, clinical and epidemiological characteristics. The statistical analysis will be done separately for each group, using the SPSS 20 statistical software. A 95% confidence level (α = 0.05) will be used for data analysis, with non-parametric tests for numerical variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. There will be a descriptive characterization of the sample in the experimental and control groups, and their clinical characteristics on admission. The following comparisons will be made: clinical importance of the prescription, controlled blood pressure, adherence to the treatment and clinical relevance of the interventions, as well as patient satisfaction. The hypothesis is that there will be a positive effect on the variables of the study, such as controlled blood pressure, treatment adherence and clinical relevance of the interventions between the two groups. This project aims to generate knowledge in pharmaceutical care, highlighting and improving current care services for the elderly. Additionally, it will add to the growing evidence regarding the effectiveness of telepharmacy in public health primary care."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common male cancer in Finland and most western countries. PCa is known to affect the quality of life as well as life span of the men diagnosed with it. Although a lot of effort has been put into the prevention and treatment of this type cancer, there are still significant knowledge gaps concerning the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Epidemiological data suggest that there is a 40-fold variation in the incidence of PCa between different populations. In this context, epidemiology provides evidence that lifestyle, including smoking habits, nutrition and physical activity, influence PCa risk. The microbial colonization, i.e. gut microbiota, present in the intestine is known to affect many metabolic processes and diseases in the human body. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggest that gut microbiota composition might also affect PCa risk.

The purpose of our study is to better understand the role of gut microbiota composition in benign prostate hyperplasia (SHPB) and PCa. For the clinical part of the study, a cohort of men with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer will be recruited. The samples will be collected before and after medication that affects the levels of androgen hormone (ADT) or 5-α reductase inhibitors, respectively. 

In addition, the following metabolic factors will be assessed:
- Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
- Steroid hormones: testosterone, DHT, estradiol to testosterone ratio, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)
- PTH (parathyroid hormone)
- FGF23 (Fibroblast growth factor 23)
- Microbiota composition in the gut and feces
- Fecal and serum steroid metabolites that can be determined using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry

The microbiota composition will be assessed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. 

The outcomes of the study should provide a better understanding of the potential role of gut microbiota in PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia, and may lead to the creation of novel non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic methods for these diseases. Additionally, insight gained from this project might pave the way for novel lifestyle-based interventions aimed at lowering the risk of PCa."

Gliomas are the most frequent malignant brain tumors in adults. The grade of malignancy is assessed according to the IDH mutational status and the 1p19q codeletion status, established on an ex vivo tumor specimen.
In the case of glioblastoma and metastatic glioma, the survival prognosis is poor. For other grades, patients have a good prognosis when these tumors are fully removed. Tumor recurrences are frequent and associated with the development of resistance mechanisms.
The diffusion MRI technique and metabolic spectroscopy are imaging modalities that could be used to distinguish recurrences from regrowths and to better target the biological status of the tumor.
In gliomas, the concentration of 2-Hydroxyglutarate (2HG) is measured by MRS at the time of surgery and 6 months after the beginning of treatment (chemoradiotherapy or targeted treatment). The concentration of 2HG is correlated with the histologic status and 1p19q codeletion status. The goal is to assess the evolution of 2HG concentrations in various recurrences situations: no treatment, adjuvant chemotherapies or adjuvant targeted treatment (L1 inhibitor).
This study is performed on 30 patients operated for a glioma. A MRS examination is performed before and after tumor removal to quantify metabolites, particularly 2HG. This examination is also performed 6 months and 1 year after the start of treatment on the patients according to the evolution of tumor and/or to the appearance of new symptoms.
Patients with a glioma in the second grade, who benefit from a surgical resection, are included in a sub-study (study2).
Patients with a glioma in the third grade without surgical resection are included in a sub-study (study3). 
This study is not considered a clinical trial because it is a sub-study of a diagnostic test.
The results of this study will help to optimize treatment strategies, by selecting patients responding to a certain treatment and identifying those with refractory tumors. 
MRI will not be the only selection criteria of the study but this exam will provide additional information to optimize the therapeutic strategy of patients."

Background: Future time perspective is a key aspect of prospective thinking, which is associated with substance use disorders (SUDs). Prospective thinking relies upon future self-concept, which includes beliefs about a future version of the self. Deficits in future time perspective and future self-concept in individuals with SUDs have been linked to drug seeking and reuse. We aim to enhance future time perspective and future self-concept in individuals with SUDs through Virtual Reality (VR) exposure. 
Methods: This study is an experimental, randomized, waitlist-controlled, two-sample parallel assignment study. Participants are 18 years of age and above with outpatient psychotropic medication for SUD. Participants are randomized to one of two parallel groups. The experimental group is allocated to the Virtual Reality Avatar experience (first week) + Treatment as Usual (TaU) in which participants are asked to reflect on a future time-perspective goal. The control group is allocated to TaU alone. Both groups have one in-person session where participants are placed in a Virtual Reality environment (VR Park) for approximately 10 minutes, either with or without an avatar. This avatar resembles the participant in clothing and style but is modified to reflect an avatar who is more physically active and exercising. Both groups have follow-up sessions at 30 days and 6 months. Primary and secondary outcomes include self-reported use of drugs, lengths of abstinence, and time/time horizon related measures. 
Potential Implications: The current study is the first known study to examine the effect of VR exposure upon future time perspective in individuals with SUDs seeking treatment. If effective, the current study has the potential to inform the development of VR exposure-based interventions, especially in low-threshold settings.

Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults in the United States and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The most severe deterioration is most often associated with critical illness, an outcome that is heralded by the gradual development of physiologic abnormalities in multiple organ systems. Early identification of patients at risk for critical illness followed by intervention and optimization can reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Although numerous early warning scores (EWSs, such as Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS)) have been developed, the sensitivity and specificity of EWSs is far from perfect. Machine learning algorithms, which identify patterns in big data, improve accuracy but only achieve high clinical accuracy if fully integrated into hospital workflows. This study examines performance parameters of a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm (ecarter) at a single academic medical center and seeks to measure its impact on patient care at 4 healthcare organizations (HOs) using a randomized controlled design. The primary outcome measure is to determine whether eCART reduces mortality for high-risk hospitalized patients at participating HOs. Secondary outcome measures include reduction in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and the proportion of ICU- and ventilator-free days for elevated risk patients. This trial involves the development of an artificial intelligence model for screening hospitalized patients and standardization of care of these patients based on clinical pathways. We expect that rapid identification and management of acutely ill hospitalized patients will improve clinical outcomes and resource allocation."

African-American (AA) mothers have a higher risk of perinatal depression than Caucasian women, primarily attributing to high environmental stressors. Pregnant or postpartum AA women also have poor mental healthcare utilization and compliance with psychiatric treatment, contributing to poor clinical outcomes. In addition, AA fathers have a critical role in reducing the mother's emotional distress and environmental stress. This study will address some of these shortcomings by using fathers as an untapped resource to reduce the mother's environmental stress and encourage healthy maternal behaviors. The proposed study aims to design and implement a culturally-based and empirically-tailored intervention to target the AA father's mental health literacy, psychoeducation, and communication skills with the AA mother to reduce maternal depression symptoms during the prenatal to postpartum period. Also, this study will enhance the father's parenting and the mother-father-infant relationship through targeted skills and support. Twenty-five dyads of pregnant or postpartum dyads aged 18 or older, in committed relationships or not, will be randomized into the ASSET-PPD (African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment-Partners Alleviating Perinatal Depression) or the No Treatment comparison groups. The ASSET-PPD intervention will be designed to have 4 active modules that address the key factors to reduce maternal stress during the prenatal and postpartum period. The modules will be individual sessions constructed to provide training, information, and behavioral assignments to increase fathers' understanding of depression- and anxiety-provoking situations, and to create a communication and a parenting plan that promotes an equal division of parenting responsibilities before the birth of the infant. The primary outcome will be maternal depression, assessed using the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self-Rated (IDS-SR16). Secondary outcomes will include infant attachment, breastfeeding experience, and parent-infant interactions. This study will be effective in supporting women with PND and will have a high probability of improving the mental health outcomes and parental-child health of the children of AA women, potentially making an impact on future social policies concerning AA women's mental health.

This study is designed as a retrospective data analysis of a database of controlled malfunction simulation in subjects with type 1 diabetes receiving automated insulin delivery (AID). The current clinical practice is currently performed by recording the time series of glucose, insulin, and food intake data produced by the patients' AID, without any a priori information about the onset of the malfunction itself. To address this limitation, the investigators developed a control algorithm to detect episodes of insulin pump malfunction, based on the comparison between pre- and post-malfunction data-sets, the latter characterized by a significant increase in glycemia. However, a validation of this algorithm in real clinical practice, with a sufficient number of patients, may confirm the actual effectiveness and safety of this detection system. The use of a retrospective analysis, as currently conducted in the clinical practice, would permit the collection of a large amount of high-quality data, with a precise characterization of the malfunctions, as previously described. These data could support further validation in a prospective study. In these circumstances, it is necessary to assess the sensitivity of a number of detection techniques, in order to estimate the probability that a suspected insulin pump malfunction corresponds to a true positive event. The investigators propose the following study objectives: 1) Assess the sensitivity of the existing algorithms for the detection of insulin pump malfunctions (currently used in clinical practice) in 20 patients; 2) Analyze the ability of the proposed algorithms to detect malfunctions when the glycemic excursion is milder than what was simulated in this study, in 15 additional patients. The investigators expect that a sensitivity of 100% in detecting insulin suspension will be achieved, when the glycemic excursion following malfunction is higher than a defined threshold. As a secondary objective, the investigators will assess the safety of the study procedures, in terms of the risk of hyperglycemia and other side effects or complications. The study results may lead to optimization and improvement of the glycemic control, and to avoid the occurrence of the most serious risks associated with malfunctions. The study will be conducted on a population of 20 patients with type 1 diabetes, under insulin pump treatment and using continuous glucose monitoring sensors. The study will be conducted in two phases: - Phase 1: collection of free living data - Phase 2: malfunction simulation (data analysis after the experiment). The patients enrolled will be required to visit the study center at least twice: one baseline visit to activate the artificial pancreas and collect baseline data, and one visit to perform the malfunction simulation. Based on the experience gained during phase 1, the malfunction simulation procedure aims at inducing different durations and severity of hyperglycemia, by means of controlled insulin suspension. The study team will assist the patient in the restoration of normoglycemia before sending the patient back home. To account for the variability of the response to insulin suspension, subjects with type 1 diabetes and AID therapy are planned for enrollment, as the response to the same malfunction may vary according to the patient, insulin dose, and other factors such as meal intake, exercise, and illness. These factors will be carefully recorded by means of standardized questionnaires to be filled by each participant during the study visits.
The novelty of this approach is in the control of the experimental insulin suspension events, performed under medical supervision in a controlled and documented setting. The data collected in this study will be the only human trial dataset where malfunctions have been induced with precisely defined characteristics. By analyzing data generated by these experiments, it will be possible to develop accurate algorithms for detecting malfunctions and minimize the risk of missing important events because of lack of data. As a result, the patients will benefit of a more reliable system for insulin infusion and monitoring, with a reduced risk of critical and dangerous consequences."

To assess whether the use of the personalized risk assessment tool (PERSARC) is (cost)effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing informed choices in high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma patients compared to usual care (co-primary outcomes). In addition, we aim to assess in a process evaluation (a) the involvement of patients in decision-making (b) the extent and way PERSARC is used by patients and professionals, and (c) how satisfied patients and professionals were with the use of PERSARC. Study design: To assess the (cost)effectiveness of PERSARC in treatment decisions of high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma-patients, a parallel cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the 6 Dutch hospitals that are Soft-tissue sarcoma expertise centers. Hospitals will be randomized between standard care (control condition) or care with the use of PERSARC (intervention). Outcomes will be assessed within one week after treatment decision has been made (T1), and after 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment decision has been made (T2, T3, T4) in at least 120 patients. See main study parameters/endpoints for a description of the outcomes that will be measured at these time points. Actual use of PERSARC, satisfaction with/added value of PERSARC and barriers and facilitators for the integration of PERSARC in treatment decision-making processes during patient-clinician encounters will be measured in a process evaluation using questionnaires, interviews, and audio-recording/observation of consultations. Study population: Patients (>= 18 years) with primarily diagnosed (histologically confirmed) grade 2-3 extremity Soft-Tissue Sarcoma, who do not have a treatment plan yet and will be treated with curative intent. Patients with sarcoma subtypes or treatment options other than those mentioned in PERSARC are unable to participate. Furthermore, patients need to be Dutch fluency and literacy and mentally competent. Intervention (if applicable): High-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma patients will either receive standard care (control group) or care with the use of PERSARC; i.e. PERSARC will be used in multidisciplinary tumour boards to guide treatment advice and in consultation in which the oncological/orthopaedic surgeon informs the patient about his/her diagnoses and discusses the benefits and harms of all relevant treatment options (intervention group). Main study parameters/endpoints: The co-primary outcomes are decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale(DCS) (T1) and informed choice (T1), combined outcome incorporating knowledge (self-developed questionnaire), attitudes concerning trade-offs between quality and length of life (QQ_Questionnaire, see below) and treatment decision (T1). Informed choice is a combined outcome incorporating knowledge (self-developed questionnaire), attitudes concerning trade-offs between quality and length of life (QQ_Questionnaire, see below) and treatment decision (T1) Secondary outcomes, include regret (Decision_Regret_Scale) (T3, T4), worry (Cancer_Worry_scale) (T1, T2, T3, T4), involvement in decision-making according to patients (SDM-Q-9) (T1), patient reported outcome using the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMIS Global health) (T1, 2, 3, 4), (PROMIS physical function) (T1, 2, 3, 4), utilities for the cost-effectiveness analysis (EQ-5D-5L) (T1, T2, T3, T4), health care cost (iMCQ) (T2, T3, T4) and absenteeism/presenteeism from paid work (T2, T3, T4)."

Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is a public health challenge in both low and high mortality countries including the Kingdom of Jordan. The prevalence rates of caries in children attending early education and care centers in Jordan are reported to be 47- 90% in children of the age group 2 - 6 years. The objectives of this study is to report the prevalence of ECC and its associated risk factors in Jordanian children, and to determine the effectiveness of Silver Diamine Fluoride application on caries prevention for children aged from 3 - 5 years with ECC.
The study will involve children aged from 3 - 5 years who will have full mouth dental examination and questionnaires for risk factors, oral health related habits, maternal oral health, children's age and sex. The children will be divided into two groups; study group (received SDF) and control group (no intervention) at a ratio of 1:1 to determine any statistical significance of the treatment in terms of caries prevention. The participants will be asked to fill data related to the approval/disapproval of application of SDF and follow up at 1 year after application for any changes.
The results of this study would highlight the effectiveness of SDF as a preventive agent for early childhood caries, and also provide baseline data about the ECC prevalence, risk factors, and oral health related practices in Jordan. It may have impact in decision making for the dental profession to help support the inclusion of SDF as part of evidence-based protocol of caries management in children."

Background: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. Pfizer's ABRYSVO is a recently-available RSV vaccine that is intended to prevent disease caused by RSV.
Previous trials of ABRYSVO showed the vaccine's effectiveness at preventing RSV infection in older adults living in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and in older adults with cardiac/respiratory conditions. The overall effectiveness was higher in the LTCF trial versus the cardiac/respiratory trial. The LTCF trial also identified a potential suboptimal VE among participants who previously were infected with one or both RSV subgroups.
The Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) Vaccine Study Program (VSP) maintains significant resources for the evaluation of influenza and RSV vaccines in a population-based health care delivery system, providing access to electronic medical record data for more than 4.5 million individuals.
Objective: This two-year study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of RSV vaccine in preventing lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) among older adults in KPSC, who are eligible for RSV vaccination per ACIP guidelines. Secondary objectives include evaluating the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing severe events (e.g., hospitalization or mortality) in the selected patient populations. This study will evaluate effectiveness as follows:
Primary Outcome Measure: Test Negative Design (TND) 1. Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) calculated as 1 minus the odds ratio (OR) comparing the odds of being vaccinated with ABRYSVO for RSV-related hospitalized LRTI cases and controls, multiplied by 100%.
Administrative and Biologic Exemptions: 27.8% ABRYSVO coverage rates among the entire group at risk for vaccine preventable disease, as well as among those hospitalized and/or ED visited with a respiratory infection, are likely, given Kaiser Permanente's prior vaccine efforts. To address expected noncompliance with the 24-month exclusion window among those who are unvaccinated, we plan to include a 12-month control group, for VE estimation at this specific timepoint.

Eligibility: All Kaiser Permanente Southern California members born on or before 31-12-1935, regardless of sex or residence.
Design: Retrospective cohort study including 2 components: 1) TND, in which cases were identified using inpatient and certain outpatient medical claims and remnant respiratory specimens, to assess RSV-related hospitalizations, among which participants may have received prior vaccination or had prior documented RSV infection; and 2) population-based cohort including all KPSC patients at risk for RSV vaccine preventable, and nonpreventable, ARI/LRTI, as well as mortality.

Statistical Analysis: For the cohort study, we will estimate Incidence Rates (IRs) and related rate differences for all ARI and LRTI outcomes. We will also estimate VE using modified Poisson regression, adjusted for covariates including: 1) comorbid conditions, 2) RSV subgroup, 3) severity, and 4) age to describe the effectiveness of ABRYSVO against all-cause LRTI and ARI.

This study will have the potential to address important unanswered questions regarding the effectiveness of RSV vaccine in preventing lower respiratory tract infection in the KPSC population. The cohort study component will provide insights into the effectiveness of the vaccination against other ARI and LRTI outcomes, as well as provide a comprehensive understanding of the vaccine's effects in the general population. This study will further clarify the risk/benefit profiles to assist decision-making for RSV vaccine."

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by recent worsening of liver disease accompanied by acute organ failure (AOF) in a patient with chronic liver disease of any etiology. It often presents early on as an undifferentiated form of acute illness in a patient with chronic liver disease. Early detection and appropriate treatment may be life-saving. Liver transplantation is currently the best treatment for patients of ACLF. There is no consensus regarding the criteria of ACLF to select the patients for liver transplantation. Liver failure is characterized by the rapid progression of jaundice and acute deterioration in renal function and coagulopathy with or without ascites and gastrointestinal bleeding. It is commonly caused by endotoxemia followed by cytokines, as well as activation of the coagulation system.
The investigators wish to assess three different biomarkers, and find the biomarkers for accurate prognosis in the ACLF patients. ACLF patients have been considered for liver transplantation, which has shown good survival results. These patients will have three different biomarkers, fibroscan, TNF-alpha levels and CBC with PLR, NLR, SPL. They will be evaluated during the period of treatment for ACLF, i.e., 90 days and the investigators wish to select the patients for liver transplantation.
The investigators want to study the role of change in liver and splenic stiffness at day 7 (early on) of the disease by fibroscan in ACLF patients with acute change in baseline liver and splenic stiffness in predicting survival in ACLF patients.
The investigators also want to study the role of baseline liver and splenic stiffness with baseline characteristics of disease, etiology, baseline level of systemic and splanchnic pro-inflammatory markers, and pattern of organ failures in predicting survival in ACLF patients.

The efficacy and safety of the use of botulinum toxin type A in the treatment of facial wrinkles has been well established by many studies. Botulinum toxin is a safe and effective treatment for facial wrinkles and has a high patient satisfaction rate. Botulinum toxin acts by blocking the release of acetylcholine from the neuromuscular junction and thereby temporarily paralyzing the muscles responsible for facial movement and expression. In patients with hyperkinetic wrinkles, most notably the glabellar complex or frown lines in the region of the procerus and corrugator supercilii muscles, the toxin causes selective, temporary paralysis of the muscles responsible for producing frown lines. With the increasing usage of botulinum toxin, many studies have validated its efficacy and safety. However, botulinum toxin is prone to variable responses from a dose of 20U to 50U depending on several factors such as the muscle strength, thickness of the muscle and muscle area to be treated, as well as the injector's experience and skill. Variability in injection technique and individual patient response to botulinum toxin can lead to complications, such as incomplete inhibition and/or over-inhibition. Furthermore, the efficacy and safety of the BoTN varies depending on the injection depth. The depth can vary between injectors and can lead to adverse effects such as overdose, under-dose, intravascular injection, and bruising. Additionally, there is no in vivo data on the optimal injection depth of botulinum toxin in the glabellar complex. In this study, the investigators aim to establish an injection depth map for botulinum toxin type A, either at the Superficial Dermis Depth or Intramuscular Depth for the treatment of glabellar wrinkles. With this study the investigators also aim to determine any adverse effects associated with both treatment arms. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal depth of botulinum toxin injections to treat glabellar lines in the glabellar complex.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only treatment that can achieve long-term disease control in severe aplastic anemia (SAA), but it has a 20-30% mortality rate. Graft failure and relapse remain the major causes of death. Recently, non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation has been proven to have much lower treatment-related mortality. A number of clinical trials showed that the outcome of HSCT using non-T cell depleted alografts was much better than T-cell depleted alografts. However, the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) was also very high. In China, the incidence of GVHD in SAA is 70% to 80% and most of the patients required systemic steroid therapy. Non-myeloablative transplantation has also been used in unrelated cord blood transplantation. The outcome was good especially for unrelated cord blood transplantation for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. However, the outcome in adult patients with acute leukemia was not satisfactory. In the recent years, several conditioning regimens have been used in unrelated cord blood transplantation. Several reports showed that busulfan combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (Bu/Flu/Cy) or Cy/ATG conditioning regimens also have a good outcome. However, these conditioning regimens were associated with cardiac toxicity and the incidence of graft failure was relatively high. It has been proposed that the regimens may be changed to avoid the cardiac toxicity of these conditioning. Our experience showed that the incidence of GVHD in this population is relatively high and the management of GVHD in this population was very difficult. Therefore, we propose to conduct a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study. The intervention of different conditioning regimens will be evaluated in patients who underwent HSCT from matched sibling or matched unrelated donors.
Primary Objective:
1 To compare the non-relapse mortality of two different conditioning regimens by transplanting HLA matched sibling or unrelated donors in SAA patients.

Secondary Objective:
1 To compare the overall survival and failure-free survival of two different conditioning regimens by transplanting HLA matched sibling or unrelated donors in SAA patients.
2 To evaluate the incidence of GVHD, engraftment, graft vs. leukemia effect and regimen related toxicity of two different conditioning regimens by transplanting HLA matched sibling or unrelated donors in SAA patients.
3 To evaluate the incidence of CMV and EBV reactivation of two different conditioning regimens by transplanting HLA matched sibling or unrelated donors in SAA patients.

Sample size: 64 patients will be recruited to evaluate non-relapse mortality. With an incidence of 30% event under the busulfan included conditioning, a sample size of 64 will have 80% power (with α = 0.05) to detect a 10-point reduction in event rate. The estimated sample size when comparing failure-free survival is more than 130."

The aim of the study is to test the reliability and validity of the Malay PainDETECT Questionnaire (PDQ-M) in patients with both neuropathic and nociceptive pain. There are 7 items in the PDQ-M questionnaire, which is derived from the original PDQ, a nine-item questionnaire. There are no previous studies using painDETECT in patients with pain in Malaysia. Therefore, it has been used in other countries including Germany, The Netherlands, China to name a few. The purpose of this study is to translate the original German version of PDQ to Malay to produce a Malay version of the questionnaire (PDQ-M) and to assess the test-retest reliability as well as the criterion validity."

Background: Stroke patients are at high risk of cardiovascular diseases and functional limitations.
Study Design and Methods: A total of 40 stroke patients, aged over 30 were randomly divided into the two groups, the non-exercise group and the exercise group. Both groups followed the same rehabilitation program at the rehabilitation hospital. The experimental group had 2 exercise classes for 6 weeks, and the other group did not have specific exercise classes other than the rehabilitation program. All patients were evaluated for physical abilities and activities of daily living before and after the program.
Results: The exercise group showed significantly better results in physical abilities than the non-exercise group, such as the 6-minute walk test, the Berg balance scale, and muscle strength. It also showed lower disability and depression scores and more physical activity. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: These results showed that the community-based complex exercise program could be a new option for stroke patients in rehabilitation, improving physical abilities and daily activities."

Introduction

Acute liver failure (ALF) is the most severe form of acute liver disease, occurring mostly in adolescents and young adults. It often carries a grave prognosis and affects mainly the developed countries. The management of ALF is complicated by the large number of underlying etiologies and the complexity of the clinical picture, which represents a challenge to clinicians in the management of these cases.
Kidney diseases are known as causes of liver disease, however, kidney injury in the course of ALF is of much greater significance, because the liver is the primary site of endogenous biotransformation of drugs, and as a consequence, renal functions are very susceptible to liver failure. Kidney injury in ALF can develop by hepatorenal syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis. ALF is associated with acute-on-chronic liver disease (ACLF), where some characteristics of both ALF and chronic liver disease coexist. ACLF is defined by the International Ascites Society as the presence of the following combinations of ascites, encephalopathy, or hepatic failure with bilirubin >3 mg/dL, along with other organ failure, including coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Mortality rate of patients with ACLF was reported from 14% to 60% in other studies.
Due to lack of knowledge about the causes of ALF and ACLF, early diagnosis is vital for prognosis and recovery of patients. Early diagnosis of complications such as hepatorenal syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis is crucial, as these alter the course and outcome of ALF. Several risk factors that lead to ALF and ACLF have been identified in many studies.
In this study, ALF and ACLF cases are defined according to guidelines. ALF is defined as an acute deterioration of liver function in patients with previously normal liver function. It can be isolated liver failure, or it can evolve to ACLF by underlying liver cirrhosis that are detected after evaluation. ACLF is defined as evolving from chronic liver disease (CLD) or having a chronic progressive liver disease. CLD is defined as a known chronic liver disease for at least 6 months, with or without ascites, and with or without other organ failure.
Study goals
-----------------
Determination of risk factors leading to ALF and ACLF in a hospital setting. Study of the main causes of disease. Early determination of organ failure, and complications such as renal failure (hypotension or shock in the course of ALF), nephrotic syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis. Assessment of mortality and short-term (1 week, 2 weeks) morbidity rates in patients with severe acute liver disease. Assessing hepatic and renal functions in individuals with ALF with regard to age and gender.
Methodology
-----------------
We aim to recruit at least 60 patients with ALF and 30 patients with ACLF fulfilling the specific criteria, who are admitted to intensive care units at National Liver Institute, Menoufia University. They will be assessed by history taking, physical examination, complete blood count, liver function tests. Clinical, radiological and echocardiographical assessments will be done along with special scores such as Child's Pugh, DF, C OFs scores and CLIF-SOFA score.
Inclusion criteria:

The goal of the study is to examine whether impulsivity and coping skills are associated with better (or worse) quality of life in people with bipolar disorder. People with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of suicide attempts compared with the general population. Therefore, it is important to identify factors that affect their quality of life. The study will take 12 weeks with two visits of approximately 15 minutes. If you are 18 years or older and suffer from bipolar disorder, you are eligible. The main aims of the study are:

1. To explore whether impulsivity and coping skills are associated with quality of life in people with bipolar disorder (i.e., to find out whether a high level of impulsivity reduces the quality of life of people with bipolar disorder).
2. To find out whether the participants' age and gender are associated with the quality of life.
3. To explore any other factors that may affect the quality of life. For example, other psychiatric conditions in addition to bipolar disorder (e.g., depression, anxiety etc.).
4. To find out whether there are any differences in the level of impulsivity and coping attitudes between participants with a history of suicide attempts and those without such a history.
5. To find out whether there are any differences in the level of impulsivity, coping attitudes and quality of life, depending on whether participants are currently in a manic phase of the disorder or in a 'normal mood' (i.e., neither manic nor depressed). The findings of this study may be useful for improving quality of life for those with bipolar disorder.

The risk to participants is no greater than when people with bipolar disorder receive usual care. There is no specific treatment involved in this study.

If you currently have bipolar disorder and are 18 years or older, you are welcome to join this research study. If 10 or more people with bipolar disorder are found to participate (and if they sign the consent form), they will be interviewed for approximately 15 minutes in total. Firstly, they will be requested to sign the consent form. Then, they will complete 3 self-report questionnaires: 1) Quality of life in bipolar disorder scale, 2) Barratt-Impulsivity-scale, and 3) the Coping Attitudes Questionnaire."

Introduction
-----------------
Color selection in the clinic is a very sensitive process and is affected by environmental factors and operator-related variables. This has led to the development of single-color universal composite materials that aim to facilitate color selection. These materials have a universal opacity and several Vita shades and are recommended by manufacturers to be used in a single color layer that can match different tooth colors. As we know, there is no study investigating the clinical performance of these two universal composites. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical performance of 2 different single-color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions with the control group (Filtek Z250, 3M), which is a multi-color composite resin material, using modified USPHS and FDI criteria. In this study, two different null hypotheses were established. The first null hypothesis of this study is; It is concluded that there is no difference between 2 different single color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in terms of clinical performance in restorations of non-carious cervical lesions. The second null hypothesis of the study is that universal composite resin materials are not different from the control group, multicolored composite resin (Filtek Z250, 3M), in terms of clinical performance in restorations of non-carious cervical lesions.

Study Population and Sample Size
-----------------
Non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) lesions located on first permanent molars and premolars will be selected, according to the FDI criteria. Inclusion criteria for this study are:

-At least 3 teeth with cervical abrasion
-Volunteerily enrolling in the study.

Inclusion of both gender and different teeth types allows the study to detect significant differences related to the materials used for restorations. The study includes 99 male and female patients voluntarily chosen for participation. The data will be collected from six health facilities that operate in Izmir.

Method
-----------------
Patients who have voluntarily agreed to participate in the study will be asked by the clinical coordinator to fill in the consent form. After completing the consent form, patients will be informed about the restoration procedure and postoperative instructions. The color of the teeth will be recorded with the Vita classic scale (N = 16). The selection of 44 teeth for the study will be based on the teeth with the same Vita color (A1-D4).

For each restoration, one tooth will be randomly assigned to OMNICHROMA, one tooth to Zenchroma and the third tooth will be assigned to Filtek Z250. A code will be prepared for all restoration procedures, and each restoration in the same patient will be prepared with one of the 3 materials, which will not be specified to the dentist. The operator who performs clinical and radiographic examinations will be blinded to the restorative materials used in the study. All restorative procedures will be performed by one operator. During this period, a composite color will be prepared as if it is a different tooth to eliminate the operator's habituation to a specific color shade. Each restoration will be restored by a single restoring operator. The operator who prepared the restoration will check the restoration and score the results according to the modified USPHS and FDI criteria (Table 1 and Table 2). The same operator will restore each patient's 3 teeth and apply the same restorative protocol to all teeth.

Tooth preparations for the NCCL will be planned in accordance with the modified USPHS criteria. Full coverage of the preparations will be provided with the use of resin composite. Before restoring each tooth, 35% phosphoric acid (Ultra Etch, 3M) will be applied to the NCCL surface for 15 seconds each time and washed with water. It will be dried gently with a compressed air and cotton roll. After that, Te-Etch ® (Brush & Co) (18% nano-hydroxyapatite primer and 37% phosphoric acid) will be applied for 15 seconds and washed with water. Dentin will be covered with a single layer of nanofilled (Filtek Z250, 3M) and cured in 40 seconds. When the tooth is filled completely, the next step will be filling the cervical margin of the tooth with the universal composite restorative (OMNICHROMA, Zenchroma, Filtek Z250"

Overweight and obesity are common among women diagnosed with endometrial lesions, including atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) and grade 1 endometrial cancer. These women, especially those who are premenopausal, wish to preserve their uterine, meaning that they do not wish to undergo hysterectomy for their atypical endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer. The primary goal of treatment in these patients is to eliminate the atypia and prevent or delay the development of grade 2 or higher grade endometrial carcinoma or recurrence. Progestin, oral or intrauterine device (IUD), is used as part of standard practice in order to promote atypia elimination. However, the efficacy rate of atypia-free uterine preservation with progestin treatments is only 50%. As such, identifying strategies to increase the effectiveness of progestin treatment in premenopausal women diagnosed with endometrial atypia is important.
This study hypothesizes that weight loss may improve the efficacy of atypia-free uterine preservation with progestin treatment. It is reasonable to assume that, over the course of six months, a modest weight loss of 5% will result in improvements in clinical outcomes. The investigators also believe that the study of a behavioral weight loss intervention may result in the formation of a support network, provide strategies to manage weight, and help women who have received an endometrial diagnosis to develop skills that can help them with weight management in the future.
A two-year randomized prospective study of 50 obese and prematurely menopausal women with AEH or grade 1 endometrial cancer and a uterus will be conducted. Women with endometrial atypia (with complex architecture histologically), grade 1 endometrial cancer, or premenopausal endometrial hyperplasia will undergo a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD insertion and be randomized to receive counseling for an enhanced usual care (EUC) or a novel behavioral weight loss intervention. Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random numbers table, with a randomization allocation scheme by a statistician who is independent of the randomizing physician. It is expected that over the course of one year, there will be a 19% chance that women assigned to behavioral intervention will achieve atypia-free uterine preservation compared to 12% of women assigned to the EUC. In year 2, those in the EUC will cross over to receive the behavioral weight loss intervention, while the treatment group will receive the standard of care therapy.
Patients will be followed to evaluate uterine preservation and weight status. The investigators will examine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the number of participants who will require surgical intervention, including hysterectomy or endometrial resection.
This study will provide information into if a behavioral weight loss intervention can improve the clinical outcomes of women with this diagnosis. It holds the promise of aiding in the prevention of hysterectomy and endometrial resection surgery, which may alleviate the burden of menopause and/or hormonal therapy commonly given after these surgical procedures.
There are no specific conditions on which this study is focused."

Rationale: During many years, cholecystectomy has been considered a safe laparoscopic procedure . However it can turn into a disaster that may require the application of damage control techniques. Many authors have recognized difficulty in performing cholecystectomy following several reports (1)(2)(3)(4)(5). Several methods for performing simple laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been proposed to overcome this difficulty.
Procedure: A new simple technique of subtotal cholecystectomy was recently described (6) to deal with the difficulty associated with cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis.

Objectives: 
The aim of this paper was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this technique.
Study Design: 
Fifty patients with acute cholecystitis were enrolled in this study between June of 2005 and June of 2008. All patients had either symptoms or radiological evidence of difficulty and were to be operated on within days of symptom onset. The operative technique was performed as reported by Zhuang et al. The operative procedure was evaluated using the Clavien - Dindo classification. Data was collected using case report forms filled by the investigators. The postoperative course was assessed for 30 days, including the assessment of surgical wound complications, and death.

Results: This procedure seems to offer many advantages compared with other cholecystectomy techniques that have been proposed . It is performed within minutes by a simple operation and represents a feasible and safe technique.

Food and liquid intake postoperatively was allowed on day 1, oral activity and hospital discharge were on day 4. None of the patients died or were converted to an open procedure, and no major morbidity was reported in this series of patients with acute cholecystitis. No leaks were reported nor was there bile duct injury. Three patients were converted into Laparotomic cholecystectomy for reasons not directly related to the technique used in this study (other gallbladder bed attachments). One of the converted patients was a 60 y/o woman who was a type II obesity (BMI 39.2) and was operated on two months after the first presentation with acute cholecystitis. She had a perforated appendix that was treated with necreectomy. She had severe abdominal adhesion and there was an inflammatory induration between the liver and the falciform ligament that prevented performing the operation. This patient underwent a cholecystectomy (performed under General anesthesia) in the same sitting of the laparotomy for appendectomy (there was a 5 cm midline laparotomy incision). Another problem reported with the new technique is an unanticipated bile duct injury which could occur with clipping of the cystic duct. This was not observed in the current study. The remaining 9 patients were laparoscopically operated on without difficulty or complication.
Afterwards, all patients were mobilized in the morning of day 1 and allowed to tolerate food. They were mobilized on day 1 and allowed to tolerate food. Fluids were introduced in the morning of day 1, followed by semisolid diet in the morning of day 2. Oral activity and hospital discharge were both done on day 4.
The mean operative time (from the time of first incision into the stomach until the closure of the last skin incision) was 140 min (95% CI 116 min to 231 min). The mean time required to identify the cystic duct was 14 min (95% CI 10 min to 21 min) and the mean length of hospitalization was 5.4 days (95% CI 4.7 days to 5.9 days). This technique was feasible and safe for use in patients with acute cholecystitis within three days of symptom onset. More studies are needed to confirm our results.

The results of our study indicate that our new technique is safe compared with other traditional techniques. This method seems to be reliable since no biliary duct injuries or leaks were noted in the series.

In summary, the new laparoscopic technique proposed by Zhuang et al. represents a relatively safe and quick operation that seems to be a better approach in patients with acute cholecystitis who are being operated on within 3 days of symptom onset. This technique facilitates a safe"

Introduction and Aims Most patients prefer to discharge from the hospital to their own home, but 11% of all hospitalized patients-and 22.4% of patients with Medicare-require discharge to a post-acute care facility. Hospital systems are increasingly incentivized to facilitate discharge home since a post-acute care facility stay is costly. Post-acute care is most often necessitated by a patient's functional decline during hospitalization. Physical therapists, whose primary treatment objective is generally to improve functional independence, could therefore play a crucial role in promoting improvements in functional status sufficient to enable a greater number of discharges to home. In current practice, however, physical therapists in acute care hospitals do not generally address patients' function-related deficits. They do not generally have the opportunity to do so, since the Inpatient Prospective Payment System incentivizes short hospital stays. Nor have they needed to, since post-acute care facilities have become the primary setting for patients to regain functional independence. In this environment, physical therapists-a constrained resource in most hospitals primarily play a consultative role in which they evaluate functional status during a single visit in order to provide a recommendation for appropriate post-acute rehabilitation needs. With greater focus on ensuring value across the care continuum, healthcare systems are now striving to maintain short hospital stays, but also limit post-acute care utilization. This will require patients to achieve greater functional independence as quickly as possible within their hospital stay. Thus, the role of physical therapists in acute care hospitals must evolve. Intervention Despite the need to evolve, the fact that physical therapists are a constrained resource prompts the need for care prioritization that is optimally targeted. It is currently unclear which patients need physical therapist intervention in the hospital, and how much physical therapy is necessary, in order to achieve a functional status that is adequate to discharge home. We have developed a patient-level clinical decision support tool to guide optimal treatment frequency. This tool-the Physical Therapy Frequency Clinical Decision Support Tool, or PT-PENCIL-is based on a statistical model that predicts discharge home relative to the frequency of physical therapist treatment. The primary goals of this study are to assess the development and implementation strategy for the PT-PENCIL and analyze its effect on improving the proportion of patients who discharge home. The PT-PENCIL will include two solutions integrated into the electronic health record (Epic). For both, Epic will use the underlying statistical model to identify patients for whom daily physical therapy may be indicated in order to facilitate a discharge to home. For such patients, an Epic best practice advisory (BPA) alert will appear on the screen, which will prompt therapists to consider a visit on the next day. The second Epic-integrated solution is an indicator column on the patient lists maintained by therapists, which will identify patients who would benefit from daily PT (a green dot), those who would not (a red dot), and those for whom the PT-PENCIL did not run in Epic. PT-PENCIL will be implemented into clinical care by means of a pilot hybrid type 2 design, informed by the PRISM (Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model) and RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) frameworks. We will accomplish the following primary specific aims: Aim 1: Analyze the effect of using the PT-PENCIL on the proportion of patients discharged home. Aim 2: Assess the reach, adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the PT-PENCIL.

The elbow is a hinge joint; it has the highest risk of degeneration. Range of motion (ROM) deficit could result in both a functional and cosmetic deficit. Stiff elbow can be due to capsular contracture, which is a result of scar tissue formation around the elbow joint. Stiff elbow can be also cause by post-traumatic joint effusion, elbow fracture, dislocation and POP. The aim of this study was to compare, Maitland Mobilization and Post Facilitation stretch in improving ROM in the post- traumatic stiff elbow patients. Maitland mobilization and PFS are common interventions applied in managing stiff elbow. Studies have revealed that PFS is more effective than Maitland mobilization in managing stiff elbow. As there is no definitive study comparing post facilitation stretch and maitland mobilization in post-traumatic elbow contracture, that was the rationale of designing this study. This study was prospective; randomized; controlled clinical trial. Forty-three participants were enrolled in the study. Outcome measures were ROM at the elbow, forearm supination and pronation. Numeric Pain Rating Scale and DASH scoring was also observed. The study found that significant improvement in all outcome measures were seen in both treatment groups. PFS group showed statistically significant improvement in ROM ELbow flexion and extension, and forearm ROM when compared to pretreatment assessment, whereas statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements were seen in Paitland elbow mobilization group, in ROM Elbow Flexion and Extension and forearm ROM in between the two groups."

The incidence of heart failure (HF) is increasing with a similar increase in mortality. Despite advances in heart failure treatment, there still remains a significant burden and gap in heart failure diagnosis. There is clear evidence that early diagnosis and treatment improves patient outcomes and reduces heart failure hospitalizations. With advances in technology, particularly artificial intelligence that can help improve diagnosis, it is now possible to provide earlier diagnosis of at-risk individuals by implementing a population health approach. This multidisciplinary approach will be conducted in primary care offices, providing high quality evidence to determine whether artificial intelligence screening enhances the speed of HF diagnosis."

Fluid therapy is one of the most common procedures in the operating room, anesthesiology and intensive care. It is also commonly used in emergency medicine, especially in undifferentiated shock. Intravenous fluids may be administered to achieve various goals, such as volume expansion. To date, it has not been shown how the effects of intravenous Ringer's acetate vary with different volume statuses. Therefore, the investigators want to examine the effects. We intend to examine the differences by measuring cardiac and vascular hemodynamics in a two-compartment model, where part of the circulation is exposed to a specific treatment, and another part is not exposed.

This study is divided into 2 experimental groups and 1 control group. Experimental group 1 included patients treated with thoracolumbar interfascial plane (L3) block by erector spine plane (L3), and experimental group 2 included patients treated with thoracolumbar erector spine plane (L3) block. The control group did not receive any interventional treatments for the lower back. These analgesia methods are all under ultrasound-guidance. Each group has a total of 60 people. According to the above design, the effectiveness and side effects of the 2 ultrasound-guided analgesia methods (TLIP block and ESP block) for patients with lumbar spine fusion surgery were compared and analyzed. The study used the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) for dynamic pain assessment, 24-hour morphine consumption for static pain assessment, and adverse reactions for side-effect assessment. The results showed that the 2 ultrasound-guided analgesia methods (TLIP block and ESP block) can effectively reduce the stress reaction caused by the patient's autonomic nervous system during surgery, maintain the stability of the patient's vital signs during and after surgery, and improve the overall postoperative quality of patients by 1 score improvement in VAS score. TLIP block is more effective than ESP block in terms of postoperative pain relief and requires less morphine dosage. Overall, TLIP block is a better perioperative analgesic than ESP block for patients with lumbar spine fusion surgery."

The study will enroll 12 healthy volunteers (4 from each ethnic background) to characterize the initial comfort and safety associated with the application of a novel, wearable puls oximeter. This device will be used to simultaneously measure blood oxygen saturation and epidermal melanin content under one of three conditions: no skin protection, 3M tape, and 3M Skin Protector adhesive wipe. The participants will wear the device for the testing day, and the investigators will characterize its safety and comfort. Additionally, the investigators will calibrate the device to estimate blood oxygen saturation. Each 60-second sample during the testing period will constitute one 'estimate' of arterial oxygen saturation, and 80 samples will be compared to the FDA approved pulse oximeters for accuracy assessment. The investigators will assess the device's accuracy in estimating arterial oxygen saturation on the testing day and 2 and 4 days later. Finally, epidermal melanin content will be estimated using 3 wavelengths of light to characterize the device's ability to estimate the individual's skin tone."

Current methods for screening postpartum glucose metabolism abnormalities in GDM mainly rely on 2h and 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The postpartum time limit and the dependence on the blood glucose levels reached only have a limited application value. The occurrence of postpartum glucose metabolism abnormalities is related to abnormal lipid metabolism, and abnormal glucose profile is also a sign of abnormal lipid metabolism. In this study, the serum lipidomic and serum metabolomic profiles during pregnancy were first compared between the abnormal postpartum glucose metabolism group and the normal control group. And then, the serum lipid profile and glucose profile at 24-28 gestational weeks were comprehensively analyzed, and their relevance to postpartum glucose metabolism abnormalities were determined. The results may help provide early diagnosis of postpartum glucose metabolism abnormalities, and the corresponding individualized treatment measures, thus providing the basis for the prevention and intervention of glucose metabolic diseases, reducing the probability of insulin use and improving the quality of life in patients."

It is well-known that an altered sleep is often found in ICU and critically ill patients. Sleep quality and duration have been previously reported to be disturbed in critically ill patients. Critical care setting is characterized by multiple light variations due to frequent opening of doors with entrance of medical and paramedical staff, interruption by medical devices and alarms. Indeed, in this environment, sleep quality is reported to be disturbed due to interruptions by staff, alarms and light variations. Although hospitalized patients are recommended to sleep 8 hours a day in a room free of light, noise and disturbances, this is particularly difficult to achieve in intensive care.
To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no data on the sleep quality of in-hospital intensive care unit patients. Furthermore, there is no systematic practice to optimize sleep (particularly at night) quality in critically ill patients. These lack of data on sleep quality, absence of specific care dedicated to sleep and the current trend to deliver care closer to the patient's room, prompt us to propose a novel approach, that is the use of an electroencephalogram (EEG) guided sleep protection method. Indeed, by monitoring continuously the EEG traces, we can distinguish between sleep and wake phases. When sleep is detected, the system displays an alert which advises the caregivers to protect the patient from care interruption or noise. Although the study has not been reported, this approach is currently used by several health care institutions in Europe.
The objective is to evaluate the impact of EEG-guided protection of the patients' sleep in intensive care and its effect on patients' sleep quality, sleep fragmentation, environmental noise and light exposure, caregiver and patients agitation. In addition, we will quantify the impact of sleep optimization on patient, caregiver and society benefits as indicated on the health-economic analysis by the French high authority of health (Haute Autorité de Santé) which is a key priority for ICU work. Furthermore, the feasibility of such a method and its effect on patient safety (respiratory failure) and workload of staff members involved in the care of the patients will be assessed."

The aim of this study is to investigate SAR441566 efficacy and safety as a therapy to treat adults with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have an inadequate response to methotrexate. SAR441566 is a first-in-class B cell maturation modulator that may stop RA from progressing by blocking a critical signalling pathway needed for B cells, white blood cells that play a crucial role in RA. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in RA patients who have been taking methotrexate for a stable period of time with no or partial response. Approximately 400 patients will be enrolled and randomized into 5 dose groups (75 mg, 150 mg, 225 mg, 300 mg, and placebo) for 12 weeks. Patients will be treated with SAR441566 or placebo once a day, plus methotrexate. Patients will go through an initial screening period followed by a 12-week treatment period, a safety/immunogenicity follow-up visit of approximately 6-7 weeks (depending on when the last dose is taken), and a final safety/immunogenicity follow-up visit approximately 7 weeks after the last dose."

Detailed Description
-----------------
Nearly 30 million people worldwide suffer from chronic heart failure (HF), a condition for which effective long-term treatment options are greatly needed. While the pathogenesis of HF is multifactorial, one of the key underlying mechanisms is the disruption of the endocalyx, a glycocalyx layer that lines the blood vessels and regulates the exchange of water and electrolytes between blood and the cardiovascular system. This mechanism occurs even in patients with HF who have otherwise normal kidney function. The key consequence is fluid excess which results in symptoms like peripheral edema and shortness of breath. This fluid excess is typically managed by diuretic treatment, but excessive use of diuretics often leads to electrolyte depletion and worsening of kidney function. Therefore, a non-diuretic treatment option that will allow patients to be less dependent on diuretics is urgently needed. However, existing non-diuretic treatment options are either not effective or are associated with negative consequences. Thus there is a clear clinical need for finding treatments that will help HF patients deal with the fluid excess without relying on diuretics. The main goal of the current investigation is to determine the efficacy of the food supplement Endocalyx in dealing with the fluid excess of chronic HF. For patients with long-term chronic HF, fluid excess can manifest in a variety of ways. Most patients experience symptoms such as shortness of breath and peripheral edema, while others develop hypertension or may have a worsening of kidney function. Endocalyx is a food supplement that has shown to reduce sodium storage in the small intestine, and as a result increase sodium excretion in healthy volunteers. However, the effect of Endocalyx on patients with long-term chronic HF remains unknown. In the current study we will test whether Endocalyx can decrease sodium and water excess in patients with chronic HF. In an explorative pilot study we have previously demonstrated that Endocalyx also has positive effects on blood pressure control and microcirculation in patients with chronic HF and diabetes mellitus with hypertension. This study was not powered to directly demonstrate these effects. For the current study we will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled trial focused on patients with heart failure and fluid excess, as manifested by elevated NT-proBNP levels or symptoms such as shortness of breath, peripheral edema, hypertension or worsening kidney function. The primary outcome will be the degree of fluid excess or symptom burden based on the change in NT-proBNP levels. Secondary outcomes will include changes in body weight, blood pressure, hemodynamic parameters, total body water and urinary sodium excretion as well as adverse events. We aim to include 50 patients. As many as 1 out of 3 patients will drop out prematurely leading to an estimation of an n = 74, which will give a 80% power to identify a 30% difference in NT-proBNP levels between the two study arms, assuming a significance level of 5%. Sample size calculations were performed using the program G*Power, version 3.1.9."

Chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has the synergistic effect on tumors, and has emerged as a new breakthrough in tumor treatment. HBsAg loss is an ideal treatment outcome. Studies have shown that tumor immune surveillance has immune dysfunction, which is reflected in defective dendritic cells and dysfunctional T cells. Therefore, activating innate immune system (dendritic cell, NK cells and antiviral CD8+T cells) and adaptive immune system (lymphocyte subsets) play important roles in the anti-tumor effect. This research plan is designed using a triple combined therapy approach (immunotherapy) to aim at the functional cure for chronic Hepatitis B. We select anti-PD-1 antibody, NAs and peginterferon alfa-2a (peg-IFNα) for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV), so as to activate the host's innate and adaptive immune systems, eliminate HBV-infected cells, and maintain a persistently high level of HBsAg-specific T cells that can control HBV replication to reduce the incidence of HBV DNA reappearance. This design of the clinical treatment approach is expected to achieve effective control of HBV replication, maintain HBeAg negative state, and achieve the goal of sustained HBsAg loss, thereby realizing the functional cure of hepatitis B virus."

The purposes of this study aim to detect suture wound loosening in mouth and its related symptoms under experimental conditions with different suture techniques.
Mouth wound loosening is one of the main complications related to periodontal surgery, and it can negatively affect the periodontal therapy. After a full arch alveoplasty, the surgical wound should be closed and sutured at the end of the operation. However, a well-known clinical concern is loosening of the suture material. Since loosening of sutures is related with increased morbidity and discomfort for patients, it is important to investigate suture loosening and its related symptoms.
In several clinical studies, it has been reported that different suture techniques result in different rates of suture loosening. However, due to the lack of similarity and comparison among studies, clear evidence of the influence of different suture techniques on suture loosening has not been found so far. It is known that the time required to knot or suture is longer for the full arch alveoplasty operation. According to the clinical experience in the division of oral surgery in Istanbul Medipol University, the suture wound loosening is more difficult after full arch suturing without interruption.
In this study, the investigators planned to detect early wound healing parameters and suture loosening according to suture techniques between full arch alveoplasty. The null hypothesis for this study is that continuous suture methods should not be different from simple wound closure methods, in terms of suture loosening parameters, and any suturing techniques should not show significant difference in terms of suture loosening parameters. For this purpose, one hundred and eight patients who were candidates for the same full arch alveoplasty treatment in Istanbul Medipol University Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery are included in this study. Patients, aged between 40 and 65, who were candidates for the same full arch alveoplasty are treated under similar conditions.
To detect whether early wound healing score, laundry healing index, suturing time, suture removal difficulty, pain, suture loosening are related to suturing techniques in Istanbul Medipol University, the null hypothesis about there is nothing different about continuous suture methods compared to simple wound closure methods in terms of suture loosening parameters in the full arch suturing in oral surgery is analyzed. If the null hypothesis is proven wrong, the investigators should conclude that the simple suture technique gives less wound loosening related morbidity."

During the last two decades, corneal endothelial replacement (DMEK) has become an established surgical technique for the treatment of cases of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy. The use of DMEK in the presence of pre-existing retinal surgery, and especially in its absence, remains subject to discussion among corneal surgeons, with opinions ranging from ""the treatment is contraindicated"" (in the absence of retinal surgery) to ""the treatment is not contraindicated and is even recommended"" (in the absence of retinal surgery).
The hypothesis of the present study is that DMEK performed in patients with retinal surgery or with a history of anterior segment surgery (cataract, IOL implantation, filtering bleb) presents a serious risk of surgical complication. The investigators hypothesize the opposite in the case of patients with a history of pars plana vitrectomy and / or with an implanted intraocular lens.
This prospective monocentric randomized study will compare the occurrence rate of serious post-operative complications of DMEK in the three groups of patients mentioned above, as well as the improvement in visual acuity from both unaided and corrected eyes one year after surgery.
The main objective is to quantify the occurrence rate of post-operative complications, namely the composite endpoints consisting of corneal detachment requiring graft redressing under air or gas, corneal edema requiring reoperation, corneal stromal graft rejection requiring reoperation, and the development of cystoid macular edema.
The secondary objectives concern the evolution of visual and refractive results of the operated eye, the endothelial density and morphometry of the corneal graft one year after surgery, the evolution of intraocular pressure, the complication rate of phacoemulsification or DMEK combined after one year of surgery, and the analysis of the surgical time.
The analysis of these results will confirm the need for a DMEK surgery in specific patient groups or the need to avoid surgery in others. This analysis will also provide additional data for surgeons wishing to perform DMEK surgery in non-uniform groups, and contribute to defining better indications for DMEK surgery in patients with a history of anterior segment procedure."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of stabilization and stabilization-related parameters on shooting performance at the cervical, lumbal and scapular levels in archery athletes. 40 archery athletes aged between 10 and 18, who have been professionally engaged in archery for at least 1 year were included in the study. Demographic information and musculoskeletal system evaluations of the athletes were done. Performance of the athletes via Upper Extremity Closed Kinetic Chain Stability Test, Hand Grip Strength test; presence of scapular dyskinesia was evaluated via the Lateral Scapular Slide Test. Cervical region stabilization was evaluated via Craniocervical Flexion Test, scapular level stabilization was evaluated via Scapular Muscle Endurance Test, lumbar region stabilization was evaluated via Abdominal Drawing-in Test and Sahrmann's Core Stability Test. As the parameters related to stabilization, postures via Corbin Postural Rating Scale; balances via Stork Balance Test, Upper Extremity Y Balance Test; pain was evaluated via the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index. Shooting performances were evaluated with 72 target shootings and a total of 720 points.  There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of total shooting performance (p = 0.13). The two athletes belonging to the upper extremity performance group were scored higher in each session than the other athlete in terms of upper extremity performance with only one clicker test. There were no significant differences between two groups in terms of scapular dyskinesia (p = 0.057). There are significant relationships between upper extremity performance, shooting performance and scapular dyskinesia (r = 0.495, r = 0.448 and r = -0.474) and there is significant relationships between upper extremity closed chain stability test and the presence of scapular dyskinesia (r = 0.403). The study results showed that there was a positive relationship between the muscle strength performance, scapula muscle endurance performance and upper extremity performance. However, there was no difference between the groups in terms of total shooting performance. Our study showed that all stabilization-related parameters measured; muscle strength, muscle endurance, postural stability are related to upper extremity performance and scapular dyskinesia in archery athletes. However; further studies with larger series are needed to clarify the relationship between stabilization performance and the shooting performance of archery athletes."

Background: Sexual and reproductive health concerns often arise, but adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these sensitive topics with their parent or provider. Despite clear benefits to contraception use, adolescents may experience challenges in the quality of communication discussing contraception with their providers that can influence their sexual health outcomes. Mothers and daughters are increasingly accessing primary care. Providers may feel unprepared in discussions around contraception. Although a variety of communication training programs exist for pediatrician trainees and health providers, none are culturally appropriate, family based or designed to address the challenges of adolescent reproductive health. Objectives: To characterize the quality of sexual and reproductive health encounters involving adolescents, mothers and their provider in pediatric primary care settings. To evaluate a conversation skills intervention for providers and assess its impact on communication quality of sexual and reproductive health encounters. To identify communication strategies preferred by adolescents and their family that may be embedded in a chatbot communication training program. Methods: This study will be conducted in three stages. In Stage 1 (formative) (50 encounters), we will characterize the quality of sexual and reproductive health encounters involving adolescents, mothers and their provider in pediatric primary care settings. Through separate post-encounter surveys of each triad member, we will determine ideal, moderate, and poor communication interactions with a 4-point Likert scale to describe the overall quality of the interactions (concordant contraception plans, satisfaction), communication (confidence, comfort, self-efficacy, confidentiality) and decision-making (perceived autonomy, ownership and power) to determine ideal, moderate, and poor communication interactions. In Stage 2 (development), we will use machine learning algorithms to design virtual conversations for providers, adolescents and mothers. In Stage 3 (proof-of-concept), we will test how an AI communication training intervention tool can influence triadic interactions by comparing evaluation results of 50 pre and 50 post training encounters using the same assessments as in Stage 1. The investigators will enroll ten physician learners who will train with the chatbot communication training program as a behavioral intervention. Before the training, the 10 learners will complete 5 sexual health clinical encounters with adolescent-mother dyads (50 total encounters) that will be audio-recorded and post-encounter surveys completed. After training with the tool, the same 10 learners will complete 5 more clinical encounters with adolescent-mother dyads (50 total encounters) in the same format to assess for improvement in communication interactions. Discussion: This study aims to provide innovative approaches to train pediatricians in adolescent sexual health care. This project addresses a critical gap in evidence-based communication training interventions for pediatricians focusing on underserved adolescents. Expected outcome of this project will be a culturally appropriate and family-focused conversation skills training for pediatricians engaging with adolescents and parents."

Background: There is little information about vitiligo which characterises healthcare disparities in vitiligo, despite mounting evidence about the psychological impact of vitiligo. The aim of this study is to assess and characterise mental health and related issues in a vitiligo cohort recruited from a large electronic healthcare database. Healthcare disparities: Mental health conditions; healthcare utilisation including primary care encounters, dermatology referrals and mental health referrals; and work impact (time off work and unemployment) will be assessed for people with vitiligo compared to those without vitiligo.
Design: This will be a retrospective observational cohort study. A large electronic healthcare database, the Optimum Patient Care Record (OPCRD), will be interrogated prospectively to identify people with vitiligo and those without vitiligo, from 2004 to 2020. The endpoints for both cohorts will be examined during the following two years (2020-2021). Patients with vitiligo, compared with those without, will be described demographically and followed up with data on mental health referrals, primary care referrals, time off work, and unemployment. The cumulative lifetime incidence and prevalence of vitiligo will be estimated at age 80 years using survival models and plotted by age, gender, socioeconomic profile and ethnicity.
Outcomes: Primary outcomes will include the frequency of mental health referrals, primary care encounters, time off work and unemployment in people with vitiligo compared with those without disease. Secondary outcomes will include prevalence rates of mental health conditions and time to first mental health referral event in the vitiligo population. The cumulative lifetime risk of vitiligo will be estimated by baseline characteristics age, gender, sex, ethnicity and deprivation.
Study size: The cumulative lifetime risk based on 16 years of follow up, accounting for competing risk of death would identify vitiligo in approximately >350,000 individuals.
Investigative team: A multidisciplinary research team of clinicians, epidemiologists, statisticians, a patient group representative and a patient representative will work closely throughout this project."

The COVID-19 pandemic had caused early childhood development to have reduced access to early care, education, and life participation, leading to worsening of parents' mental health status, deterioration of child development, and layoffs. This study found that the use of self-efficacy and relationship interventions based on caregivers' understanding of their relationship can promote long-term parent-child interaction and promote effective intervention in early childhood development. The experimental group is more effective than the self-learning group, with a good degree of self-reporting, suggesting that these two-person interventions could be carried out in a small community, and caregivers should actively participate in the process of participating in self-esteem and family intervention."

The NCCN guidelines for the management of brain metastases recommend localized therapy, including surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), in patients with good performance status, no leptomeningeal disease, and controlled extracranial disease. The investigators believe that it is reasonable to include such patients in a study of vinorelbine and trotabresib. Trotabresib is thought to inhibit poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP), which is commonly altered in HER2-enriched cancers and is also known to function in DNA repair inhibition, and to be particularly effective as a therapeutic agent in breast tumors harboring loss of function mutations that are thought to lead to deficient homologous recombination DNA repair, even in the absence of overt mutations, loss of function or reduced expression in the PARP pathway. There is some evidence that Vinorelbine might enhance the effectiveness of cytotoxic radiotherapy in CNS. This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of 3-week cycles of vinorelbine (9 mg/m2 intravenous over 10 minutes) along with trotabresib administered orally during the entire week (25 mg/day) immediately after the completion of radiation therapy to brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. The investigators aim to determine the highest tolerated dose of this combination. The investigators believe that this treatment regimen with radiotherapy, followed by vinorelbine and trotabresib, will provide an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic approach for patients with limited metastatic disease to the central nervous system."

Our primary goal is to develop a culturally-relevant digital health tool for Black women to detect and treat binge eating in Black women with obesity. Our secondary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the digital health program to prevent weight re-gain. A priori sample size calculations indicate we can detect feasibility and preliminary efficacy for the program (based on previous findings). We will use a randomized clinical trial design with 40 participants. This protocol will be the first to focus on preventing weight gain and reducing binge eating among Black women with obesity by implementing a culturally-relevant digital health tool. The program will utilize an approach of ""centering"" body signals, a cognitive behavioral strategy to better understand and respond to internal eating cues of hunger and satiety. The program's content and design will be informed by a formative process with Black obese women and their primary care providers (PCPs) to optimize engagement and retention in a 6-month study. Intervention Phase: The study will be in two phases: 12-week Feasibility Phase; 6-month Pilot Phase. Phase 1: Feasibility Phase. Aim 1. This formative feasibility phase will include up to 20 participants who, in Phase II, will be randomized to different study arms. Our goal is to recruit 660 Black women over 2 years for Phase 1. The recruitment method will be informed by the results of the formative phase. Aim 1a. Identify the barriers and facilitators to detecting and treating binge eating in Black women with obesity and identify strategies for optimizing digital health tools. Participants will complete individual interviews in Phase I. Interviews will identify strategies for enrolling, retaining and motivating Black women over 6 months and to refine the digital tool. Participants who demonstrate a satisfactory retention rate for Phase 1 (> 90%) will be eligible to participate in Phase II. Aim 1b. Modify and adapt a validated program to be a culturally-relevant digital health tool for binge eating and weight management for Black women."

The purpose of this study is to assess if dietary nitrate (NO3-) supplementation can enhance resistance exercise performance and muscle capacity to generate mechanical work. Specifically, we aim to investigate the effects of different levels of nitrate supplementation on the performance of a single set of heavy resistance exercise. We will explore two different modes of exercise: whole body (e.g., bench press, barbell back squat) and upper body (e.g., barbell bench press, preacher curls) resistance exercise. Investigators will collect data from 30 healthy, male recreational strength-trained individuals between the ages of 18 and 45. Participants will be invited into the study on four separate occasions (one per week), and will be provided (based on a computer-generated sequence) with four different beverages pre-exercise: 4 x 70 ml of nitrate-depleted beetroot juice shots for placebo (PL), 1 x 70 ml of nitrate-rich beetroot juice 3 x 70 ml nitrate-depleted beetroot juice shot for a low dose of nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BR-LOW; 6.5 mmol of nitrate total), 2 x 70 of nitrate-rich beetroot juice and 2 x 70ml of nitrate depleted beetroot juice shot for a moderate dose of nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BR-MOD; 13 mmol of nitrate total), and 4 x 70 ml of nitrate-rich beetroot juice for an elevated dose of nitrate-rich beetroot juice (BR-HIGH; 26 mmol of nitrate total). The 6 conditions will be presented in a fixed, counter-balanced order such that subjects will perform all 3 interventions in a crossover assignment in each muscle group."

Study Overview
=================
A total of 72 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be included from December 2021 to April 2022. All patients recruited will be included in the study if they meet the inclusion criteria. Written and oral information will be obtained from the candidates to be included in the study. All candidates will be informed in writing again before the operation and the consent form will be signed by 2 people by the candidates.
Patients who are not volunteering will be excluded from the study before the operation. Patients who do not consent to the continuation of the study during the operation will be excluded. Patients with ASA 3-4 or patients who do not meet the other inclusion criteria will be excluded from the study. Patients with lung disease, other surgical procedures or anesthetic techniques, pregnant patients, and patients with morbid obesity who cannot tolerate surgery under general anesthesia or have contraindications to the study will be excluded from the study. Patients whose operation is determined to be converted from laparoscopic to laparotomy at any time for any reason after the incision is made will also be excluded. Data will be recorded from the electronic hospital record system. The records of all operations will be inspected and recorded in the study program. Anesthesia data in the operation chart of the patients will be used. If there are errors during data recording, these data will be re-evaluated by 2 experts in the surgical and anesthesia fields to correct the error again. Patients will be included in the groups after the insufflation pressure applied by the surgeon. The group where the insufflation pressure level is determined as 12 mmHg will be kept in group 12, and the group where the insufflation pressure level is determined by the surgeon as 14 mmHg will be kept in group 14. Mechanical power parameters of the patients will be measured using a pressure monitor (Puritan Bennett, Pennsylvania, USA) between December 2021-April 2022. Mechanical power values will be measured for 1 hour after the operation. Statistical power analysis has been performed to determine the number of patients to be included in the study. No statistically significant association was found between mean mechanical power and intraoperative complications in the study literature. In view of the results of the study, a sample size of 36 patients in each group was determined as appropriate to evaluate this relationship in cholecystectomy. The sample size in this study has been determined as sufficient to detect the difference in mechanical power between the 2 groups with at least 90% power at a significance level of 5%. The data recorded will be tabulated by SPSS 22.0. All data will be expressed in numbers, percentages, mean, median and standard deviation. Shapiro Wilk test will be used to evaluate data distribution in each section. Normally distributed data variables in the two groups will be compared using the independent or paired t-test (or Mann Whitney U test respectively). Non-normally distributed data variables; They will be evaluated with the chi-square test after testing the compliance of the data structure with the expected distribution with the Shapiro Wilk test. Correlation will be evaluated between variables in the normal distribution range. A p value below 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The results obtained will be expressed in text, tables, and graphics in a clear and concise way. The results will be evaluated with statistical packages.

Background: Furcation involvement of molars in deep class restorations is a common finding in patients with deep class restorations. Radiographic assessment is the most recommended technique for evaluation of furcation involvement when CBCT is not the method of choice. MRI might be an acceptable alternative to CBCT. Purpose: The main goal of this prospective study is to assess the extent of horizontal and vertical bone loss determined by MRI compared with CBCT in molars with deep class restorations and furcation involvement. We also aim to assess the correlation between MRI and CBCT in the measurement of furcation involvement. Methods: 60 subjects will be included sequentially by the clinical periodontal research group of the Department of Periodontology of the University of Graz. Patients included in the study must have full bone coverage as measured by CBCT (<1.5 mm) in at least one first molar with a deep class II or III restorations and furcation involvement in the apical third (grade II or III, according to Hamp 1975). MRI will be performed with the subject sitting in a fully loaded MRI scanner and with a 3.0 T MRI device (Siemens MAGNETOM Verio, Erlangen, Germany). Data on alveolar bone loss will be extracted for the mesial and distal roots of each molar in both CBCT and MRI examinations. Results and conclusion: If MRI is shown to be an acceptable alternative to CBCT, then further research will be needed for an alternative, non-invasive method. This will be of clinical importance for dentists, since it avoids intra-oral ionization radiation used in CBCT and is cost-effective, compared to regular CBCT assessment. It will also contribute to the development of a new method for evaluation of furcation involvement.."

The effects of physical and mental development differences in children with ADHD and healthy children were detected in dental health. Differences between the two groups were detected in terms of gingivitis, and it was concluded that children with ADHD exhibit gingival bleeding more frequently than children without ADHD. However, when plaque removal efficiency of children with ADHD is evaluated according to the type of electric toothbrush used, it was determined that electric toothbrush use of children with ADHD provided a plaque removal efficacy similar to that of healthy children. A comparison of mechanical cleaning methods in children with special dental health needs is needed to determine the plaque removal efficacy of these groups.

Background: The objective of this clinical research is to evaluate the efficacy of two manual toothbrushes (CS 5460 and Oral-B 123) and two electric toothbrushes (DiamondClean 9000 Philips® and HydroSonic Easy Curaden®) when used daily by pregnant women over a 3-month period.
Objective: Assess the impact of the recommended brushing time (3 minutes minimum) of electric and manual toothbrushes on clinical parameters from baseline during pregnancy.
Methods: Randomized clinical comparative trial in parallel groups with controlled masking. Fifty-two women were recruited when they were in their first trimester of pregnancy and were randomly distributed into groups using sonic or manual toothbrushes or a combination of both. The initial evaluation is made at baseline (T1) and after 1 and 3 months (T2 and T3) by the principal investigator, independent of the randomization groups. The clinical parameters evaluated were: gingival bleeding (BI), number of sites with BI, gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), clinical attachment (CAL), periodontal pocket (PTRPDEP), and Patient Satisfaction Score (PSS).
Intervention/Treatment: Participants at baseline were included in the trial in four experimental groups: Group 1 (n = 13), patients using a sonic toothbrush; Group 2 (n = 13), patients using manual with 5460 strands; Group 3 (n = 13), patients using manual toothbrush; Group 4 (n = 13), patients using two brushes during baseline.
Analysis: Qualitative and quantitative variables were presented by descriptive statistics: absolute and percentage frequency for qualitative variables; minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation for quantitative variables. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed in the experimental groups, comparing changes from baseline in all parameters before and after treatment between the various groups.
Results: The mean plaque index before treatment (baseline) was similar between all experimental groups (PBS1 = 3.3±2.6; PBS2 = 3.3±2.6; PBS3 = 2.7±2.8; PBS4 = 3.4±2.7), except for the number of teeth (mean: PBS1 = 21.5±4.2; PBS2 = 21.4±4.7; PBS3 = 22.0±4.3; PBS4 = 21.4±4.6, p= 0.010). Over the evaluation period, there was a significant reduction in plaque (P < 0.0001) in all groups. However, no significant differences were observed between the groups using any toothbrush, the only difference being in the GI index with regard to the treatment performed (p= 0.000). The results of the study conclude that the two toothbrushes, sonic and hydrosonic, were as effective as the manual toothbrush to control gingival bleeding, gingival inflammation, and plaque control.
Ethical Considerations: This study is the direct result of the study of its investigators and a clear need to expand knowledge in this field, which was developed with the participation of the research group, taking into account the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Research Ethics Board of Clínica São José of CIMO, Campinas, based on the National Law No. 7,194, of 17 December 1984 on the Registry of Clinical Trials, in force since August 18, 1986, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.

The metabolic state of patients with cancer is an important factor that influences the effectiveness of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors by changing the amount of proteins in the body, including the anti-PD-1 drug. Studies previously have shown that nutritional interventions with high-energy and high-protein oral nutritional supplements (ONS) prevent or reduce weight loss and improve the protein balance and treatment response in patients with lung cancer receiving chemotherapy. This study, called NutriCim, specifically aims to show the impact of a tailored oncology nutritional intervention (ONI) on the bioavailability of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with lung cancer, especially pembrolizumab. The study will focus on the effects of the oncology nutritional intervention in NSCLC patients receiving anti PDL-1 immunotherapy."

Depression and anxiety disorders are pathological conditions associated with severe economic and social costs. While significant progress has been made in understanding its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, very few molecular targets for drug development have emerged. Here we identify a number of signaling pathways linking integrin β3, Protocadherin-9 (Pcdh9) and dysfunctional synaptic circuitry in glutamatergic circuits in the brain.
In order to achieve this aim, the following study arms have been designed:
1) Patients with Anxious-Depressive Disorders (Anx-Depr.D) and healthy controls (HC) will be enrolled, and neurofunctional and neurochemical assessments will be conducted, including the measurement of excitatory synaptic markers using structural and functional MRI, 1H-MRS.
Excitatory neurotransmission is critical in the regulation of glutamatergic circuits in cognitive and emotional functions and a dysfunction in this type of transmission has been found in depression and anxiety.
In particular:
- structural brain imaging (e.g., T1-weighted) performed using a 7T-MRI will be used to study the volumetric differences in white and gray matter structures between HC and Anx-Depr.D subjects in the prefrontal-limbic pathway, the area most sensitive to depression and anxiety. This assessment is crucial as the Anx-Depr.D shows significant atrophy of white matter in this specific area, and this atrophy is more severe in patients who have also experienced suicide attempts
- functional brain imaging (e.g., fMRI) will be used to study the functional connectivity differences at rest and during task in the prefrontal-limbic pathway. Since this pathway is frequently impaired in both depression and anxiety disorders, this assessment will help to identify abnormal functional connections.
- proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) will be performed to study the altered levels of glutamatergic neurotransmitters in the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, critical hubs in cognitive-emotional control.
These specific targets are of potential interest in the pathogenesis of depression. Moreover, they help to test the hypothesis that glutamate neurotransmission in the prefrontal-anterior cingulate circuit is altered in depression and anxiety.
2) Mice with Pcdh9 deficits will be investigated for changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal-limbic pathway, comparing Pcdh9 KO (homozygotes) and control mice (wild type). Pcdh9 was not known to be involved in the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the nervous system thus far, but it has a role in maintaining the integrity of synaptic connections in the brain, ensuring they are correctly targeted to and from the developing brain. In fact, it is known that Pcdh9 plays a critical role in controlling how cells communicate throughout the developing brain, by ensuring that neurons and other cell types remain connected to the right nearby structures. Abnormal Pcdh9 expression has been implicated in a number of developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as lissencephaly, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Autism Spectrum disorders (ASD). Given the role of Pcdh9 in mediating synaptic connectivity, understanding the dysfunctional circuitry may provide new targets for drug development.
3) In a series of follow-up experiments, the investigators plan to study the interaction between integrin β3 and Protocadherin9 using co-immunoprecipitation analysis from murine brain. If a causal link is established between the two proteins, the investigators will proceed to study compensatory mechanisms of defective Pcdh9 activity in mice. They will assess whether overexpression of integrin β3 or Protocadherin9 compensates for defects in synaptic glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs. In this case, experiments on murine models will be performed to determine whether overexpression of integrin β3 or protocadherin9 could compensate for defects in synaptic glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs.
Finally, the investigators will undertake to establish an integrin β3/Protocadherin9 drug discovery program to identify novel compounds that restore glutamatergic syn"

A microbial ecosystem is a complex community of interacting bacteria. The potential role of intestinal flora in human health has attracted extensive attention. Imbalances in the gut microbiome have been implicated in a variety of chronic diseases. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity worldwide and are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent advances have provided scientific evidence that cardiovascular disease may also be attributable to gut microbiota. In many literatures, we have found complex interactions between microorganisms, their metabolites, and potential impacts on the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. The use of intestinal flora in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is the latest research direction. Gut microbes are likely to be used in the clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases in the near future.
Gut flora plays an important role in human health and disease transformation. It not only participates in many physiological processes of the host, but also affects the function of the central nervous system (CNS) through the activity of the microbiota - gut - brain axis, which may be closely related to neurotransmitter, immune, endocrine and metabolite pathways. When the intestinal flora is dysfunctional, it can affect the occurrence and development of CNS diseases such as cerebral ischemia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, hepatic encephalopathy and mental disorders.
Fecal microbial transplantation, exercise training, acupuncture and massage and other therapies can improve intestinal flora disorders, and are expected to become effective measures to treat and prevent some nervous system diseases.
Based on a comprehensive understanding of the microbiome involved in cardiovascular and neurological diseases, explore the relationship between cardiovascular and neurological diseases and intestinal microbiome through clinical sample collection, sequencing technology and machine learning analysis, to provide a new theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and neurological diseases."

Pembrolizumab has been approved for first-line locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50% for PDL1, based on the results of KEYNOTE-024. However, even with a positive PDL1 status, only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy. In the KEYNOTE-024 study evaluating pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS ≥50%, the response rate in the pembrolizumab arm alone was 45%. This result led to the approval of pembrolizumab for first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS ≥ 50%, which nevertheless represents only 22% of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Early identification of biomarkers for patients unlikely to benefit from first-line pembrolizumab is therefore a crucial step in selecting suitable candidates. Furthermore, in cancer, genomic alterations in NFE2L2, KEAP1 and CUL3 result in constitutive activation of NRF2-dependent gene transcription, which promotes cellular resistance to oxidative stress, xenobiotic efflux, proliferation and metabolic reprogramming. Somatic mutations in NFE2L2 and KEAP1 are found in 3.5-15% and 12-17% of NSCLC patients respectively. NFE2L2 is a transcription factor that directs the expression of free radical defense genes that may interfere with radiation-induced DNA damage. KEAP1 is an adaptor protein that targets NFE2L2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction as part of normal homeostasis. These new biomarkers are of clinical interest, as KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations predict radiation resistance in patients with localized NSCLC treated with radiotherapy but not surgery. Some data also suggest a role for the KEAP1/NFE2L2 axis in response to immunotherapy. Establishing a predictive model for the presence of the KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutation would provide a tool for predicting survival (progression-free and overall), even before the patient starts immunotherapy.

In Mexico, tens of thousands of refugees arrived after December 2018, when the previous US administration began the ""return-to-Mexico"" policy that separated thousands of families. While this policy was temporary, Mexican families continue to arrive to the Tijuana/San Diego border in high numbers. Many stay in large shelters, awaiting adjudication of refugee claims by Mexican authorities. A unique opportunity exists to intervene during the shelter stay to promote parenting skills and strengthen family relationships and overall well-being. While stressors on parents in refugee shelters have been identified in previous research, no studies address effective interventions to address these challenges. This research is proposed to fill these gaps by creating an innovative and culturally-sensitive learning curriculum to build parenting skills in refugee families facing the challenges of the border environment. By involving the host community directly, this approach will enable parents to learn and practice important skills that lead to more positive parent-child interactions, as well as child behaviors and fewer signs of parental stress. Participating mothers, fathers, and children can learn together while also promoting community and culture within the shelter. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of teaching parenting skills to refugee families and to involve the larger host community in promoting these skills. This proposed investigation has 4 specific goals: to work with parents and community stakeholders in shelter settings to identify the most important parenting skills that they want for their children. These skills will be prioritized into a concise curriculum. To facilitate the delivery of the curriculum through a learning-by-observing model (LOPI), which increases feelings of ownership and efficacy. To test the effectiveness of this curriculum of parenting skills in improving parent-child interactions and reducing signs of parenting stress compared to a control group waiting to receive the intervention while providing a handout on basic parenting skills. To demonstrate, through qualitative analysis, that parenting skills learned in the shelters may be applicable to life post-shelter after refugees cross the US border. This research proposal presents a framework for adapting parenting interventions for refugee-origin families and involves all groups of people in the shelter in identifying the most important needs and learning together in a supportive community setting. The proposed curriculum aims to be accessible, culturally and linguistically sensitive, and effective in promoting the highest quality care for children of refugee families. This research has the potential to contribute to the development of a community-oriented mental health program that will impact a growing population of refugees awaiting asylum in Mexico."

The main objective of this study is to identify areas for improvement in the health care experiences of those with incurable HNC (head and neck cancer). It is estimated that around 2,500 people a year (up to10 per week) in the North of England are diagnosed with incurable head and neck cancer. The study will be involving both patients/family carers and health care professionals (HCP) in an innovative two-phase process to generate views and opinions about what can be done to improve things for those involved in caring for or having incurable head and neck cancer. By adopting the participatory action research approach throughout all phases of the project we hope to achieve an active partnership between patients/family carers and HCP to provide innovative, creative solutions for improvement. In Phase 1 we are involving patients and family carers through longitudinal qualitative interviews at 4-month intervals following a sampling strategy of purposive maximum variation sampling. All interviews will be conducted via telephone call, video call or online written interviews.

In Phase 2, co-design workshops were be developed using findings from the initial interviews. These workshops will involve patients/family carers and HCP, and aim to identify and prioritise 'stress-points' in the system, where things need to be improved, and generate initial ideas for solutions.

Interviews with patients and family carers will be conducted by an experienced and accredited qualitative interviewer (Dr Emily Mayland). Patients will be approached through a variety of settings and will be recruited in order to ensure a diversity of experiences are captured. Focus Groups with HCP will be facilitated by a multidisciplinary team involving at least 5 HCPs (consultant surgeon, consultant oncologist, clinical nurse specialist, palliative care specialist, allied health professional e.g. dietician, speech and language therapist and specialist nurse). These meetings will be supported by experienced qualitative researchers at the University of Sheffield.

The co-design approach will involve a variety of stakeholders including those with lived experience (patients and family carers) and those who work clinically with or commission services for those with incurable HNC (clinicians, commissioners and service leads) and members of the wider public. This study will use a variety of methods including long term qualitative interviewing and focus groups to provide a comprehensive understanding of the experiences of people with incurable head and neck cancer and the perspectives of health care professionals. This study has been approved by the University of Sheffield Risk Assessment and Ethics Committee (approval number: 6514). It is an important element of our research programme funded by Yorkshire Cancer Research. This study can help improve the quality of life for a large number of individuals with head and neck cancer, their families and also provide guidance for health care decisions."

Endoscopic spinal surgery has become one of the leading minimally invasive surgical methods with rapid recovery, small trauma and fewer complications. Endoscopic spinal surgery is the nerve root decompression based on the preservation of the posterior ligament complex. The accuracy of nerve root identification and protection is of great importance. In response to the increasing attention of minimally invasive spinal surgery, this project will evaluate the clinical application value of near-infrared fluorescence imaging of indocyanine green in the identification of nerve roots in endoscopic spinal surgery.
Fluorescence imaging based on indocyanine green can provide high sensitivity and specificity assistance to the surgeon in identifying the spinal nerve roots. The main factors influencing this process are fluorescence imaging rate of nerve roots, fluorescence imaging time and ICG-related adverse reactions.
This project conducts a prospective randomized clinical study on 90 patients with lumbar disc herniation requiring endoscopic spinal surgery. 
The patients are divided into 1 mg/kg ICG group, 2 mg/kg ICG group, 0.5 mg/kg ICG group and control group(without intervention). The primary evaluation indicators are: the fluorescence imaging rate of nerve roots, the fluorescence imaging signal ratio of nerve root endoscopically, the time taken to find the nerve root endoscopically. The secondary evaluation indicators include: operation-related factors such as imaging method time, amount of bleeding, degree of nerve root protection, visual analogue pain scale, Oswestry disability index and surgical complications. At the same time, 30 patients of the 90 patients in the 1 mg/kg ICG group, 2 mg/kg ICG group are selected and divided into three groups to evaluate safety indexes such as adverse events of ICG.
We hope that this project can provide reliable and effective clinical guidance for the application of indocyanine green fluorescence near-infrared imaging in endoscopic spinal surgery, improving the accuracy of nerve root protection and minimizing surgical risks."

Background: Children with IDDs and their parents often experience social isolation, financial problems, and an increased chance of becoming a victim of child abuse or neglect. Parents who are not well supported could also have low self-esteem that negatively affect how they feel about their parenting abilities. Social services have a duty to identify and provide support for parents when they experience these difficulties. There are several structured evidence-based training programs, but they are mostly delivered in small groups or in the community and they often lack focus on individualized care for families or on practical skills such as household safety. Further, there is an underreported risk for neglect and abuse of young children with IDDs, but structured training programs for supporting those parents are yet to be fully tested. The intervention: For this study, we want to develop a parenting program that has been found to be effective, but that can be delivered in a practical approach suitable for parents with IDDs. The program should be adapted to specific parenting needs and should be provided in the home. The intervention includes support in both practical household tasks as well as skills development in caregiving, based on child's needs, and in parenting skills such as responsiveness and playful engagement with the child. 
Objective: The main objective of the study is to develop a practical home-based training program for parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and to evaluate its effect on parental confidence in caregiving and on child wellbeing. We aim to adapt and individualize the program. We will also measure the effects of the intervention compared to treatment as usually provided.
Method: Parents who have children aged 0-6 years living in their own home and who are assessed as in need of individualized care, are included in the study. Each participating parent will be coached and supported to complete structured training tasks, as well as providing data regarding child wellbeing and parent feelings about their own parenting abilities."

This is a research study involving 11 participants with malignancies in the pancreas, lungs and bowels. These subjects will have 68Ga NOTA-H006 intravenous injection to the arm. Images will be obtained by PET/CT (two examinations at least 4 hours apart) within 1 day. Based on the SUVmax of the lesions in the PET scan, we will compare the imaging results with the corresponding pathological specimens (imaging lesions biopsied or surgically resected) and compare the difference. In this way, the investigators will further understand the expression of 5T4 in subjects with these malignancies and the effectiveness of 68Ga-NOTA-H006 in imaging. This study may provide new ideas for the non-invasive diagnosis of tumors."

Heart failure is a common disease with high morbidity and mortality. There are different treatments available and all have a limited effect on reducing heart failure related events and improving survival. Resynchronization therapy, CRT, is a pacemaker with two extra electrodes that stimulates both left and right ventricle simultaneously. A subset of patients respond to CRT with improved heart function, health status and survival. In order to select the best patients for CRT and optimize the treatment, we have started to collect blood samples, heart tissue and clinical data from heart failure patients eligible for CRT and a control group of heart failure patients on medical therapy. Patients will be assessed before CRT implantation and at 3, 6 and 12 months. The samples are stored in the KUHT biobank (Swemno 2012-027) and used for different studies including proteomic and molecular studies in the heart tissue, exosomal miRNAs in blood and analysis of red blood cells. The data collected will be used to increase our knowledge of the mechanisms behind heart failure and resynchronization therapy and to identify biomarkers that could help select patients likely to respond to CRT.
In a subgroup of study eligible patients, a heart biopsy will be performed before CRT to study the biological differences between patients that respond to resynchronization therapy and patients that do not. After a study period of 2-3 years, all the collected data will be analysed and published in different articles from the study."

Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a chronic progressive disease and currently has no cure. The guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is the current first-line treatment for patients with HFrEF. The majority of patients with HF are tolerable to all the medications recommended in GDMT. For patients who are intolerable for GDMT, the clinical value of the medications is not well documented. In addition, there is no guideline for the treatment of intolerable patients. This study aims to determine the prognosis of HF patients who are intolerable to GDMT and propose a treatment strategy for these patients. We will include 200 patients with HFrEF and follow-up them for 180 days. The outcome endpoints are all-cause death or worsening heart failure, change of symptoms and signs of heart failure, and changes of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), Left Ventricular End-Systolic Dimension (LVESD), Left Ventricular End-diastolic Diameter (LVEDD), Left Ventricular Fractional Shortening (LVFS) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level from baseline to endpoint. This study will provide evidence for treatment strategies of patients who are tolerable or intolerable to GDMT."

This will be a cross-sectional prospective study. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by members of the ESC team and will be informed about the study. Interested patients will then discuss the study with the research team and will be invited to participate. After informed consent has been obtained, participants will complete a questionnaire which will cover their level of prognostic awareness, psychological symptoms, and quality of life). The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The questionnaire can be completed online via RedCap. Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study is the level of patients' prognostic awareness, which will be assessed by the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire. This questionnaire has previously been successfully used in research to assess patients' information preferences, perceptions about their prognosis and the goals of therapy and communication preferences about end-of-life care. Secondary endpoints will be (a) patients' preferences for receiving prognostic information assessed through the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire (b) symptoms of depression evaluated through the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), (c) symptoms of anxiety evaluated through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), (d) quality of life and (d) patients' trust in their medical team and (e) other aspects of perceived quality of care, rated on a visual analogue scale (NRS) from 0-10. Sample size and statistics: The investigators will conduct univariable and multivariable regression analyses to evaluate associations between sociodemographic or clinical variables and outcomes. The investigators aim to include 100 patients. This will give us at least 10 degrees of freedom to assess association of potential risk factors with outcome and to evaluate confounders in a multivariable analysis. Discussion: This will be the first prospective study to assess prognostic awareness among cancer patients referred to ESC services in a British setting. Identifying covariates for prognostic unawareness and psychological burden among patients with advanced cancer will inform the future development of strategies to improve care and communication with this patient group."

Arterial hypertension remains one of the most important risk factors in developing a cardiovascular disease. Medical treatment is usually necessary, lifestyle modifications should always be included. Besides physical activity and a balanced diet, there are also therapeutic approaches from the so called classical complementary medicine. One very important part in Europe is hydrotherapy, based on ideas of Sebastian Kneipp and his contemporaries. In hydrotherapy there are various therapeutic approaches that can be used additionally to conventional therapy. Because conventional medical therapy is often associated with unwanted side effects, these additional approaches experience increasing popularity. In arterial hypertension, temperature-elevating armbaths, developed by Kneipps contemporaries Hauffe and Schwenninger, are a hydrotherapeutic approach that is highly recommended. Even though hydrotherapy has been a part of complementary medicine for more than a century now some therapeutic approaches lack of scientific evidence - especially when it comes to their effect on arterial hypertension. This randomized-controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a temperature-elevating armbath among participants with arterial hypertension. 50 participants will be randomized to either an intervention group or waitlist (treatment as usual). All 50 participants will be monitored with three 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure measurements (24h ABPM) at the beginning of the trial after randomization, at 8 weeks and at 6 months. The intervention group will be advised to perform the armbaths on 5 of 7 days per week for 8 weeks total. Each participant will get a detailed instruction how to perform the armbath and will be handed a diary to document their performance. After 6 months, each participant of the control group will be offered to be instructed on performing the armbaths as well. Within the active period of 8 weeks, participants of both groups will be called regularly to ask about their health and whether they have questions regarding the trial.

This randomized clinical trial is considered to be the first study that compared the effect of a circumferential and a sectional matrix on tightness of proximal contacts in Class 2 restorations. 62 patients, with compound class 2 cavities (31 teeth- 16 in each group) will be recruited and they will be randomly selected to receive restoration using the sectional matrix.
                Local anesthesia will be administrated, and the whole quadrant containing the offending tooth will be isolated by using a rubber dam. A proper sized wedge will be used to avoid the gingival overhangs. Restorations will be completed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flossing and a probe will be applied to evaluate and classify the tightness of the proximal contacts after finishing and polishing. Tooth with good general health will be included. Each patient will be selected from patients seeking treatment from the periodontal department of Cairo University. Examination of periodontal and caries status will be done. All restorations in this research will be done by one experienced clinician (S.M.). Tightness of proximal contacts will be evaluated using dental floss. Proximal contact points will be categorized as optimum, open, and tight; if the dental floss passed through the contact area the contact point will be considered optimum. Open contact points will be considered when the dental floss passed through the contact area without resistance. The duration of flossing is less than 5 seconds, according to the FDI recommendations.
                Sample size calculation was based on 80% power and alpha error 0.05 using a software program (Gpower, 2014). Assuming a difference of 0.05 for categorizing tightness of contacts between systems, an effect size of 1.18. 28 cases in each group are required. After a 10% drop out ratio, each group will include 62 cases. Comparison of intergroup difference in tightness of the proximal contacts will be done by using McNemar's test. The significance level is P<0.05.
                The obtained result will help the clinician to choose the best matrix which results in optimum tightness of proximal contact points in Class 2 restorations, leading to longer life span of composite resin restorations..
                The aim of the present study to be the first study comparing the effect of a circumferential and a sectional matrix on tightness of proximal contact in Class II restorations. This study will be the first to report a significant difference in tightness of proximal contacts between the two systems. This study is important for the dental profession because it will provide the evidence base to the clinician in order to choose the optimum matrix for optimum tightness of proximal contacts. Additionally, it adds up to the literature by highlighting the effect of matrix systems on tightness of proximal contacts."

This study seeks to find out whether a pay for performance program can provide more help at a lower cost to frequent users of acute psychiatric services. The purpose is to evaluate whether a pay for performance program, that includes both performance incentives and intensive treatment, can reduce the use of emergency, inpatient, and other high-cost services by persons with severe and persistent mental illness.
The intervention or treatment is an approach that includes intensive case management, individualized assessment and skill building, rehabilitation in the community, peer support, crisis intervention and crisis support, treatment for co-occurring disorders, psychiatric medications, and hospital based care. There are also two financial incentives for providers. The first requires providers to meet certain performance targets by reducing the use of high cost services, with monetary incentives in the form of an 8% bonus if targets are met and a 7% penalty if they are not. The second is a capitated payment system that gives providers a flat amount of money for each client enrolled, but the providers are only paid if clients actually use the services that they pay for.
There was a three-year study period that included an 8-month enrollment period and two years of outcome measures collection. We randomly assigned 114 eligible patients on a 4 to 1 basis to either the pay for performance program or to traditional mental health and psychosocial services, and then followed them over two years. At each follow-up period, we assessed use of emergency services, psychiatric and crisis services, residential care, correctional facility services and other costly programs and services. We also asked a smaller group of participants about their satisfaction with treatment. Finally, we interviewed pay for performance providers and County contract monitors about their experiences with the program."

Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-modified cell therapies are rapidly emerging as a promising approach for the treatment of relapsed and refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).
While CAR-T cells targeting CD19 represent a significant improvement in therapeutic options for patients with R/R aggressive B-cell NHLs, CAR-T cells targeting B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) which target the CD22 antigen, show even better treatment results. The CD20 antigen is also a valuable surface marker for anti-cancer therapy. CD20 has a high degree of target saturation on the surface of virtually all B-cell lymphomas, even at non-pathological or benign disease stages, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Unlike CD19, CD20 is not a cancer-specific marker, but it is very well expressed on the surface of cells. Based on extensive pre-clinical evaluation of bispecific anti-CD19/20 CAR-T cell clones with excellent in in-vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity, I-Mab has developed a CD19/20 bispecific CAR-T cell product, IMPT-314.
Objectives: This study is designed as a dose finding Phase I/II clinical trial with an expansion phase. The purpose of Phase I is to evaluate the safety of IMPT-314 in a first-inhuman study in adult R/R B-cell aggressive NHL patients and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMPT-314 based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The primary objectives of Phase II are to confirm the dose level determined in Phase I, to evaluate the complete response (CR) rate and to estimate the safety of the chosen dose level (either MTD or the highest tolerated dose).
Design: Phase I consists of 2 parts. In Part A a conventional 3+3 design is applied. The MTD of IMPT-314 in adult R/R B-cell aggressive NHL patients will be determined based on the number of participants experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLTs) within the first 28 days after infusion of IMPT-314. In Part B a response-adapted design is used. Cohort A consists of CAR-naïve patients enrolled at the determined MTD. Cohort B consists of CAR-experienced patients enrolled at the determined MTD.
The Phase II part consists of patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL who already initiated the study in the expansion phase of Part B. The primary objectives are to confirm the MTD of IMPT-314 established in Phase I, to evaluate the CR rate and to evaluate the safety of the IMPT-314 cohort in the expansion phase of Phase I.

Chronic sleep disturbance or poor sleep quality is a common problem in long-term care institutions. However, few interventions have been examined to alleviate the problem. A possible solution, binaural beats (BBs), is a music technology embedded with an audio signal that stimulates brainwaves to produce a relaxing and stress-reducing state. To test the efficacy of BBs in improving sleep quality, depression, heart rate variab;ity (HRV) among older adults with poor sleep quality, a randomised controlled trial was conducted.
                The participants were screened from older persons, aged 65 and above, in a long-term care institution in Taiwan. A total of 34 participants (age: 65-89, Hz: 15-20) were randomly assigned into BBM group or control group, with approximately matching of age, gender, marital status, and number of visits from family. The BBM group listened to BB music for 20 min and control group listened to the same music without BB for 20 min in three sessions (Monday to Friday) for 2 weeks. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were used to evaluate sleep quality and depression status, while the HRV analyzer was used to calculate the five markers of HRV. Comparing with the control group, participants in the BBM group showed significant improvement in the total score and seven markers of PSQI, except its subjective item. Besides, the BBM group reported significantly higher depression scores than control group after the two-week intervention. No significant difference of HRV was found between the two groups.
                This study indicates that listening to BBM music for 20 min thrice a week for two weeks improves sleep quality and self-reported depressive symptoms of older persons with poor sleep quality, however, it does not reduce the actual depressive status in them. Thus, BBM music may be an effective and safe music-therapy intervention in the management of sleep quality in long-term care institutions.
                To our knowledge, this is the first study that combines the BBM and familiar music in a long run, and examines its effects on sleep quality, HRV, and depressive status among older persons in a long-term care institution.

Inclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria were participants who: were aged 65 years and older, had a PSQI score> 7, were able to understand questionnaire contents and communicate in Mandarin or Taiwanese Hokkien, stayed in institution for 1 month and more, and did not receive antidepressant within 3 months prior to and during the intervention.

Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria were those with hearing loss, history of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia diagnosed by a physician, and had an acute physiological disease, such as cold, fracture, or trauma.

The study aims to develop an understanding of the barriers and facilitators of a high level of fidelity that is sustainable for use by patients and health care providers. It is a mixed methods implementation science study that aims to personalise follow-up for patients with a high risk of recurrence of a head and neck cancer. Central to the construct of ethical research is the prevention of harm, informed consent, and voluntary participation. Participant demographics, treatments, and clinical condition will be purposively sampled for qualitative interviews to provide a range of patient and service provide perspectives. The study will also involve patient and public involvement (PPI) to provide valuable feedback and ensure the findings are relevant to study participants. Patient surveys, service provider surveys, and interviews will be conducted to evaluate patient experience within the personalised follow-up pathway, acceptability to service providers, and sustainability. The study will also examine the safety and feasibility of the pathway by monitoring any recurrences of cancers and any new cancers developed by these patients."

Maternal and fetal well-being is an indispensable requirement for the safe and efficacious conduct of surgery around the puerperium. In recent years, regional anaesthesia (RA) is associated with increasing safety, especially in the obstetric population.
Many drugs were used in RA to combine the anxiolytic, sedative and antidepressant effects with the analgesic effect of local anaesthetics (LA), to improve their quality and safety.
The most widely used agent for this combination is a non-selective, α2 adrenergic receptor agonist, dexmedetomidine (DXM).
Clinical studies on neuro-physiological block characteristics of intrathecal dexmedetomidine with bupivacaine after caesarean section, has not been reported in the English literature.
The objectives of this study are to compare DXM with neostigmine. This comparison will assess the effect on neuro-physiological block characteristics between the DXM anesthesia group and the neostigmine group. Assessments of the onset and duration of sensory and motor anesthesia, quality of operative field, maternal satisfaction and pain scores were also determined.
Patients will be randomized to group 1 which will be receiving 10 μg intrathecal DXM, Group 2 will be receiving 50 μg intrathecal Neostigmine as an adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine. and Group 3 will be receiving hyperbaric bupivacaine as a control group.
DXM, a nonselective, α2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is a potent sympatholytic and it has sedative, anxiolytic and analgesic effects. The sympatholytic action of DXM has positive effects on hemodynamics. The incidence of hypotension in patients receiving DXM anesthesia has been significantly reduced.
Neostigmine is an indirect cholinomimetic agent which acts as an antagonist of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Neostigmine is a reversible competitive inhibitor for AChE. It combines reversibly with AChE by the formation of an ester link between the carbonyl group of neostigmine and the ester site on the AChE molecule. The carbonyl group in the neostigmine molecule is attacked by a serine residue on AChE, breaking the ester bond, but only in the presence of ACh, which provides another moiety which can combine with the AChE molecule, thus displacing the ACh-enzyme complex. At doses of neostigmine routinely used as a neuromuscular blocking agent, the duration of effect is short because of rapid hydrolysis of neostigmine by AChE.
In addition, patients and attending anesthetist will be assessed for the onset, duration of sensory and motor block, quality of operative field, maternal satisfaction measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) and post-operative pain scores measured by the same VAS.
Intra-operative hemodynamic monitoring will include heart rate (HR) (beat per minute [bpm]), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP ) (mean arterial pressure (MAP) ) and pulse oximetry (SpO2) will be also monitored.
At the end of surgery, 25 mg Metoclopramid ® will be administered to the spinal anesthetized patients to assess the post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) incidence.
It is very important to compare these two adjuvants to bupivacaine to detect their role in improving sensory and motor block, quality of visual field and maternal satisfaction. As the anxiolytic, antidepressant, analgesic efficacy and physiological profile are different the aim of this study is to know which adjuvant can be used safely, easily and better.
                This study will be carried out as a double-mask prospective randomized study. It will take place in the Department of Anaesthesia. The patient's age will be between 18 to 40 years old. The patient's physical condition is American Association of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II, and patients with ASA III and high risk will be excluded from the study."

The mouth is a unique microbial biofilm, and its composition is very much affected by tooth brushing. The effectiveness of tooth brushing relies on the efficiency of mechanical control by the toothbrush on pathogenic bacteria, and a high level of plaque accumulation has been associated with poor oral health and periodontitis. The majority of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment will develop plaque accumulation and gingivitis due to difficulty to brush teeth with fixed braces, and dental plaque and biofilm accumulation can induce significant problems for patients and practitioners during orthodontic treatment. Indeed, gingivitis is the most common oral problem in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances, and its resolution is important for better acceptance of fixed appliances. Additionally, the gingival crevicular fluid is enriched with bacteria and inflammatory markers which will contribute for worsen of the gingiviitis.
In order to assess the efficacy of a new oral care system (Air-Flow) on the incidence of gingivitis, the plaque accumulation and the levels of dental biofilm, gingivitis, plaque accumulation and the levels of biofilm, the host response during orthodontic treatment with fixed braces in patients under 18 years old.
The aim of this study is 1) the evaluation of the effectiveness of the air-polishing system with erythritol in controlling gingivitis and plaque accumulation during orthodontic treatment with fixed braces.
The hypothesis: The null hypothesis tested is that there is no difference between the air-polishing device and the conventional ultrasonic device in preventing WSLs and gingivitis during orthodontic treatment.

Inclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria: Subjects about to undergo fixed orthodontic treatment will be invited to participate. Age between 12 and 16 years only participants Informed written consent obtained by the parents Exclusion Criteria: Clinically significant concomitant disease states (e.g., renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, etc.), Known or suspected non-compliance, drug or alcohol abuse Inability to follow the procedures of the investigation, e.g. due to language problems, psychological disorders, dementia, etc. of the subject Participation in another investigation with an investigational drug or another MD within the 30 days preceding and during the present investigation Previous enrolment into the current investigation Enrolment of the PI, his/her family members, employees and other dependent persons History of fixed orthodontic treatment Defects on enamel on labial surfaces of the teeth Untreated cavitated lesions Plaque levels >25% Periodontitis Multiple missing teeth Cleft lip and/or palate or other craniofacial anomalies or syndromes Patients taking any regular medication Patients with asthmatic problems."

Focal tissue fibrosis is a dominant characteristic of atrial scar tissue, and key to atrial arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. It is also present in pulmonary veins and in fibrotic remodelling after myocardial infarction.
Our group has experience in the study of atrial fibrosis, including in relation to different causes of atrial fibrosis. We have discovered new mechanisms by which atrial fibrosis occurs and new pathways by which atrial fibrosis promotes electrical and mechanical abnormalities that underlie AF and other atrial arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
We now have the opportunity to examine tissue that contains atrial fibrosis and the characteristic atrial driver regions from clinical settings in the field of Thoracic surgery and cardiac surgery. We will study these human atrial tissues, using methods that examine the molecular phenotypes. This pilot study will be the first study to do this."

Parent-based language intervention in early childhood with severe or global developmental delay: a randomized controlled trial with an assessment point at school age.
Background: Children with severe or global developmental delay (DLD) often experience deficits in language development with potential consequences for their later academic, social, and vocational functioning. The current lack of long-term efficacy studies and inconsistently demonstrated effects of language intervention on overall language development require further investigation.
Objectives: 1) To examine whether parent-implemented home-based language intervention applied from childhood to school age with children with severe or global DLD is superior to a less structured control condition with respect to children's spoken language development; 2) To examine whether parent-implemented home-based language intervention applied from childhood to school age is superior to a less structured control condition with respect to children's overall language development; 3) To examine whether parent-implemented home-based language intervention applied from childhood to school age is superior to a less structured control condition with respect to children's communicative participation.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel groups. Participants (N=178) were children with a diagnosis of non-progressive severe or global DLD, aged 3;6 to 4;7 years. Parents participated in the training condition or the control condition. Parents participating in the training condition were supervised weekly for 12 months by speech- and language pathologists in the application of parent-implemented home-based language intervention including a stimulation element during caregiving activities. The intervention will be conducted from age 3;6 to 4;7 years. The control condition consisted of general behavioral guidance. Children's overall language development will be assessed from age 4;8 to 8;11 years.
Expected results/conclusion: The expected results of this study will enhance the knowledge on the long-term effects of language intervention on the language development and participation of children with severe or global DLD."

Mental illness, specifically schizophrenia spectrum disorders, affects an estimated 3.2 million people in the United States. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder often present in early adulthood, with 10% of individuals experiencing their first episode before 18 years of age. Despite the recent identification of first episode psychosis (FEP) clinics and stepped care models, the gap in resources and care between FEP clinics to standard psychiatry outpatient settings is vast for young adults with schizophrenia and related disorders.
The purpose of this study is to assess the barriers and facilitators of integrating Horyzons, a digital intervention for young adults with schizophrenia, as part of standard practice, care or treatment at five established first episode clinics in North Carolina.
This project proposes to conduct formative research within FEP clinics where Horyzons is integrated in the form of focus groups and interviews to qualitatively assess the barriers and facilitators of implementing and integrating a digital intervention with clinical practice. Additionally, a quantitative survey will be conducted to assess the readiness and perspectives of providers on the barriers and facilitators of implementing and integrating a digital intervention at their respective clinic. By understanding the barriers that providers experience when integrating Horyzons into their care, the investigators hope to improve access to evidence-based intervention and improve the quality of services at established FEP clinics, ultimately bridging the gap between first episode care and psychiatry outpatient settings.

Participating in this study involves the following procedures/activities: If you are a provider/peer specialist who works or collaborates with a first episode psychosis clinic in North Carolina, you will be asked to complete an adapted survey on barriers and facilitators of implementing and integrating evidence-based practices at your clinic (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). This survey will be completed once at baseline (approximately 4 weeks).
If you are a client diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or other psychotic disorders, receiving services from select FEP clinics in North Carolina, you will be asked to participate in qualitative interviews related to your engagement with Horyzons once you complete the effectiveness trial. This qualitative interview will be conducted once, at the end of your involvement in Horyzons for a 12-month period.
If you are a client diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or other psychotic disorders, receiving services from select FEP clinics in North Carolina, you will be asked to complete several brief questionnaires at baseline, approximately four (4) weeks post-admission to the platform, 12 months post-admission to the platform, and 3 months post-completion of the platform (for a total of up to 24 months). These questionnaires will include a battery of items that examines your individual experiences and treatment history (for up to 2 times), as well as assessments of loneliness, social support, and overall quality of life.

If you are a client diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or other psychotic disorders, receiving services from select FEP clinics in North Carolina, you will be asked to use an online platform, Horyzons, for a period of 12 months. Each time you login and use the platform (e.g., engage with activities, tracks, and online community discussions/interactions), information will be passively collected without the ability to turn off or limit the information being collected. Information collected may include how often you use the platform, the activities you engage in, and your engagement in online discussions.

If you are a provider or peer support specialist at a first episode psychosis clinic in North Carolina, you will be asked to answer questions related to your clinical practice at baseline and once at 12 months. Providers, as well as peers, will also be asked to participate in a small focus group or one-on-one interview if they choose. The qualitative interview will be conducted once at 12 months and focus on your perspectives, experiences, and challenges of integrating and implementing a digital intervention into your day-to-day care.

If you are a client diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or other psychotic disorders, receiving services from select FEP clinics in North Carolina, you will be asked to complete a brief battery of measures at baseline and once again as you make the transition from the platform to a follow-up questionnaire."

The aim of the study is to investigate the gene expressions in patients with liver transplantation compared to the healthy group and to determine the gene expression patterns in liver transplant patients in order to contribute to the early prediction of transplantation-related complications and determine better treatment protocols. For this purpose, liver transplant patients and healthy volunteers who received informed consent will be involved in the study. Biochemical analysis will be performed by collecting peripheral venous blood (5 ml) from patients before surgery, 1 month and 6 months after surgery. Peripheral blood samples will be used for DNA isolation and gene expression measurements in our study. The expression levels of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes will be evaluated by qRT-PCR (Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction) and RTQ-PCR methods.

This is an open, clinical proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of two doses of BI 771716 administered via a single intravitreal injection (IVT) and subsequently via five additional IVT injections (total of six IVT injections) into one eye in participants with Geographic Atrophy (GA) secondary to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). The study is scheduled as an open-label, non-randomized multi-part study in participants with GA secondary to AMD.

Participants will be enrolled into one of the two cohorts: Part A (single rising dose [SRD] part) or Part B (multiple dose [MD] part) and will receive a single IVT injection at screening and two IVT injections prior initiation of the multiple dose treatment (MD part). SRD part participants will also receive three IVT injections post the MD part. In both treatment cohorts, each participant will receive IVT administered as a per-protocol injection with a topical anaesthetic, followed by a pre-defined ≥10 second interval and a ≥30 second interval. In Parts A and B, BI 771716 will be administered as a solution of 0.01-0.03 mg/mL, either 1.2, 2.5 or 5.0mg in Part A or 2.0mg in Part B. Subjects will have at least one post-injection blood sample collected to measure BI 771716 concentrations one hour after the baseline injection. Participants will be allowed to remain in the treatment cohort for treatment with additional IVT injections up until Week 26.
The primary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the tolerability and safety of intravitreal single rising doses of BI 771716 to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and to assess the pharmacokinetics of intravitreal multiple doses of BI 771716. The secondary objectives include determining the incidence of AEs and Ocular AEs, comparing the PK and PD profiles of BI 771716 and evaluating the long-term safety after dosing with single (Part A) or multiple doses (Part B) with BI 771716."

Cardiac decompensation secondary to volume expansion is a common reason for hospitalization in acute heart failure patients. The primary treatment for this entity is diuresis. Current standards recommend the use of loop diuretics for this indication. A novel technology called Matched Dehydration System (RenalGuard) has been developed to optimize fluid removal in these patients by matching hourly urine output to the infusion of sterile liquid. This technology promises to allow better fluid removal during diuresis therapy while also maintaining optimal blood volume. However, it is not known if the novel technology leads to better outcomes in decompensated heart failure patients compared to standard diuretic therapy. This study proposes the determination of the effects of Matched Dehydration System compared to standard loop diuretic therapy on acute kidney injury episodes and weight loss in decompensated heart failure patients. We further intend to determine the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events in this population, specifically cardiovascular death, worsening heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, or re-hospitalization due to heart failure exacerbations."

Chest pain is the most frequent reason for children and adolescents to visit the emergency department (ED) in the United States. Although a majority cases are deemed non-cardiac, a significant portion of these patients undergo unnecessary cardiac testing or are admitted for observation, which carries significant logistical and economic challenges for the healthcare system. Prior research has identified a group of children with chest pain referred to as “idiopathic” chest pain, children with chest pain but no underlying cardiac pathology. Idiopathic chest pain is most commonly seen in adolescents, is typically musculoskeletal in nature, and has been studied extensively in this age group. Despite the high prevalence of idiopathic chest pain in adolescents, there have been no previous studies to evaluate the efficacy of pain-directed interventions in this population.
Research with adult patients with chronic pain syndromes has identified mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), which focus on increasing awareness of pain and increasing positive emotional states, as effective non-pharmacological approaches to pain management. There have been no published studies of MBIs for children with recurrent chest pain, and yet the same principles of mindfulness may be effective for children as well.
The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of a MB-directed intervention on pain coping strategies in adolescents with idiopathic or musculoskeletal chest pain. If feasible and acceptable, this trial would provide the basis for future studies focused on improving outcomes and decreasing healthcare utilization in this population."

Background:
The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has led to a devastated global health crisis. Therefore, millions of individuals are vaccinated against COVID-19 to reduce infection rates. These vaccines also induce a strong antibody response against other coronaviruses, most notably against the coronavirus causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers are now exploring the possibility of extending the license of their vaccines to cover MERS as well. This goal can be achieved via inclusion of certain antigens of MERS in the vaccine, known as MERS antigens. In parallel, pneumococcal vaccination is recommended by physicians in general and is particularly important for elderly individuals. Pneumococci is a bacteria causing major complications in various age groups and particularly in the elderly, who are especially vulnerable to these complications. This also holds true for individuals with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease. The study aims to investigate whether vaccination with a COVID-19 and a pneumococcal vaccine at the same time causes a reduction in antibodies against Pneumococci in comparison to vaccination with a single or the other vaccine as a comparison.
Inclusion criteria:
Participants, who have received three Covid-19 vaccines, of which the third was a mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) and at least 16 weeks ago will be included in the study, after giving their consent by signing an informed consent form.
Participation is not possible if
- Use of immunosuppressants
- Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (e.g. history of HIV infection, hematological disease, current malignancy, or others)
- Chronic condition that may significantly interfere with the immune response in the opinion of the investigator
- History of Covid-19 within 16 weeks before study vaccination
- Previous pneumococcal vaccination
- Contraindication against any ingredient of the NVX or the PCV20 vaccine.
Participants will be randomly distributed into four study arms:
1. Active Comparator: NVX arm. In this arm, participants will receive the NVX vaccine and also a placebo injection administered intramuscularly in the right leg.
2. Active Comparator: PCV20 arm. In this arm, participants will receive the PCV20 vaccine and also a placebo injection administered intramuscularly in the left leg.
3. Experimental: Combination arm. In this arm, participants will receive the NVX vaccine and also the PCV20 vaccine.
4. Placebo Comparator: Placebo arm. Participants in this arm will receive three placebo injections administered intramuscularly to each leg."

The purpose of this study is to show the possible anti-DOMS effects of treatment with the flavonoid diosmin taken 1 day before exercise and 2 days after exercise. This project will be carried out through a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled single-center clinical trial in Paraná State Capital (Curitiba), with a volunteer sample of 39 female athletes. All of them will be subjected to a standardized intense dynamic exercise protocol and will be randomly divided into two experimental groups, as follows: intervention group that will receive supplementation with 750 mg of diosmin (5 tablets, twice a day for 3 days) and the control group that will receive 750 mg placebo (5 tablets, twice a day for 3 days). The effects of diosmin will be assessed immediately after exercise cessation, as well as 24 and 48 hours later. Additionally, evaluations will be carried out at the beginning and end of the experimental period to confirm the absence of alterations in oxidative balance, as well as any adverse effect. In accordance with the study's objectives, the investigators will investigate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin reduces muscle pain (primary outcome), in addition to muscle tissue damage, oxidative stress and the impairment caused by DOMS in performance and balance."

Background/rational: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood disability, with a prevalence of 2.11 per 1000 live births in high-income countries. CP is attributed to non progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain. An advanced treatment option for individuals with severe CP is Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) treatment. This treatment can be considered when other options, such as oral medication, are insufficient or cause side effects. Previous studies have shown mostly low level evidence for the effect of ITB on spasticity in children with spastic CP. For children with dyskinetic CP, The Amsterdam UMC and Maastricht UMC previously conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial, which provides evidence for the effect of ITB on attaining personal treatment goals after three months of ITB treatment. It was furthermore found that after one year of ITB treatment, personal treatment goals were at least partially achieved in 97% of children and adolescents. Not all children showed similar response to ITB: some benefit more than others in attaining treatment goals. The investigators previous research on the effect of ITB in children with dyskinetic CP, found that a higher level of dystonia prior to ITB and reduction of pain during ITB were associated, for a small part, with attainment of treatment goals. Sample size was not sufficient to look at specific factors associated with specific types of treatment goals. For example, goals on the level of personal caring could be influenced by other factors than goals related to sitting or transfers. Long-term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with spastic and dyskinetic CP have not yet been described in literature. Furthermore, knowing which factors influence outcome on the long term, preferably related to specific types of treatment goals, can be used to inform and select children and adolescents with CP better before initiating ITB. In order to accomplish these goals real life data over a long period of time, and from a large cohort are needed. The Netherlands CP register is an innovative register for data collection which was developed between 2016 and 2020 in a unique collaboration between children with CP, their parents, researchers and health care professionals. The overall aim of the register is to provide personalized, value-based care for children with CP. In the Netherlands CP register, a follow-up registration program is combined with treatment registration. Prospective data collection in the treatment registration will allow us to implement standardized assessment protocols in the two academic medical centres in the Netherlands where baclofen pump implantations are performed, the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC) in Amsterdam and Maastricht UMC (MUMC)in Maastricht.

Objectives: The primary research question of this study is: 1. What is the short- (3 months), medium- (1 year) and long-term (2 years) effect of ITB in children with CP on personal treatment goals? Secondary objectives are: What is the association between the effect on personal treatment goals and on spasticity and/or dystonia? Which factors are associated with treatment success of ITB in children with CP?

Study design: A prospective observational study will be conducted in Amsterdam UMC and the MUMC using the Netherlands CP register to collect data over a period of 4,5 years. It is anticipated that in these centres 15 to 20 pumps will be implanted in children and adolescents annually. Over the total study period of 4,5 years, we aim to include a total of 67 to 90 children. The Medical Ethics Review Committee (MEC) of the Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical Center (IRB00002991) has stated that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) does not apply to the study and that further official approval by the MEC is waived.

Participants: Inclusion criteria: All children with CP Who start ITB treatment in the Netherlands under the age of 16. Exclusion criteria: no consent is given by the patient and/or caregiver for participation.

Subject follow-up schedule: In the investigators previous randomised controlled trial (the IDYS trial) on the effect of ITB in dyskinetic CP, we found that after three months of ITB most goals were, at least partially, attained. A study by Albright et al, additionally implies that dosage increases mostly in the first months, then shows some increase between 12 to 24 months and is fairly stable thereafter. Considering this"

Our study builds on research demonstrating that participation in traditional exercise does not necessarily translate to better health outcomes for older adults. Additionally, the costs associated with traditional exercise, such as gym memberships or fitness classes, place a strain on the limited resources of older adults. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and safety of a low-cost, structured Nordic Walking (NW) intervention for community-dwelling older adults who are at risk of falling or experience fear of falling.
We will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial examining the effects of NW on reducing the risk of falls and fear of falling, while also improving balance, mobility, and quality of life for older adults. We hypothesize that NW will result in significant, positive effects in all examined areas. The study aims to determine the effect sizes of the interventions, explore the experiences of the participants regarding the intervention, and inform future sample size calculations. This initial phase of the research will lay the foundation for a full-scale randomized control trial."

This project is a non-randomized, single-arm pilot feasibility trial, to help develop internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral and psychoeducational interventions (IP) that can be used to address help-seeking barriers and mental health symptoms among sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth. The intervention aims to improve the mental health of SGM youth in the short term by increasing their help-seeking intentions and reducing stigma, depression, and anxiety symptoms. The interventions will be offered through an online social media platform, Discord, and will consist of videos and written text content. Study subjects will be youth aged 13-20 with at least half self-identifying as cis girls, lesbian, homosexual, or transgender.
In-person and telephone counseling will be offered immediately upon enrollment, in addition to the self-directed internet-based interventions.
Updates to the Discord and Intervention pages in this trial has been temporarily stopped while we work on the re-design of the IP content. This delay will also likely affect the enrollment phase of this trial, which we expected to be wrapping up around early May, as the study pages will not be available to the public during this downtime.
The next intervention will be released in the spring of 2019. At this time we will also open up the next enrollment period. We would appreciate any participant willing to come on board as an early reviewer to continue the trial.
Study subjects will continue to have access to this intervention, including monthly meetings with the study team for additional support and assistance, as needed.
We anticipate that the 2019 intervention will be substantially shorter than the interventions we have already released in 2018.
Intersections 2019 will likely open up for full team members around late April or early May. We may need to adjust this as we will be transitioning from the current study pages to a new platform for the IP content.
It may be a good time to add you as an additional collaborator, since you are going to be heavily involved in the next intervention, and will need to be able to access the online portal as a team member.
We anticipate ending enrollment for this study on July 15th."

Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is often accompanied by different degrees of discomfort and tension in patients. In recent years, researchers have studied analgesia and anesthesia techniques for colonoscopy. Patent controlled analgesia/sedation (PCAS) is one of the modern anesthesia techniques, which can achieve on-demand analgesia during endoscopy. However, propofol alone can lead to hemodynamic fluctuations and an increase in anesthesia-related complications, such as longer hospital stays after surgery. In recent years, studies show that the use of mixed solution of propofol and remifentanil in endoscopic sedation and anesthesia have obvious advantages. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the sedation and analgesia efficacy and recovery of the two groups using mixed solution of propofol and remifentanil and routine intravenous combined anesthesia in fiber colonoscopy, hoping to provide clinical evidence for the sedation and analgesia technique of fiber colonoscopy."

Background: Radiation-induced injury to the gastrointestinal tract occurs in nearly 80% patients undergoing NCRT for rectal cancer. Although most patients recover within 2 months after NCRT, some may develop chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury. There is no effective method for predicting which patients are prone to chronic bowel injury after NCRT. This study is aimed at investigating whether the predictive model of chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury can be constructed using the biomarkers of acute colitis.
Objective: The objective of this study is to construct and validate the predictive model of chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury and determine the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of this prediction model.
The prospective, observational and confirmatory clinical study will be conducted by the Department of Radiation Oncology, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University located in Guangzhou, China. The expression levels of immune factors including IL-7, IL-12, IFNgamma, and TNF in 200 pathological tissues after TME, as well as clinical information of these patients will be collected. The follow-up results of these 200 patients will be used for model training and validation.
Methods: Two hundred patients who are diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer and meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited for the study. During NCRT, patients will be routinely monitored for radiation-induced injury. Patients who develop grade 2 or above radiation-induced acute intestinal injury during or within 1 month after NCRT will be enrolled in the study. After the completion of NCRT, multidensity TME will be performed for all patients. The expression levels of IL-7, IL-12, IFNgamma, and TNF will be detected in the paraffin sections of these patients. We will evaluate the association between these levels and the chronicization of RAII. The prediction model will be constructed using these levels and the collected clinical information.
The study arm includes radiation therapy and surgery. The patients will receive a total dose of 40-50 Gy in 5-7 fractions of radiotherapy along with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). We will compare the differences in immune factor levels between patients without chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury and patients with this injury, as well as the differences between the levels before and after radiotherapy. The correlation between the immune factor levels and the clinical evaluation of the treatment is also observed.
The prediction model will be evaluated by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for the chronicization of RAII.
The area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.75 is considered significant in predicting the chronicization. We will analyze the accuracy, precision, and specificity of this model.
Clinical Significance: This study provides a precise prediction of chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury and helps patients choose an appropriate therapy while reducing adverse reactions, providing evidence for clinical efficacy evaluation, and guiding the development of new effective therapies."

The ENDOMATIC SEPIOLA Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Closure Device is intended for closure of LAA in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). This safety and performance study will enroll 10 patients. The LAA is opened first, then the SEPIOLA device is mounted at the mouth of LAA with a suture. LAA is closed with the SEPIOLA device, by pulling it up through the suture. The SEPIOLA device will completely exclude the LAA. The closure of the LAA is expected to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation, thus reducing the need for anticoagulation to prevent blood clots in the heart."

The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether motivational interviewing can positively influence treatment adherence and therapeutic alliance in the acute inpatient setting and the secondary aim is to investigate whether motivational interviewing can improve symptom severity in the acute inpatient setting. Our pilot study is of randomised controlled, non-blinded design, with a control condition of supportive conversations and a sample size of 60 patients with acute psychosis. Patients will be screened for eligibility on their first ward day and are required to provide written informed consent. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to the experimental group, which undergoes 4 sessions of motivational interviewing, or to the control group, which undergoes 4 sessions of supportive conversations. We will assess symptoms, therapeutic alliance and treatment adherence at baseline, at the end of the intervention and 1 week after intervention. Additionally, at the end of intervention and 1 week after intervention data on motivational level for psychotherapy and self-efficacy are collected. Our results can help us to better understand how MI-based interventions can be adapted to patients with acute psychosis and inform future clinical guidelines regarding the use of MI in this specific patient population.

| Experimental: Motivational Interviewing Group<br>Patients will receive four sessions of Motivational Interviewing within two weeks. | Behavioral: Motivational Interviewing<br>* In our study intervention, patients should receive four session of motivational interviewing (MI). Throughout the MI sessions, interviewers use common MI techniques including open-ended questions, affirmations, reflections, summaries, asking permission, expressing empathy, supporting self-efficacy, etc. Interviewers are clinical psychologists who received MI training immediately prior to the study.<br>|
| Active Comparator: Control Group<br>Patients in the control group receive four sessions of supportive conversations within two weeks. | Behavioral: Supportive conversations<br>* In the control intervention patients should also be given four sessions, in which no MI techniques take place. They will be carried out in the sense of supportive conversations (i.e. conver-sations that do not follow a specific psychotherapy concept). Since we want to check whether the patients really benefit from the specific intervention and not from getting more speaking time, the patient in the control group will also be given four conver-sations. It is known that supportive conversations can have a certain effect on the well-being and recovery process of patients, as the therapeutic relationship, i.e. appreciation, attention and/or attention, is an important efficacy factor (e. g. Grawe, 1995).<br>|

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of lumbar plexus block in postoperative pain relief and early mobilization of the lower extremity, which was applied to lower extremity orthopedic surgeries via Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) device, which is used to monitor tissue oxygenation.

In the study, patients who will undergo lumbar plexus block (bupivacaine 0.25-0.5%, 16-50 ml) that will provide postoperative analgesia in lower extremity orthopedic surgeries will be evaluated with rso2 and sensory block level NIRS measures applied to the operator and other lower extremities. Sensation loss will be tested by cold testing to assess the success of the block. In addition, the blood pressure values and finger saturation values of the patients will also be evaluated. The primary success criterion evaluated in terms of NIRS data will be rso2 saturation values below 65% in the operator extremity. The secondary success criterion for the same extremity will be 50% compared to the other extremity. In lower extremity orthopedic surgeries, nerve blocks applied under ultrasonographic guidance or lumbar plexus block application with a lower dose of local anesthetic will be associated with a decrease in surgical trauma and a decrease in the systemic side effects of regional anesthesia. In conclusion, NIRS is a non-invasive and simple method that can be used to monitor the success of lumbar plexus blocks applied to lower extremity orthopedic surgeries.

The prevalence of severe mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, is rising in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and this burden disproportionately impacts lower income individuals who primarily access health care services through publicly run facilities. In India, over 3.5 million people live with schizophrenia, and as the population ages and disease burden shifts to chronic conditions. Individuals living with schizophrenia are increasingly impacted by comorbid medical conditions that require attention in the form of medical care. Importantly, psychosocial interventions, focused on rehabilitation and skill-building, engaging in social activities, managing mental health symptoms, and promoting recovery and community reintegration, hold potential to reduce disability and improve mental health and functioning for individuals living with schizophrenia. Furthermore, building on recent compelling evidence from higher-income countries, community-based programs could be augmented with additional content aimed at addressing risk factors for early mortality, such as lifestyle behaviors, tobacco use, and management of co-occurring chronic medical conditions. Therefore, this study seeks to evaluate the use of a digital platform for supporting the clinical effectiveness of a psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for patients with schizophrenia in primary care settings in India. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) determine the overall effectiveness of the COPSI intervention + mindLAMP on disability, symptoms, and quality of life; and 2) determine whether implementation support with a novel mobile application enhances uptake and utilization of COPSI + mindLAMP. The study will enroll 150 participants with schizophrenia in two separate but similar sites in India. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms: 1) COPSI + mindLAMP or 2) COPSI alone. Participants in both study arms will be enrolled in the standard COPSI intervention, which will be delivered to them by trained Community Health Officers over a 12-month period. Participants in the experimental group will have access to an interactive and customizable mobile application (smartphone app), which can be accessed on-demand at any time. Participants in both study arms will be followed for 12 months to evaluate the long-term impact of COPSI and mindLAMP on disability, symptoms, and quality of life of individuals living with schizophrenia. This study will contribute to the knowledge of effective psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia and the role of digital implementation support in achieving sustained and quality service delivery for persons with schizophrenia.

Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder of the masticatory muscles and preauricular region and the temporomandibular joints. Several studies suggest the participation of cytokines as factors involved in the development of TMD. This study may be of particular importance, especially in the light of the limited success of various therapeutic approaches to TMD. The primary aim is to characterize the levels of cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-13, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, TNF-alpha) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and peripheral blood (PB) in patients with myalgia, arthralgia, headache attributed to TMP and painful disc displacement (with and without reduction) after stabilization occlusal splint therapy. The second aim is to evaluate the effect of therapy on the levels of inflammatory cytokines in GCF and PB in the same patient population. It has not been tested whether the cytokine levels in GCF or peripheral blood in TMD patients treated with occlusal splint therapy will change in response to therapy compared to the non-specific increase in stress and anxiety. Another interesting question is whether there is a correlation between the levels of cytokines in GCF and PB in TMD patients."

The purpose of the TREAD Study is to assess whether training to counteract perturbations to the trunk during walking can reduce the frequency of falls for people recently undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The intervention is a brief (about 45 minutes) perturbation training program that is targeted at counteracting the perturbation response. The perturbation training program is expected to increase the stability of the trunk and improve the ability to respond to a loss of balance. The ability to counteract a perturbation to the trunk is important in maintaining balance and preventing falls during walking. Falls are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly for people with conditions such as knee osteoarthritis.
The investigators propose that a targeted training program can improve fall outcome after TKA. As such, this study will assess whether the perturbation training program can improve fall outcome after TKA."

Hip fracture is a major burden on individuals, the health service, and economy each year. Surgical treatment reduces death and other poor outcomes, but is not benign as many patients die within a month. Low blood pressure (hypotension) is surprisingly common after hip fracture surgery (> 30%) and is independently associated with a higher risk of death (3% relative rise per 5 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure). UK guidelines recommend that low doses (< 2mls 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine) are given for spinal anaesthesia to prevent hypotension, but this recommendation is based on data from trials > 40 years old involving younger, fitter patients. There is no observational data describing the blood pressure changes after low dose spinal anaesthesia in older, unfit patients. The investigator provides a retrospective, observational study with outcomes defined by deaths within 30 days of surgery. The investigator aims to analyse the blood pressure changes in the older, unfit patients during and after low dose spinal anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery, using anaesthetic data gathered as part of normal clinical practice. The investigator will describe the haemodynamic changes in the cohort using the latest (2017) European guidelines for measuring and describing blood pressure using the standard ASA definition of hypotension. The investigator will also assess the potential value of a new, more sensitive measure of hypotension (hypotension depth x duration product). Finally, the investigator will use statistical tools to assess whether the frequency of hypotension, and/or the depth/duration product are associated with poor outcomes such as death at 30 days and increased length of hospital stay. By describing the haemodynamic events at a population level, the investigator aims to determine whether lower doses administered using a fascia iliaca block + sedation can prevent hypotension and improve outcome after hip fracture surgery in the older, unfit patients most likely to benefit from surgery."

The prevalence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary in regions where other infectious diseases are endemic, and malaria-endemic countries are an example of this phenomenon. In Malawi, the burden of COVID-19 remains higher than in Western countries, in part due to the high incidence of HIV and malaria infections, and the low numbers of immunized individuals. This study will explore several hypotheses centered on innate immunity as a factor responsible for the difference in host/pathogen interactions that influence the clinical course and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Malawian compared to Western populations. The investigators will examine the relative contribution of innate and adaptive immunity pathways to natural and evoked immunity in individuals in Malawi and compare these with the response in the matched cohort from Sweden.
The study will include 3 cohorts: natural infection, vaccine, and population-based cohorts. Each cohort will be followed-up for 15 months, allowing assessment of the immune memory and protection following infection or vaccination.
The specific aims of this study are to:
1. Determine if the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are impaired in Malawians compared to matched controls from Sweden.
2. Identify the innate immune cell subsets, soluble factors, regulatory pathways, and cytokines that differentiate Malawian's innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 from that of Swedes.
3. Identify the innate immune parameters that differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.
4. Determine the relative importance of innate and adaptive immunity to the generation of neutralizing antibodies and their ability to mediate SARS-CoV-2 clearance in Malawians compared to Swedes.
5. Determine the relative importance of innate and adaptive immunity in mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.
6. Identify the innate immune parameters that differentiate vaccinees across different age groups in Malawi and Sweden.
Answers derived from this study will help to understand how host-pathogen interaction and malaria and intestinal parasitic co-infection influence COVID-19 transmission, morbidity, and vaccine response in this region."

Introduction
Sleep apnea and polycythemia, the latter also known as primary arterial hypertension, are very common diseases. It is estimated that 6-7% of the adult population have sleep apnea, and its prevalence increases up to 30% after the age of 50 [1]. In the United States, an estimated 7.5 million women and 15.8 million men suffer from OSA [2].
Polycythemia is characterized by an increase in the proportion of red blood cells, leading to an increase in the proportion of oxygen-transporting hemoglobin [3] which, by altering the blood viscosity, can have deleterious cardiovascular effects [4]. In addition to altering blood viscosity, the increased number and size of red blood cells can promote the development of atherosclerosis [5]. The association of polycythemia with Obstructive sleep apnea has not been extensively studied, although there are case reports and a retrospective report on the prevalence of polycythemia in patients with OSA but not on the possible relationship of treatment with CPAP and the reduction of the polycythemic process in this population.
In 2016, it was estimated that 7-8% of the adult population have polycythemia, with this prevalence increasing with age in men and in pre-menopausal women [6,7]. The prevalence of polycythemia is high in primary care [8]. The relationship of sleep apnea and its treatment (continuous positive airway pressure-CPAP) with polycythemia have been rarely addressed. The aim of this study is to quantify the effect of CPAP treatment on the reduction of hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients with OSA and associated polycythemia.
Methods

The investigators are interested in understanding the influence of egg consumption on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and immune responses to a viral challenge, in healthy middle-aged and older adults.
The investigators hypothesize that consumption of eggs would increase HDL levels and improve HDL composition. The investigators predict that the HDL and cholesterol profiles will be influenced by the age group of participants, with the younger group showing greater increases in HDL responses due to their age-related increase in HDL concentration and composition."

Amputations lead to the loss of muscle activity from a portion of the limb that is lost during amputation surgery. The residual muscles are then repurposed from producing movement to helping to control a prosthesis. The current main method of prosthesis control is through the decoding of electrical signals (myo-electric signals) from the residual limb. These control signals are decoded from the electro-myogram (EMG) activity, and can be used to control various types of prosthesis components. However, traditional myo-electric prosthesis designs require frequent training with both a physical prosthesis and virtual training environments to be effective, both of which make frequent visits to a medical facility and/or therapist necessary for effective prosthetic use.
In our previous research, we demonstrated the feasibility of using virtual reality (VR) for task-specific training in amputees who received a myo-electric prosthesis. The VR training system used a VR headset to provide visual feedback of prosthesis function, and was found to reduce the time for learning to use a new myoelectric prosthesis when compared to the traditional training and a control group.
Our previous research also demonstrated that myoelectric prosthesis users had difficulty controlling multiple movements (2 DoF or more) with the myoelectric controller, which is necessary in order to effectively control more complex prosthetics (for example, a 7 DoF hand prosthesis). As a result, many users of myoelectric control systems have difficulty picking up and transporting objects effectively. As a result, there is a significant need in clinical practice to develop novel training interventions and interfaces that are specific to controlling more complex prostheses.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a new virtual prosthesis functional training system (referred to as MyoTrain AR) for the purpose of training novice prosthesis users to control multiple movements during daily tasks (that is, performing multi-joint movements simultaneously over multiple planes including during transport, manipulation, and release of objects). The training system consists of an augmented reality (AR) headset, a desktop computer, and four SteamVR kinematic trackers. The AR headset provides real-time visual feedback of the prosthesis user's performance and allows for the use of more complex training activities and objects.
Up to 10 participants with a unilateral upper limb trans-radial amputation will be selected to receive the MyoTrain AR training system. They will undergo 5 full training sessions with the MyoTrain AR system over 3 weeks in a laboratory setting. During the 5 sessions, the participants will use the MyoTrain AR system to perform the GaMA Cup Transfer task that involves reaching for, grasping, and transporting cups of various volumes that are placed at different locations and heights.
Potential participants may be referred to the study by their rehabilitation physician, therapist, or prosthetist. Eligibility assessment and consent discussions will typically occur remotely. Potential participants will then participate in a one-session pre-screen, where they will undergo an assessment of their muscle function as compared to the muscle function of people with similar limb loss patterns. Those participants who are shown to have sufficient muscle activity from their residual limb to control a pattern recognition-based myoelectric system will then be randomized to either the Experimental (MyoTrain AR) group or to the Control group."

Postoperative ileus is a common and serious complication following major surgery, caused by a temporary paralysis of the intestines. Current treatment options, such as nasogastric decompression and antibiotics are poorly effective. In the past, it has been suggested that temporary, non-invasive pacing of the stomach may accelerate recovery from postoperative ileus, based on data from an animal study. The aim of this international prospective double blinded randomised controlled trial is to evaluate if such gastric pacing, with new developed pacemaker technology, really reduces the time before the first bowel movement after major surgery. We expect the gastric lead to be well tolerated and safe and no serious adverse events is expected as a result of the study."

Background: The purpose of this study is to enroll at least 72 subjects diagnosed with BPPV or migrainous vertigo, who have moderate-to-severe vertigo symptoms measured by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and to test the effectiveness of the OtoBand as therapy for vertigo. The OtoBand is a medical device that uses mechanical stimulation provided through oscillations to the neck to temporarily alleviate symptoms of vertigo.
Inclusion criteria: Diagnosed as having vestibular vertigo that is caused by one or more of: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) Migraine associated vertigo (MAV, aka vertiginous migraines) Meniere's disease (aka idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops) Uncompensated unilateral vestibulopathy (such as arising from vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis) Vertigo that has been present for at least 90 days Score greater than 35, and less than 91, on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (corresponding to moderate to severe vertigo) Smartphone, computer or tablet and access to internet for online enrollment, check-in and wrap-up meetings Willingness to install and use the JotForm ePRO app Residing in the United States Willingness to be paid via Venmo or PayPal. Exclusion criteria: Surgery to the base of the skull within the last 6 months or plans for surgery to the skull during enrollment period Any skull or neck implants such as but not limited to a cochlear implant, vascular stents, bone conduction implant, or deep brain stimulation device History of vitreous detachment (aka floaters) in the last 90 days Superior canal dehiscence (aka third window) or otic capsule dehiscence Hyperacusis (aka hypersensitivity to loud sounds) Currently undergoing vestibular rehabilitation therapy or planning to start vestibular rehabilitation therapy during the study. (People who have completed vestibular rehabilitation therapy, but in whom vertigo persists, will be permitted to enroll)

Study Objective: This pilot study, with a planned enrollment of 24 participants, aims to study the effectiveness of the OtoBand in reducing vertigo symptoms in subjects diagnosed with vestibular vertigo who have moderate to severe vertigo and no other apparent explanation for their vertigo.
Study Design: Decentralized Clinical Trial (DCT) using online meeting software. The intervention will be the OtoBand device and the study will be conducted completely remotely with online video check-ins, e-PRO surveys, and remote monitoring.
Intervention: The investigators intend to enroll up to 120 participants in total. Participants will be randomized into two study arms. One arm will enroll subjects that are determined to have moderate to severe vertigo that requires at least weekly use of the OtoBand to temporarily relieve symptoms of vertigo. The other arm will enroll subjects whose vertigo is less severe and who may use the OtoBand on an as-needed basis (less than weekly).
Study Arms: OtoBand Arm: The investigators intend to enroll up to 80 participants in this arm, and at least 56 enrolled participants will complete the study. In this study arm, the OtoBand will be used as instructed by the clinical coordinator. Participants will be given written instructions and provided a device for the remote monitoring of their OtoBand usage during the treatment phase. Participants will be randomly assigned to use the OtoBand on one of four power settings. The OtoBand will transmit data via Wi-Fi on the frequency of its use, the intensity of its use (power settings), the duration of each therapy session, and the adherence of each subject to OtoBand use. The investigators will record this information via remote monitoring. If a participant's vertigo severity is mild, with a score of less than 35 on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, they will be re-evaluated by the clinical coordinator at any point in the course of the study to re-designate them to the quality of life arm. Quality of Life Arm: The investigators intend to enroll up to 30 subjects in this arm. In this study arm, the subject's symptoms will be monitored during vertigo episodes using the DHI questionnaire to determine the severity of their vertigo symptoms. The clinical coordinator will then select 16 of the subjects to begin treatment in the moderate treatment arm, and 14 will"

Background: Acute upper respiratory tract infections (acute URTI) are a major problem in the elderly. It is a condition that is usually related to colds and flu. This condition is the most recurring in this population. There is a relationship between the increase in the incidence of antibiotics and the lack of immune response due to ageing. It has been recorded that the elderly population is the greatest consumer of antibiotics. Antibiotics have no antiviral efficacy, do not prevent respiratory diseases caused by viruses such as cold and flu, and therefore, in the prevention of respiratory infections for which antibiotics are prescribed, probiotics have proven efficacy in the long term. So far, there have been no studies on the effect of probiotics in the prevention of URTIs in the elderly. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the multistrain probiotic OMNi-BiOTiC® Active in the prevention of URTIs in the elderly. Methods: This is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month study. Two independent groups (2:1 allocation) will be examined, the experimental group receiving probiotics and the control group receiving placebo. The sample will consist of 450 participants aged 65 years and older and in good health. They will be enrolled on the basis of self-reported upper respiratory tract infections. Each subject will be provided with a dose of 1 pack of probiotics per day for 6 months. Dosage of probiotics is 10(6) cfu of microorganism per capsule. Questionnaires for the study will be completed monthly and in the event of an acute URTI. Acute infectious URTIs will be diagnosed based on the participant's history of the onset of symptoms, the presence of at least one respiratory symptom (nasal secretion, pharyngeal pain, cough, dyspnoea, headache, myalgia or fever) and the absence of any pre-existent chronic disease. Diagnosis of URTI will be based on the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The effectiveness of probiotics will be expressed as the incidence and the duration of URTIs for each participant in both groups. In addition, the concentration and changes in concentration of leukocytes (leukocytosis), neutrophils (neutrophilitis), eosinophils (eosinophilia), lymphocytes, monocytes will be compared for each participant between baseline and the end of the study (12 weeks). The same evaluation will be completed for immunoglobulin A (IgA). The difference between the groups on the basis of these parameters will be assessed."

Adhesive Capsulitis is a commonly observed musculoskeletal disorder that leads to shoulder pain and dysfunction. Although the pathophysiology of Adhesive Capsulitis remains poorly understood. The current intervention for Adhesive Capsulitis includes physical therapy sessions which may include the use of different joint manual therapy techniques to decrease pain and improve shoulder range of motion and functional mobility. Among these techniques are Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization. Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization techniques have both shown promising results in improving pain and shoulder range of motion. However, there are limited studies that provide evidence on their relative effectiveness in improving outcomes for Adhesive Capsulitis patients. The authors therefore seek to conduct a single blind clinical trial to compare Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization techniques on functional mobility, pain and shoulder range of motion in patients with adhesive capsulitis. A total of 20 patients with second and third stage of adhesive capsulitis will be included (10 in each group). Participants will be randomized into 2 groups: patients in group A will receive Gong's mobilization and patients in group B will receive Kaltenborn's mobilization. Both groups will receive routine physical therapy sessions in addition to the specific manual therapy techniques of interest (2 sessions a week for 4 weeks, in total 8 sessions). Routine physical therapy sessions include electrical stimulation and heat therapy. The primary purpose of the study is treatment, and the allocation is randomized and the study is conducted as a single-blind randomized clinical trial."

Urothelial carcinoma (UC) accounts for over 90% of bladder cancer and approximately 10% of kidney cancers. Most UC patients are diagnosed with localized disease, for which surgery can be curative. Patients with muscle-invasive disease or those who develop metastatic disease may receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. In this phase III trial, researchers compare treatment with disitamab vedotin plus the immunotherapy pembrolizumab—targeted therapies known to block cancer cell growth and stimulate the immune system—against the standard chemotherapy option of gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin. The study will evaluate the safety of this treatment and its effects on disease progression and patient survival. Disitamab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody treatment that works by blocking cancer cell growth and stopping cancer cells from dividing. Pembrolizumab is a type of immunotherapy that works by enhancing the immune system's ability to identify and destroy cancer cells. Gemcitabine and cisplatin or carboplatin are chemotherapy agents that work by stopping cancer cell division. Eligible participants may be enrolled in a post-treatment analysis for the evaluation of long-term survival benefits."

In this study, the investigators aim to develop a novel biomarker for detecting residual cancer and recurrence/metastasis for HCC patients after RT. They hypothesize that Human-HBV junctional Chimera DNA (vh-DNA) with high prevalence and specificity in HCC can be used as a highly sensitive and specific biomarker before or after RT. The investigators plan to retrospectively analyze the changes in vh-DNA copy numbers/detection rates between pre- and post-RT serums and prospectively analyze the serial changes of vh-DNA copies within different treatment outcomes. They will correlate the copy number changes of HBV vh-DNA with RT response and prognosis on the pathogenesis and clinical significance of vh-DNA, and support using personalized vh-DNA to evaluate response, to predict prognosis. They plan to identify the HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR. Moreover, The investigators will further correlate the clinical response and recurrence/metastasis to serial changes of vh-DNA copy numbers. The investigators hope that vh-DNA will offer a novel method to achieve earlier evaluating response and earlier post-radiotherapy disease monitoring."

Emergent evidence shows that undernutrition is common in patients with amputations, and this can cause complications after surgery. However, undernutrition is often not recognized or acknowledged. The investigators hypothesize that patients who undergo a major LLA have low physical activity levels, low nutritional intakes, and low nutritional status. Aim of this investigational study is to determine the impact of LLA on the dietary intake, physical activity level and nutritional status of patients. Specific secondary outcomes include mortality, wound healing, quality of life, physical functioning, functional level, mobility, exercise capacity, self-efficacy, and healthcare costs.

Methods: 
Patients who undergo a major LLA are asked to participate within 10 days after amputation surgery. Data will be collected before the operation and at 2, 5, and 9 months follow-up. Participants will provide demographic data, provide a dietary recall and accelerometry data, perform a 6-minute walk test, and complete self-report questionnaires on quality of life, physical functioning, physical activity level (in and outside the household) and nutritional status.

Study Population: Eligible patients are 18 years of age or older, undergoing or recently having undergone a major dysvascular (Syme amputation or more proximal) LLA at the Department of Vascular Surgery of Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) or Wilhelmina hospital (Assen, The Netherlands).

Impact: The results can be used for tailored dietary and physical activity advice, the implementation of a post-amputation care regime, and the development of a nutritional assessment tool."

Diabetes mellitus type 2 and proteinuria increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Proteinuria and a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are associated with an elevated risk of CVD. Empagliflozin and finerenone are both effective pharmacological therapies for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 with proteinuria. While data from pivotal clinical trials indicate a more potent and sustained renoprotective effect of finerenone compared to empagliflozin, this therapeutic advantage has been observed beyond 44 weeks of treatment only for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease with a specific phenotype. Since the risk of a non-favoured outcome increases with disease duration and the development of comorbidities, it is reasonable to evaluate the clinical course of patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, proteinuria, comorbidities and an established eGFR of ≥30 ml/min/1.73m2 (CKD stage 3 or 4) after the initiation of empagliflozin, with the possibility to switch to finerenone in case of an insufficient response to reduce the risk of unfavourable outcomes. This protocol aims to provide relevant insights into a personalized use of SGLT2 inhibitors and MRA following an initial open-label monotherapy with empagliflozin as a first-line treatment.
We will conduct a multi-centre, randomized, prospective open-label crossover trial. Patients with type 2 diabetes, albuminuria and an eGFR between 30-60 ml/min/1.73m2 will be recruited in a dedicated research visit at the clinic. Patients will be treated with empagliflozin 10 mg once daily (OAD) for 24 weeks, followed by randomization into two study arms. In group 1, patients will receive either 20 mg finerenone OAD or continue empagliflozine 10 mg OAD for another 24 weeks after which patients will be switched in group 2 and receive 10 mg finerenone OAD or continue empagliflozine 10 mg OAD for another 24 weeks after which patients will be switched again and receive the other drug for the final 24 weeks. The investigators will continue data collection and adherence monitoring until study completion. The primary goal is to investigate whether SGLT2 inhibitors and MRA can be safely and effectively used in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, proteinuria, comorbidities and a specific phenotype (CKD stage 3 or 4), and to investigate if individual responses regarding albuminuria and eGFR can help tailor the choice of medications."

Through experimental design and quantitative research methods. This experiment will test the effectiveness of the training method by intervening in the selective fitness, skills, and tactical performance of college students using a high-intensity interval training method on the ice. The experiment will use 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training to improve the fitness, skills, and tactical performance of the intervention for ice hockey players. The experiment will use 20 students in the experimental group and 20 students in the control group, to compare the differences between the two groups. The experiment was divided into a discussion group and a general teaching group. The purpose of this experiment is to provide a theoretical basis for the improvement of ice hockey training methods so that college ice hockey players can obtain better competitive performance, especially in physical fitness and technique. The experimental group (1-12 weeks) performed repeated sprint training, sprint interval training (on-ice 45-s shift length conditioning drill), a long-pass tracking drill, and a chase-the-rabbit tracking drill. There are three phases: 1-4 weeks, 5-8 weeks, and 9-12 weeks gradually increasing the intensity of training. Similarly, the control group performed varied-pace skating (1 minute accelerated skating, 2 minutes even pace), dribbling and shooting drill (30 m), passing-catching drill (20 m), and 2 on 1 offensive drill (full rink). As in the experimental group, the same three phases were used to gradually increase the intensity.
Based on the experimental design, the purpose of this study was firstly to assess which training method is more efficient in improving the physical fitness, skills and tactical performance of college male ice hockey players in the high-intensity interval training group than traditional training for college ice hockey players, and to compare the physical fitness, techniques and tactics of elite ice hockey players and high-intensity interval training group."

Pain after accidental injury can be severe and long-lasting. Patients experience chronic pain in up to one third of post-operative injuries requiring hospitalization. For patients with acute injuries, discharge often results in lack of ongoing pain treatment, leading to inadequate pain control and unnecessary overuse of opioids. One explanation for this is that patients fail to access their GP after discharge from the hospital. A growing body of research suggests that collaboration between GP and hospital specialists may significantly impact prescribing of strong painkillers. At present, this collaboration is not common in Norway, where the healthcare system is based on a mix between the public health service and private primary health care. If more patients were to access their GP, and the GP subsequently contacted the hospital specialists, this could potentially reduce unnecessary and inadequate opioid prescribing. The objective of this study is to evaluate if a Pain and Coordination Plan (PAC-plan) for patients after accidental injury can reduce opioid use in the first 6 weeks after discharge. The study also aims to compare the effectiveness of a PAC-plan and conventional care in relation to pain severity, pain interference, insomnia, health-related quality of life, overall satisfaction and adverse outcomes.
66 accidental injuries will be included in the study. Patients will be treated according to a clinical pathway in a comprehensive orthopaedic trauma center, Oslo University Hospital. The patients will be assigned randomly to the PAC-plan or conventional care. Outcomes will be assessed immediately after discharge, at 6 and 52 weeks after the injury."

Background: It is well established that antiplatelet agents decrease the incidence of major ischemic events following stent implantation of intracranial arteries. However, excessive platelet inhibition may cause serious bleeding events. Recently, the optimal antiplatelet regime and the best antiplatelet regimen for patients in different clinical conditions are still controversial. To reduce the risk of ischemic events without increasing bleeding events, antiplatelet dose-guided schemes have been introduced into clinical practice. In view of the lack of such research results in China, this study will be carried out.
Objective: To explore the role of dose-guided antiplatelet drugs in the occurrence of ischemic events after endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysm and the rate of major bleeding events.
Method: This study is a single-center retrospective controlled cohort study. Participants who underwent endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms requiring stent placement between January 2019 and August 2020 in the Department of Neurosurgery, Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University will be included. The clinical data of the participants was divided into 2 groups, namely the dose-guided antiplatelet group and the standard antiplatelet group. The participants in the dose-guided antiplatelet group will receive antiplatelet drug testing before stent placement according to the specific requirements of the test results. The dose of antiplatelet drug is adjusted according to the level of platelet function, and the specific drug and its dose are based on the specific requirements of the test results. The participants in the standard antiplatelet group will be treated with conventional antiplatelet drugs before the operation, and the drugs used for antiplatelet drug testing were not involved in the intervention. The ischemic and bleeding events within 4 months after stent placement will be recorded in each participant.
Hypothesis Test: The incidence of postoperative ischemic events and major bleeding events is different between the 2 groups.
Expected Results: It is expected to improve the rational use of antiplatelet drugs in the clinical treatment of intracranial aneurysms, to provide more evidence-based data for the establishment of the treatment guidelines of intracranial aneurysms."

Background: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is primarily a neuromotor disorder that affects the development of movement, muscle tone and posture. The underlying pathophysiology is an injury to the developing brain in the prenatal through neonatal period. Although the initial neuro pathologic lesion is non-progressive, children with cerebral palsy may develop a range of secondary conditions over time that will variably affect their functional abilities. The prevalence of CP varies between 1.5 to more than 4 cases per 1,000 live births worldwide. The motor impairments associated with CP can range from mild to severe, affecting different muscle groups and leading to difficulties in activities of daily living and participation in social and recreational activities. Children with CP often experience motor impairments that affect their gross motor function, leading to limitations in activities and participation. These motor impairments can also have a negative impact on bone health, resulting in reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of skeletal complications. Gross motor function (GMF) refers to the ability to perform coordinated movements using large muscle groups, such as walking, running, and jumping. It is a key aspect of physical ability and independence in daily activities for children with CP. Previous research has shown that gross motor function is closely associated with bone health in this population. However, further investigation is needed to explore the specific nature of this correlation and its implications for intervention strategies. Gross motor function is commonly assessed using standardized tools such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Quality of life is a multidimensional construct that encompasses physical, psychological, and social well-being. In the context of cerebral palsy, understanding the impact of gross motor function on quality of life is crucial for comprehensive care and intervention planning. Children with CP may face limitations in mobility, participation in activities, and social interactions, which can significantly affect their overall quality of life. Exploring the relationship between gross motor function and quality of life can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the holistic well-being of children with CP. The quality of life in children with CP is not only influenced by their motor function but also by their overall health and well-being. Bone health plays a crucial role in maintaining the physical abilities and independence of individuals, as well as their overall quality of life. Impaired bone health in children with CP can lead to limitations in mobility, increased pain, and reduced participation in activities, which can have a significant impact on their overall well-being. Bone mineral density, on the other hand, is an important measure of bone strength and overall skeletal health. Children with CP often exhibit lower BMD compared to typically developing peers due to factors such as reduced weight-bearing activities, muscle weakness, altered biomechanics, limited mobility, and hormonal imbalances. This reduced BMD increases their susceptibility to fractures and skeletal deformities, further impacting their functional abilities and quality of life.

This study proposes to develop and validate two new imaging biomarkers, which are measures that reflect the impact of sulpiride on striatal brain regions to assess dopamine function in health and in schizophrenia. These biomarkers will help to understand how changes in dopamine are related to the working of the brain, and to improve the treatment of schizophrenia-related symptoms such as cognitive deficits, negative symptoms and social cognition. This project will contribute to the identification of biomarkers that can help in the development of new antipsychotic medications and treatments in schizophrenia that can specifically target dopamine changes.
Over 50% of all psychiatric patients suffer from symptoms such as poor attention, impaired working memory, cognitive slowness and decreased motivation. Cognitive symptoms are resistant to currently available antipsychotics. The dopamine system plays a crucial role in cognitive functions like working memory and attentional control. Dopamine is a chemical transmitter that helps the brain to select and maintain working memory representations. Drugs that block dopamine at specific cortical and sub-cortical brain structures have been found to improve cognitive deficits when added to standard antipsychotics.
The main objective of this study is to develop and validate new brain imaging biomarkers that will give us a better understanding of the impact of the new drug compound sulpiride on dopamine transmission."

The aim of this study is to determine whether general anaesthesia affects epigenetic profiles in blood cells and we want to confirm if this results in early alterations in brain responses. As we're also interested in whether the type of anaesthesia (TIVA-based intravenous versus inhalational) affects these results, we would like to include a randomised controlled trial. We will investigate both immediate changes and any alterations over the first few weeks after the first anaesthetic.
Could you provide some further details about the study type and phase?"

Current laboratory guidelines recommend measuring serum TSH levels to monitor thyroid hormone status in hypothyroid patients using levothyroxine. This is a widely used indicator to determine the dosage and efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy. However, the interpretation of TSH results in a large group of patients using levothyroxine causes difficulty for their physicians. For hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, it is advised to have TSH values within the reference interval; for patients with hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy, a suppressed TSH is required. In patients with hypothyroidism due to Graves' disease, the TSH concentration must be slightly suppressed with a suppressed TSH (i.e. at low concentrations). Despite these different requirements for TSH, fT4 concentrations are often measured in a majority of the patients to ensure treatment efficacy. A higher fT4 level is also seen in the majority of the patients using levothyroxine. These high fT4 levels will only cause treatment problems in patients in which a TSH-guided treatment is impossible (e.g. in patients with hypothyroidism due to central disease). This study investigates whether the treatment efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy can be monitored by measuring other thyroid hormone markers and ratios of these markers. Thyroid hormone markers as total T4 (TT4), total T3 (TT3), rT3, SHBG, acylcarnitines and several amino acids will be assessed and compared to outcomes in healthy controls. This study also includes participants with hypothyroidism using L-T4 with 'normal' TSH to see whether other thyroid hormone markers can indicate thyroid status."

Hip fractures are a common injury in the elderly, especially in the institutionalized population. A large group of patients is not suitable for surgery and benefits more from palliative care. Nonoperative treatment can be the preferred solution for these patients, but little use is currently made of this.
The project aims to improve the treatment decision by shared decision making, which will lead to more nonoperative treatments. Through interviews and a large cohort study in the last 2 years 118 of 193 patients opted for nonoperative treatment. These patients have equal quality of life compared to patients who opted for an operative treatment. Quality of dying was rated as good by the next of kin.
The project team has an extensive network of orthopedic specialists and geriatricians in the Netherlands, which will support the implementation.
In phase 2, the PNOM protocol will be enriched, educational modules will be developed for residents of Orthopedics, information sessions will be organized at scientific conferences and the final PNOM protocol can be put in place. Subsequently, two selected hospitals will be installed as a pilot for an implementation PNOM.
In phase 3, all other hospitals that treat the selected patient group must participate. It is estimated that 1000 patients per year will be approached and that half of these patients will prefer non-operative treatment. This approach leads to a 15% decrease in the number of hip surgeries. This is likely to be a cost saving for the health care system.
In the third and fourth phase, the PNOM project team will support the implementation of the PNOM protocol. The support will range from training sessions, to support in the implementation process, to advice on management. It is expected that this support will lead to an increase in the use of nonoperative treatment for the selected group.
Finally, a process evaluation will be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the implementation process in which all steps from awareness raising and training to successful implementation was documented.
It is expected that this project will result in patients receiving a treatment that meets their needs at the end of their life.
This is a collaborative project of the Zuyderland Medical Center, University Medical Center Groningen and Maastricht UMC+

Treatment for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma is sub-optimal because of two main issues: (1) Creating an accurate target volume for radiotherapy, a key aspect of glioblastoma treatment, containing all remaining tumour cells after surgery that is impossible with the conventional CT and MRI imaging techniques currently used and (2) in the follow-up of patients after radiotherapy, conventional MRI is incapable of distinguishing tumour progression from treatment effects. The solution to these issues lies in accurate and non-invasive assessment of physiological processes of tumour cells to enable delineation of the true physiological clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy planning and to allow for early detection of true tumour progression during treatment follow-up. Therefore, the rationale behind this project is to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, a physiological CTV will be generated for each patient in addition to the standard CTV. Treatment for each patient will be according to the current standard in which the standard CTV is used. Initial analysis will include comparing both CTVs in terms of volume and location. Patients will follow the clinical standard, including the standard MRI scan protocols, for a maximum of 2 years. Pattern-of-failure analysis will be done to compare the standard CTV and physiological CTV. It is hypothesized that the physiological CTV will be smaller than the standard CTV, whilst having the same pattern-of-failure."

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, immunosuppressive drugs used for treating Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) patients could lead to an increased susceptibility to severe Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The use of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) for SSc patients could therefore lead to worsened COVID-19 infections due to severe immunity impairment. It is therefore crucial to assess the incidence and severity of COVID-19 after AHSCT as compared to non-AHSCT SSc patients. The SOLID study will explore the proportion of vaccine refusal in Systemic Sclerosis patients previously treated by AHSCT and in non-transplant controls. It will also assess the cumulative incidence of asymptomatic or symptomatic COVID-19 infection after AHSCT as compared to non AHSCT SSc patients. It will investigate the severity of the disease, measured by the care received by each patient. The study will also describe SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immunity and the rate and nature of adverse events observed in both populations."

Children and adolescents with overweight and obesity may have unhealthy diet quality. Improving diet quality is essential for treating obesity but time and knowledge can delay access to nutrition recommendations by pediatric providers. Text-based interventions might be able to improve fruit and vegetable intake of adolescents, however, it is unknown if digital interventions are effective for improving diet quality in adolescents with overweight or obesity.

Aims: To show that a digital-based diet quality intervention for adolescents with overweight or obesity is feasible by demonstrating that participants complete study procedures and retention rates are acceptable. Participants will also complete two 24-hr dietary recalls, one for their first morning void, and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). 

Study design: Two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). One hundred and forty adolescents between 14-17 y/o who have overweight or obesity and a history of overweight or obesity will be invited to participate. Measurements will be taken in the clinical research center and the home. Participants will be randomized to receive the intervention or no intervention.

For the first aim, the primary hypothesis is that participants randomized to the intervention will achieve a greater overall diet quality than participants randomized to the control group (no intervention) as assessed by change in HEI-2020 between baseline and end of study measurements on primary and secondary outcome measures (24-hr dietary recalls, urine sodium to potassium ratio, and glucose profiles).

For the second aim, an important hypothesis is that participants randomized to the intervention will achieve a greater change in urinary sodium to potassium ratio between baseline and end of study measurements compared to participants randomized to the control group as assessed by change in urine sodium to potassium ratio and HEI dietary components.

Based on prior reports, we anticipate an 11% increase in HEI, and 30% difference in urinary Na to K. To achieve these findings, we will need a total N of 14 to 15 and an estimated retention rate of 81%. This study aligns with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Recommendation 10.16 to encourage a 20-50 kg weight loss for children with obesity who are treated in inpatient settings."

Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is the ability of the brain to maintain a stable level of cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite changes in systemic blood pressure (BP). There are two main cerebral autoregulation pathways that have a significant impact on CBF: the myogenic pathway, which acts through the endothelium and smooth muscle of cerebral arteries, and the metabolic pathway, which acts through local CO2 levels and extracellular fluid.
The mechanisms of CA have been studied in the cerebral artery by using techniques such as transcranial Doppler (TCD), transcranial near-infrared spectroscopy (TNS), laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These techniques have demonstrated that the myogenic and metabolic autoregulation pathways have opposite response patterns during acute BP changes, which means that the myogenic pathway tends to constrain blood vessels when BP is high, while the metabolic pathway tends to vasodilate blood vessels when BP is low. The metabolic pathway is known to have a rapid response compared to the myogenic pathway, which tends to have a slower response time. CA is also influenced by various diseases and conditions, such as brain tumors, cerebral aneurysms, stroke, trauma, and headache.
Hyperperfusion is an increase in blood flow and pressure associated with a decrease in arteriolar resistance. It is often thought of as an indicator of abnormal autoregulation.
Some studies have indicated increased incidence of CH in carotid revascularisation. These results are related to incomplete restoration of CA after carotid revascularisation. In most previous studies, the incidence of CH varied between 2.8% and 24.8%. The cause may be due to carotid revascularisation-induced cerebral hemodynamics disorder.
For the risk factor that cannot be corrected, the only effective treatment is the early detection and prevention of CA. Therefore, the present study is aimed at improving the early detection and early prevention of CA, thus to reduce the incidence of CH after CAS.
Understanding these mechanisms and determining the most effective autoregulation pathways to regulate CBF, clinicians can optimize cerebral hemodynamics in patients receiving CAS.
In this study, we will try to find the risk factor of CH after carotid revascularisation, the early detection of CA in patients undergoing carotid revascularization, thereby reducing the incidence of CH after carotid revascularisation.

A diagnosis of cancer reverberates throughout the family. Family caregivers take on a wide range of responsibilities, such as monitoring medical symptoms, communicating with the patient's medical team, managing insurance claims, providing transportation, and assisting with activities of daily living. Psychological distress is common. Caregivers often feel unprepared for their role, and socially isolated from others. Physical impacts have also been documented, from fatigue to sleep disturbance to immune dysfunction. To alleviate some of these difficult sequelae of cancer caregiving, we propose to test the utility of a brief, low-cost, non-pharmacologic, behavioral intervention for persons providing care for a loved one with cancer. Specifically, we will test the effects of an expressive writing (EW) intervention. The basic paradigm asks participants to write for 20 minutes on four separate occasions about a trauma or stressor. Initial work conducted with undergraduate samples showed benefit of EW. Since then, EW studies have been conducted across a variety of populations including persons coping with chronic illness. Benefits have ranged from better lung function among asthmatics to fewer physical symptoms among women with breast cancer. One meta-analysis of 146 studies across 10,994 participants reported positive effect sizes (mental or physical health benefits) for 102 of the studies (70%). Notable gaps in this literature include testing with cancer caregivers (with some exceptions) and use of novel delivery formats. Specific aims are: (1) To examine the effects of a group-based, videoconference-delivered EW program on emotional, social, and physical well-being among informal caregivers of persons diagnosed with cancer; (2) To identify social and linguistic mechanisms by which participation in the group-based EW intervention may improve distress; and (3) To identify potential moderators of benefit including age, gender identity, relationship to the patient, and baseline social constraints."

The investigators propose a prospective, single surgeon randomized controlled trial that investigates the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) in patients undergoing gender affirming mastectomy (GAM).
Gender affirming mastectomy is a life-changing and life-saving procedure that is being performed more often and for an increasingly diverse population. It is well documented that GAM improves mental health and decreases the risk for associated cancers in transwomen. As part of gender affirming care, surgical correction of a masculine breast is often the first and only procedure transwomen are willing to undergo. Complications such as hematoma and seroma formation are a significant concern for patients and surgeons post-operatively.
The investigators will randomize patients undergoing gender affirming mastectomy into two groups: an experimental group receiving intravenous TXA and a control group receiving standard care without TXA. The investigators will assess the presence of hematoma, clinical signs of seroma, and total aggregate drain output to determine the effect of TXA on post-operative bleeding, hematoma, and seroma. The investigators will also assess for thromboembolic events and wound complications. These outcomes will be evaluated in the immediate 3-month post-operative period, with a 1-year follow-up review of patient charts to capture long-term complications.
Patient benefit with the use of TXA will be most significant in terms of decreasing the rate of post-operative hematomas, seromas, and delayed drain removal, all of which have been previously demonstrated to improve with the use of TXA in breast surgery. If the investigators' hypothesis is correct, the investigators' data will provide a compelling argument for the routine use of TXA in patients undergoing gender affirming mastectomy."

Rituximab is one of the most active agents in the treatment of B-cell lymphoma, including splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). Rituximab combined with chemotherapy improves outcome (progression-free and overall survival) in patients with follicular lymphoma and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, there is still uncertainty in the management of patients with SMZL, especially in the presence of high-risk features. This is partly due to the fact that the clinical course of SMZL is very heterogeneous. Previous studies in patients with SMZL have reported 5-year overall survival rates between 43-65% in patients with no specific treatment. Zanubrutinib is a potent and selective Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor with high response rates and favourable safety profile in Mantle Cell Lymphoma. BTK has recently been reported to be expressed in SMZL and also identified as the driver kinase of B-cell receptor (B-cell receptor)- mutated non-follicular non-GCB lymphoma, including SMZL.
This study will evaluate, in a prospective randomized trial, whether treatment with zanubrutinib (with or without rituximab) results in an improvement in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) compared to treatment with rituximab alone in patients with previously untreated symptomatic splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Based on previous data, a superiority in 3-year PFS of 30% of zanubrutinib compared to rituximab alone is hypothesized. The study will include approximately 120 participants. The study will have separate co-primary endpoints defined as 1) PFS defined as the time from randomization to progression (according to Lugano 2014 criteria) or death from any cause; and 2) PFS according to Matutes criteria, which include only splenic MZL. The safety profile of the combination will be described and compared with the standard treatment with rituximab. The trial will be carried out in different European countries."

According to our knowledge, this will be the first randomized controlled trial comparing ultrasound guided SAPB versus thoracic epidural in pain control for thoracotomy. Patients with cancer will be enrolled in our study and will be randomized into two groups. Before induction of anesthesia, the ultrasound image will be obtained with the help of linear transducer probe and an on laying patient with the diseased side of the patient up. The 5th rib is identified in the mid-axillary line. The following muscles are overlying the rib latissimusdorsi ,teres major, and serratus muscle. The needle (22 G, 50-mm Tuohy needle) is introduced in-plane targeting the plane superficial to serratus muscle. Local anesthetic injection is done when the needle is withdrawn back to the subcutaneous layer after injection of local anesthetic, followed by a catheter is threaded subcutaneously. The catheter is secured with sterile gloves and the area of the catheter and skin is covered with sterile dressing and the ends of the dressing are secured with surgical sutures. Intraoperatively, the patients receive general anesthesia with thoracic epidural catheter insertion. Postoperatively, the patients in both groups will be monitored for vital signs while they are transferred to intensive care unit. The same measurements including pain scores, analgesia requirement, and side effects will be done. The investigative plan of the trial is as follows:

Background: The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) serves as the frontline of pediatric healthcare, providing life-supporting medical care for seriously ill patients. While this intense care has led to more children surviving critical illness, it leads to a significant number of adverse events, long-term complications, and a period of time when families are not able to engage with or support their ill child. Research studies have shown that these adverse health outcomes can be significantly decreased when parents are actively engaged in care decisions and the emotional experience of their child’s hospitalization.
However, the PICU can be a distressing and overwhelming place for families, and it can be difficult to find ways to engage them in their child’s care. Currently, medical teams do not have a system in place to support parent engagement in their child’s PICU experience. Furthermore, there is a lack of research investigating parent engagement in high-risk, acute care medical settings. The first step in addressing this gap is to work with families during their time in the PICU to create a journal that serves as a tool for parents and pediatric healthcare teams to communicate with one another and support the family's coping, caregiving, and self-care needs.
Objectives: 1. Identify parental and child needs that can be met within the PICU to support coping, caregiving, and self-care needs.
2. Creation and evaluation (via pilot trial) of a journal that allows family members to communicate and express emotions to their child's care team.
3. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this journal with the child's care team.

Background: People with Autism Experience Differential Access to Therapy and Research
Those with autism experience different outcomes across the lifespan because many interventions were developed based on White populations. Even interventions targeted at autistic communities have been tested using primarily White participants. The outcomes and effectiveness of these interventions are not generalizable to Hispanic and Latino populations. Understanding cultural and contextual factors that influence the use of and engagement with research is essential to developing effective interventions.
Objectives: The long-term objective of this project is to improve the health and well-being of Hispanic/Latino autistic children by engaging in stakeholder engagement to improve utilization of the evidence based autism intervention Ayres Sensory Integration and to improve stakeholder engagement in the research process from conceptualization to dissemination for effective outcomes. The specific aims of this project are:
1. Compare stakeholder engagement effectiveness of Design Thinking (DT) and Focus Groups (FG) using Stakeholder Engagement Evaluation measures (PCORI areas of stakeholder engagement) in engagement of Hispanic/Latino autistic individuals, parents, caregivers, OTs, teachers, and cultural experts.
2. Adapt two versions of the Ayres Sensory Integration intervention protocols (one based on FG and another based on DT data) to create culturally appropriate information to engage Hispanic/Latino stakeholders in research and treatment for therapeutic services.
3. Evaluate the Acceptability and Feasibility of the adapted intervention manuals using the Acceptability and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention Appraisal Measure (IAM), and the Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM).

Study Design: The study design is a randomized mixed methods design with two primary aims. The first aim compares the effectiveness of Design Thinking (DT) and Focus Groups (FG) on stakeholder engagement via the PCORI engagement principles, and the second aim compares the acceptability and feasibility of the two versions of the intervention protocols (one based on FG and another based on DT data).

Study Population: The study participants include Hispanic/Latino participants with autism, parents/caregivers, occupational therapists, teachers, and cultural experts.

Intervention: Participants will be invited to participate in either DT or FG to provide input on therapies for Hispanic/Latino autistic individuals. For Phase two of this study, participants will be invited to participate in a follow-up study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the adapted intervention manual for Hispanic/Latino individuals and their families.

Study Procedures: Phase one will consist of a stakeholder engagement session using two methods: Design Thinking (DT) or Focus Group (FG). Participants will learn about the project, provide input using the Stakeholder-Centric Engagement Evaluation (SCEE), and participate in either DT or FG. Phase two will consist of adaption of the information provided to create culturally-appropriate intervention protocols for Hispanic/Latino individuals and their families. Participants will provide input on the acceptability and feasibility of the adapted intervention manual.

Outcomes: Primary Outcome Measure: The study evaluates two measures: Stakeholder-Centric Engagement Evaluation measures using a Likert scale and evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of intervention using the AIM, IAM, and FIM using a Likert response scale. Secondary Outcome Measures include the Demographics and Background Survey (DSBS), the Quality of Life in Autism (QOL-A), and the Occupational Therapy Engagement Scale (OTES) that is completed by participants.

Project Significance: This project addresses significant public health issues in autism treatment delivery and engagement in research and treatment interventions among Hispanic/Latino families. The study may identify strategies for engaging minority stakeholders in research, thereby increasing their utilization of and confidence in the interventions and services provided. The developed therapeutic protocols and intervention manuals will provide culturally-specific guidelines for engaging this underserved and growing population with autism with therapy services and research participation. The results will improve the health of Hispanic/Latino autistic children and guide future clinicians and researchers in effectively engaging minority stakeholders in research and treatment programs that ultimately result in improved health outcomes.

Fasting: preoperative fasting remains one of the main rules observed before a surgical procedure. The implementation of this rule limits perioperative fluid and nutrient intake. However, these constraints can cause patient's inconvenience and anxiety as well as discomfort. In the perioperative period, this fasting is associated with a high rate of postoperative complications, with an increase of postoperative nausea and vomiting without any benefit. In practice, the duration of fasting before surgery remains arbitrarily determined, despite a trend to an increase of preoperative fasting. In 2016, the French society of anesthetists and intensive care (Société Française d'Anesthésie et de Réanimation) proposed a guideline about preoperative fasting with a clear indication of solid and liquid oral intake before daytime surgery. However, a retrospective study about preoperative fasting was done before the implementation of this guideline. There are thus no data on the evolution of preoperative fasting after this sensitization campaign, except some retrospective studies in emergency surgery. This study aims to observe (before-after) the duration of fasting (solid or liquid) before daytime surgery in patients admitted to general surgery or gynecology surgery departments in 2 French hospitals. Additionally, the team will investigate the influence of preoperative fasting on patient's anxiety and discomfort and the quality of recovery after surgery."

This community-based randomized controlled trial targets 7th grade students in rural Appalachia to determine the effectiveness of the Mentored Planning to be Active (MPBA) plus Family for physical activity, exercise behaviors, and body composition. Having teens deliver intervention content via structured peer mentoring increases social support and motivation, thereby promoting self-regulation and sustainability to improve health behaviors, especially during adolescence when overweight/obesity in adolescents is rising at an alarming rate. Over the course of two years, 309 children suffering from overweight and obesity will be randomly assigned to receive MPBA+F (n=155) or self-regulation support in both rural and urban Appalachian counties. The long-term goal is to reduce the high rates of overweight and obesity-related diabetes in Appalachia youth.
The study will be conducted during 2019 and 2020 and is composed of 3 data collection phases: the fall (Phase 1), the winter, spring, and summer (Phase 2), and the winter, spring, and summer of the following school year (Phase 3). Phase 1: Children will be recruited during the first 6-1/2 weeks of 7th grade and will undergo one-time data collection to obtain medical histories, height measurements, weight measurements, blood pressure, and blood sample collections. They will also answer questionnaires about their physical activity behaviors. Parents will be asked to provide information about their child's family demographics, home environment, medical history, and family health behaviors. Phase 2: Children will receive either 10 weekly MPBA plus Family sessions or 10 self-regulated health support sessions. Children will be monitored for physical activity minutes (using accelerometers), physical activity behaviors, body composition, blood pressure, and blood samples collected again, as well as answer questionnaires about their behaviors and health. Phase 3: Half of the families will receive a 6-month 'Health and Fitness' rewards-based self-regulation program for child participants. Changes in study outcomes (physical activity, self-efficacy, self-regulation, health behaviors, weight status, and blood pressure) will be measured using interviews, accelerometers, and questionnaires. At the end of the 2-year study period, the investigators compare outcomes for children who received MPBA+F, the comparison condition (self-regulation arm), and usual care (those who do not receive any intervention). Long-term effects on PA outcomes and body composition are explored by analyzing child outcomes between early fall (Phase 1) and the end of child's 8th-grade year (Phase 3), comparing subgroup differences on effects by early fall, later fall, or winter, spring, and summer (child's 1st semester of 7th grade). Comparing the outcomes of peer mentors (intervention condition) and peer mentees (comparison condition) will reveal the effects of the intervention on adolescent health behavior changes. Analyses will also compare children who received the 6-month family reinforcement program to those who did not, with subgroup comparisons by age, biological sex, or baseline weight status. The investigators will also compare child outcomes to those of parents, and compare health outcomes between child participants. The results will provide guidance for future intervention development and the integration of peer mentoring for promoting healthy habits among youth at risk."

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common opportunistic infection in China and a major factor leading to liver transplant recipients’ poor prognosis. In order to obtain relevant epidemiology data of CMV and its clinical features in liver transplant recipients, we will evaluate the patients enrolled in this study prospectively. Our results may provide some clinical guidance for clinicians to prevent and control CMV-related diseases in such population. The subjects of the study are liver transplant recipients in seven high volume liver transplantation centers in China. By collecting baseline and clinicopathological features, and laboratory tests when patients are hospitalized, we will observe CMV-related outcomes including the incidence of CMV reactivation, CMV disease, the death risk within the first year after liver transplantation, as well as the rates of graft rejection and other infections. Meanwhile, we will also assess the effects of the different CMV prophylaxis and treatment strategies on CMV outcomes and survival."

Project Summary/Abstract:
Cognitive deficits after right brain stroke, such as impaired spatial cognition and lack of attention to the left side of space, cause significant functional disability, and can be mistaken for inattention or laziness. The principal goal of cognitive rehabilitation is restoration of function to improve quality of life. This project targets the right brain stroke syndrome of spatial neglect (SN), defined as damaged control of left visual space, which accounts for 12-55% of stroke survivors in inpatient rehabilitation units. Individuals with SN are 50% less likely to return home, and half of SN survivors lose their license after stroke. A personalized approach to SN rehabilitation must balance three factors: i) accurate diagnosis of SN (many stroke survivors do not have this diagnosis), ii) efficient administration of effective treatments, iii) cost-efficient care delivery. There is a pressing need for this personalized approach to restore function and independence for Veterans with SN.
The purpose of the research is to determine if a validated clinical predictor of effective SN rehabilitation can be identified from routine clinical data, in order to guide clinical decision-making about which survivors should receive this specialized treatment. The investigators have recently published on the predictive value for recovery of functional independence after rehabilitation of a clinical index (the Existence of Aiming Spatial Neglect) and of neuroimaging, specifically disconnection of dorsolateral frontal and right thalamocortical regions. Here, the researchers have two specific aims. (1) To develop a brain imaging biomarker which indicates the highest likelihood of having SN that affects movement, action and planning, and (2) to determine how these biomarkers can help to predict improvement in daily life function after receiving prism adaptation therapy. Based on our previous work, the investigators predict that this clinical index will be an effective predictor of PAT rehabilitation outcomes, which could translate to improved quality of life after stroke. The investigators have developed PAT for stroke survivors, resulting in the largest collection of PAT outcome data, and have identified a clinical index of PAT outcome prediction based on the presence of Aiming SN. The goal of this proposal is therefore to identify a validated biomarker of the presence of Aiming SN, to determine if including brain imaging biomarkers refines this clinical index of PAT outcome response. The investigators' preliminary findings suggest that subcortical disconnection is the defining attribute of Aiming SN. Thus, the investigators expect to find a strong correlation between Aiming SN and the disconnection of frontal regions with subcortical and parietal regions. These neural biomarkers are needed to support a clinical trial examining the impact of PAT on outcome, to be submitted to the VA National Center for Rehabilitation Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders."

Background: It has been hypothesized that immune checkpoint blockade could prevent the fibrotic transformation of resected low-risk PDAC, prevent disease progression, and reduce the incidence of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula in BRPC or LAPC patients that undergo a partial pancreatectomy. There is some evidence to suggest that such resections may have less incidence of pancreatic fibrosis than the standard removal of the whole organ (Whipple's Procedure) for LAPC patients. However, this evidence is insufficient to make any definitive conclusions. Additionally, the long-term outcome of patients has been limited to small cohorts. There is a need to further characterize these patients to identify prognostic markers. Therefore, this is a pilot study that aims to provide preliminary efficacy data to support the design of a future larger Phase IIb study to evaluate the role of adjuvant zimberelimab and quemliclustat in patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Research Design: The study is a Phase Ib, multicenter, open-label single group, pilot study. The study participants will be treated with zimberelimab, a CD73 inhibitor (antigenic CD73 is highly expressed on immature T cells), in combination with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, including modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) comprising fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and inrinotecan, and with quemliclustat, an inhibitor of α(1,3) glucan. The first 6 patients enrolled in Part A are treated on a lead-in dose escalation of zimberelimab orally, at a starting dose of 80 mg twice a day (BID), and given intravenous (IV) chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, IV leucovorin calcium, and IV fluorouracil). For patients enrolled in Part A, the dose of zimberelimab will be escalated by doubling in successive cohorts, using a Bayesian adaptive cohort design, to obtain a dose to be studied in Part B, which is 160 mg twice a day (BID). In Part B, up to 19 additional patients will be enrolled to receive the recommended phase IIb dose (RP2Bd) of zimberelimab, 160 mg twice a day (BID), in combination with IV chemotherapy. Patients will also undergo biospecimen collections, including blood and tissue samples, for exploratory translational studies. It is expected that all enrolled eligible patients will continue to receive the same dose level of zimberelimab and chemotherapy until disease progression. During the second year of the study, additional 30 to 50 patients with locally advanced PDAC will be enrolled in Part B. Up to 18 additional patients will be enrolled to receive the RP2Bd of zimberelimab and chemotherapy. It is anticipated that all enrolled eligible patients in Part B will continue to receive the same dose level of zimberelimab and chemotherapy until disease progression. During the third year of the study, an additional 36 BRPC patients are enrolled on the combination of zimberelimab, quemliclustat, and chemotherapy over a 3-year period. It is anticipated that during these three years of the study, investigators will collect up to 120 tissue samples."

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the first cause of death in the world. It is well recognized that probiotics are safe and effective in treating several diseases. Several studies supported the use of probiotic for depression, with some studies showing significant improvement. Depression is the most common psychiatric problems among hemodialysis patients, with a high prevalence of over 40%. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of probiotics on depression syndrome and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients.
                This is an interventional study and the patients will be randomized either to probiotics or no probiotics. The patients will take probiotic, MIYAIRI 588, or no probiotics for 3 months.
                The probiotics, MIYAIRI 588, contains B. lactis HN019 and Pediococcus acidilactici PAC 1.0. MIYAIRI 588 has been demonstrated to have neuroprotection and neuropsychotic benefit by inducing the generation of new neurons. The patients in this study are taking MIYAIRI 588 1 packet 3 times daily before dinner.
                Inclusion Criteria. Eligible are subjects who are aged 20 years or over, who are undergoing hemodialysis (more than 3 months, 3 times per week, and ultra-filtration rate ≥65%). Exclusion Criteria are subjects with allergy to the probiotic component or those who have clinically significant cardiovascular comorbidity, infectious complications, active malignancy, psychosis, hypersensitivity or any history of allergy to milk.
                Depression will be assessed by a psychiatrist using the Chinese version of Beck Depression Inventory and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. In addition, the presence of hyperlipemia, hypertension, body mass index, level of anxiety, depression, and inflammation will be examined.
                This trial could provide new perspective on the treatment of hemodialysis patients and open new avenue for using probiotics in hemodialysis patients."

We will recruit and retain college-aged adults (age 18-24) to participate in a preliminary clinical trial of a 12-week Internet-delivered CM-PST intervention. The intervention, CM-PST, will integrate positive psychology with CM, and will thus be called CM + Positive.

We will recruit participants with Alcohol Use Disorder between age 18 and 24 years and who have met DSM criteria for AUD in the past year at the entry clinic. Participants will complete written informed consent and, if eligible, an interview with a study psychologist to screen for AUD using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5.

After screening, participants will be invited to participate in one 30-minute baseline session at the UIC Clinical Lab. In that session, participants will complete baseline self-report measures, consent to a separate MRI session the following week, and receive the standard CM assessment and feedback. Participants will also undergo standard neuroimaging procedures to establish baseline brain activation patterns. Following this baseline session, participants will begin treatment that will entail 8 CM-PST individual sessions over 12 weeks.

Prior to the first CM-PST individual session, participants will attend an orientation-instruction session that will review the CM-PST procedures, including how to participate in videoconferences, how to use the computerized treatment procedures, and the study guidelines and requirements. Subsequent to Orientation-Instruction, participants will participate in 8 CM-PST individual sessions weekly via videoconference. In each of these 8 CM-PST sessions, participants will learn how to solve problems that elicit drinking and how to apply problem-solving skills to other activities that elicit drinking. In CM-PST, participants will receive incentives for alcohol abstinence and submission of urine samples twice per week. For each such sample that the participant does not report consuming alcohol and/or illicit drugs, the participant will earn a $5 gift card toward their incentive total.

To assess feasibility and acceptability of CM-PST, we will collect data on participants’ satisfaction, acceptability, and feasibility of the treatment procedures using a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire."

This research aims to evaluate the effect of high fidelity and virtual reality based simulation applications on simulation-based learning, reflective thinking and therapeutic communication skills in undergraduate nursing students. As a result of the research, it is aimed to determine the effect of virtual reality based simulation applications applied to students on reflection and therapeutic communication skills, by examining the effects of high fidelity and virtual reality based simulation applications that provide experiences similar to practice on students' simulation-based learning skills. To this end, the researchers will apply the Simulation-Based Learning Scale, the Reflective Thinking Skills for Problem Solving Scale and the Therapeutic Communication Skills Scale to the groups who will receive high fidelity simulation and virtual reality-based simulation and to each group separately. They will evaluate the change scores of the application groups by comparing the values obtained on the scale from the pretest and the posttest with a significant level of 0.05.
The researchers hypothesize that virtual reality-based simulation will be more effective than high-fidelity simulation in terms of learning, reflecting and communication skills.
The universe of the research; It will consist of second-year students studying at Hacettepe University Faculty of Nursing in the 2023-2024 academic year.

Background: Pancreaticoduodenectomy, or Whipple procedure, is a pancreatectomy surgery to remove the head of the pancreas, the duodenum, the gallbladder, and the first part of the small intestine. In traditional open surgery, most surgeons prefer to disconnect the pancreas neck in the center of the pancreas at the beginning of the surgery. However, with the development of laparoscopic surgery, researchers found that removing the center part of the pancreas neck can lead to pancreatic fistula after the surgery. On the other hand, a few surgeons would conduct extended pancreatic neck transection during laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, which was proved to be safe and effective by limited randomized controlled trials. 
Methods/Procedure: 180 patients with benign or resectable malignant tumors were enrolled and randomized into extended transection group or conventional transection group. After operation was accomplished, patients were followed-up for 3 months and 1 year. Pancreatic fistula was defined and graded according to 2008 International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery criteria, and postoperative morbidity was evaluated by the Clavien-Dindo Score. 
Main results: Pancreatic fistula incidence was 26.30% (18/69) in extended transection group, which was similar to the 28.05% (19/68) in conventional transection group (P = 0.797). The location of the pancreatic duct in the pancreatic transverse section showed no difference between two groups. No pancreatic anastomotic leakage was found during the operation and the follow-up after 3 months (P = 1.000). Pancreatic fistula and the pancreatic anastomotic complication were significantly higher in patients with left-side dissection than right-side dissection of the pancreas (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of other morbidity, postoperative mortality and operative time (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: Extended transection group of pancreatic neck cannot reduce the occurrence of pancreatic fistula, but can improve the success rate of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy by achieving left-side dissection."

Delirium is a common and distressing disturbance in cognitive function among mechanically ventilated patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The VR-based sensory stimulation (VRS) intervention effectively reduces the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium and hospitalized general psychiatric patients' psychosis. However, its effect on delirium prevention in ICU patients remains uncertain.
Patients in the ICU are usually exposed to sensory stimuli such as mechanical ventilation, frequent invasive monitoring, and unpredictable events that can lead to delirium. A simple and effective way to reduce exposure to these stimuli is VRS, which can also increase the sensory integration among sensory stimuli in daily life.
Aiming to test the effect of VRS on preventing delirium, this pilot clinical trial compares the effectiveness of the VRS intervention to usual care in ICU-patients.
Delirium-free patients (n = 64) are randomized into two groups, the VRS and usual care groups. Delirium incidence, duration, severity, along with ICU memory, post-traumatic stress disorder, ICU quality of life, and clinical outcomes will be compared between groups."

A retrospective study revealed a 1-year mortality rate of 24% after multiple and long fractured ribs, and patients with multiples rib fractures have a high risk of respiratory, cardiac, and acute lung injuries. Early surgical fixation of fractured ribs is associated with lower incidence and mortality of pneumonia, atelectasis, and delayed pulmonary recovery and reduction of time of respiratory assist with mechanical ventilation. To minimize the morbidity after rib fractures, surgical fixation of multiple and long rib fractures is currently considered in patients who are pre ventilatory.
The primary goal of this study is to determine the outcome of surgical rib fixation versus conservative management. As a secondary goal, we would like to study:
a. The length of ICU hospitalization between the two groups.
b. The length of hospitalization between the two groups.
c. The development of acute lung injury between the two groups.
d. The mechanical ventilation between the two groups.
e. Thoracic and overall pain of the two treatment groups.
a. Mechanical ventilation: the need and duration of mechanical ventilation.
b. Thoracic pain: measure severity of pain using pain scale 0 to10."

This project will compare acute psychological stress responses to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and the Mannheim Multicomponent stress test (MMST). While the TSST is the most widely used stressor protocol, recent literature reviews have concluded that, due to some methodological limitations, not all physiological responses to the TSST were consistent with the SNS stress paradigm. Therefore, the aim of this project is to improve the validity of acute psychological stress tests by using the MMST, which can better measure the impact of mental stress by specifically targeting the SNS response.
                Previous studies have reported significant salivary cortisol rise in response to laboratory stressors. This increase is primarily attributed to exposure to social stimulus (e.g., the TSST) accompanied by speech or arithmetic tasks. However, many investigations reported contradictory findings regarding the magnitude of saliva cortisol response induced by these tasks. Therefore, the project will use a standardized laboratory stressor and measure salivary cortisol response from baseline to peak and to recovery, using standard biochemical techniques (ELISA). In addition, we will assess whether differences in acute cortisol response are associated with trait anxiety, as previous studies showed significant links between trait anxiety and physiological response to social stress.
                Cortisol is a biochemical correlate of the stress response. However, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) can be another biomarker for the acute stress response. It is a human salivary enzyme, whose activity has been used in the diagnosis of pathological stress (such as depression). Previous studies have shown a positive correlation between sAA and salivary cortisol after psychosocial stress tasks. Therefore, the project will examine the association between sAA and salivary cortisol induced by mental stress to clarify the utility of sAA as a biomarker of acute psychological stress.
                Saliva cortisol and sAA will be used to examine the relationship between psychological stress and the immune response after the stress tests. Some studies showed that an acute psychological stress test can down-regulate the cellular immune response (measuring the natural killer cells activity). However, other studies failed to find significant negative effects of psychological stress on immune function. Therefore, the project will combine two specific immune biomarkers (e.g., natural killer cells activity, cellular proliferation) to examine the long-term (7 days) impact of acute psychological stress on immune function.
                Furthermore, we aim to examine the long-term impact (7 days) of acute psychological stress on the cortisol metabolism by measuring the cortisol free fraction. The cortisol free fraction is the amount of free cortisol (unbound to cortisol binding globulin) in the blood. This ratio is commonly used as a measure of glucocorticoid (GC) activity since the unbound fraction has direct access to GC receptors in the target tissues. Additionally, we will examine the association between acute psychological stress and plasma oxytocin levels. Oxytocin is known as a hormone of social bonding and plays a key role in social interactions (e.g., during pregnancy and lactation).
                We hypothesize that participants performing acute psychological stress will exhibit elevated sAA and cortisol levels in response to the tests. However, due to the small number of previous studies, we expect that the association between sAA and/or cortisol and the immune response of cortisol free fraction, natural killer cells activity and cellular proliferation is not clear at this time."

A high yield condition seen in the pediatric emergency department (ED) is acute elbow pain. The majority of evaluations and treatment interventions for acute pediatric elbow pain involve imaging by radiography. While acute elbow pain is often self-limiting and due to either a distal radial fracture or an elbow subluxation, up to one half of all pediatric elbow evaluations will not identify a fracture on radiography, resulting in significant unnecessary radiation exposure. Therefore, it is imperative to be able to differentiate between these two conditions in children as both have different management plans. In addition, acute distal radial fractures have a high probability of being occult (missing on imaging) when visualization is limited by fracture comminution or subtle findings which are seen on a later imaging exam (CT or MRI). Ultrasound has become one of the most commonly utilized imaging techniques due to its cost effectiveness and availability in the ED. Ultrasound has been shown to accurately detect elbow fractures in adults with good sensitivity and specificity. There are currently no studies using ultrasound to address acute distal radius fractures in children.
Despite the availability of ultrasound in the majority of EDs, there is limited literature on using ultrasound for diagnosing pediatric elbow injuries. The pediatric elbow is a complex area of the body with a small amount of fat between tendons and ligaments and is typically difficult to image with traditional ultrasound techniques. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to determine if a novel pocket-sized ultrasound device called Butterfly IQ is capable of imaging the pediatric elbow and can be used by emergency physicians to detect injury. This study will also determine if pocket-sized ultrasound can be used to differentiate between a distal radial fracture and elbow subluxation. This study will be conducted in an Academic Level 1 Pediatric Hospital Emergency Department. 
Additionally, after enrollment in an open-label trial, eligible children will receive a pocket-sized ultrasound exam and be followed up 2 weeks later for presence of fracture on subsequent imaging. The primary aim of the study is to compare initial test performance characteristics of PSUS evaluated by bedside ultrasound provider on initial imaging compared to subsequent blinded radiology readings of the initial or subsequent x-ray images or bedside nursemaid reduction of participants diagnosed with elbow subluxation/dislocation. The secondary aim is to evaluate the accuracy of pocket sized ultrasound elbow exams compared to Xray in suspected fracture or bedside nursemaid reduction in suspected subluxations."

Hallux valgus is a progressive foot disorder involving the great toe and is characterized by a lateral deviation of the first metatarsal (MT1) and the hallux valgus angle (HVA). The HVA is the angle formed by a line connecting the first metatarsal (MT1) and the proximal phalanx of the hallux in the sagittal plane and a horizontal line tangent to the proximal phalanx. A positive HVA angle is defined when the first metatarsal is tilted laterally and the HVA angle is > 15 degrees. Individuals who have a HVA of < 15 degrees and 15-20 degrees are classified as mild to moderate hallux valgus. Individuals with a HVA of 20-40 degrees are classified as moderate to severe. Individuals with a HVA of > 40 degrees are classified as severe. Hallux valgus with a HVA of > 20 degrees is defined as stage 3. Stage 4, hallux valgus with a HVA of > 40 degrees, is treated through surgery and conservative treatment methods are less preferred. Orthotic devices with proven effectiveness are preferred in the conservative treatment of individuals with hallux valgus. The most commonly used hallux valgus orthoses are the finger separator orthosis and the dynamic orthosis. The finger separator orthosis separates the toes to improve the alignment of the first metatarsal to the third metatarsal, while the dynamic orthosis is a device that uses a free joint to prevent hallux valgus deformity and realign the hallux through a lateral force application on it. Although studies have been conducted on the finger separator orthosis, a comparative study between these two orthoses has not been conducted in the literature. In this study, plantar pressure analysis will be done to compare the effectiveness of finger separator orthosis and dynamic orthosis in mild and moderate hallux valgus deformity. To compare the effectiveness of finger separator orthosis and dynamic orthosis on hallux valgus angle and foot pressure distribution will be evaluated by using AOFAS Foot and Ankle Score form, Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire form, Numerical Evaluation form and Socio-Demographic Evaluation Form will be used."

Background: Children born with cleft palate have an opening at the roof of their mouth, which can cause issues with dental eruption, nasal reflux, and speech. An additional issue is velopharyngeal insufficiency. Children with this condition have difficulty speaking, particularly with the letters s, sh, ch, and the sounds of s and z. In fact, the majority of children with cleft palate are considered to be velopharyngeally incompetent. There are several ways to improve velopharyngeal competency, such as speech therapy and surgery.
Objective: To develop two outcome measures to measure speech function in children with isolated or combined cleft palate after surgery. The measures are the Patient and Parent Response Outcome Measurement, Intelligibility in Context Scale, and CLEFT-Q. This is the first study to test these measurements, which could be used in future research into velopharyngeal competency.
Methods: In this study, the speech function of 65 children will be tested before surgery, and one year and 5 years after surgery. In addition, parents will provide feedback about how they communicate with their children. The study will also examine how often children speak, their general health, and the quality of their speech.
Hypothesis: The project hypothesises that (1) the use of these new outcome measures in children with cleft lip and/or palate will be feasible and valuable both for clinical use and for future research."

One of the most feared complications is the vaginal cuff dehiscence. However, in a recent meta-analysis of the literature published in 2018, it is observed that the data available are scarce and insufficient to determine which technique is more effective in preventing it, considering that the evidence for the absence of a difference between the various techniques adopted was incomplete (I2 = 45%, p=0.14) and at high risk of bias. Our objective is to compare the safety and complication rate of a colporrhaphy with barbed absorbable suture versus that of a traditional colporrhaphy using a monofilament absorbable suture."

Gambling addiction has often been conceptualized as the result of reward processing dysfunction in the brain, particularly in the striatum, a key structure of the reward system. Although a number of studies have provided support for this hypothesis, neuroimaging studies have produced inconsistent results, suggesting either hypo- or hyper-reactivity to rewards in gambling addiction. These inconsistencies have been the subject of intense debate, but remain unexplained to this day, hampering our understanding of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction. Objectives Primary objective: This project will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional, respectively. Secondary objective: This project will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers.

Obesity is a multi-factorial chronic disease and an important health problem in developed countries. Worldwide there are more than two billion overweight or obese adults and 35% of the world's population suffer from obesity. The economic burden of obesity is overwhelming, with estimated direct and indirect costs for Germany in 2007 being 33.6 billion euros. The main problem of obesity treatment is the lack of effective therapy. This study investigates the effectiveness of different laparoscopic imaging systems, the Olympus and Leica imaging systems, for bariatric surgery and to analyze the impact of different imaging systems on the clinical outcome of the patient compared to each other.
2D 4K and 3D HD cameras are currently the most used camera system in minimal invasive surgery; however, they are not equally available and some countries mainly use the 2D 4K camera system while others mainly use the 3D HD camera system. The investigation focuses on comparing the effectiveness of 2D 4K and 3D HD Laparoscopic imaging systems during Bariatric Surgery.
The evaluation of the primary outcome should be comprehensive enough to evaluate the impact of the surgical image on each clinical outcome parameter. For this purpose, the operation time has been chosen as the primary outcome parameter. This parameter is also the easiest to measure and determine. The workload of the operating surgeon is another secondary outcome parameter. It is also important to document potential intraoperative and postoperative complications, which have a great impact on the success and outcome of bariatric surgery. Since the choice of imaging systems depends on the available resources, and these imaging systems are costly, there is a growing need for evidence and recommendations for a better use of these resources. In Germany, only a few publications exist, which focus on the assessment of different imaging systems.
With the proposed study, a comparison of 2D 4K and 3D HD laparoscopic imaging systems for bariatric surgery will be made using an RCT under real conditions. This will give recommendations for better use of the available resources and provide a comparison between the two imaging systems in a real hospital setting.

Ovarian cancer has a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. Many ovarian cancer patients have received standard treatment with surgical resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
The use of Chinese medicine in the treatment of various cancer and other diseases has a long history and has been proved to have certain efficacy and safety in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Huaier Granulated Chinese Medicinal was approved by the State Food and Drug Administration and entered clinical market. It is one of the commonly used TCM in the field of cancer prevention and treatment. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that Huaier Granule can regulate the immune function of patients, inhibit tumors, strengthen the body, and effectively alleviate the symptoms and side effects of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Therefore, it is possible to regulate the immune function of patients, improve the quality of life of patients and reduce the adverse effects of chemotherapy.
This study is a retrospective, single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of Huaier Granule in the treatment of stage I primary ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and peritoneal cancer after operation. A total of 92 patients with BRCA mutation and BRCA wild-type ovarian cancer in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital between February 2019 and June 2020 were enrolled as a retrospective study. All patients were treated with Huaier granule after operation."

Introduction: 
Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) remains to this day a syndrome that is not fully understood. Initially, it was considered quite rare, but today there are reports suggesting a SIBO prevalence between 6 to 15% of healthy, asymptomatic people and reaching 80% in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. It is often involved in various disorders, such as diarrhea and malabsorption. It is defined as an increase in the number and/or disturbance in the type of bacteria in the upper part of the intestinal tract. SIBO occurs when the homeostatic mechanisms of the small intestine are disturbed. The two main conditions that favor microbial overgrowth in the small intestine are decreased acid secretion from the stomach and small bowel dyskinesia. The literature is scarce concerning the effects of SIBO on critically ill patients. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the effects of SIBO on mechanically ventilated patients. It is a non-invasive observational study employing a modified technique to obtain exhaled air from the ventilator tubes to perform a standard hydrogen breath test for SIBO diagnosis. Lactulose is used as a substrate. Specifically, each patient is administered 20 g of lactulose diluted in 400 ml of water through the nasogastric tube. Measurements are performed at 0-15-30-45-60-90-120-180 min from lactulose administration. During measurements, a valve attached to a collecting bag at the end of the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit, is kept open and the collecting bag is filled by several patient exhalations. After valve closure and bag isolation, the air is drawn by a 50 ml polyethylene syringe which is connected to the valve system to prevent losses and/or contamination. Then the air is blown into the breath hydrogen monitor and the expired hydrogen measurement is recorded. The hydrogen breath test is repeated at predetermined, protocol-based time intervals for all participants included in the study; 1st/day of admission, 3rd, 5th and 7th day of ICU stay. The 1st day measurement serves as a measure of eligibility, and patients exhibiting abnormal values of hydrogen breath testing at Day 1 are excluded from the study. An increase by more than 20 ppm of eH2 from baseline within 90 min was considered an abnormal measurement suggesting SIBO. Moreover, an increase by more than 12 ppm of eH2 from baseline within the first 30 minutes followed by a second rise within the next 15 minutes (double peak) was also considered an abnormal measurement suggesting SIBO. The primary objective of this study is assessment of the prevalence of SIBO on critically ill mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Secondary outcomes include investigation of the effects of SIBO on ventilator associated pneumonia, as well as ICU length of stay and all-cause in-hospital mortality rate in critically ill patients.

The aim of the study was to investigate whether exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is present following exercise in patient after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and if so, if it changes with exercise intensity. A repeated measures and single-blinded randomized study were done in thirty-eight patients 24 hours after TKA. Pain severity was assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 mm). Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured over quadriceps and biceps brachii and muscles immediately before and after exercise. The Exercise-Induced Hypoalgesia (EIH) were evaluated on both sides for each patient. Patients were randomly assigned to either high intensity exercises (HIE) group or low intensity exercises (LIE) group. An exercise program consisted of ankle pump exercise (3 sets of 10 repetitions), isometric exercise (3 sets of 10 repetitions), terminal extension exercise (3 sets of 10 repetitions), passive-active assistive-active range of motion exercise (1 set of 10 repetitions) were performed with ankle pumps, isometric exercises, terminal extension exercise, passive-active assistive-active range of motion exercise (2 sets of 8 repetitions) and were performed with the use of continuous passive movement (CPM) device(30 minutes sessions at ankle pumps, isometric exercises, terminal extension exercise and passive-active assistive-active range of motion exercises). Exercise intensity was monitored using the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale, which was maintained between 6 and 20 (16) throughout the exercise program. The HIE program was 60 minutes in duration, and LIE program was 30 minutes in duration. PRE< 8 indicates low intensity, PRE>14 indicates high intensity. A difference of pressure pain thresholds between pre and post of exercise for both sides were defined as Exercise-Induced Hypoalgesia (EIH). This study found that there exists a difference in EIH depending on the intensity of the exercises. There was no difference between the PPTs of the exercise side and the other side in both HIE and LIE groups (P>0.05 for all comparisons). It was concluded that the difference of pain severity in pressure algometry (PA) was detected on the exercise side in the 5th day of the participants without EIH on the HIE. There were no differences of Visual analoy scale scores of both exercise legs and non-exercise legs in both groups (HIE and LIE)) except between the non-exercise and exercise legs of LIE (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between HIE and LIE groups for pain (P=0.80) and no significant difference between HIE and LIE groups for both sides were detected for EIH (P=0.62). The conclusion of this study was that there was no EIH following exercises in patients after TKA, and different exercise protocols may be applicable on patients."

The specific aims are:
1. To determine the perception and knowledge of familial breast cancer risk among first-degree female relatives of breast cancer patients in Southwest Nigeria.
2. To determine the rate of breast screening among first-degree female relatives of breast cancer patients in Southwest Nigeria.

To determine the rate of lifestyle risk reduction among first-degree female relatives of breast cancer patients in Southwest Nigeria.
4. Determine factors associated with breast screening and lifestyle risk reduction practices among first-degree relatives of breast cancer patients in Southwest Nigeria.
5. Determine the effects of breast cancer risk assessment and counseling on adherence to breast screening and lifestyle risk reduction recommendations among first degree female relatives of breast cancer patients in Southwest Nigeria.
6. Determine the independent predictors of breast screening and lifestyle risk reduction among first-degree female relatives of breast cancer patients in Southwest Nigeria.
7. To determine the independent predictors of knowledge, perception, and attitude towards breast cancer prevention among first degree female relatives of breast cancer patients in Southwest Nigeria.

Inclusion Criteria:
First-degree female relatives of histologically-confirmed cases of breast cancer living in the Southwestern states of Nigeria.
Women aged 20 to 75 years of age.
Willingness for contact for follow-up after six months.

Exclusion Criteria:
Personal history of breast cancer.
Previous exposure to breast cancer risk assessment and counseling.
Absence of intact breasts.

Study Plan:
This will be a randomized controlled trial. Consecutive consenting subjects who met the inclusion criteria will be recruited. In a single-masked study, we would randomize all eligible participants at the baseline visit to receive either standard care or standard care in addition to individualized breast cancer risk assessment and counseling.
Baseline data on all selected participants will be collected to determine age, menopausal status, previous breast screening, lifestyle practices, and socio-demographic characteristics, as well as to assess the perception of familial breast cancer risk. The participants will be interviewed on risk communication, personal beliefs and attitudes, perceived benefits and risks, and willingness to have genetic testing.
All subjects will be recommended to self-assess their breast health once a month using the modified Breast Self-Examination (BSE). Those who were not actively performing monthly BSE will be offered monthly BSE instruction and training. They will also be recommended to have yearly mammogram, clinical breast exam, and breast cytology. They will be instructed on how to obtain assistance with breast screening at no cost if they are unable to pay for this at the nearby health care facilities. All women will be advised to adopt the NCI recommended lifestyle risk reduction practices in addition to mammography, clinical breast exam and cytology.
The primary outcomes of this study will be rates of breast screening and lifestyle risk reduction, and the secondary outcomes will be the perception, knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding breast screening, and the factors determining the performance and timing of these preventive modalities. At the six-month follow-up visit, a clinical breast exam will be performed and participants will be re-interviewed to determine the performance of mammogram, cytology, frequency of BSE and other lifestyle risk reduction practices."

The study objectives include: 
- To determine whether efavirenz (EFV) (also known as Stocrin or Sustiva) induces the metabolic pathway of CYP2B6.
- To evaluate the differences in plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic effects of methadone and tizanidine in the presence and absence of efavirenz and its effects on Caucasian individuals of different CYP2B6 genotypes (normal, intermediate or poor metabolizers).

The study involves 2 visits (pre-entry and follow-up visits), as well as 2 inpatient stays (1 for entry study and 1 for follow-up study). The total duration of the study is 22 days. In the first visit (pre-entry), subjects will have a pre-enrollment screening visit at least 1 week before the start of the study.

In the second visit (entry into the study), subjects will have a baseline study (control) in which the subject will receive a single dose of methadone and tizanidine with blood samples taken every hour for the first 8 hours and multiple blood samples until 72 hours after administration of the drugs.

After a 2 week washout period, subjects will be treated daily for 16 days with efavirenz and will return for a second inpatient stay to receive a second single dose of methadone and tizanidine. Blood samples will be collected at 24 and 48 hours after administration of the drugs, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tizanidine and methadone will be determined. Blood samples collected at baseline (control) and during treatment with efavirenz for 16 days will be available for pharmacokinetic studies on CYP2B6-metabolized drugs, and pharmacodynamics data on tizanidine will be used to assess the functional consequences of the change in these concentrations.

Subjects will be randomized to specific order of receiving methadone alone or methadone and efavirenz treatments for the entry and follow-up inpatient studies. In addition, subjects will be randomized to treatment with efavirenz (or not) for the first 16 days. The order of treatment administration will depend on the study period and the specific protocol for each subject."

The purpose of this study was to measure the serum magnesium level in adult patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.
In total, 65 adult patients with newly diagnosed type 2 DM (cases), and 65 age and sex matched healthy individuals (controls) were subjected. 
Serum magnesium level of type 2 diabetes mellitus cases, and healthy control subjects were determined by a commercial kit using automated chemistry analyzer.
Serum Mg level in type 2 diabetes cases significantly decreases as compared to healthy control subjects with a mean of 85.15 mg/dl and 96.58 mg/dl respectively (p=0.032).
The serum Mg level is not only decreased in type 2 diabetes but also decreased according to HbA1c.
HbA1c levels were 8.97 and 9.53 percent in patients having serum magnesium level equal to or less than 82 mg/dl and 83.94 and 90.70 percent in groups having serum magnesium level higher than 82 mg/dl.
Magnesium supplement was prescribed in the form of Magnesium oxide 400 mg orally twice daily till total duration of 3 months.
The mean of Mg level in patients after 1 and 3 months treatment was 94.17mg/dl and 100.09 mg/dl respectively.
The conclusion of our study emphasized the fact that serum Mg level is low in type 2 DM patients, and it is related to glycaemic control as well.
These studies suggest that magnesium supplementation could improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic subjects as well as lowering the cardiovascular risk in high cardiovascular risk patients.
Our results suggest that serum magnesium level be examined as a possible marker for screening purposes for cardiovascular risk in DM patients.

Malnutrition is a global health issue with negative consequences on quality of life, health, well-being, and survival. A population-based study conducted in the United States indicated that 45% of older adults 60 and older are at risk for malnutrition with rates of malnutrition at 20-47% depending on the risk level used. Malnutrition in older adults has a myriad of consequences, including decreased muscle mass, decreased physical function, delayed recovery from illness, and increased mortality. With aging of our society, it is imperative that innovative solutions to improve malnutrition care delivery be developed and tested in real-world settings, using models of care that are easily and quickly scalable to reduce these consequences and improve health outcomes for those affected.
The goal of this new model is to improve food security and quality of life in persons older than 60 years of age discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of malnutrition. The study aims to test the feasibility of a patient identification, cross-referral, data reporting, and communication (including data transfer) process from an acute care hospital to a community meal provision organization. Additionally, the study will increase the rate of patients older than 60 years of age with malnutrition receiving care (MNT, MTM) in the community setting by utilizing an MNT care plan developed by an RDN in the hospital. Malnutrition diagnosis will be confirmed by an independent, trained RDN in the community setting.
The study will conduct a cluster-randomized trial with eight sites throughout the United States, specifically recruiting sites with individuals who are Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Native Americans, individuals living in rural areas, and individuals who are food insecure and have low income. These sites will be paired with community meal providers funded through Title III-C1 and C2 funding. Two RDNs per site will participate in the pilot and feasibility study, which will last 18 to 24 months. The investigators will test the new model of malnutrition care delivery and examine the impact of malnutrition management, nutrition care, and meals in the community setting. The study will utilize a stepped wedge cluster-randomized control trial design and have a 7-month study duration consisting of four consecutive 7-month phases. Each phase will randomize two additional sites (8 sites total) to the intervention/treatment. The intervention/treatment will be the new referral and nutrition care and meal delivery model. The new model will be implemented over 5 periods, with each period lasting for 7 months with 21 days of data review at the end of each period. The goal of the study is to enroll a total of 1120 patients, thus allowing for a statistical power of 0.8 to detect a 20 percentage point change. The study outcome will be the percent of patients receiving nutrition care and meals (medical nutrition therapy - MNT, and meals - MTM)."

Reduction Mammaplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in Plastic Surgery. Adolescent patients undergoing this operation have unique pain management challenges due to the length of their procedures and recovery time. They are also more likely to experience chronic pain if their surgical post-operative pain is not well managed. This study focuses on the use of subpectoral bupivacaine in decreasing post-operative pain in adolescent reduction mammaplasty. We will also evaluate the dose and time frame of the intervention.

A randomized, comparative trial will be utilized, with the participant group/arm and intervention/treatment being as follows:

1.) Participants in the active intervention group will receive 20cc of subpectoral bupivacaine injected into the fascia following the removal of breast tissue.

2.) Participants in the placebo comparator group will receive 20cc of subpectoral saline injected into the fascia following the removal of breast tissue.

The primary endpoint for our study is immediate post-operative pain score on a scale of 1-10. This will be recorded by the PACU nurse upon arrival into the PACU and upon discharge from the PACU. Patients in both groups will be prescribed the same narcotic (Tylenol #3) and will fill out a daily pain log. Additionally, we will utilize chart review to record PACU pain scores from the immediate post-operative time period.

The use of bupivacaine in post-operative pain management in adult procedures has been shown to be effective and our study can help provide insights for pediatric patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty. By examining and comparing the outcomes of the two arms, we can determine if the use of subpectoral bupivacaine can further improve outcomes related to pain management in this population, ultimately addressing the opioid epidemic faced by all patients undergoing surgery."

Background: Ribonucleotide reactivation protein A (RPA) is the most abundantly expressed protein in eukaryotic cells. Among the proteins that bind RPA directly, DNA-PK is unique in that it is regulated on both the DNA and protein replication pathways in response to DNA damage. RPA interacts with a specific domain of DNA-PK called DNA-PKcs and is the cellular protein substrate on which DNA-PKcs is activated. DNA-PK activation is a highly conserved mechanism for controlling DNA damage in response to agents that cause DNA strand breaks including most topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) inhibitors, mitomycin C (MMC), platinum agents, mitotic spindle poison drugs or antimetabolite (chemotherapy) drugs. Recent data suggest that DNA-PKcs is a major target for cancer therapy due to increased activity in many tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) compared to normal tissues. LMS is a distinct histological subtype of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) that is almost exclusively associated with long segment mutations in the high mobility group box-containing gene (HMGB1) which encodes an architectural/structural chromatin-associated protein. Preclinical genetic and pharmacologic studies with DNA-PK inhibitors show that in HMGB1-mutant LMS and GBMs, inhibition of DNA-PK with NU7026, a potent and selective inhibitor of DNA-PKcs, induced DNA damage, apoptosis and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Patients with unselected STS (N=36) treated with the DNA-PKcs inhibitor M3814 (peposertib), an investigational drug that is different than NU7026, showed some signs of anti-tumor activity with less observed adverse events than NU7026 in other tumor types, suggesting the potential benefit/risk profile of this new class of inhibitors that can be further evaluated in specific subsets of STS. Objectives: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the combination of low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (DL) with peposertib (M3814) in patients with STS. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of peposertib when combined with low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The study will include two sequential cohorts: Cohort I = 2 to 6 patients with LMS or selected STS treated with peposertib (M3814) and low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Treatment will start with a single dose of peposertib (M3814) on Day 1. A standard 3 + 3 accrual method and an MTD determination method with dose de-escalation will be used to determine the MTD of this combination, which will be the recommended phase II dose that will be used in a larger cohort of patients with LMS or selected STS in cohort II. Cohort II = 20 patients with LMS or selected STS treated with peposertib (M3814) and low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at the MTD from cohort I. In each patient, if appropriate, the biopsy will be performed before treatment is started and periodically at 1 month interval during study treatment. Optional biopsies can be obtained at 1 month interval during study treatment. At study entry, each patient will undergo a comprehensive assessment through medical history, physical exam, laboratory values, chest X-ray and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Additional imaging studies may be performed depending on patients' symptoms and any abnormal results found during this initial assessment. Patients will be followed until progressive disease is seen or there is an unacceptable level of toxicity. Patients will be also asked to sign a voluntary specimen bank form to allow their stored specimens to be used for future research studies. The overall design of this study enables patients with different subtypes of STS to be treated with a combination of low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib (M3814). Patients in cohort I will be enrolled as the first group of patients who may or may not benefit from this combination therapy"

Introduction:
Back pain affects 55 to 60 million Americans every year. Approximately 50% of Americans will experience low back pain in their lives. One study in New York state showed that people with low back pain report about 25% less physical activity on average. A sedentary lifestyle is strongly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Physical activity is safe and can be considered a 'drug' with few side effects. The American College of Physicians guidelines recommend non-pharmacological treatments for treating chronic low back pain. Exercise has been shown to be one of the best strategies for reducing back pain. T'ai chi is one of the simplest and most gentle of all exercise activities and has been shown to be effective in improving low back pain symptoms. It is also effective in reducing symptoms of insomnia. Aims of the study: The aim of this pilot project is to examine the impact (if any) of a 12-week t'ai chi and qigong online exercise program on chronic low back pain and co-morbidities including sleep disturbances and quality of life. Our study offers a free online class taught by a master t'ai chi practitioner. The PI, who is an interventional research fellow at NYMC, has experience using the MindBody Online Program (MBO). The MBO platform allows for classes to be accessed remotely by individuals anywhere in the NYMC service area. Methodology: This study will be conducted in the community to allow easy and convenient access to participants. Participants will be recruited online using NYMC social media platforms and flyers. Interested subjects will complete an initial Survey, then be randomly assigned to either the free t'ai chi and qigong online exercise class held twice weekly or a waitlisted control. Participants who were waitlisted (and who were not injured and could no longer complete the course) received the classes in January 2023 to allow for a cross-over. The study will be a prospective, single-centered, single-blind, parallel design, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Consent for participation in the t'ai chi and qigong exercise (treatment) group and completion of Surveys will be included in the Survey. Participants who were waitlisted received the classes offered on a rolling basis throughout the study. The study will use a pre-post design to track changes within the groups (e.g., Treatment vs. control groups). The PI and the study assistants will remain blinded to the subject assignment, which will be contained on a database protected by a password. The data will be stored on an encrypted, password-protected laptop in a secure space. Data will be transferred by the PI from the laptop to his NYMC-issued computer via a secure portal, then to the project computer. The study will be conducted over a 6-month period using the MindBody Online Platform.

The study will include two groups. Group A will consist of individuals who enrolled in the free online Zoom t'ai chi and qigong exercise program after September 23, 2022 and will be tracked for 3 months after enrollment..

The EMBOL-AF is a multicenter, international, observational study designed as a retrospective re­gistry that will investigate the characteristics of systemic arterial embolic events after treatment of atrial fibrillation by catheter ablation. The registry will gather all clinically relevant data of all cases of arterial embolism that have occurred over the last 5 years in the centers that will participate in the study. Based on these reported cases, the incidence, management and sequelae of embolic events (particularly st­roke and TIA) will be studied. The registry is specially focused on cerebral embolism.
A retrospective survey on the current practices of catheter ablation for AF in the period 1st january 2017 and 31st july 2023 will be performed. The data obtained from this survey will allow to classify centers in tertiles of high, moderate, and low risk.
Each participating center will be requested to provide anonymized data on the total number of patients treated with catheter ablation for AF during the retrospective period, and the number of patients with arterial embolism after ablation, as well as relevant patient characteristics, the details of AF ablation procedure and the consequences of embolic events.
Each participating center will provide data for specific cases following a uniform DCL (data collection logbook). Only the local investigator will be permitted to access the database using a personalized access code. The data collection will follow a standardized and uniform DCL. The DCL has been designed and it is under direct supervision and monitoring by the members of the Executive Committee of EMBOL-AF.
A database will be set up to store information from all participating centers. Confidentiality of data is guaranteed by legal enforcement.
The EMBOL-AF registry is coordinated by the University Hospital of Tor Vergata (Rome, Italy). International collaboration is encouraged. The Executive Committee of the study is being composed by experienced electrophysiologists and researchers in embolic events. This Committee is supported by a steering committee that also includes representatives of the main international scientific societies, such as European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), American College of Cardiology (ACC), Latin American Heart Rhythm Association (LAHRA) and Spanish Society of Cardiology (SEC).
The expected results of this study will be the following: 
1. To describe the incidence, management and sequelae of arterial embolism, especially stoke and TIA associated to catheter ablation for AF.
2. To study the acute clinical profile, symptoms, signs and results of brain image techniques of these events.
3. To study the acute therapeutic management of these events.
4. To study the sequelae and clinical consequences at 3 months of follow-up.
5. To study whether the severity of stroke/TIA is associated to any specific ablation techniques.
6. To study other procedure-related aspects as predictors of stroke/TIA.
The EMBOL-AF International Registry is expected to start during the fourth quarter of the year 2023. The maximum time for data collection will be 6 months. The maximum time for data monitoring will be 6 months."

The objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of using low-intensity electrical acceleration (ELF-EMF) to accelerate the retraction of anterior teeth using backward traction. The null hypothesis to be tested is that the patients who will undergo the enhanced pulling using the electrical acceleration will perceive no differences in the level of pain, discomfort, and acceptability of the treatment. The alternative hypothesis is that there will be a significant difference between patients subjected to traditional en-masse retraction and those subjected to enhanced pulling using electrical acceleration. To test it, both patients will complete the same questionnaires about pain, discomfort, and acceptability of the procedure before and after the treatment, in addition to other questionnaires about pain intensity and the burning sensation. The sample size will be divided into two subgroups; one will be treated using traditional retraction and the other group will use low intensity electrical acceleration. The data analyzes will use chi-square, Fisher, t-test, and correlational analysis to evaluate the statistical significance. The study will be carried out in accordance with the Statement of Helsinki adopted for the protection of experimental subjects to prevent any damage to human health. Two hundred and eighty-eight patients will be treated, and 282 patients will complete the study. The data collection forms will be distributed among patients at the four-dimensional level (dental, soft tissue alterations, functional changes, and psychological effects) following the retraction of upper anterior teeth, using three instruments: visual analog scale (VAS) and Dental Impaction Questionnaire (DIQ-R) and the short form Health Survey.

Patients who receive ADT are at higher risk for developing AD. AD is linked to cognitive impairment in other disorders, such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Cognitive tests that measure abilities like memory and attention are used to determine whether patients with dementia or cognitive impairments are experiencing memory loss. AD has four stages: no cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild dementia, and severe dementia. The number of people suffering from memory loss is rising as the population ages and life expectancies increase. Prostate cancer patients starting hormone therapy are at higher risk for developing cognitive impairments.

This is a single-site, non-randomized prospective observational study of men with prostate cancer. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To evaluate whether baseline plasma Amyloid-beta 42/40 ratio is associated with cognitive decline in men upon starting ADT. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: I. To evaluate whether ADT is associated with a decline in plasma Aβ42/40 ratio. II. To evaluate whether intensified ADT (iADT) receipt is associated with greater cognitive decline compared to ADT.

Inclusion Criteria: Patient Participants- Age 18 years or greater. Fluent in reading, listening to, and writing English. Current or prior diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma based on a pathology report or as documented in a medical oncology, urology, or radiation oncology note. Access and ability to use a computer or mobile device with Internet connectivity to complete study procedures. Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA) of 16 or greater. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 (documented within past 3 months, otherwise patient-reported). Study partner participants- Age 18 years or greater Fluent in reading, listening to, and writing English Identified by patient participant as a person who knows patient participant well, like a friend, family member or spouse. Access and ability to use a computer or mobile device with internet connectivity to complete study procedures. Only the ADT cohort- Anticipated to start ADT, which includes one of the following two treatments Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (e.g., leuprolide, goserelin, and others). GnRH antagonist (i.e., degarelix or relugolix). Anticipated to remain on ADT for at least 12 months. Concurrent first-generation anti-androgens (e.g., bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide) and novel androgen-signaling inhibitors (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide, and apalutamide) are allowed. Concurrent radiation is allowed. Only the PC cohort- Has completed definitive local therapy (radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy) for localized prostate cancer at least 6 months prior to screening. For radical prostatectomy: undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) within 12 months of screening. For radiation therapy: last PSA of < 2.0 within 12 months of screening. Exclusion Criteria: Patient Participants- Small cell prostate carcinoma (pure or mixed). Receipt of ADT (GnRH agonist, GnRH antagonist, 1st-generation anti-androgen, or novel androgen signaling inhibitor) within 6 months before screening.

The effect of puzzles on the ability of first-year nursing students to learn vital signs is examined. Firstly, a questionnaire will be designed by the researcher, to be filled in by students at the beginning of the study, and an experimental group will be formed in such a way as to meet the inclusion criteria. First-year student volunteers who take a course on vital signs for the first time and meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the experimental group. 11 first-year nursing students will be included in the experimental group.
The education method will be applied by providing puzzles to students for two weeks, and the students' course successes will be examined after the puzzle application is over. It will be observed whether the students who were successful in learning the conceptual structure of vital signs were effective in reducing the number of failures they received.
The sample consists of first-year nursing students of Bilecik city, who take a course on vital signs for the first time and meet the inclusion criteria. The education will be carried out as the student course continues. The data in the survey will be collected by the researcher.
The data will be analyzed by SPSS 23.0 software package. In the statistical analysis of the data, descriptive statistics analysis will be used, and then Mann-Whitney U tests will be used for independent sample or Spearman's rho correlation test for independent samples. The study was carried out with a randomized experimental group for all subjects.
The study, which was planned with the students of Bilecik Şeyh Edebali University Nursing Department students, was conducted in 11 students. After the application was completed, it was planned to measure the knowledge of the students, and the results were examined statistically. With the implementation of puzzles in the teaching of the vital signs course, it was found that the successes of the students in the application group were higher than the control group. It can be suggested that both the active structure of the puzzles and the students' motivation to learn can be effective in increasing students' course successes. It should be noted that, in addition to using active learning in vital signs education, using other active learning tools or puzzles in nursing education can positively affect learning processes."

Facial erythematous rosacea, as well as mild papulopustular rosacea, are common clinical presentations of rosacea. Both conditions are mainly treated either with topical corticosteroids or systemic tetracyclines. However, the treatment of facial erythematous rosacea with systemic tetracyclines, such as doxycycline and minocycline, can lead to resistance to the drug in a sizable number of patients within one year. Ivermectin is a drug of a different chemical class with a different treatment mechanism, which allows to use it as a rescue therapy in case of tetracycline resistance. Although topical ivermectin has recently been suggested to have an anti-inflammatory effect via the inhibition of the inflammasome, no clinical experience is available so far regarding a combined treatment of rosacea with ivermectin and laser therapy, particularly in cases of refractory erythematous rosacea. Therefore, laser therapy may be an additional effective treatment option for rosacea, possibly reducing the long-term systemic use of tetracyclines or other drugs, associated with low compliance or drug resistance. This study will compare the efficacy of KTP laser therapy and the combination of KTP laser and ivermectin 1% cream topically to the skin on the same patient for the treatment of rosacea."

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition which predominately affects the lungs, pancreas and digestive system. The most common cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is respiratory failure due to chronic lung infection and inflammation. CF affects all age groups and is seen from birth to adulthood. 2017/18 saw the emergence of an infectious disease, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by a novel RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2. Early in 2019, COVID-19 spread from the Wuhan region of China to other parts of the world, but from the spring of 2020 in the United Kingdom, the NHS was overwhelmed by COVID-19 resulting in a number of social and economic challenges. COVID-19 disproportionately impacts pwCF. In Italy, there was an estimated 15-20% mortality rate among hospitalised pwCF with COVID-19 with severe respiratory failure. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus which relies on the host's immune system to replicate. Serum antibodies (natural or induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination) against SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to have a correlation with severity of COVID-19 disease and with response to vaccination. The development of antibodies in pwCF is particularly important because the lungs are a target for CF complications, including bacterial infection. There is speculation amongst pwCF and healthcare providers that pwCF have lower levels of antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection and might respond less well to vaccination due to this underlying condition. However, no studies have directly compared natural infection-induced immune response to vaccination-induced immune response in pwCF. These studies will be critical to informing pwCF and their healthcare providers about the level of protection each method provides and to inform the design of CF-specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. To date, there are no studies in the UK that have looked at the antibody responses between natural infection and vaccination, and how this varies over time in pwCF. It is possible that antibody levels from infection and from vaccination will differ between pwCF and the wider population. Understanding the antibody responses will allow healthcare providers to counsel pwCF regarding the level of protection against COVID-19 that they may expect from natural infection and vaccination. This will help to inform vaccination strategies tailored to the needs of pwCF, in particular younger pwCF or those with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for infection and severe disease. The results of this study will help to define the immune response of pwCF to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, and inform future care. Moreover, our study data will help identify important markers of immune dysregulation that can have important clinical implications for pwCF in the future. The investigators aim to create a platform for other researchers to study the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to develop targeted therapies and vaccines. 1. To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pwCF aged < 18 months to 50 years old in the UK over time.
2. To examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms in pwCF.
3. To determine the factors that influence the severity of COVID-19 in people with CF.
4. To understand the pattern of antibody detection after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and after vaccination in pwCF and how this varies between different CF populations (age, genotype, geographical area and time).
5. To identify baseline levels of cytokines, chemokines and immune cells in pwCF and investigate whether they correlate with SARS-CoV-2 infections or vaccination-induced immunity.
6. To identify baseline levels of serum proteomics and cfDNA among pwCF and investigate whether they correlate with SARS-CoV-2 infections or vaccination-induced immunity.
This study will be conducted at participating CF centers over a 3-year period. Study participants will include pediatric and adult pwCF. For the UK section of the study, UK investigators in the European Cystic Fibrosis Society-Clinical Trials Network (ECFS-CTN) will be"

Background: May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is the compression of the left common iliac vein (CIV) at the vena cava confluence, which may result from a narrow right common iliac artery (CIA) in the pelvis. The syndrome can cause symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg. There is no widely accepted guideline for MTS treatment. Diagnosing MTS can be challenging but is necessary to consider endovascular management. Duplex ultrasound is the primary modality used to non-invasively evaluate venous compression and diameter of the left CIV when assessing for MTS. The operator of ultrasound scans and the sonographer acquiring the image are not always the same. The effect of inter- and intra-operator variation of the diameter measurement is unknown. Materials and Methods: All the patients who are referred to Hull Royal Infirmary vascular ultrasound service will be invited to a vascular ultrasound examination. In total, two scans of the left CIV (diameter measurement) will be done. The operator of ultrasound scan will scan one (only operator) and a second sonographer will scan the other (operator with sonographer). The operators will perform the scans separately in real-time. The diameter measurement of the left CIV will be made by both operators at each ultrasound scan. Data Collection: The first operator will complete a case report form (CRF). This includes patient demographics, clinical presentations, the results of diagnostic investigations and the results of ultrasound. The second operator will complete the same CRF after scanning. Data Analysis: All the collected CRFs will be entered into the study's electronic database, and the diameter measurement of the left CIV (mm) will be recorded. The inter- and intra-operator variation of the diameter measurements will be examined by a correlation coefficient (Pearson correlation). Data and Results: The diameter measurement of the left CIV (in mm) of all the patients will be collected and entered into the study database. The correlation coefficients between diameter measurements of the first operator and second operator ultrasound scans for the left CIV will be determined. Statistical Analysis: The data will be entered into a database, checked and validated. The data will be entered into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA; http://www.IBM.com/software/analytics/spss/) for data analysis. The inter- or intra-operator variation between diameter measurements of the left CIV will be assessed using a correlation coefficient (Pearson correlation). The level of significance (P) will be set as <0.05. The analysis of the correlation coefficient will be done by the second operator, who will be blinded to all patient characteristics."

Background: Sentinel node mapping is an important technique in vulvar and vaginal cancers. The study is a randomized trial that determines whether new technology to find the lymph nodes during surgery (which uses a special hand-held camera and a dye called Indocyanine Green) is as good as the current technology (which uses a dye called blue dye and a radioactive tracer called radiocolloid). This study is being done to see if there are any differences in finding the lymph nodes between the two dyes. 
Inclusion criteria: Patients with early-stage SCC (diameter <4 cm) of the vulva without suspicious lymph nodes at palpation or imaging who are planned for surgery at Tufts Medical Center.
Exclusion criteria: Inoperable tumors and tumors with diameter > 4 cm.

Background: Currently, the most recommended NMES protocol for evoking torque is the Russian Current with 10% duty cycle. Studies suggest that the Russian Current may be more effective in this context because it produces greater motor recruitment due to a higher affinity between high-frequency stimulation and the properties of motor units. Objectives: The effectiveness of this protocol should be compared to other high frequency and low frequency currents, as well as to the effects of fatigue induced by high frequency stimulation on neuromuscular behavior. Based on the above, the hypothesis is that the Russian Current (10% duty cycle) would present more effectiveness compared to the Aussie Current (10% duty cycle) and pulsed currents (500µs and 200µs phase), as well as produce a lower fatigue level. A better neuromuscular activation for a longer time of stimulation, generating higher torque evoked and a higher intracellular muscle perfusion. Methods: This is a crossover, experimental, randomized, double-blind trial composed of apparently healthy participants. The effects of high and low frequency NMES protocols applied to the triceps surae muscle for evoked torque, muscle fatigue, sensory discomfort, and peripheral oxygen extraction will be evaluated in the same participant by randomizing the sequences of interventions for each visit in the laboratory. The study is considered double-blind, as individuals will not know the sequence of the protocols applied. The evaluator will also not know which protocol will be used at the time of the intervention. It will consist of a total of 5 sessions with seven days between them. In the first session, anthropometry, the maximum intensity level for each electrical stimulation protocol as well as the protocol sequence for each individual will be evaluated. From the second to the fifth session, the following will be considered: voluntary and evoked maximum joint torque of the triceps surae muscle, muscle fatigue through the evaluation of the H-reflex, M-wave, fatigue index, torque-time-integral and recruitment curve, peripheral oxygen extraction, electromyographic signals through RMS (root mean square) and median frequency, and level of sensory discomfort with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). From the second to the fifth session will be composed by the following evaluation sequence: warm-up with six submaximal contractions with 6 seconds of duration and 10 seconds of rest between them; then the assessment of muscle fatigue; then two maximal isometric contractions, then two maximal evoked contractions; fatigue protocol at 20% of the maximum isometric contraction (this fatigue protocol will use the NMES sequence randomized in the first session; after the fatigue protocol, two maximum evoked contractions will be performed again; then two maximal isometric contractions and at the end, the muscle fatigue evaluation will be performed again. The NMES protocols will be CR10% (Russian Current at 2500 Hz, modulated in 50 Hz bursts, 200 µs and 10% duty cycle - 2 ms of 18 ms bursts and interbusrts), CA10% (Aussie Current with 1000 Hz, modulated in 50 Hz bursts, 500 µs and 10% duty cycle - 2 ms of 18 ms bursts and interbusrts), CP500 (pulsed current with 50 Hz, 500 µs phase) and CP200 (Pulsed current with 50 Hz, 200 µs phase). All protocols will be performed on the triceps surae muscle.

The overall objective of this study is to investigate the acute and chronic effects of a 4-week supplementation with a lactate and ketone body ester (Lactate-ketone ester; LaKe) in healthy subjects at risk for metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). During four weeks intervention, we aim to investigate 1) if LaKe can induce a beneficial effect in insulin sensitivity in high-risk populations, 2) if the treatment can alter substrate utilization and gastric function and 3) if LaKe has a favourable effect on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health. Healthy middle-aged and older adults with a BMI of 30-39.9 kg/m2 and age >30 years will be included. The hypothesis is that one month supplementation with an intravenous lactate-ketone body ester will improve insulin sensitivity, substrate utilization, and health biomarkers.
In total, n=28 (17 women) will be included and randomized to start with the intervention supplemented with LaKe ester or a non-caloric placebo (n=14 in each group), for four weeks, respectively, followed by four week wash-out periods and a subsequent cross-over to the opposite supplementation regime after which all participants enter a 4-week post-supplementation period; the exact order of the two supplementations is randomized. All study days include oral-glucose-tolerance-test (o-GTT) (day 0), a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic-glucose infusion-clamp (M-clamp, day 5), and a 3-hour meal test (day 6), along with cardiac assessments and collection of blood for analyses of glucose-, hormones and metabolic markers. Additionally, in a subsample (n=8), we will determine the effects of the LaKe-supplementation on gastric function by analyzing gastric emptying, cardiac output and gastric biomarkers through blood, urine and stool samples. Finally, we will also collect blood to determine blood lipids and cardiometabolic hormones as well as inflammation markers. This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The results will be crucial for the development of new treatment options and dietary recommendations for people who struggle with a poor diet and/or low physical activity. The investigators hope to contribute with new knowledge that may prove beneficial in the fight against obesity, insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes."

The development of a non-invasive and sensitive diagnostic tool that is efficient in differentiating between colonization and IPA and is accessible to a wide range of physicians and settings, may greatly benefit the field of acute pulmonary aspergillosis management and decrease the morbidity and mortality of immunocompromised patients while eliminating the need for an invasive procedure. This prospective study seeks to identify exhaled biomarker patterns that clearly differentiate between patients with IPA and other patients with relevant radiological findings. Ultimately, this objective can best be reached by a comprehensive VOC-oriented approach and, therefore, our cohort will include a wide spectrum of hematological/transplantation patients presenting with relevant radiological findings."

The aim of the study is to evaluate postoperative pain and respiratory function following thoracic paravertebral block application with three different local anesthetic volumes.

Local anesthetic thoracic paravertebral block provides excellent postoperative analgesia in thoracotomy. There are no consensus-based protocols for performing thoracic paravertebral block. In particular, there are no studies comparing postoperative analgesia and patient suitability outcomes in thoracotomy given the same technique using different local anesthetic volumes."

Many of the most serious medical conditions cause fatigue. Fatigue, which is a common symptom, occurs throughout the day and is increased with activity. The purpose of this study is to determine whether muscle vibrations reduce fatigue. Muscle vibration is an active type of stretching that is applied for short periods of time to an individual's muscles. The investigators are comparing muscle vibrations with usual care to see if vibration reduces fatigue.
This study is a phase 2 interventional pilot study. Patients 18 years old or older with MS with fatigue will be recruited through advertisement and referrals from MDs in the outpatient neurosciences clinic. After participants sign an informed consent form, they will be screened with a medical history, neurological exam, and a clinical laboratory test (complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, thyroid study). They will complete questionnaires about their fatigue, mood/emotions/depression, and quality of life. The medical history, neurological exam, and questionnaires will be repeated at the end of the 3-month intervention.

Participants will receive usual care for an initial 3-week period before beginning the intervention. This will help isolate the effect of vibration on fatigue. Each participant will attend 10 training sessions per week over 4 weeks. Sessions last about 90 minutes each. Patients will receive usual care for an additional 3-week period. Participants then will attend 5 training sessions per week over 4 weeks. Session last about 90 minutes each.
The questionnaire takes about 20-40 minutes to complete. Before and after each training session, participants will have muscle and balance function tests. These tests take about 1-2 hours to complete. Patients are paid for their time completing the study. The research team will monitor for any complications or side effects. After the study is completed, participants are given a choice of having their medical charts and study questionnaires either emailed to them or given to them in hard copy.

Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are approved as first-line treatment for patients with mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in NSCLC. The most common mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs is the development of a second EGFR mutation, called the T790M mutation. Some patients may harbor multiple EGFR mutations, including those that confer resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Resistance to EGFR-TKIs may be due to alterations in other genes, such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is encoded by the ERBB2 gene. These factors have been associated with decreased response to EGFR-TKIs and poor clinical outcomes in patients with lung cancer.
A Phase I, single-arm, multicentric study (NCT00570481) is currently underway to determine the recommended Phase I dose (RP2D)/maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tucatinib (OSI-774), a HER2-directed, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with osimertinib and cetuximab (ERBITUX®), an EGFR inhibitor that acts primarily by binding to the extracellular domain of the EGFR receptor. The Phase I portion of this study will enroll a dose-escalation cohort and a dose-expansion cohort. In the expansion cohort, all patients with NSCLC must have: 1) progression on first generation EGFR TKI therapy or progression on osimertinib, and 2) evidence of HER2 alteration (by immunohistochemistry [IHC] and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH], and/or next generation sequencing [NGS] for HER2 mutation). The goal is to learn the safety profile of the combination therapy and to recommend the next phase of clinical development. The trial consists of two consecutive parts.
Part A (dose-escalation cohort) will determine the RP2D/MTD of tucatinib in combination with osimertinib and cetuximab. The dose-escalation phase of the trial will include a minimum of 6 patients per cohort and a total of about 12 escalation cohorts. The dose will be escalated in a 3+3 design until the MTD is reached or a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs. Part B (dose-expansion cohort) will confirm the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of tucatinib as a tucatinib and osimertinib combination therapy, and to further explore the anti-tumor activity of the combination therapy in patients with HER2-associated resistance to EGFR TKIs."

Patients after lung transplantation are frequently complicated with lung transplantation rejection. Transbronchial biopsy is one of the most necessary and important methods to diagnose lung transplantation rejection. Traditional transbronchial biopsy mainly relies on tissue biopsy samples obtained through biopsy forceps. Since the acquisition process of traditional transbronchial biopsy is laborious and has a certain level of safety concerns and sampling errors, researchers of University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital proposed the transbronchial cryobiopsy, which can rapidly and safely obtain more and accurate lung tissue samples. This study aims to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of transbronchial cryobiopsy for lung transplantation rejection, and compare with that of traditional transbronchial lung biopsy."

Individuals with substance use disorders have a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity, including depression and anxiety disorders. In clinical settings, substance use disorders are often diagnosed and treated separately from comorbid mood and anxiety disorders despite the documented presence and clinical relevance of psychiatric comorbidity. However, there are potential risks of treating psychiatric conditions as separate entities versus in the context of substance use disorders. There is a need to evaluate whether treatment should focus on psychiatric conditions versus targeting substance use as a means of targeting psychiatric symptoms. This study aims to provide a better understanding of the relationship between substance use disorders, substance use treatment, psychiatric symptoms, and treatment outcomes. Participants with AUD and CUD will be screened and treated under existing Integrated Care Pathways for AUD and CUD at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). Participants will complete baseline assessments of substance use, psychiatric symptoms, psychiatric history, and neurocognitive function with the PI to assess eligibility for participation in the study. Of the eligible individuals, 60 participants presenting to the AUD program will consist of a treatment-seeking sub-group with a current DSM-5 diagnosis of primary AUD (AUD group). Participants in this arm are currently being treated for AUD in an existing integrated care pathway, but are also being offered CBT for AUD. 60 participants presenting to the CUD program will be screened and those with AUD (i.e., a diagnostic history of AUD in addition to CUD) will be re-screened for CUD. A subset of each of these 2 groups (n=18) will undergo more extensive neuroimaging scans to further examine functional brain changes among the 2 disorders. The investigators estimate a 20% AUD prevalence in individuals with CUD (and therefore a 33% risk of being eligible for inclusion in both the AUD and CUD pathways). If the prevalence is higher, they may include a larger number of participants than originally anticipated (e.g. include up to 36 individuals with the AUD diagnosis). Participants in this arm are current participants in an existing integrated care pathway for CUD but are also being offered CBT for CUD. To summarize, the investigators will recruit and assess 180 participants with AUD and 37 participants with CUD. Both diagnostic groups will be followed with data collection at specific points during standard care treatment for their primary substance use disorder."

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a musculoskeletal disorder that is a major cause of disability worldwide. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, it is the leading cause of years lived with disability (YLDs) worldwide, and it was estimated that 11.9% of all disability worldwide and 72.9% of low back pain morbidity were associated with CLBP. In addition, CLBP is associated with direct and indirect costs, with annual estimated costs worldwide of $103 billion.
Treatment options for CLBP include medication, exercise, education, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and SMT. Studies of SMT for CLBP have been limited by the use of short-term follow-up (maximum of 13 weeks) and a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of change associated with the treatment. Given the high financial cost of SMT and the unclear effectiveness of this intervention there is a need to improve the effectiveness of SMT as a treatment for CLBP, which is why studies are conducted to identify factors that can contribute to a better effectiveness of this intervention. In addition, investigating these factors can provide information on the effectiveness of SMT treatment for patients, especially those with CLBP.
However, previous studies have not investigated the impact of positive, neutral, and negative expectation speech on pain intensity, disability, and expectations related to SMT in CLBP patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of videos with different expectations regarding SMT, as delivered through positive, neutral, or negative expectation speech content, on pain intensity, perceived disability, expectations related to spinal manipulative therapy (SMT), and perceived qualities of the therapeutic encounter in CLBP patients. It is anticipated that the group submitted to a positive expectation speech about SMT will have lower pain scores, greater perceived improvement and higher expectations regarding SMT than the other groups."

The dorsal and ventral striatum, also known as the nucleus accumbens (NAC), are part of a reward network, a set of brain regions that play an important role in regulating reward- and pleasure seeking. This network is implicated in addiction, gambling, and other disorders related to reward. The activity of the NAC is influenced by the frontal cortex and is linked to both pleasure and pain in the brain. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a developing technology for non-invasively stimulating deep brain regions. Studies have suggested tFUS to be a promising tool for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders, however, as with other brain stimulation techniques, there is not enough knowledge about its safety and effect on the brain. The investigators aim to understand how tFUS applied at the level of the ventral striatum influences the functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and the rest of the brain."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in China, but its incidence rate has been increasing in recent years. The risk of CRC increases exponentially after 50 years of age. Therefore, CRC screening is suggested to individuals older than 50 years old. However, more and more CRC cases occur in people younger than 50 years old, so it is possible that some individuals younger than 50 years old may have missed opportunities for cancer prevention. Since gastrointestinal diseases such as Helicobacter pylori, atrophic gastritis/intestinal metaplasia, reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and peptic ulcer have been proven to be risk factors for colorectal cancer, colonoscopy can detect colorectal adenomatous polyps, and gastroscopy is valuable for screening for upper gastrointestinal disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of upper gastrointestinal diseases in individuals younger than 50 years old by gastroscopy, to test the hypothesis that these upper gastrointestinal diseases may contribute to the missed opportunities of CRC screening in individuals younger than 50 years old, and to provide guidance for CRC screening in individuals younger than 50 years old.
Inclusion criteria: Patients younger than 50 years old who underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy simultaneously, including patients with normal colonoscopy examination and patients with colorectal polyps diagnosed by colonoscopy (both serrated and non-serrated polyps were analyzed separately).
Exclusion criteria: Patients without a satisfactory bowel preparation (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, BBPS score ≥ 6); incomplete gastroscopy or colonoscopy examinations; partial or total gastrointestinal resection; patients who have been diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer before endoscopy; patients with hereditary polyposis, including Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and patients with familial adenomatous polyposis; a history of inflammatory bowel diseases.
A total of 1114 gastroscopy-colonoscopy cases (1178 patients) were reviewed. The prevalence/occurrence of upper gastrointestinal diseases in individuals younger than 50 years old was 10.2%. For the upper gastrointestinal diseases (except for H. pylori, intestinal metaplasia, reflux esophagitis, and peptic ulcer), the prevalence / occurrence were 2.6% (2.2% without intestinal metaplasia) for esophagitis (non-ulcer), 2.3% for Barrett's esophagus, and 0.6% for gastric adenoma (0.12% for gastric serrated adenoma)."

Background: Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) has been widely used in place of Tuberculin skin testing as a means of detecting active tuberculosis (TB). The presence of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) producing T-cells is indicative of active disease. IGRA consists of two antigens, one which is active in patients with TB disease and one without activity in patients without the disease. Although IFN-gamma production against each antigen has been used in individual assays, the investigators believe that IGRA may provide better sensitivity and specificity when both antigens are used together. Objective: To evaluate an interferon gamma release assay containing both antigens in a single tube with both T and B cell-dependent responses. To determine if the antigen-specific IFN-gamma response changes between a patient taking TB treatment and subsequently when they are culture negative. Subjects: The investigational team will recruit consecutive cases of newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis. Setting: Plymouth County TB service, Southampton General Hospital, Basildon. Study Groups and Treatment: Healthy individuals (control) and those diagnosed with pulmonary TB (study cases). The investigators will perform an IGRA test in all cases at three time periods: at initiation of TB treatment, at the completion of 60 days therapy, and subsequently at 6 months after the completion of treatment. The investigators will then determine the change in IFN-gamma response between each time period. The investigators will assess the proportion of patients with a positive IFN-gamma response and whether this is related to the development of sputum culture conversion at 2 months and 6 months after initiation of TB therapy. Study Design: The study will consist of a single group assignment with all cases undergoing testing. After completion of the study, the investigators will report the outcomes with respect to the ability to change response profiles between study arms and to identify the relationship between culture conversion and changes in IFN-gamma responses. The investigators will compare patients who become sputum culture negative at day 60 of TB treatment with positive responders with those who have negative response at day 60.

The latency of evoked potentials (EPs) is an objective index of the processing of sensory information in the central nervous system. EPs are measurable electrical potentials in the EEG that are generated by afferent excitation of the central nervous system. In particular, the brain has a marked excitatory response to the activation of a subset of fibers that reach the central nervous system (nociceptors), which evokes EPs that are easily recorded through EEG. While nociceptive EPs have been extensively investigated, no systematic study on mechanical stimuli, such as stimulation with pinprick needles, or of high-frequency stimulation, such as radiofrequency (RF) stimulation, has been described. Thus, the purpose of this project is to carry out a systematic study of the effects of intense acute and prolonged mechanical stimuli and RF stimulation on evoked potentials in the brain. This study will allow to identify, based on different neurophysiological indexes, the differences and similarities between the electrical activation of different stimulus modalities, as well as their reproducibility in different individuals. Thus, the proposed protocol involves the evaluation of brain response to the following stimuli under controlled conditions: RF stimuli that are generated from the electrical stimulation of the dorsum of a foot (radiofrequency electrical stimulation, RFES); and pinprick stimuli, that are produced by an automated device consisting of two needles that penetrate the skin. The RFES consists of stimulation of large nerves (sensory nerves of the foot, median and ulnar nerves of the hand, or cervical nerves) with an electric current in a bipolar configuration that heats the surface of the skin. RF stimulation, like contact heat, evokes a clear and reproducible evoked potential in the brain. RF stimulation has the advantage that the stimulus intensity can be controlled through the power supply of the stimulator, thus allowing the investigation and evaluation of different thresholds of the stimulus. Pinprick stimuli consist of brief mechanical stimuli of the forearm and hand that cause a sensation of sharp pain in the subject. The intensity of this stimulus is also varied by adjusting the force and speed of the needle penetration. Unlike heat stimuli, mechanical stimuli are not painful at high intensity, since these stimuli do not evoke an irritant response in the central nervous system. The evaluation of the brain response to pinprick stimuli and the relationship of the parameters of the response to heat perception and sensation pain thresholds will allow to delimit the mechanisms by which the central nervous system generates the sensory experience of pain and touch.

These measurements will be carried out in healthy subjects and will be carried out in an experimental setting in the Laboratory of Biomedical Signal Processing-Laboratory of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Engineering, National University of Entre Ríos. It should be noted that the tests will not cause pain to the subject. Based on these tests, the response latency will be measured. For this purpose, a series of 10 stimuli will be applied at pain threshold intensity, with a single measurement per subject. After stimulation, a subjective evaluation of the sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli by the subject will be carried out, with a numerical scale of intensity of pain perception.

Study Objectives: We have previously identified a subgroup of trauma victims with mild TBI (MTBI) who have a characteristic finding of enhancement within the outermost layer of the brain's dural covering called the dura mater (meninges) on delayed post gadolinium enhanced MRI (TME). These individuals have been shown to have more complex clinical histories than age- and sex-matched trauma referents without MRI abnormality. MTE affects approximately 15% of MBI patients, and the clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain. The pathogenesis of TME is unknown, and a recent case-control study suggests that TME patients may have an increased risk of subsequent post-concussive problems. It is possible that biomechanical forces experienced by the brain as a result of its natural motion during walking or more common activities of daily living may be a precipitating factor for TME or subsequent post-concussive problems. This project will characterize the local differences in the brain's interaction with its surrounding skull in MTBI patients with and without MTE in order to understand if these biomechanical forces may be a contributing factor to MTE, or its clinical sequelae. We plan to use a technique called magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to non-invasively quantify the relative rigidity and motion characteristics of the brain and skull in MTBI patients.
Hypotheses: The following hypotheses will be tested: In a subgroup of MTBI patients who have MTE, there is increased local mechanical coupling of motion between brain and skull, as quantified using MRE. This may help explain increased risks of developing persistent brain symptoms in TME patients. Increased mechanical coupling of motion between brain and skull is associated with increased symptoms and impaired function at six month follow-up, as measured using standardized neurobehavioral tests. These findings will be compared to patients with MTBI but no TME.
Study Population: Sixty (60) adults will be recruited for this study, including 25 subjects with a history of mild TBI but no history of TMI, 25 subjects with a history of mild TBI and TMI (TME-positive), and 35 healthy controls.
Study Procedures: Subjects will complete standardized questionnaires regarding demographics, medical history, and prior head trauma injuries. If clinically indicated, they will also undergo a structured neurological exam to determine their medical suitability for MRI. All subjects will then complete standardized neurobehavioral tests to assess their current level of brain function, performed by blinded researchers on a separate day of MRI scanning.
During the MRE portion of the MRI visit, an external device called an MRE driver plate will be placed firmly against the front of the head. The driver plate is attached to the MRI table, which is then vibrated at a precisely controlled frequency. The MRE system uses the MRI scanner to measure the relative motion of brain and skull induced by the vibrations. These measurements can reveal how much the brain and skull move in relation to each other, as well as the timing of that motion in relation to the vibration frequency. In MTBI patients with MTE or controls, the MRE measurements will be used to quantify the local differences in the biomechanical coupling between brain and skull. In MTBI patients with MTE, these measurements will be correlated with clinical history and neurobehavioral test results to determine if differences in biomechanical coupling are associated with the risk for persistent symptoms after TBI.

High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major public health issue worldwide. Women are among those who may be at an increased risk of developing hypertension. Hypertension is a common and modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes including stroke, heart attack, kidney disease, heart failure and dementia. Despite evidence that optimal blood pressure (BP) control decreases the risk of these outcomes, many people with hypertension are not reaching their BP target levels. One approach that has shown promise in improving BP control is through the use and integration of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM). Patients who have hypertension can use a home blood pressure monitoring device to measure and record their blood pressure at home on a frequent basis and then input their measurements into an electronic database that is accessible to their community pharmacist. The patient's pharmacist can then review the readings and provide their own suggestions for therapy modification to the patient's prescribing clinician. In the absence of HBPM the patient may only have BP readings taken once every few weeks or only when they come into the pharmacy or doctor's office. This can result in suboptimal management and less therapeutic intervention. This pilot project aims to demonstrate the efficacy of combining HBPM and integrated pharmacist care. In addition, the study will explore barriers and facilitators for women using HBPM.
Pilot project hypothesis: Women patients utilizing HBPM and providing blood pressure readings to their community pharmacists who then provides tailored education to the patient and therapy recommendations to the patient's prescribing clinician will result in greater improvements in blood pressure control. In comparison to usual care.
To meet its aim the investigators anticipate recruiting 368 women from Ontario, Canada. In Ontario there are approximately 18 million people and 5000 community pharmacies with approximately 10,000 pharmacists. The investigators plan to implement this pilot project in 50 community pharmacies, aiming to recruit 7-10 women per pharmacy. The sample size of 368 participants will allow for 90% power and allow for a 10% drop-out in participants, thus providing a 23% margin of error."

Background: Aesthetic results after dental implant treatment are inseparable from the correct choice of the implant-prosthetic complex. For the achievement in the area of implant crowns, one of the necessary requirements is an adequate soft tissue around implants, which will create the basis for the creation of the correct implant-prosthetic construction. Soft tissue defects are one of the reasons for unsatisfactory aesthetic results. Methods: The aim of the study to compare two soft tissue augmentation methods around dental implants - the use of autogenous (connective tissue) graft and xenobionic (collagen matrix) graft. The investigators planned to conduct a prospective comparative study with one-group assignment and no masking using the patient population of the Department of Oral Implantology, Sechenov University. The investigators planned to include 40 patients in the study in whom inadequate soft tissues would be diagnosed as the reason for the failure of implant crowns. Inclusion criteria included age from 25 to 59 years, sufficient bone volume around a dental implant, and inadequate soft tissues thickness on the vestibular side (<3 mm). Exclusion criteria included patients with hard smoking (>10 cigarettes a day) who could not adhere to postoperative care, patients with medical complications, and patients who could not undergo the entire study protocol. The investigators planned to assess the severity of pain, assess the quality of life using Oral Health Impact Profile - 14 (OHIP-14), determine the amount of soft tissue thickness gain at 90 and 180 days compared to the 0th day (initial value), determine soft tissue aesthetics, determine the severity of collateral edema at 1,3,5,7,180,93 days compared to the 0th day (initial value). Data analysis: The investigators planned to use the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test for parametric data, as well as the Student's test for normative data at a significance level of 0.05.

The aim of this clinical trial is to improve outcomes in primary care patients with depression. Specifically the study seeks to test whether a precision-guided approach to optimal treatment, based on their personality characteristics, can enhance clinical and functional outcomes. It will test whether those who are optimally treated will be more likely to recover than those who are not. The study is using a well-established, widely used and evidence-based intervention - antidepressant medications along with a brief psychological treatment (known as Activation theory) - as treatment options for depression. By enrolling 360 patients in each group, the investigators aim to detect a 20% difference in recovery rates. Patients recruited to the study will be followed for 12 months and their recovery, functional status, disability, wellbeing and side effects will be tracked. In addition, the investigators will try and identify biomarkers and genetic predictors of recovery in primary care patients with depression. These findings will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of action of different treatments for depression, the role of the brain in regulating response to depression-specific treatments, and will provide insights into the development of a precision medicine approach to the treatment of depression."

Foot postural index varies from 0 in good posture to 14 in severe flatfoot. Subjects will be recruited based on the Foot postural index from the Taibah University Orthopaedic Outpatient Department from 1 January to 31 October 2020. One hundred and fifty subjects will be recruited. A sample size of 120 is sufficient to demonstrate a 10% difference in pain with a confidence of 95%, assuming a 20% dropout. Subjects with flexible flatfoot who have symptoms of foot and calve pain will be recruited for this study. They will be divided into groups of an equal number of people. Prefabricated insoles will be given to one group and 3D printed insoles to the other. Both groups will use these insoles for 4 weeks. Subjective feedback will be collected at week zero, when the subjects will be given the insoles to wear, and again at week 4. Statistical analysis will be used to determine whether or not there is a significant difference in the responses of the two groups. The results will help us in identifying which insoles are better than the other in terms of parameters described above."

Primary incisional hernia is a common complication of abdominal surgery, which is more common than many people think due to high recurrence rate. Pulmonary function is the only physiological function which has a definite difference between patients with primary and recurrent incisional hernia, according to previous literatures. Pulmonary function includes pulmonary ventilation function and pulmonary diffusion function, which is affected by the defect and repair quality of the abdominal wall, and is a key factor affecting postoperative complications, such as postoperative pain, postoperative pulmonary infection, ileus and postoperative stress. To explore the influence of recurrent incisional hernia on pulmonary ventilation function, and to provide a reliable basis for clinical management and prevention, we have conducted a preliminary study on the influence of recurrence on the change of pulmonary ventilation function. We hope that this study can provide an effective strategy for clinical prevention and treatment of primary and recurrent incisional hernia."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cardiovascular epidemic. It is also a major prognostic factor in patient survival, and its diagnosis is a major public health issue with about 7 million deaths each year.
CAD is due to atherosclerosis. An atheroma develops within the wall of an artery. Deposits lead to foam cells and necrotic nuclei. These atheromas are initially asymptomatic and remain non-obstructive for a long time. They become unstable only later in the course of the disease and can give rise to heart attacks, angina or death by embolism. The major advances observed over the past 20 to 30 years have focused on the prevention of cardiovascular risk factors and the management of secondary prevention. The major innovation lies in the screening of asymptomatic patients that can be carried out by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), myocardial scintigraphy using 99m Tc sestamibi (Cardiolite Tc 99m) or coronary calcium score (CCS). These assessments make it possible to detect coronary involvement with sub-clinical progression and to monitor its evolution and treatment tolerance. They are often carried out in patients with type 2 diabetes for which it is recommended to screen by echocardiography every two years. The risk of complications for patients carrying silent coronary sclerosis is very low, but the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes is not excluded. Moreover, the screening of asymptomatic patients with an additional risk factor (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking, dyslipidemia...) must be carried out at an earlier life stage. This is all the more necessary considering that the age of the onset of diabetes is becoming younger (childhood) and since patients have been treated for over 10 years with hyperlipidemic agents, which also have an anti-ischemic effect. Screening at an early stage, based on the determination of coronary calcium score (by CT scan), makes it possible to select patients in whom there are sub-clinical and silent coronary lesions to be evaluated for the prescription of a secondary prevention strategy.
The development of cardiovascular diseases is often rapid and difficult to predict before their clinical manifestation. However, with the exception of acute coronary syndromes, there is little information on the frequency of events leading to hospitalization in patients suspected of having coronary involvement. The use of molecular imaging, such as 18 F-NaF PET scanner, seems promising for detecting unstable plaques. Several imaging sequences with FDG and calcium scoring with 125 I-NaF are available for imaging the carotid and coronary arteries. The use of a 18F-labelled NaF and its detection on a PET-CT coupled scanner, and also the calculation of a calcium score is the subject of recent publication.
Calcium score is a simple, non-injected scanner that measures coronary calcifications, a stigmat of healed atheroma plaques and as a rule, non-evolving. The imaging by 18F-NaF PET scanner makes it possible to detect unstable or necrotic plaques in which the cellular composition is modified between necrotic and inflammatory cells to lipid and macrophage contents in macrophage and foam cells. The quantification of these abnormalities is essential because it is believed that it is these plaques that lead to heart attacks. The major advantage of PET scanning is its ability to detect sub-clinical events, to guide anti-necrotic drug treatment, whatever the risk factor of the patient and irrespective of his coronary plaque burden. An initial study in 2009 evaluated the 18F-NaF PET scanner compared to CT without calcium score, in stable patients complaining of chest pain and whose functional and anatomical imaging were negative. In the absence of any symptom, only the 18F-NaF PET scanner made it possible to highlight the presence of 1 or several unstable plaques.
A prospective trial to refine these results and in parallel, to propose a new strategy for the initiation of primary prevention in patients identified with an intermediate and high risk is therefore needed.
There is no reference in the literature to guide the theranostic approach of patients for whom there is no other means of evaluating the unstable plaque status.

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is associated with cognitive decline and dementia and is mainly manifested on brain MRI as WMH (white matter hyperintensities). These WMH can be subdivided into different forms, but there is no clear consensus about its impact on neuropsychological performance. The aim of this study is (1) to test the hypothesis that certain variations in WMH shape are more strongly associated with cognitive decline and (2) to study the potential relationship between these irregularities in WMH shape and other SVD markers (such as microinfarcts, hemorrhage and white matter integrity). Moreover, the investigators seek to investigate possible relationships between abnormal WMH shape to markers of abnormal CSF-flow around perivascular spaces. As a secondary outcome measure they want to explore these associations further and study whether different 'phenotypes' of WMH can be identified based on their shape.

Esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma is a common digestive system malignant tumors, and its diagnosis is often difficult. Endoscopic diagnosis is the gold standard and most cost-effective method, but traditional endoscopic image interpretation still faces some limitations, and the diagnosis rate needs to be improved. In recent years, artificial intelligence has been widely applied in various fields, but the application of artificial intelligence in endoscopy diagnosis of esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma has not yet been systematically evaluated.
In the past, the research of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of tumors has been very successful. In addition to the initial diagnosis and recognition of tumors through artificial intelligence, more attention is focused on the detection of lesions and the recognition of tumor states. Artificial intelligence plays an important role in guiding clinical diagnosis by analyzing the changes of internal texture and other characteristics, and has been widely used in the pathway and treatment of various tumors. Artificial intelligence algorithms such as CNN, CapsNet, etc. And combined with deep learning technology that has matured in recent years to mine hidden features through large data analysis, can make accurate predictions of images, thus helping to detect and diagnose tumors. In this study, we plan to use deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze the endoscopic image features of esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma and normal tissue to establish a diagnostic model, and to compare the diagnostic value of artificial intelligence with professional doctors.
Therefore, after preliminary research of the clinical database of the Digestive Endoscopy Center of Changhai Hospital, we propose the following plans:
1. Develop and verify an artificially intelligent endoscopic diagnosis system based on deep learning for esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma.
2. After preliminary research of the clinical database of the Digestive Endoscopy Center of Changhai Hospital, we used the data of endoscopic cases in this center to collect and verify the established model.
The specific research plan and methods:
1. Develop an artificially intelligent endoscopic diagnosis system based on deep learning.
2. Develop a training set suitable for modeling.
3. Develop and verify a test set.
4. Develop and verify a verification set.
5. Compare the diagnostic value of artificial intelligence with professionals.

Music therapy has emerged as a complementary treatment in palliative care that is associated with beneficial effects on physical symptoms, psychological well-being, spiritual needs, and quality of life. Music therapy interventions are heterogeneous in that both receptive and active techniques are employed, with varying instruments, durations, and therapeutic approaches. A variety of training backgrounds are found in practicing music therapists. Research has not yet provided unequivocal confirmation of the therapeutic value of various music therapy interventions in palliative care, in that the effects observed have been measured by subjective assessments that rely on rating scales or questionnaires. Few studies to date have utilized objective outcome parameters to assess psychological or autonomic response to music therapy in palliative care populations. It is possible that individual preferences concerning the music employed may be an important variable in the beneficial effects of music therapy in palliative care patients. The present study aims to assess the acceptability of different music interventions, played live or using a pre-recorded track, with objective recordings of human autonomic response using the Corsano wristband 287-2 in addition to subjective assessments of psychological outcome.
This study is designed as a prospective, repeated-measures study at the palliative care ward of the University Hospital Zurich as part of the Integrated Biopsychosocial Laboratory. Healthy research assistants will be trained in music therapy and receive additional training in the use of the 287-2 wristband. The 287-2 wristband is designed for use in autonomic recordings of humans without the need for skin disinfection or abrasion of skin. With the application of a dry electrode on the left wrist, multiple simultaneous biomarkers of autonomic response can be assessed, including skin temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, and Galvanic skin response. The data collected using the 287-2 is stored on a computer system via Bluetooth connection.
The data will be analyzed using non-parametric statistical methods applying the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test to compare pre- and post-therapy data for each biomarker assessed. Descriptive statistics will be obtained for each biomarker with the corresponding time point. Effect sizes will be analyzed by calculating the Hedges' g coefficient and 95% confidence intervals. The investigators will conduct sub-group analyses based on gender and age to assess potential interactions with intervention effect.
At the completion of data collection, patients will be invited to participate in an exit interview regarding the acceptability of the music and the method of delivery (live or recording). The investigators will utilize a modified version of the THETAF-II of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) to assess participants' acceptability of music therapy played live and from a pre-recorded track. Participants will be asked to rate six items on a scale of 1 - 5, with higher values demonstrating increased acceptability of the specific music therapy intervention. The questionnaire was adapted to the specific content of the present study and translations have been verified with the lead author, a musicologist and experienced music therapist. Descriptive statistics will be applied to calculate the mean intervention-specific acceptability questionnaire score of each treatment condition, followed by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test to analyze differences in intervention-specific acceptability questionnaire scores. Secondary outcome measures are described below.
The investigators will utilize three validated and widely used questionnaires to assess subjective outcome measures. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 15 Palliative Care (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL) is the validated short-form version of the EORTC QLQ-C30-PAL and will be employed to assess general quality of life. The questionnaire yields subjective ratings of various aspects of quality of life such as physical, emotional, and social functioning. Other measures such as the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) will be employed to assess subjective symptoms such as pain, dyspnea and nausea. Finally, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms. Qualitative analysis of open questions will be performed to evaluate the subjective experience of patients with regard to the music therapy sessions and the corresponding method of delivery.
The investigators will employ statistical methods to test if these questionnaire parameters differ according to the type of music therapy (live or recording). Descriptive statistics will be obtained for each questionnaire item, followed by the Wilcoxon signed-"

Globally, cataract surgery is the most common major operation in ophthalmology, serving millions of patients annually. Nearly half the waste of cataract surgery, as reported by a prospective Malaysian study was recyclable1. Despite the increasing evidence of reusing the operative supplies during cataract surgery in order to cut cost and waste, and in order to lower global warming and climate change, healthcare professionals may be reluctant to consider it due to worries of cross-contamination among patients3. This is mainly because of the risk of intraocular infection, Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS) due to contamination of the anterior chamber by micro-organisms3. To date, there is no randomized study in humans to evaluate the effect of reusing of operative supplies during cataract surgery on postoperative complications3. It also means a decrease in the ecological footprint of cataract surgery. 
To date, there is no randomized study in humans to evaluate the effect of reusing of operative supplies during cataract surgery on postoperative complications, especially endophthalmitis and TASS.
The aim of this trial is to show if reusing the operative supplies to reduce financial costs, especially in developing countries, will affect the rate of postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. In the proposed study, the investigators will assess the risk and the infection rate between:
The routine use of different new gloves, gowns, and tips of the phacoemulsification with hand and gloves sterilization.
The reuse of the same gown, gloves, tips, and operative equipment between selected consecutive cataract patients.
In order to minimize the risk of infection during the reuse of the operative supplies, adequate sterilization and hand hygiene are done:
hand sterilization with alcohol once, each time before and after wearing the next gloves,
changing the tip of the phacoemulsification only and used throughout the operation,
the reuse of keratome, MVR, IOL cartridge, cassette-sac from multiple patients by immersion of them between cases in alcohol, and
the reuse of OVD between multiple surgeries by immersion of them between cases in alcohol.
The irrigation fluid to be used is 3/50 saline solution during 3min.
After each surgery, the conjunctival and corneal wounds were closed with the same 9-0 nylon suture.
All patients received of antibiotic prophylaxis, topical Gatifloxacin (Tymer) and Prednisolone (Optipred) drops one drop per day for the first ten days after the surgery, and a topical combination of Ofloxacin, dexamethasone (Dexaflox), and a lubricant (Systane) three times a day for the next four weeks.
Intraocular antiseptic and topical antibiotics can minimize the risk of ocular infection and the risk of contamination to the corneal stroma.
Topical Gatifloxacin and Prednisolone drops were used for 10 days after the surgery, while a combination of Ofloxacin, dexamethasone (Dexaflox), and a lubricant (Systane) were used three times a day for the next four weeks.
The study will be double-blind, randomized, and conducted at a single referral center. After the preoperative assessment, and following a signed informed consent form, all patients (who had bilateral cataracts, and the second eye will be cataract surgery 3-8 days after the first eye surgery) were randomly divided into 2 groups. 
One month after the surgery, all patients visited the clinics for evaluation of the cataract grade, and any complication such as inflammation or infection. We assessed, in a standardized form, all the risk factors of intraocular infection, toxic anterior segment syndrome, endophthalmitis, and postoperative vision recovery. All patients underwent an ophthalmologic examination and clinical evaluation once a week for 3 months, then twice a month up to 6 months, or whenever there was any ocular complication.
Clinical examination included visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and fundus examination.

Building on the previous foundation and literature review, we found that ACC is closely related to the core symptoms of AN, and proposed the hypotheses that ACC overactivation and abnormal functional connectivity with other brain regions (anterior frontal lobe, parietal lobe, precuneus, and striatum) is the neuropathological mechanism for the onset of AN. The study is the first time to use dTMS to intervene with ACC in the treatment of adult AN. A randomized controlled study design was adopted, in which patients with AN were divided into the dTMS treatment group and the pseudo-stimulation group by 1:1 randomization, followed by 6-week intervention and half-year follow up, to clarify the near-term and long-term efficacy and safety of the dTMS treatment. Psychometric and fMRI examinations were performed at baseline in both groups. The rest of the time follow-up of symptoms and psychometrics and side-effects questionnaires were performed at week 2, 4, and 6 (during treatment) as well as at week 4, 12, and 24 ( after completion of treatment). Meanwhile, baseline fMRI data were extracted and combined with clinical features to establish an efficacy prediction model. Factors predictive of dTMS efficacy in AN patients of dTMS treatment group, divided into two groups according to whether dTMS was effective or not at the end of treatment (week 6) (effective is defined as BMI increasing by ≥1.2 kg/m2 at the end of treatment), using pre-treatment (baseline) demographic information, psychological assessment questionnaires, and neuroimaging data in the two groups. This will provide theoretical and practical basis for the pioneering ACC-targeted dTMS treatment in China, helping to establish a new type of intervention program for AN, with expected results of innovation."

In France, the only disease being screened in the newborn screening program (NBS) is phenylketonuria. The extension of the NBS has been a long-pursued goal in all the countries and is the subject of numerous studies.
The extension of newborn screening depends on public opinion and its acceptability. However, the results of acceptability studies carried out so far are contradictory, partly due to the use of different definitions of acceptability, but mainly due to the absence of validated multidimensional models of acceptability.
We propose to conduct a prospective, quantitative and qualitative nationwide survey of acceptability among both parents of healthy newborns and parents of a sick child. The aim is first to adapt the multidimensional definition of acceptability and then to use it to measure the acceptability of expanded newborn screening. The survey will also be used to describe parents' expectations and perceptions of expanded newborn screening and to generate hypotheses about the variables associated with positive and negative views on expanded newborn screening.
A second objective of the study is to provide a better understanding of parents who have had to endure a screening/diagnosis/treatment pathway involving the newborn's diseases or close relatives' illnesses (including cancers). These parents may have a different view of expanded newborn screening.
A third objective of the study is to analyze the effects of socio-cultural parameters such as socio-professional category or geographic area on the acceptability of expanded newborn screening."

This is a UK-based observational study that aims to discover novel predictive biomarkers with the potential to guide treatment decision making and prolong PFS and OS in patients with advanced TNBC. Patients will undergo a mandatory, study-specific core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration of the breast tumour or metastasis before commencing their next line of therapy. The research sample will be run on Pear Bio's test whilst the patient receives therapy as per their physician's choice. This study will not use Pear Bio's tool to inform the choice of treatment, with the treating oncologist being blinded to the test results. Treatment response data will be collected at multiple timepoints to conduct analyses on the study's secondary and tertiary objectives. Fresh tissue resections that arrive at Pear Bio's lab will undergo processing, cell culture and various drug dosing and omics assays (depending on extracted cell numbers). Tumour samples will be processed using a cell isolation kit to retrieve a viable single-cell suspension. A minimum of 100,000 cells (10,000 viable cells per chip) will be used for staining with live and dead cell-tracking dyes. In parallel, blood vials will be processed for PBMCs and further effector cell extraction (flow cytometry, Dynabeads, etc). The remaining cells will be used for sequencing (DNA/RNA), fixed for immunofluorescence characterisation of biomarkers/receptor status or used for further omics assays (if cell numbers allow). The stained cells will be cultured in a biomimetic hydrogel within Pear Bio's organ-on-a-chip to provide a physiological 3D environment for drug dosing experiments. Using a microfluidic device, samples in each chip will be exposed to approved therapies (either as monotherapy or combination therapies, as outlined below) over multiple days. In parallel, PBMCs will be extracted from whole blood, characterised and sorted via flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic beads selection. Cells of interest (e.g. CD8+ T cells) will be used for culture in Pear Bio's chips jointly with cells isolated from the matched tumour sample. To test immunotherapies, tumour cells will be co-cultured with immune cells in a modified organ-on-a-chip architecture. Chips receiving immunotherapies may be tested for tumour mutational burden and/or microsatellite instability. Confocal microscopy will be conducted daily to collect 3D image data of the cells and track their position and behaviour over time. At the end of the assay, the 3D cell cultures will be fixed for further 3D immunofluorescence analyses or used for embedding, sectioning and assessment of spatial transcriptomics. For targeted therapies, RNAseq, IF and other omics data will be integrated to confirm drug MoA and identify other potential therapeutic targets. Concurrently, 3D image data is processed through a computer vision pipeline to measure functional metrics of the ex vivo 3D cell cultures, including cell viability, cell culture width and cell migration, both at a bulk tumour level and at a single-cell resolution. For immunotherapies, additional metrics such as immune cell infiltration and immune cell killing will be recorded. A patient report is then generated to outline an individual patient sample's response to each therapy tested."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to bowel changes, ranging from severe dysplasia to colon cancer. In addition to inflammation in the intestine, IBD causes psychological illness and has a great impact on a person´s well-being and quality of life. IBD patients often need surgery and a long waiting time for surgical procedures can cause significant complications. There is a need to find better ways to treat and follow up IBD patients that reduces the need for surgery. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate if a patient with IBD and a prolonged waiting time for elective surgery differs in both quality of life and socioeconomic status from a patient who has undergone an elective surgery. The study will also focus on the cost of treatment for patients delayed for elective surgery compared to a patient who is operated with elective surgery. Another focus will be if delayed surgery increases complications and the need for reoperation compared to a patient that is operated with elective surgery in a timely manner. A questionnaire will be given to IBD patients, both those who are planned for elective surgery and those who have been operated with elective surgery to investigate the impact of their condition on their quality of life, employment status and socioeconomic situation. A retrospective questionnaire will be given to patients who were operated with elective surgery to investigate their course of disease, complications and needs of re-operation. By doing this, it will be possible to calculate the cost of treatment over time (from the time before surgery to the end of the study) and investigate if delayed surgery leads to increased complications and a need for re-operation. It is well established that early surgery improves the prognosis for patients with IBD, but the decision to delay surgery needs to consider the costs, benefits and risks for each patient affected. By this study we will obtain knowledge that will help us to find better ways of managing the patients and reduce complications and costs in cases where surgery is delayed. By following up on the patients´ condition, including quality of life and socioeconomic status, we will also increase knowledge about what happens with patients with IBD when surgery is delayed. If we find that the patient's condition is negatively affected or if there is a disproportionate risk of complications for the patient, surgery can be performed earlier, and if resources are limited, operations can be prioritised in a better way. The results in this study will allow us to investigate and describe potential societal and patient implications of delayed surgery and thereby develop new strategies in how we handle delayed IBD surgery."

The immunosuppressive environment induced by tumor through cellular and/or soluble pathways critically contribute to hinder efficient antitumor immunity. The role of MDSC in lung cancer and their cross-talk with lung cancer stem cells and their potential to be targeted is still unknown. The aim of this project is to better characterize the non immunologic functions of MDSC. We propose to assess in vitro the non-immunological pro-tumor functions of MDSC isolated from lung cancer patients. Functional in vitro studies of the effect of MDSC extracted from resected NSCLC prospectively collected on phenotype and function of lung cancer cell lines at the time of surgery only, when fresh tumor is resected."

Additionally, added sugars play a significant role in childhood obesity and are also the leading preventable cause of tooth decay. Because added sugars are found in high amounts in flavored sparkling water (SSW), these drinks are the primary drinks that adolescents consume. The proposed study will evaluate whether the substitution of sparkling water has health benefits in adolescents, compared to SSB. In the study, the researchers will compare the effects of a sparkling water intervention that promotes the daily consumption of flavored sparkling water instead of SSB. Adolescents, and their parents, will be provided with enough supplies of the drink each month. The researchers will also provide iPhones with a mobile food recording app. During the study, study staff will regularly communicate with adolescents through the app to encourage them to consume the sparkling water. The investigators hypothesize that by substituting sparkling water for SSB, the adolescents' overall added sugar consumption and energy intake will decline. The decline in added sugar consumption will lead to improved indices of health. Improved health outcomes such as lower waist circumference, increased insulin sensitivity and reduced HgbA1c will occur without changing caloric and macronutrient intake from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended levels. These positive effects will be sustainable and reproducible over a yearlong intervention. In the first study arm (i.e., Experimental group) adolescents who receive the sparkling water intervention are expected to have declining levels of added sugar and energy intake. In the second study arm, (i.e., Control group), adolescents who do not receive a sparkling water intervention are expected to maintain high levels of added sugars. The study will provide adolescents with a unique opportunity to adopt healthier dietary habits, which they can retain after the study intervention. If these benefits can be maintained, it will provide strong support for the substitution of sparkling water for SSB as a promising dietary pattern for adolescents. Findings have implications for adolescent health, clinical practice and the reduction of disease related to diabetes. This study is feasible, with clear, measurable outcomes, and will provide preliminary data to support research on the effectiveness of interventions that promote the adoption of healthier dietary patterns in adolescent populations at risk for obesity and onset of type 2 diabetes."

Introduction: In resective periodontal surgery suturing has a pivotal role in obtaining a definitive closure of the wound to achieve the best possible postoperative outcome. Several polyglycolic acid (PGA) sutures are available on the market at present. The aim of this clinical study is to evaluate the early wound healing, wound dehiscence, oral candidiasis, dentinal hypersensitivity, angular cheilitis, swelling, bleeding, infection, pain, satisfaction, suture handling and bacterial colonization on the suture.
Material and methods: This is a monocentric, double-blinded, randomized, parallel controlled study. Adult patients undergoing resective periodontal surgery will randomly (1:1 - stratified by study site) receive Novosyn® Quick (control group) or Monosyn® Quick (treatment group). The first 28 patients included in the study will be the run in period. Patients, surgeon, and outcome assessor will be blinded to the type of suture used. The sample size was calculated using the outcome parameter ""clinical signs of wound healing"" (Early Wound Healing Score) considering the difference between the scores and the pooled standard deviation. The allocation will be randomized (1:1 dynamic allocation) with minimisation algorithm to a suture group. Randomisation will be stratified by study site. Randomisation will be stratified by study site. Data will be analysed using Chi-square test, Student t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and univariate linear regression on continuous variables.
The primary end point in order to evaluate the primary objective of the project (i.e. to assess the early wound healing score, clinical signs of re-epithelization, clinical signs of haemostasis, and clinical signs of inflammation) is defined as the assessment of the Early Wound Healing score in patients undergoing resective periodontal surgery 10 ± 5 days postoperatively. Clinical signs of wound healing will be scored by one investigator blinded to the treatment. The early wound healing score (EHS) is a three parameter score including clinical signs of re-epithelization, clinical signs of haemostasis, and clinical signs of inflammation."

Overview: There are many pathological mechanisms of sensorineural deafness. The prevalence of sudden deafness is high. In this study, we found that NAD is down-regulated in the endolymphatic membrane of the chorda tympani ganglion in the sudden deafness model and then propose that NAD supplementation is effective in the treatment and rehabilitation of sudden deafness, and provide a possible pathway for the treatment of sudden deafness. In conclusion, we provide a preliminary treatment for sudden deafness with new ideas and explore more accurate pathways.
Objective: To observe the effectiveness and safety of CoenzymeI for injection combined with conventional treatment in the rehabilitation of hearing loss caused by sudden deafness, and to assess the safety of CoenzymeI for injection.
Methods: This is a small sample (2 groups), unicenter, double-blind, randomized research.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1)Age: ≥18yrs. The 2019 American Sudden Deafness Guidelines are for patients with sudden deafness over 18 years of age; (2)Patients diagnosed with sudden deafness, i.e. unexplained sensorineural hearing loss occurred within 72 hours, with hearing threshold≥30 in at least 3 consecutive frequencies, refer to the 2019 American Sudden Deafness Guidelines; (3)Unilateral sudden deafness; (4)Within 1 week of the onset of sudden deafness, no treatment in another hospital/our hospital; (5)No major neurological disease, serious systemic disease, family genetic history, major mental illness; (6)Informed and agreed to join the experiment, no plan to move out or go out within 1 month; (7)If the doctor judged that the patient had no major problems affecting the completion of the study.
Exclusion criteria: (1)Other diseases such as acoustic neuroma diagnosed by imaging; (2)Those who cannot tolerate NAD+; (3)Pregnancy.
The patients were divided into the treatment group and the observation group.

Based on a pilot project, we have gathered data on children with nephropathic cystinosis from cysteamine therapy. These pilot data do not provide proof of the benefit of early detection. The transfer to a larger study is hindered by a lack of uniformly agreed upon criteria. A study of the current study size would therefore be too large.
The aim of this study is:
- scientific evaluation of the transferability of the molecular newborn screening for nephropathic cystinosis (screen CST) and
- evaluation of the possible transferability of the genetic newborn screening for primary hyperoxaluria (screens I & II) to other laboratories.
The genetic newborn screenings for cystinosis (screen CST) and the primary hyperoxaluria screening (screen I & II) are carried out without additional costs for the laboratories participating in the study. Participating laboratories can thus not gain economic benefits from it.
Since 2010, the first screening in the DHK has been taking place at the Hannover Medical School (MHH) in about 40% of the births in Lower Saxony with maternal consent. Therefore, this project is mainly limited to the testing period, but the data for the affected children will be collected as usual in the MHH by the parents or physicians. In principle, all newborns whose parents have agreed to participate in the pilot project at HMH will be tested for two mutations in the CTNS gene, and for the cysteamine test, and depending on the test result, for one mutation in the PH1 gene and one mutation in the HOGA1 gene (see design details). The detection rate of both diseases is expected to be >95%.
The follow-up of patients with positive screening results is carried out according to the NBS guidelines of the individual federal states by the competent centers for rare diseases (see design details). In the case of newly diagnosed affected children (Cystinosis) the follow-up will take place in the interdisciplinary cystinosis consultation of the German competence center for cystinosis.
At the age of 10 years, the outcome of the affected children screened for will be evaluated. An extended data will be derived according to a predefined protocol. This extended data is intended to enable an interdisciplinary scientific evaluation.
Parents whose children are to be tested have the opportunity to waive participation in this study. Based on the consent given up to 72 hours after birth or, if not obtained promptly, up to 10 to 14 days after birth, the parents may revoke their consent at any time.
The study is carried out as a non-interventional study with a case-control design without economic benefits. Parents receive the usual care of their children. Screening laboratories are not financially compensated, as their routine NBS is only slightly burdensome through the testing of new mutations.
If the study is negative, no conclusions can be drawn about the future introduction of molecular genetic NBS for Cystinosis and PH in Germany. If the study is positive, its results can be used to scientifically justify a screening of the respective diseases in the future in Germany. In this context, the results on the proportion of heterozygous variants can also be used for the introduction of further variants into the NBS screening. In this way, it is possible to achieve a broad NBS screening, which also covers the detection of heterozygous carriers for the rare diseases. However, in the long term, genetic screening for cystinosis and PH will be necessary to further reduce its costs, to ensure equal distribution of health in Germany and to improve the health of the population overall."

Background: Negative pressure wound therapy is a common practice, but few study shows the effect of placing negative pressure drainage in patients underwent laparoscopic intra-abdominal surgery in surgical wound. Some surgical field, such as gastrointestinal cancer surgery and surgery after the accident of gastrointestinal organ, has high possibility of post operative surgical site infection. Infection at the surgical site can give a big impact to both the patients and health care cost. Aim: To evaluate the effect of placing negative pressure drainage on the post operative surgical site infection rate of clean-contaminated and contaminated surgical wounds from intra-abdominal surgery. We plan to recruit patients who underwent the gastrointestinal surgery. Hypothesis: Place negative pressure drainage on the surgical wound can reduce the postoperative surgical site infection rate of clean-contaminated surgical wound in intra-abdominal surgery. Methods: First, we will conduct a pilot study by using online calculator (Nomogram) to calculate and compare the sample size between two different study model before full scale study. We will recruit 46 patients for each study model. For the control group, we place no drainage in the surgical wound after skin closure. Then we will place negative pressure drainage in the surgical wound after skin closure for the intervention group. We will put out the drainage when the fluid content is less than 20 ml per day. The investigators collect data at the day following the surgery, the second postoperative day, the postoperative third day and the postoperative seventh day. The investigators will follow up on the patients until discharge from the hospital and when discharge, they will evaluate it by 36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-36) survey according to hospital service at the 7th day after the discharge from hospital. Finally we will compare the rate of surgical site infection between two groups and the comparison will be performed by the Chi-square test, or Fisher exact test at 0.05 level of Significance. Sample Size: To compare the rate of surgical site infection which is considered the primary outcome, our previous study which is the study of negative pressure drainage on open abdominal surgery, the event of surgical site infection occurred in the control group was 6 % while that in the intervention group was 2 %. The sample size of control group that will be recruited is 60 patients and for intervention group is 85 patients. To estimate the incidence of SSI in this study, the total number of patients is a 7:5 ratio (control: intervention). Thus the total patient number is 140 patients (60 controls, 80 intervention). Power: 95% Power was estimated a priori. Based on these calculations, sample sizes of the groups in the pilot study are 12. To detect the difference of a 4% of reduction on the rate of SSI between the two groups. A total of 46 patients for each study groups. To detect the difference in the length of hospital stay with a power level of 80% will require 96 evaluable patients with 48 patients per group."

The 3 FDA-approved CDK4, 6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, all provided progression-free survival benefits when combined with endocrine therapy in advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer. But, not all of them provided overall survival benefit in the same setting. One of the proposed mechanisms that influence the overall survival difference is from the different influence of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors on tumor microenvironment and / or immune system. However, there was no head-to-head comparison of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors in the same study. Neoadjuvant therapy provides a window to obtain tissue samples before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment. We aim to compare the immune modulation effects of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib with letrozole in neoadjuvant treatment for ER+/HER2- early breast cancer. We will collect tumor tissue, blood, and stool samples prospectively before treatment, at 2 weeks after treatment, and after 12 weeks of treatment at the time of surgery. Immune modulation effects will be compared between 3 treatment groups from breast tumor RNAseq analysis. No randomized clinical trial of CDK4, 6 inhibitors combination with letrozole in neoadjuvant setting has been reported to investigate the immune modulation effects of CDK4, 6 inhibitors. This clinical trial is designed to assess the immune modulation effects (changes of transcriptomic profiles from 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors) of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib compared to letrozole in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant CDK4, 6 inhibitors plus letrozole. Tumor immune microenvironment might be modified by the addition of different CDK4, 6 inhibitors. Our hypothesis is that the different immune modulation effects among palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib when combined with letrozole will contribute to the overall efficacy. The study population will consist of postmenopausal female patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer. The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized study to compare the expression status of immune-related signatures on RNAseq after different CDK4, 6 inhibitors treatments using three different CDK4, 6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) combined with letrozole in each treatment group. By studying the immune modulation difference between the three treatment groups that are currently available as neoadjuvant treatment option, our study can provide evidence of the immune modulation effect of CDK4, 6 inhibitor in neoadjuvant setting of ER+/HER2- breast cancer, which is valuable for the clinical decision and the development of CDK4, 6 inhibitor strategy in precision medicine.
It is an open-label randomized study with parallel assignment.

The study is a randomized controlled trial. New mothers experience postpartum depression after childbirth, which may cause mood swings, crying spells, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. Postpartum depression mainly begins within two to three days after delivery and may last for up to several weeks or months. Physical activity and mobility have been found to be an integral part of human life, which has significant effects on postnatal depression. This study hypotheses that women in resistance groups will have increased self-efficacy, reduced depression scores and higher maternal quality of life than participants in the flexibility group.
                This study is a cross-sectional research study, conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Jinnah Hospital, Lahore. After informed consent, the 36 postpartum women will be selected using a purposive sampling method. They will be divided into two groups. The data will be collected after obtaining informed consent from the participants by administering a questionnaire for assessing self-efficacy, depression, and maternal quality of life. Data collection is an interview process. Resistance training group will be given resistance training. Twice per week for 8 weeks. Total 16 sessions will give to both intervention groups. Flexibility training group will be given flexibility training. Twice per week for 8 weeks. Total 16 sessions will give to both intervention groups. To assess self-efficacy, Depression scores will be measured using self-efficacy self-report questionnaire developed by Shumway-Cook & Williams in 1995. Epidemiological studies Depression scale developed by Radloff in 1977. Maternal Postpartum Quality of Life Questionnaire (MAPP-QOL) questionnaire will be administered to measure maternal quality of life during the early postnatal period.
                The study will use a two-group design. Intervention groups will have twenty-five per group. Data analysis will be performed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25. Data will be presented in terms of frequencies & percentages and mean & standard deviations. After 4 weeks of intervention, it is hypothesized that women in resistance groups will have increased self-efficacy, reduced depression scores and higher maternal quality of life than participants and control group; also the scores will be different in each group."

Dental wear is one of the most common factors that negatively affect quality of life. For the first time, surface hardness of denture teeth is measured and its correlation with the wear resistance are compared between the prefabricated and CAD/CAM milled dentures in an attempt to increase knowledge of the most appropriate dentures to be used. 2D, Vertical wear were used to characterize the wear on denture teeth. 3D Volumetric wear was measured using a 3D scanner, which provided measurements of wear in the vertical, horizontal and rotational coordinates in a more detailed manner. Predefined inclusion criteria were used for the cross-over clinical trial. All prefabricated artificial teeth of both the conventional acrylic resin base and CAD/CAM milled artificial teeth were measured for surface hardness at the onset of the study and again 6 months later. Vertical wear, 2D, 3D wear were measured when the prefabricated and CAD/CAM milled teeth were used at the onset of the study and again 6 months later. The Vickers's micro indentation tester (Model: HXD-100; Shore Inc. Suzhou, China) was used to evaluate the surface hardness (HV) of the artificial teeth. Two indentations were done separately on the occlusal region of artificial teeth on both sides and its mean value was recorded. The wear resistance of prefabricated and CAD/CAM artificial teeth are significantly correlated (r=0.755, P<0.001). The 2D wear, Vertical wear and 3D Volumetric wear were measured when the prefabricated and CAD/CAM milled teeth were used at the onset of the study and again 6 months later and the difference, p values of the prefabricated and CAD/CAM milled artificial teeth ware studied using T-test. The results show that the 2D, Vertical wear and 3D Volumetric wear of prefabricated and CAD/CAM artificial teeth were non-significant at 0.05 level of P, Pvalue shows no significant difference between the prefabricated and CAD/CAM artificial teeth. The surface hardness of prefabricated and CAD/CAM artificial teeth were significantly correlated (r=0.755, P<0.001). The results show that there is no significant difference in surface hardness and wear resistance between prefabricated and CAD/CAM artificial teeth. Surface hardness, wear resistance were measured with a higher magnification and in three dimensions using 3D scanning. For the first time the surface 3D characteristics of the teeth were demonstrated using the superimposition of the teeth in a 2D and 3D plane. For the first time, surface hardness of denture teeth was measured and its correlation with the wear resistance are compared between the prefabricated and CAD/CAM milled dentures. The results showed that there was no significant difference in surface hardness and wear resistance between prefabricated and CAD/CAM artificial teeth. A further comparison with clinical data for different age groups and dentures usage time is needed. It was concluded that prefabricated and CAD/CAM milled denture teeth have similar surface characteristics and their use is clinically effective. It is recommended that more detailed measurements should be carried out on larger sample size and more age groups. For the first time the surface 3D characteristics of the teeth were demonstrated using surface 3D mapping and scanning. There is need for more measurements of teeth on a larger sample size, and for different age groups. Furthermore, clinical data from patient files using similar tooth types with different usage times and different patient age groups as well as clinical data from the examination of oral mucosal changes for different tooth types should be investigated."

The purpose of this study is to see whether Trastuzumab deruxtecan therapy is more effective than standard neoadjuvant (before surgery) chemotherapy in treating people with HER2-positive breast cancer. It will compare the effectiveness of the trastuzumab deruxtecan regimen with a standard regimen (consisting of docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab and pre-operative hormone therapy for those with hormone receptor positive tumors).
For this study, patients are not required to have specific tests or perform procedures before being eligible to participate. Once the participant is eligible and has agreed to take part in the study, further tests are performed. These tests are to:
- Ensure that the tumor is HER2-positive
- Perform imaging tests, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scans
- Confirm the molecular subtype of the patient's tumor using gene expression profiling (GEP) analysis, known as PAM50.
This study will follow the participants for up to 5 years through regular visits and phone calls. A visit may include:
- Examination
- Blood tests
- Imaging scans
- Biopsies
The study will also see if trastuzumab deruxtecan can be given based on molecular testing in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.
This study also tries to understand:
- How well patients respond to the study drugs
- Factors such as how breast cancer develops may be related to the treatment success of trastuzumab deruxtecan."

The sevoflurane and propofol groups, both of which were randomized, were included in the study. After the preoperative evaluation, the exclusion and inclusion criteria were met, and the patient, anesthetist, and patient care team and relatives were informed and agreed, were allotted to the two groups. Preoperative evaluators and the anesthetist responsible for general anesthesia in the operating room had no knowledge of the grouping method. There was no discussion or data exchange between the two groups. The participants and data analysts were all blinded. During the operation, the dose of anesthetic drugs (propofol/ fentanyl /remifentanil and sevoflurane/ cisatracurium/ rocuronium) were adjusted to maintain the mean arterial pressure and heartbeat fluctuations within 20% of the baseline value and Entropy (or BIS) value at 40-60in both groups. Postoperative complications within 30 days were assessed by the surgeon or anesthetist. After discharge from the hospital, the patients were followed up by phone or in person every 3 months. The follow-up time was up to 5 years. Clinical follow-up data such as postoperative complications and survival status were recorded every 3 months. The functional capacity score, tumor marker, tumor size, intraoperative blood loss/transfusion, duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, total opioid (remifentanil/ fentanyl/ propofol) use, postoperative radiation therapy, postoperative chemotherapy, postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the presence of disease progression, and 90-day, 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year overall survival and Karnofsky performance status score were recorded. The investigators also used the patient's medical records and the electronic medical record system to track the patient's prognosis. Survival follow-up was conducted using telephone follow-up on patients with known survival. When the patients died, the investigator contacted the patient's families to record their survival status."

Physical activity-related health competence is a major factor in health promotion among nursing students. A key factor for the promotion of PAHCO is the transferability of knowledge into one`s own everyday life. Nursing schools, which provide professional training for tomorrow's nurses, play an essential role in promoting health competence in the future. To this end, the present study aims to promote PAHCO among nursing students in the Bavarian region, thereby supporting health-oriented action both during the study and in professional life. Using a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT), the study aims to improve PAHCO by disseminating a specific intervention concept, the effect of which depends on the education type (i.e., vocational college: cooperative planning; university of applied sciences: expert-based intervention concept delivered by external physical-activity specialist; university: expert-based intervention concept delivered by teachers). In addition, a co-creation process for the development of intervention concepts will be conducted with the nursing schools. Quantitative and qualitative secondary data analyses of both data collection points (longitudinal) will evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions on the individual-, group- and school-level. The overall objective of the research project is to (a) contribute to the dissemination of PAHCO among nursing students and (b) to provide information for the promotion of health competence in vocational institutions of other occupational fields."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of Diosmin/Hesperidin combination on the clinical outcomes in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
The effects of Diosmin/Hesperidin (Daflon two tablets 500 mg daily), Metformin (Glucophage ® 500 tablets twice daily), and Combined oral contraceptive combination (Yassmin ® film-coated tablets 3 mg of drospirenone and 0.03 mg of ethinyl estradiol once daily) to compare to the standard hormonal contraceptive for the treatment of PCOS.
Participants were randomly assigned to receive Daflon (two tablets 500 mg daily, n= 46) + the standard hormonal contraceptive (Yassmin ® film-coated tablets 3 mg of drospirenone and 0.03 mg of ethinyl estradiol once daily, n= 48), Combined oral contraceptive+Metformin (Glucophage ® 500 tablets twice daily), and Combined oral contraceptive alone (Yassmin ® film-coated tablets 3 mg of drospirenone and 0.03 mg of ethinyl estradiol once daily, n= 48) for 16 weeks. Assessments were done at 0, and 4 months. We found a better improvement in all clinical criteria at month 4 in participants who were treated with Daflon compared to participants who were treated with the standard regimen (Yassmin ® film-coated tablets 3 mg of drospirenone and 0.03 mg of ethinyl estradiol once daily). No statistically significant difference in the improvement of the clinical criteria at month 4 was observed in the comparisons between the Daflon combined with metformin and the standard regimen."

Resectable lung cancer remains the fifth most common cancer, responsible for over 500,000 deaths annually worldwide. With an incidence of around 3% of all cancers, lung cancer accounts for 10.8% of male and 7.8% of female cancer mortality. The 5-year survival rate following the diagnosis is still inferior to 17%, even after surgical treatment. Despite increasing evidence of the efficacy of cancer screening through chest X-ray and low-dose computed tomography, lung cancer detection still occurs in advanced stages. To date, the combination between cancer screening and early-stage lung cancer detection and treatment remains mandatory to improve patient's quality of life, to decrease the rate of death due to lung cancer, and, consequently, to increase life expectancy. On the other hand, the role of non-invasive intra-operative fluorescence imaging using an optical tracking system using NIR tracers can increase the rate of detecting lung nodules located deep in the lung, not visible on the surface of normal, uninvolved tissue."

Our ability to treat cancer patients is limited, especially for patients with previously approved treatment failures. The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of the combination of Sotorasib and Panitumumab for patients who have a KRAS G12C mutation. 
In our study, patients will receive 960 mg of oral Sotorasib once daily with Panitumumab administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 14 days, infused over a period of 60 minutes (≤ 1,000 mg) or 90 minutes (> 1,000 mg). The therapy may be repeated for patients with measurable lesions, whose lesions shrink, improve, or stabilize after 1 course of chemotherapy, according to RECIST v1.1. For each new course of chemotherapy, the researchers evaluate treatment response 7-14 days after the first administration.
Patients receive other treatments, including surgery, radiation therapy or radioisotope therapy, if available, before, during or after the treatment, as clinically indicated. If patients have a measurable lesion, the researchers may continue the chemotherapy even if their symptoms improve. When a patient cannot continue Sotorasib and Panitumumab, they will be dropped from the study.
Patients will be interviewed about their cancer history through video conferencing at the end of each course of chemotherapy. If patients develop new lesions, the researchers will assess the treatment response 7-14 days after the first administration.
Additionally, the researchers will periodically conduct blood tests and evaluate each patient once every 3 months to assess their treatment response."

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the use of two protocols for treating 1 single gingival recession associated with a non-carious cervical lesion partially restored (type RT1 associated with NCCLB+). The first technique was the partial correction of the restoration (PR) with gingival soft and hard tissue alterations only treated with a coronally advanced flap (CAF). The second technique consisted of the association of Partial Restoration (PR) with gingival soft and hard tissue alterations correction, and the use of a volume-stable collagen matrix (VCMX) applied to the gingival margin, associated with CAF. Both groups received antibiotic and anti-inflammatory support during the post-operative period. The procedures used for the correction of gingival recession were the partial restoration (PR) and the coronally advanced flap (CAF). The procedures for the treatment of gingival recession in association with NCCL were evaluated using the Recession Reduction Index, root sensitivity test, visual analogic scale, Patient Related-14 (OHIP-14), patient discomfort diary, and a post-operative diary.
After 6 months, it was found that the average recession reduction was 1.2 mm for both study groups, without significant difference between them. The use of VCMX, associated with CAF, did not provide the hypothesised benefit, as recession reduction was similar for both treatment protocols (PR + CAF and PR + CAF + VCMX). Therefore, the use of VCMX as a treatment adjunct was not significant in the treatment of 1 single gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesion partially restored in the context of a 1-year follow-up."

In this study, 302 patients with gastrointestinal tumors were selected from the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University from July 2021 to June 2023. After nutritional risk screening and follow-up, patients with nutritional risk (PG=SGA≥4, NRS2002≥3) were divided into the intervention group, and patients with no nutritional risk (PG=SGA<4, NRS2002 < 3) were divided into the control group. The nutritional risk screening 2002 score and Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) score in the two groups before and after propensity score matching were compared. It is proposed to give the corresponding intervention. At the same time, the changes of various nutritional indexes of patients before and after nutritional intervention were analyzed. The effects of different nutritional support modes based on nutritional risk screening on postoperative nutritional status were examined. It is expected to provide scientific basis for the rational use of nutritional support in patients with gastrointestinal tumors."

The study aims to evaluate the effect of different abutment-prosthesis connections in implant-supported prostheses on marginal bone loss and gingival health. Conventional multi-unit implant prostheses with internal or external connections are compared with a two-piece implant abutment system. The investigational study hypothesis is that a one-piece abutment in the form of internal connection and screw-retained restoration between implant and prosthesis will have less impact on marginal bone level and gingival condition than conventional two-piece implant prostheses with external connections and cement-retained restorations during a 1-year period."

With the recent advances in non-invasive health monitoring, transcranial Doppler (TCD), a ultrasound-based imaging system, has drawn increasing attention for its ability to provide high-resolution images of blood flow and structure of major arteries, veins and cardiac outflow tract. While these advancements have resulted in improved safety and efficacy of the procedure, significant developments are still needed to ensure a comfortable, portable, and affordable imaging system. In this study, the feasibility of employing ultra-miniaturized ultrasound patch will be investigated to measure blood flow in the major cerebral arteries, including the internal carotid artery and vertebral artery, in healthy participants. With a conventional TCD probe, blood flow in the middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, posterior cerebral artery, ophthalmic artery and basilar artery will be visualized by the investigators. Blood flow measurements for each vessel segment will be recorded with a maximum of 55 minutes for each participant. Participant satisfaction with the comfort and ease-of-use of the wearable patch will be evaluated by a post-procedure questionnaire. Safety will be monitored by the investigators throughout the procedure. A minimum of 60 participants will be recruited from the University Hospital of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will include age, gender, ability to operate the device, and provide informed consent. The comparison of the measurements from the compact and wearable ultrasound patch with a conventional TCD probe will be evaluated to determine the performance of the patch for clinical use."

Background: There are two types of HD, conventional HD and hemodiafiltration (HDF), which is also called HFR. Compared with chronic hemodialysis patients with HDD, the survival risk of HFR patients is less, and the quality of life is better. This is because HFR has the function of eliminating a variety of particles with different sizes including the middle molecules and macromolecular uremic toxins. The present research is to evaluate the clearance rate of uremic toxin (especially in the removal of β2-MG, uremic toxins, cytokines, etc.) by HFR, to further study the dialysis replacement effect of HFR and to establish the target of clinical diagnosis and treatment of MHD.
Methods: The study is a randomized controlled single-center interventional study of all cases, and patients treated with blood purification are included in the study. After the patient signed the ICF (Informed consent form) voluntarily, they first went through the HDD treatment and then HFR treatment. The first group of patients (n=57, one day HFR group, with age, gender, disease type, primary disease course, vascular access status matched, the HFR group) underwent a total of two blood purification treatments. The first was an HFR treatment with a blood flow rate of 250 to 400mL/min and a speed of 50-60mL/min, and the second was an HDD treatment with a blood flow rate of 400 mL/min. The β2-MG and λFLC in the HDF treatment were measured. The blood purification treatment of each group was randomly assigned to two treatments (4 times in a month, each time there were two blood purification treatments in a week, and the order of the two treatments varied), with a total of four measurements. The middle molecules and macromolecular uremic toxin (α1-MG, λFLC, Hcy, IL-6, p-cresol, YKL-40, CFD, leptin, hippuric acid, TMAO, ADMA, TNF-α, myoglobin, FGF23 and iPTH) were measured in the fasting serum before and after HFR treatment. The serum albumin, branched chain amino acids and vitamins A, C, E were measured before and after HFR treatment. The comfort of dialysis was evaluated by patients. Dialysis replacement effect of HFR (single-compartment urea clearance index). Statistical analysis.
Expected result: HFR can remove a variety of particles with different sizes, including middle molecules and macromolecular uremic toxins, which can be used to optimize the treatment options provided for MHD patients."

The investigators propose a randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center clinical trial to investigate two treatment groups. Experimental group: multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab, No Intervention: without adjuvant therapy. This is a phase III, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the adjuvant efficacy and safety of multi-kinase inhibitors, including sorafenib, lenvatinib, or donafenib, combined with bevacizumab in patients with high-risk recurrence factors after liver transplantation. The high-risk recurrence factors of liver transplantation include the pathological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma, such as liver function abnormality, extrahepatic metastasis, vascular invasion, microvascular invasion, satellite nodules, and other high-risk factors for recurrence. In addition, the preoperative imaging evidence or postoperative pathological confirmation of the factors mentioned above will also be listed. The intervention model for this clinical trial is a randomized controlled trial (RCT): parallel assignment. No masking is involved in this clinical trial."

The objective of this study is to study the effects of 20% human albumin infusions on coagulation parameters in patients with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver. The study aims to look at the effects of albumin on clotting time, clot formation time, maximum clot formation parameters, inflammatory parameters such as ESR, CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α, platelet function studies and endothelial dysfunction studies. Additionally, pulmonary function tests with diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), albuminome and duration of the hospital stay will be evaluated. This open label randomized control trial will be conducted in 70 patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis with serum albumin ≤ 2.5 g/dl upon presentation and who will be receiving the standard treatment for their liver cirrhosis. The patients who meet the inclusion criteria will then be put on two different groups. Those randomized to the study arm will receive 20% human albumin infusion if their serum albumin levels are less than 2.5 g/dl. Albumin will only be given to those with serum albumin levels ≤ 3 g/dl to raise and maintain the serum albumin levels above 3 g/dl. The standard treatment group will receive the treatment that the patient would be getting if they were not enrolled in the trial (standard of care). Both groups will be compared for their albumin levels at the time of presentation, 1 week after inclusion in the study, and until 4 weeks unless they are discharged, transfered or die. The effects of albumin on coagulation parameters will be compared."

The clinical trial is a prospective cohort study comparing ciprofol and propofol for sedation in hypotensive ICU patients. The patients in the ciprofol group (group 1) and propofol group (group 2) were sedated by ciprofol and propofol, respectively, during the resuscitation period. The sedation depth of patients in group 1 and group 2 was evaluated by a researcher who is not aware of the grouping. The patient's condition was evaluated by the Numerical Rating Scale of Acute Pain (0-10), Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS), and sedative drugs' dosage. The mean dosage of propofol, ciprofol, and norepinephrine was collected by researchers. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who met the RASS sedation state. Secondary endpoints included total dosage and duration of propofol and ciprofol, total dosage and duration of norepinephrine, duration of mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality rate, sedation-related complications (pain, delirium, and hypoventilation), and intraoperative time to extubation."

Newborns with complicated ECUN undergoing surgery have a high risk of complications with major post-operative morbidity and mortality. Laparoscopy decreases intra-abdominal pressure and induces a reduction in cytokines (blood inflammatory markers) in experimental animal models, in a clinical trial without surgery. We aim to assess whether laparoscopy reduces the extent of the inflammatory reaction in newborns requiring ECUN surgery.
Hypothesis: Laparoscopy reduces the inflammatory reaction in newborns with ECUN.
Objective: to compare the influence of laparoscopy on the short-term evolution of premature newborns with ECUN requiring surgery by evaluating in these newborns the clinical and inflammatory post-operative evolution between two groups: one undergoing laparoscopy and another undergoing only laparotomy.
Methods: this is a randomized controlled trial in single blind, in two parallel arms, in ratio 1:1. Premature infants of <37 weeks of age, presenting with ECUN after medical treatment, will be included. The main outcome will be the blood C reactive protein level evaluated between D0 and D2."

The investigators will perform basic experimental studies designed to quantify the perceptual experiences of retinal and cortical prosthesis patients. The investigators will produce visual percepts in CORTIVIS and Argus II patients either by directly stimulating electrodes (using FDA-approved pulse trains), or by asking them to view a computer or projector screen and using standard stimulation protocols (as is standardly used for their devices) to convert the computer or projector screen image into pulse trains on their electrodes. Informed by psychophysical data and computational models, the investigators will test the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks (e.g., object recognition, navigation). These encoding methods may include computer vision and machine learning methods to highlight important objects in the scene or to highlight nearby obstacles and may be tailored to each individual patient. Performance of prosthesis patients will be compared both across stimulus encoding methods and to performance in normally sighted control subjects viewing stimuli manipulated to match the expected perceptual experience of prosthesis patients."

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has identified specific stages for determining treatment for various types of cancer. Stage is determined based on lymph node status. Stage I indicates no regional nodal involvement, Stage IIa represents micrometastatic nodal involvement, Stage IIb represents nodal involvement in which the tumor is > 2cm in diameter with < 6 involved lymph nodes with at most one node > 2cm in diameter, Stage III represents nodal involvement with > 6 involved nodes, while Stage IV represents distant metastasis. High Risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) refers to tumors that are T3 in the AJCC staging system. In patients with early disease who are in good health, treatment consists of surgical removal of the primary tumor and dissection of the nearby lymph nodes. In patients with more advanced disease, treatment includes radiation with or without chemotherapy as well as surgical removal of the primary tumor. Immunosuppressed patients are defined as patients who have a transplanted organ or patients with Hematologic Malignancy and are on chronic chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive drugs. The lymph nodes are considered a safe haven for tumor cells, which can metastasize to the lymph nodes even with small primaries. Immunosuppressed patients have additional factors which may increase their risk of developing lymph node metastases such as cancer recurrence. The investigators of this study question the current AJCC staging system for immunosuppressed patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the head and neck, and whether ultrasound surveillance of the neck is an effective alternative of surgical removal of the lymph nodes and CT surveillance. The investigators believe that this study could provide valuable evidence to help determine the optimal management of head and neck cSCC in immunosuppressed patients. The hypothesis of this study is that immunosuppressed patients with stage IIa, IIb, and T3 cSCC benefit from ultrasound surveillance. The investigators propose to evaluate the time to nodal metastases, local recurrence, and overall mortality in these patients with ultrasound surveillance compared to a historical control with surgical removal of the lymph nodes. Approximately 200 immunosuppressed patients with high-risk HNSCC will be followed over a 2-year period and prospectively entered into a database. The investigators will compare time to nodal metastases, local recurrence, and overall mortality in participants who undergo ultrasound survey to those who are treated with traditional surgery. All participants are managed with active surveillance with no treatment until there is documentation of nodal metastases. Upon confirmation of nodal metastases, the participants are treated based on the decision of their treating physicians. The study is designed to allow for flexibility in this regard. Once this information has been completed, the investigators will conduct a retrospective review of the outcomes of 200 cSCC patients who received surgical management of the lymph nodes from 2008-2012 at Brigham and Women's Hospital. These data will be used to compare lymph node involvement and disease progression at 1, 2, and 3 years in the prospective cohorts who have undergone ultrasound surveillance with the historical controls who have undergone surgical removal of the lymph nodes. This observational design will help assess the appropriateness of the hypothesis and the potential reduction in complications associated with lymph node dissection. The study results will give insight into the risk of developing distant metastases in immunosuppressed patients. Ultrasound surveillance has the advantage of not requiring treatment for microscopic nodal metastases or small tumors in draining lymph nodes. Ultrasound surveillance offers the theoretical advantage of delaying the need for definitive treatment until later stages of disease progression. Ultrasound survey can help minimize surgical morbidity associated with radical surgical interventions for high-risk cSCC."

Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disease. Its clinical manifestations are unspecific and, consequently, its diagnosis is not easy, even if medical and dietary guidelines are available.
The diagnosis is supported by the finding of alarm symptoms and/or specific clinical findings (i.e. strictures and ulcers). When suspicion of GERD remains high despite normal MII-pH and endoscopy have returned normal results, the doctor can decide to perform the pH and intraluminal impedance monitoring (MII-pH) or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies repeated if it comes to normal results.
Salivary biomarkers for GERD could be useful in diagnosing infants with GERD, helping to perform the necessary diagnostic investigations and identifying the patients who really need the more invasive ones. At present, there are no evidences of the possible presence of salivary markers of GERD or the effectiveness of these markers in diagnosis.
Objectives: Investigated the differences in the salivary protein profile (proton pump-associated intracytoplasmic antigen- pepsinogen A and pepsinogen C; pepsinogen B; gastrin) and, possibly, in the electrolyte content, present in the saliva samples of infants with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux or suspected GERD, in order to search new biomarkers of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Methods: This study will include a case/control series.
The cases: 40 infants (males and females), aged 2 months to 12 months, hospitalized in the Pediatric Ward of our Institute with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, performed 24-hour MII-pH and the subsequent evaluation of GERD severity according to the standardized scales. The saliva samples will be collected during the execution of the MII-pH of the esophagus 24 hours, at defined time points, at least 2 hours after the last meal, so as to study the circadian variations of their composition."

The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to assess the feasibility of surgical exposure of palatally impacted upper canines with open-eruption technique using a surgical template. The secondary purpose of this study is to compare this method with the conventional free-hand surgical exposure. The upper jaw of the patient is scanned using an intraoral scanner and cone beam tomography. The scanning conditions are standardized. OnyxCeph™ software is used to register the digital impression with the digital reconstruction of the pre-operative CBCT scan by surface registration. A surgical template is designed to cover the palate, incisal, and occlusal surfaces of the dentition with an opening that outlines the window to be prepared to expose the impacted canine. Fused deposition modeling is used for the rapid prototyping of the surgical template. During continuous recruiting, sample size calculation is to be carried out to determine the actual number of patients included in this study. Two groups are studied. Patients rinse their oral cavity with 0.2% chlorhexidine solution before surgery and surgical interventions are performed under local anesthesia. Surgery is performed according to the conventional free-hand method in the control group and according to the surgical guide in the test group. The orthodontic wire is attached to the exposed canine after surgery. Patients are instructed to clean the wound with toothpaste and toothbrush and to rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine solution in the morning and in the evening for a week starting on the day after surgery. Anti-inflammatory drugs (25 mg diclofenac three times a day for 3 days) are prescribed to control postoperative pain. The patients are followed one year after surgery."

Prior to blood sampling, parents and children were initially informed about the study in Experiment 1-dry heat, Experiment 2-dry cold, and control groups, and their written and verbal consents were obtained. After obtaining consent, information about the child and family was collected by the researcher with the Child-Family Introductory Information Form before the procedure. After the family and the child were introduced to the measurement tools (Wong Baker Faces Pain Scale, Child Fair Anxiety Scale and Medical Procedures Fear Inventory) to be scored, it was explained to the child that his mother or father would be with him during the procedure, and he was taken to the intervention room. Before the blood sample collection, the child's fear and anxiety were evaluated using Child Fear Anxiety Scale. In Experiment 1-Dry Heat Application group, the electrical heating pad with temperature regulation was heated by the researcher and set to 42°C. After making sure that there were no contraindications (deterioration of skin integrity, etc.) in the application of the electrical heating pad device, a dry heat of 42°C was applied to the determined area with an electrical heating pad for 5 minutes. In Experiment 2-Dry Cold Application group, dry cold was applied to the determined area with a gel pad for 3 minutes after the researcher made sure that there were no contraindications (deterioration of skin integrity, etc.) in the application of the gel pad. In the Control group, blood sampling was performed according to the clinical routine, and no heat or cold application was made."

Choroidal melanoma is a condition that can lead to metastases as well as tumor progression if not adequately treated. Current treatment recommendations for large tumors in Brazil, which is where the study is being conducted, include plaque brachytheraphy with Iodine 125 or Ruthenium 106. However, plaque brachytheraphy is limited due to the inability to deliver a therapeutically adequate dose of radiation without the risk of retinal detachment or other complications. In order to control intraocular choroidal melanoma and avoid subsequent enucleation, an alternative treatment option to plaque brachytherapy is being explored: Intra-arterial Chemotherapy or IAC, followed by the standard treatment of plaque brachytheraphy.

The investigators hypothesize that intra-arterial chemotherapy will reduce the average tumor thickness in patients with primary choroidal melanoma, allowing subsequent brachytherapy as planned according to standard of care procedures.
The investigators aim to test the hypothesis that selective catheterization of the ophthalmic artery (with administration of 7.5mg of melphalan) and ruthenium 106 brachytherapy will reduce tumor thickness and decrease the risk for enucleation, with acceptable toxicity, in patients with primary choroidal melanomas with a thickness higher than 8 mm on B-scan ultrasound (USG) evaluation, according to a previously developed nomogram."

Trauma is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Knowing the incidence of injures, mechanisms of wounds, approaching strategies, and outcomes is essential to improving prevention and outcomes of trauma patients. Data registries are used worldwide to register severe cases in specialized centers. However, it is necessary to evaluate trauma cases in community hospitals where most of the patients are treated. In this study the investigators want to register trauma cases admitted to the Emergency Ward in a general rural hospital in Colombia during the first semester of 2023. They want to evaluate the characteristics of the injury mechanism, the severity of the injury, the proportion of patients needing intensive care and those treated in the ICU, the length of stay of patients in the hospital, the incidence of mechanical ventilation in trauma cases, the outcomes during hospitalization, discharge, or death. It is expected that with the data collected, the investigators can prioritize policies to prevent traumatic causes of injuries and to improve the management of trauma cases in general hospitals."

Lumbosacral spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common cause of disabling leg pain and back pain. It frequently goes untreated and can often negatively alter veterans quality of life. Noninvasive postural therapy (NIPT) is a treatment approach where patients are trained to maintain flexion when standing or walking. Flexion postures are known to limit lumbar stress and pain and improve activity level. We propose a small feasibility study to determine the initial effects of NIPT on mobility and pain in older adults with LSS. This study will recruit 10 older adults with LSS from the VA New Jersey Healthcare System and measure if NIPT can have a positive impact on symptoms and mobility over a six week period."

This study is being conducted to better understand how self-administered nitrous oxide (SANO) can improve the experience of urodynamic study (UDS)--testing to diagnose bladder conditions.
The main goal is to find out if nitrous oxide (N2O), also known as SANO, can make the UDS test more tolerable for people who may be at higher risk of having an uncomfortable experience.
SANO is a gas that is safe to inhale and is commonly used during medical procedures to help people handle pain or anxiety. The study will be conducted in the Urology Clinic in Seattle, Washington.
All eligible participants will be enrolled.
SANO will be used during the UDS test, which includes catheter placement (also called cystoscopy) and two runs of the test. Before the start of the procedure, SANO will be given to the participant through a gas mask. The dose of the gas will be adjusted based on the participant's comfort level but they won't be able to ask for more than allowed. SANO will be used during catheter placement at the start of the UDS. During the two runs, the participant will receive SANO (run 1) and then oxygen (run 2) or oxygen (run 1) and then SANO (run 2).
The study team will talk to the participants after the UDS is started but before it is stopped. Participants will be instructed to breathe out gently in the mask until they no longer smell gas. Participants will then be asked how their pain and anxiety levels were in the UDS test. Participants will also be asked about their overall experience of the procedure as well as issues with pain, anxiety, and bladder dysfunction. Study staff will not be given a copy of the participant's diary."

Background: The incidence of breast cancer in Latin America has become in recent years the most frequent neoplasia among women; in fact, the latest data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer show that its incidence has tripled in the region in the last 30 years. Although there are no known biological criteria for the development of breast cancer, evidence from case-control studies and genetic association shows that early childhood, such as abuse, and inadequate care such as maternal institutionalization, in addition to having the role of modifiable factors (e.g., smoking, obesity), also plays a key role in the genesis of the disease; all these data point to these early experiences of suffering an adverse experience (adverse childhood experience), as one of the possible causes of the increase in hormonal-responsive breast cancers (1).
Aim: The study aims to determine the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences in women recently treated for breast cancer and evaluate the quality of life of women in remission from breast cancer.
Methods: Population: This study will include 227 women treated for breast cancer in the Plenary Health Service of the University Hospital ""Dr. Juan A. Fernández"" Hospital at the University of San Martín de Porres, during the years 2019 and 2020, by appointment with the Oncology Outpatient Clinic or by phone. The sample will be recruited, through the medical staff, to complete the questionnaire; in addition, patients will be informed about the objectives and the study will be carried out through the voluntary participation of women who agreed to participate.
Instruments: Measures of adverse childhood experiences, quality of life, cancer recurrence fear, anxiety and depression, attachment, resilience, epigenetics and physiological measures.
Expected results: It is expected to increase the knowledge of nursing regarding the psychosocial aspects of breast cancer treatment in the Peruvian population. Thus, the results may allow the development of new psychoeducational intervention strategies aimed at decreasing the incidence of breast cancer."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer and the second cause of cancer-related mortality in men and women, respectively. Colonoscopy has been considered the gold standard for the detection of lesions in the mucosa (premalignant and malignant). Through recent technology, new tools have been launched to improve the quality and performance of colonoscopies. AI-assisted polyp detector systems based on artificial intelligence have been developed to facilitate the detection of premalignant and malignant lesions and minimize the missed lesions.
Official Title, Conditions, Intervention/Treatment, Study Type, Phase, Criteria, Design Details, and Study Plan: The investigators aim to assess the real-world effectiveness of AI-assisted polyp detector, in addition to the differences between experts and non-experts. The study will be conducted in a single study center in the city of San Lorenzo de Escorial, Madrid, Spain."

People with epilepsy who are planning for pregnancy or are pregnant have concerns about anti-seizure medication (ASM) treatment, as some ASMs increase the risk of major congenital malformations and can negatively influence cognitive outcomes in developing offspring. Non-pharmacologic epilepsy treatments, such as specialized diets like the low glycemic diet or the modified Atkins diet, are not well studied in pregnant people with epilepsy but have proven to be effective in reducing seizures in the non-pregnant population. Dietary influence on seizure control is likely multifactorial, and recent studies have shown that one mechanism of action is to cause changes in the gut microbiome and alter neuroactive downstream bacterial metabolites, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (Olson et al., 2018). The low glycemic index (LGI) diet is one of the most flexible dietary therapies for epilepsy, and it appears to be safe in pregnancy with positive health outcomes for both the mother and baby (Walsh et al., 2012). Unfortunately, little is known about the effectiveness and mechanism of the LGI diet in pregnant patients with epilepsy. Therefore, this study is proposed in which the LGI diet will be initiated in the first half of pregnancy and explore LGI diet tolerability, seizure frequency, and potential underlying mechanisms in the pregnant epilepsy population. Investigators will invite pregnant people with epilepsy up to 20 weeks gestation in the Brigham & Women's Epilepsy-Obstetrical clinic to participate in this study. Participants will choose to go on the low glycemic index diet or continue their standard diet, with a goal of enrolling 21 participants in an 1:2 intervention to control group ratio. Participants in the intervention group will meet with a dietician to initiate the diet and have ongoing dietician support and appointments. All participants will fill out diet questionnaires and provide a maximum of 3 stool samples and 3 blood samples. Dietary intervention will end when pregnancies end, and stool and blood samples will be collected up to 3 months postpartum. The main outcomes will be diet tolerability, seizure frequency, gut bacteria composition, and metabolite alterations.

Pancreatic cancer has a high rate of mortality and a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate less than 10%. The role of neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer in tumor control and resection remains uncertain. Immunotherapy may represent a new therapeutic approach for local control of tumor. Mesothelin is expressed in about 80% of pancreatic cancers. MSLN targeted CAR-T cells can elicit efficient lysis of cancer cells both in vitro (7, 8, 9, 10) and in vivo (11, 12). In a xeroxial model (Trojan) of pancreatic cancer, MSLN targeted CAR-T cells injection was able to significantly inhibit tumor growth, increase the rate of R0 resection, and improve survival. In the current feasibility study, MSLN-targeted CAR-T cells will be injected into PDAC by endoscopic ultrasonic guidance. The efficacy of neoadjuvant MSLN-targeted CAR-T injection before surgery will be evaluated by radiological changes, tumor volumetric changes measured by CT, rate of R0 resection, PFS, and OS rates."

Can you generate a summary of the provided trial?: A clinical trial titled ""Enhancing Therapy Adherence Among Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients: the Study Protocol"" was carried out at European Institute of Oncology (IEO) and aims to determine the effectiveness of a smartphone application called ""TREAT"" in fostering oral anticancer treatments adherence for metastatic breast cancer patients. To this end, 100 Italian patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) under oral anticancer treatment will be recruited. The intervention group (n=60) will receive a training session on how to use the ""TREAT"" application which is composed by 4 section: information about MBC condition (e.g. physical and psychological effects of MBC), information about adherence (e.g. importance of medication adherence in MBC), resources and tools for promoting adherence (e.g. educational videos or articles), and information and tips for supporting the management of side effects. For the first 3-months, patients will be monitored using weekly medication intake diaries to assess compliance, medication-related risks and side effects. Then, the same procedures will be repeated at 6 months. At the end of the first year, data about patients adherence to anticancer treatment will be correlated with the predictive model of the same trial for identifying potential factors associated with adherence to anticancer treatment. Finally, the effectiveness of the ""TREAT"" application will be evaluated as well and compared with the adherence and outcomes of the control group."

Dialysis, a treatment for end-stage kidney disease, is performed either peritoneally (PD) or via a surgically created avenous fistula. Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) is preferred by older dialysis patients and is better tolerated than hemodialysis. Although dialysis adequately removes waste products from the blood, it causes dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients. A better lipid profile and less oxidative stress, which lower CVD risk, are needed to improve quality of life and survival in these patients. CVD risk markers include: lipids, glycemic markers, inflammatory markers, and bone metabolism markers. Bone metabolism is negatively affected by dialysis, putting patients at high risk for fractures, bone loss, and osteoporosis. Oxidative stress also contributes to inflammation and CVD. The main objective of this study is to compare the effect of melatonin versus a placebo on these clinical factors in 34 PD patients. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with melatonin for three months will significantly improve the lipid profile, glycemic markers, inflammatory markers and bone metabolism markers in PD patients.
Inclusion Criterion for patients:
Patients with end-stage renal disease in peritoneal dialysis who are willing to take part in the study for three months.

Oxygen delivery (DO2) is defined as the amount of oxygen reaching tissue and is commonly monitored during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Adequate DO2 is one of the goals of anesthesiology and perfusion management during cardiac surgery. However, the relationship between DO2 and the outcome of patients is unclear. It is essential to provide adequate but not excessive oxygen delivery by balancing the use of oxygen, transfusion of blood, blood products and inotropic infusions. In addition, the optimal management of perioperative DO2 remains a matter of debate with no recommendations on DO2 thresholds. Anesthesia, perioperative blood management strategies, surgical duration and complexity as well as type of cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and postoperative complications impact DO2. In this study the investigators focus on identifying perioperative factors that could influence DO2 to help clinicians in their goal directed optimization of perfusion.

The investigators will collect clinical, biochemical, physiological and procedural data of all patients with DO2 monitoring during CPB in cardiac surgery at the university hospital of Lille, France for 7 consecutive weeks.

Patients who agree to participate will have DO2 measured during CPB as part of their standard care practice. Patients are enrolled after giving their informed consent.
In order to respect the European regulation concerning Clinical Trial and patient right; all patients will undergo DO2 monitoring during cardiopulmonary bypass, whatever their consent choice; patients who are not included will be managed as part of their usual care. The investigators will retrospectively collect data from those patients.
Routine perioperative care, including management of hemodynamic and perfusion goals, anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, and cardiac surgery itself, will be conducted as per the usual practice at the University hospital of Lille, France."

Background
------ 
Diabetes mellitus type 2 is the most prevalent form of diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by insulin resistance and beta cell failure in the context of low-grade systemic inflammation. Insulin resistance causes hyperglycemia and altered glucose and lipid metabolism, which leads to dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease and increased morbidity. Nitazoxanide is an antiparasitic drug that has been used for the treatment of helminthic parasites and protozoan orchidiasis. In some cases, beneficial effects with anti-inflammatory properties have been described. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of nitazoxanide as adjuvant therapy of antidiabetic treatment of type II diabetes mellitus.
Objective
------ 
To evaluate the efficiency of nitazoxanide in patients with type II diabetes mellitus taking metformin and DPP-4 inhibitor.
Eligibility criteria
-----------------
Inclusion criteria: Glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) between 7% and 9%.
Body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2.
Exclusion criteria: pregnant or nursing women.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Liver disease ( alanine ( Alanine) aminotransferase > 3 upper normal limit )
Kidney disease ( estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 )
Inflammatory bowel diseases.
History of allergy and/or adverse reactions to the drugs used in the study.

Design
-----------------
Prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled, parallel-group study.
Participants will be randomly allocated into the study and control groups by stratified randomization. In one group (Group 2), participants will take nitazoxanide 500 mg orally twice daily in addition to metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors (such as vildagliptin) and in another group (Group 1), participants will receive metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors (such as vildagliptin). Interventions will be performed for a period of 12 weeks.
Nitazoxanide 5000 mg capsules were manufactured by TAPI Pharmaceutical Industry Co., Ltd. (Drug number: T04-28).
The drugs will be given once daily in the morning for 14 days, one day a week for 8 weeks, and once daily in the evening for 3 weeks. Metformin 1000 mg and DPP-4 inhibitor (Vildagliptin 50 mg) will be taken once daily in the morning.
The treatment duration in each group will be 12 weeks.
After 3 months of treatment, all participants who are not withdrawn during the trial period will be assigned into the efficacy analysis set (EAS) for each group, and the mean change of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin level, HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides and asprosin and A-kinase anchoring protein 1 serum levels will be calculated between the baseline and end-of-treatment visit in each group. The adverse effects in each group will also be assessed between the baseline and end-of-treatment visit in each group. The efficacy visit will be conducted after 3 months of treatment or 12 weeks visit. The follow-up visit will be conducted 24 hours after the 12 weeks treatment. One month (28 days) after the enrolment date, participants of control group will start to take the metformin and DPP-4 inhibitor (Vildagliptin 50 mg) and nitazoxanide 500mg capsules twice daily in addition to metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors (such as vildagliptin). Two months (56 days) after the enrolment date, all participants will make the 12 weeks efficacy visit for the control group and end-of-treatment visit for the nitazoxanide group. If the study drug is missed, the participants will be instructed to take it as soon as possible during the day, and if the missed dose is beyond 12 hours, the"

Money is a critical factor for survival. It is especially important for the mental health community who needs to ensure their mental well-being and stability in the future. Even for those who were stable, their families need to pay close attention to their expenses in order to prevent the relapse from their illness. One of the best ways to save money is to manage it properly. Financial problem is a commonly associated factor with relapse of mental disorder and may be a contributing factor to readmission. Financial well-being and stability have become one of the key factors to ensure the continuation of treatment and prevent relapse of mental illness. Money management skills can also prevent the risk of financial scam, which are increasingly common in the aging population.
A recent survey from the Financial Services Authority found that there are about 100,000 scam victims every year in Hong Kong, with the lost amount up to HK $3 billion. With an improving economic situation and an increasing online market, the financial scam problem is on the rise and is expected to increase rapidly. The current treatment from traditional mental health services does not include appropriate training in money management for the vulnerable patients. As a result, even for those who are stable, they are likely to fall into problems when they come into contact with scammers, which may cause relapse of their illness.
There is a growing body of evidence showing the positive effect of money management skills in promoting positive attitude, increasing effective coping strategies, and prevent risky financial behaviour. This research aims to develop an online money management course for the mental health community in Hong Kong to ensure their financial stability, reduce the risk of financial exploitation and prevent relapse of their mental illness. This project is also in response to the increasing financial fraud in Hong Kong. Previous research on money management skill training is mainly conducted through face-to-face interaction. There is a lack of work on internet intervention for this population. This study will provide evidence on the efficacy of an internet-based money management program for the mental health community. This study will also provide evidence for policy makers to implement an online system in helping the mental health community to manage their finances. Based on the findings from this study, a sustainable online course can be developed to reach more individuals in need of financial management skills with minimal cost."

A patient's socioeconomic status (SES) should not predict their post-stroke disability but individuals with low SES are more disabled and have higher mortality rates compared to individuals with high SES. These inequities are not isolated to low- and middle-income countries. In the United States, individuals with low SES are more disabled at 3 months and less likely to be independently ambulatory or discharged to their own homes. There are many factors contributing to these outcomes; however, one critical feature is access to affordable care. Many newly developed rehabilitation therapies and technologies require expensive equipment (e.g. instrumented treadmills, transcranial magnetic stimulation) and extensive training for clinical staff. The extra costs (financial and training) ensure that these state-of-the-art options are only available at metropolitan, well-funded institutions or to individuals who can afford additional healthcare costs. There is an urgent need for accessible, low-cost solutions capable of being delivered at underfunded hospitals and to individuals with no or low insurance coverage. Startle Adjuvant Rehabilitation Therapy (START) represents an accessible and low-cost solution that can be delivered to rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. START is the application of a startling, acoustic stimulus alongside traditional therapy. Distinct from other auditory treatments (e.g. metronome, music), administration of a START represents an endogenous activation of the brainstem (i.e. reticular formation) a phenomenon referred to as startReact. Rather than being a standalone treatment, START is applied within a standard clinical practice to enhance and accelerate skill re-learning through activation of the brainstem. START has been advanced as an adjuvant therapy tool because of the profound way it enhances training outcomes in individuals with stroke, in particular severe stroke. This is particularly compelling given the high degree of difficulty in generating functional changes in individuals with chronic, severe stroke. There is emerging evidence that individuals with stroke strengthen ipsilateral reticulospinal connections during the process of recovery. Thus, START may represent a priming of the nervous system to engage the reticular formation, which is nearly always spared post-stroke, during therapy to enhance both training and long-term outcomes. START's application is a loud, acoustic stimulus timed with planned motor activity and can be administered via headphones. Unlike many new rehabilitation devices/techniques, START represents an extremely safe intervention (the application is a loud sound well beneath OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) regulations with no reported adverse reactions since its discovery). Thus, clinical staff training and safety protocols are minimal further decreasing application costs. Finally, it is mobile and easily packaged, so it can be administered via the increasing number of telemedicine programs designed for rural populations. Finally, START allows severe stroke survivors to participate in and benefit from therapy. The benefits of START are not contained to severe stroke survivors (e.g. improvement of hand extension in mildly disabled patients) but the capacity of START to work in severe patients significantly increases the potential of this tool to assist patients across all levels of disability."

Endobronchial valves (EBV) can be placed in lobes of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-COPD to treat hyperinflation and dyspnea. However, there is no data on whether EBV also improve or preserve diaphragmatic function and conformation in these patients.
The investigators plan to undertake a prospective non-randomized controlled monocentric study on hyperinflated COPD patients without collateral ventilation in which all patients have EBV. Eligible patients (FEV1 < 50% of the predicted value, Rv/Tc > 350 and the presence of homogeneous emphysema).
Before and after EBV, the investigators will assess the diaphragm strength and conformation by the measurement of the transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) and diaphragm conformation (diaphragmetric fibers, area and radius of curvature) using high resolution computed tomography.
The hypothesis is that the endoscopic lung volume reduction performed with EBV should improve diaphragmatic strength and conformation in COPD patients."

Carious lesions of teeth can be restored with direct filling of restorative materials. The majority of restorations in the posterior area are prepared using Class I cavity preparation. Two-step resin-based composite restorations were introduced in 1988 as alternative filling materials in direct restoration. However, these resins needed sufficient light-curing intensity and time, and this increased treatment time. Recently, bulk-fill resin composites have been developed to decrease the treatment time significantly. In vitro studies have suggested that both dual- and light-cure bulk-fill resin composites showed no difference in their physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. On the other hand, the clinical performance of the newly developed bulk-fill resin composites was not evaluated so far. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the 2-year clinical performance of the tested bulk-fill resin composites using the FDI criteria of esthetic, functional, and biological properties in Class I cavity preparations, compared to conventional dual-cure restorative material."

The NET RETREAT study involves 80 patients with metastatic/unresectable midgut neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), a rare subtype of cancer that originates in the gut. NETs are not normally regarded as curable, but there may be effective alternative treatments that should be tested. The trial compares retreatment with a type of treatment called everolimus to standard treatment using a drug called 177 lumetate DOTATATE (dottoreotide).
Patients on the trial will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, to make sure that both groups have a similar number of people with certain characteristics that could affect the results, such as the type of tumor they have or how far it has spread. One group may receive 3 or 4 cycles of standard 177 Lu DOTATATE. The other group will not be treated with 177 Lu DOTATATE but instead will receive everolimus, a treatment which has recently been approved for NETs.
The 177 Lu DOTATATE will be given to the body (through a drip or a tube) every 8 weeks until the liver, kidney, and bone marrow are able to clear it from the body. This will typically involve 2 repeats of treatment each year and will be given as part of your routine visits. Blood tests will be done at the beginning of each treatment to check the level of the hormone that carries the radiation (thyroid hormone) and the level of protein used to bind the radiation to the tumour (EDTMP).
Over the 18 month (1.5 year) trial period, patients will have additional tests to check how their disease is responding to treatment. These tests include a physical examination, medical history, blood tests and scans. Quality of life questionnaires are filled out at weeks 2, 22, 36 and every 6 weeks (7 times, up to 32 months) from baseline while a diary for patients on everolimus are filled out at weeks 1 and 4 of cycles two to six.
Once patients stop receiving 177 Lu DOTATATE, further blood tests and scans will be done every 3 months for 2 years to look for disease progression, and a further scans may be required if disease progression is suspected. Patients who are not responding to 177 Lu DOTATATE or everolimus may switch to the other treatment option.
Some patients who are on everolimus are able to cross over to 177 Lu DOTATATE after disease progression. This decision will not be determined by the trial team, but the patients can discuss their options with their treating oncologist. For patients who have never received 177 Lu DOTATATE, this cross-over is planned once disease progression has been confirmed by cross-sectional imaging (CT, MRI, PET scan).
The aim of this trial is to improve our knowledge about NETs, to help doctors decide which treatment to offer to patients, to help doctors monitor the progress of the disease, to improve the quality of life of patients and, most importantly, to improve survival for patients."

Children with achondroplasia are often treated with growth hormone, a treatment that results in improvement in growth, but does not significantly affect overall body proportions, which continues to cause functional limitations and medical complications for these individuals over the course of their lives. The study will investigate an investigational medication called TransCon CNP, which helps to increase the amount of collagen that is produced in the body. This medication may help to increase the growth rate and body proportions of individuals with achondroplasia."

Background: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is a rapidly increasing condition that has posed a growing health care problem. People with PAF experience various challenges, which in turn results in significantly impaired quality of life (QOL). However, few studies have specifically focused on the health-related QOL (HRQoL) of patients with PAF. Objective: This study aims to explore the influences of illness perceptions and coping styles among patients with PAF on their HRQoL by using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). Methods: In this observational study, 150 individuals newly diagnosed with PAF will be recruited from the outpatient unit. The data will be collected through an online survey consisting of the 12-item short form health survey (SF-12) (including the physical and mental component summary (PCS and MCS) scores, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire Revised (B-IPQ-Rev), Coping Orientation to Problem Experiences (COPE), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Socio-demographic questionnaire. We assume that illness perceptions and coping styles have a significant influence on HRQOL. A multiple regression model will be used to determine the mediating effects of self-efficacy, depression and anxiety, and coping on the relationship among illness perceptions, coping styles, and HRQOL among the 150 people newly diagnosed with PAF. Conclusion: Understanding the factors influencing the HRQoL of people with PAF is critical to assessing the holistic benefits of the disease management services provided. This research would contribute to the development of health care delivery models for better supporting the management of PAF.

This study is designed to evaluate the impact of the center volume-outcome relationship and that on mortality which remain poorly understood. A better understanding of the determinants of outcome in patients undergoing surgery could support decision making, aid in the design of service delivery, and improve outcomes for surviving patients who are referred to specialized centers for treatment of aortic disease. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate outcome predictors in patients undergoing surgery for TAAD, including clinical and perioperative variables as well as to evaluate the incidence of complications beyond 30 days of surgery. Finally, the study will define the long-term clinical course of these patients, including those with a previous aortic surgery, such as Bentall procedure.

Inclusion criteria: Patients aged greater than 18 years, with ascending aortic dissection or intramural hematoma involving the ascending aorta, experiencing a symptom onset within 7 days from surgery, scheduled for a primary surgical repair for acute TAAD, or for any other major cardiac surgical procedure, if concomitant.

Exclusion criteria: Patient aged less than 18 years, onset of symptoms more than 7 days from surgery, concomitant endocarditis or TAAD secondary to blunt or penetrating chest trauma.

Patients will be recruited by the cardiac surgical unit at 14 centers in Europe.
The procedures under evaluation will be:
1. Ascending Aorta Replacement (AAR) with or without Hemiarch Repair
2. Ascending Aorta Replacement (AAR) with Aortic Root Replacement (ARR)
3. Ascending Aorta Replacement (AAR) with Total Arch Replacement (TARP)
4. Root and Ascending Aorta Replacement with Total Arch Replacement

The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of operative mortality within 30 days from the procedure and the incidence of mesenteric ischemia beyond 30 days. The secondary objectives include the determination of the incidence of permanent new neurologic deficit within 30 days from the procedure, the incidence of major adverse events, the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction, the incidence of acute heart failure, the incidence of transient neurologic deficit, the incidence of spinal cord injury, the incidence of acute kidney injury, the incidence of bleeding, the incidence of reoperation for bleeding, the incidence of mechanical circulatory support, the incidence of major pulmonary events, the incidence of need for reintervention, the incidence of late survival rate and the incidence of mortality 30 days from surgery among patients who have had a previous Bentall procedure.

The study will be conducted on a prospective basis. All the enrolling patients will receive routine care. This will include surgical management of dissection or TAAAD, management of their concomitant illnesses, pre-and post-operative care and appropriate medication during and after hospital stay.

The data required for the management of the patients will be collected prior to recruitment as per conventional practice. Further data will be collected at specific time period after hospital admission and discharge, that is 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years and 18 years. This approach is appropriate due to the importance of long term follow up and for the completeness of data.

After the 30 days post-operative period, follow-up will be done at specific time period after hospital discharge for survival, re-intervention and complications. The follow-up is crucial and it will ensure the long-term safety of the patients undergoing various procedures described in the current protocol since these procedures are performed only in patients with acute aortic dissection at high risk for early and late mortality."

The aim of this experimental and quasi-experimental clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of virtual reality and traditional meditation method in medical students of the degree of Physiotherapy and Nursing about the academic stress (primary outcome), perceived stress the last month (primary outcome), blood pressure (secondary outcome), maximal heart rate (secondary outcome) and salivary cortisol level just before exams (secondary outcome). Also, between-group differences in qualifications of exams will be registered. It is an experimental and quasi-experimental randomized clinical trial with three groups. Two groups will be submitted to an intervention (EG1 and EG2) and one group will be used as control (CG). The main intervention will be visualizing exams through virtual reality glasses, and the control group will receive the same intervention, but through traditional visualization method. This study will be carried out with students from the 6th and 7th semesters who are enrolled in at least 80% of subjects of an ongoing academic course. Participants will visualize the exam in a specific computer of our University. As the primary outcomes, between-group and intra-group differences in academic stress, which will be registered with the SISCO Inventory version-21, and perceived stress of the last month, which will be registered with the Perceived Stress Scale. As the secondary outcomes, between-group differences in the level of current perceived stress just at the moment prior to start the exam, blood pressure, maximal heart rate and salivary cortisol level just before starting the exam. Finally, as a secondary outcome, between-group differences in qualifications of exams will be registered (it will be pondered by the average qualification of the degree for each student). 140 students will be recruited, and they will be allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio into the three groups (EG1, EG2 and CG) by using a parallel assignment and blocked randomization. No one, at any time, and not even the principal investigator, will be able to know the allocation until the last visit of each participant."

Obesity is now a huge global problem and the number of morbidly obese patients who need surgical treatment, including sleeve gastrectomy, is steadily increasing. Recently, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been actively performed to reduce morbid obesity symptoms, and LSG helps solve obesity and its complications. General anesthesia is required because of the large-scale surgery such as LSG. However, there can be a risk of systemic hemodynamic instability and hypotension according to the anesthetic drugs used during induction of anesthesia of morbidly obese LSG patients.
Remimazolam, a new short-acting benzodiazepine, has been used as an anesthetic induction agent instead of other traditional inhalation anesthetics because of its clinical benefits of stable hemodynamics and faster awakening. Especially, with the recent trend of using remimazolam as an anesthetic induction agent, there is a need for a clinical trial to verify its advantages. On the other hand, propofol is a traditional induction agent as a clinical anesthesia standard, and although it is a potent drug with quick onset of action, it also has the disadvantage of a rapid offset of action (too short to maintain the surgical effect) and rapid awakening compared to remimazolam. The remimazolam group showed lower systemic hemodynamic instability rates without the use of vasoactives, which can be important for rapid postoperative awakening in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who maintain upper airway function during surgical intervention.

Recently, remimazolam has been used as an anesthetic induction agent in the cases of both LSG and bariatric obesity surgery, but no related study has been conducted in comparison to propofol. Especially, there are no studies for the rate of hypotension at induction during LSG with Remimazolam. By comparing remimazolam and propofol, we can find the benefits of remimazolam in clinical efficacy and safety. Therefore, we performed randomized controlled experiments to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anesthesia induction drug administration (remimazolam versus propofol) in 80 normal or morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG. It also provides a basis for evaluating remimazolam's advantages in the clinical setting.

The primary purpose of this clinical research is treatment evaluation. In addition, various parameters are measured such as blood pressure, heart rate, and ephedrine doses, and the incidences of adverse events during anesthesia are monitored. The expected outcome of this study is a low incidence of hypotension by comparing the incidence of hypotension during induction between the Remimazolam group and the propofol group."

This is a single-group, phase II study of darolutamide along with leuprolide acetate and exemestane in recurrent adult-type granulosa cell tumor (AGCT). Patients have measurable disease as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI. Patients must have had >= 1 treatment regimen.
Safety will be assessed beginning with the initial dose of any treatment. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies of maximum grade of adverse events by term and category will be reported. Patients receive exemestane PO QD and darolutamide PO BID starting on days -14 to -7 prior to C1D1 and then on days 1-28 of each cycle. Patients also receive leuprolide acetate IM on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Patients must have a prior or concurrent diagnosis of recurrent adult-type ovarian granulosa cell tumor (AGCT). Adequate health must permit completion of the study requirements and required follow-up. Patients must have measurable disease and >= 1 treatment regimen. For example, a prior or concurrent line of treatment with an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole, exemestane, anastrozole). Patients must not be pregnant and must agree to use adequate birth control while on study. Tissue is required. The effects of the combination of darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane on the developing human fetus are unknown and androgen receptor inhibitor agents may be teratogenic."

This is an observational cohort study using MRI to measure gastrointestinal (GI) function, lung structure and function and liver endpoints in children with CF aged 6 to 11 years. The study will use a modified version of the protocol used in the GIFT-CF3 study (NCT04618185) to measure GI physiology in addition to MRI measures of lung and liver structure and function. The aim is to identify whether these measures are changed before and after starting ETI. For the CF participants, to be enrolled in the study they must be homozygous or have at least 1 copy of the Phe508del mutation, which would mean they are eligible for ETI treatment. The modified MRI protocol, taken from NCT04618185, has been shortened to include scans that are taken over three timepoints. These timepoints are determined around the ingestion of a test meal which has been previously described. Participants will arrive fasted before having a baseline scan. After their first scan they will eat their first standardised high fat meal followed by a second standardised high fat meal around 240 minutes after. MRI scans to assess GI function will be taken at baseline (fasted), 240 minutes post ingestion of a breakfast meal (T240) and 300 minutes post breakfast (T300). Liver scans will also be taken at baseline and lung scans taken opportunistically at the T240 timepoint. In total, participants will be asked to remain in the MRI scanner for approximately 30 minutes at a time. For comfort, participants will be able to watch multimedia programmes through the use of a specially adapted television while in the scanner. Participants will also be asked to complete validated gastrointestinal questionnaires throughout the study day and recall their GI symptoms over the previous 2 weeks and complete a 3 day food diary. The study will be split into two phases. The first will be a pilot phase where 3 children with CF aged 6 to 11 years and 3 healthy age and gender matched controls undergo MRI scanning. These scans will be assessed to determine whether the scan protocol can be completed by the participants and assess the quality of the images obtained. If successful, the trial will progress onto the main phase. In the main phase, the 12 additional children with CF will be recruited and undergo the above scanning protocol, prior to starting ETI. We will then ask participants to return for a repeat scans approximately 6 months after starting ETI."

Hypospadias repair surgery is an invasive surgery that results in significant postoperative pain. pain alters the quality of life and satisfaction of the patients and results in manipulation of wounds, infection, bleeding, and wound dehiscence leading to unfavorable surgical outcome . As a plan for postoperative pain prophylaxis in children, different analgesic techniques have been used as preemptive analgesia such as local infiltration of anesthesia, penile block, epidural block and caudal block in addition to general anesthesia. Caudal block is found to be one of most succeeded technique in hypospadias repair and decreases the postoperative analgesia consumption. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic commonly used via caudal epidural route but gives limited duration of analgesia. Therefore, the addition of other drugs in an attempt to improve the quality and duration of analgesia given by bupivacaine has been studied. Examples of additives drugs used in the caudal epidural are opioids, alpha 2 agonist as dexmedtomidine and clonidine which produce prolongation of the duration of the analgesia, but their undesirable effect may limit its use as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression. Epidural corticosteroids have a long history of safe and effective use in the treatment of low back and radicular pain due to their strong anti-inflammatory effect encouraging use in management of acute postoperative pain. In pediatric surgical patients presenting for mainly lower abdominal surgery, a meta-analysis revealed clinically meaningful prolongation of the duration of analgesia from caudal blockade by adjuvant dexamethasone versus placebo. In addition to doubling to tripling the duration of analgesia, adjuvant dexamethasone has a rescue analgesia sparing effect and reduces post postoperative nausea and vomiting. A vast majority of literature supports the efficacy of particulate steroids like methylprednisolone over dexamethasone in providing longer analgesia in management of chronic pain conditions. Aim of the work and hypothesis: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that will evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of caudal methylprednisolone in pediatric patients. This randomized, double-blind, controlled bi-center study was designed to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in caudal block for children undergoing hypospadias surgical repair using the duration of analgesia as the primary outcome. The investigators hypothesize that methylprednisolone will provide superior postoperative analgesia than dexamethasone when added to bupivacaine for caudal block."

Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) holds great promise as one of the best solutions to expand the donor pool and overcome the donor shortage in lung transplantation. Despite increasing interest in this new technique, the current clinical practice of using EVLP is not without controversy. Although the quality of lungs reconditioned by EVLP is superior to the lungs discarded in standard transplant center, the quality of accepted lungs is still inferior to the lungs accepted in standard practice. 
Our aim is therefore to include an additional device treatment, HDF, in EVLP. This new therapeutic approach could improve the quality of accepted lungs and the outcome of transplanted patients. Currently, the role of dialysis or hemodiafiltration (HDF) in the process of lung reconditioning remains unclear. The addition of a dialyzer and blood-purifying treatment device, HDF, in the lung recovery process could result in improved outcome of transplanted lungs. In our setting, we will assess the impact of HDF on lung regeneration. After exclusion and acceptance of organs on the basis of ISHLT criteria, a subset of lungs will be further evaluated by X-ray and bronchoscopy in the standard setting. The additional step would be the assessment of lung function after 1 hour reconditioning.
Study patients in which the lung function tests are positive, will be randomized to either standard EVLP (without adding a dialyzer) or EVLP plus HDF (an external blood-circulating pump and an additional dialyzer will be added). This will allow us to compare outcomes between the two groups. At the end of the perfusion period, the lungs received by HDF will be compared to controls with standard EVLP. Parameters assessed will be oxygenation, lung compliance, airway secretion volume and cell counts, pH, and inflammatory markers. A subset of donor lungs (tissue biopsies and BAL-samples) will be evaluated for inflammatory markers. We will also perform a complete bronchoscopic evaluation using narrow banded imaging. After completion of the standard perfusion protocol, we can observe any differences that we will expect to find in the tissue markers of this group of lungs.
There are two potential explanations for how EVLP plus HDF works in lung reconditioning. The first explanation is that HDF and reconditioning of cells and matrix may be directly related. The second explanation is that HDF may serve as a lung support therapy that allows the endothelium to recover in vivo and maintain its function (and thus oxygenation), leading to acceptance of lungs which would not been accepted otherwise. By accepting the lungs of older donors with a low functional status, the number of available organs will dramatically increase.
The use of HDF will allow us to investigate the role of plasma clearance and detoxification in lung reconditioning. There are several factors that support this thesis. Our group has shown that in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in patients with lung cancer, the severity of the illness and the plasma concentration of inflammatory markers like TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and CRP are correlated with lung function. Moreover, extracorporeal blood purification is known to lower those inflammatory mediators and to be beneficial in ARDS. Another example of EVLP and HDF that support this approach is the report by Kocan et al. Of the 19 lung transplantation patients in this report, 17 received some type of pretransplant EVLP and HDF. In the last transplanted lung of this study (an 80 year old recipient) the lung recovered after 6 hours of EVLP and HDF, which was not possible prior to the addition of HDF. Moreover, the addition of this HDF system seems to be safe. Recently, an increasing number of studies have shown the beneficial effects of HDF in various patient populations. All those studies will contribute to the establishment of an evidence base that supports the introduction of HDF as a method of reconditioning damaged lungs. Based on the evidence, a significant impact of the addition of an HDF system in the lung reconditioning process can be expected and thus the ability to accept organs from a previously underrepresented part of the donor pool may increase.
In the present study we will investigate the impact of HDF on the regeneration of marginal donor lungs after 6 hours of EVLP. Additionally, we will compare the EVLP plus HDF with our current practice of using standard EVLP. Outcome variables that will be measured will include standard lung function tests, microscopic aspects and function of the lung, plasma concentrations of inflammatory mediators"

Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) is a validated and widely used tool designed to assess pain in preterm infants. A randomized controlled experimental design was employed, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensorial stimulation group. The white noise group received auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensorial stimulation group received additional visual and tactile stimuli during the retinopathy examination. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated (retinopathy) examination protocols for premature infants. By comparing the effects of white noise and multisensorial stimulation, the study aims to provide insights into the most suitable intervention that can optimize the examination process, improve examination success rates, and minimize potential discomfort or distress experienced by infants. It is anticipated that the results of this study will inform healthcare professionals and researchers about the benefits of auditory stimulation (white noise) and the additional advantages of multisensorial stimulation during retinopathy examinations. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the overall quality of care provided to premature infants, leading to improved visual outcomes and long-term well-being for this vulnerable population."

Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a common disease contributing to dry eye disease (DED). Several methods used to evaluate and classify MGD have shown limitations.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified calculation formula for MGD grading (modified MG grading) in MGD patients diagnosed with both objective and subjective symptoms. The investigators also aim to evaluate the reproducibility and repeatability of the modified formula.
Participants recruited for the study will be classified using the LipiView (TearScience, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA) method. 150 patients diagnosed with MGD will be randomly divided into two groups. The first group will be evaluated by the old calculation formula, and the second group will receive evaluation by the modified calculation formula. The following parameters are obtained to calculate MG grading: The area of the MGs and the whole eyelids will be measured by the investigators, and the corneal width from inferior to superior (WTW distance) of the cornea will be measured using the IOLMaster device (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany). Corneal WTW distance and the area of the MGs and the whole eyelids calculated by both formulas in each patient will be compared and evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) analysis to determine intraindividual and interindividual reproducibility of the measurement. The investigators also obtain subjective symptoms such as irritation, dryness, burning, and pain. It is expected that a calculation formula with a wider calculation area of the formula, which is more accurate to diagnose the state of the tear film, will be developed, and its reproducibility and repeatability will be investigated."

Oral Mucositis (OM) is a common and severe side-effect of chemoradiation therapy. OM manifests as erythema, mucosal friability/erosion and pain. Oral Mucositis is an important determinant of treatment tolerance and quality of life of patients. Several preventive approaches have been explored, including topical and systemic administration of growth factors and nutrients. Among them, zinc gluconate (ZG), a common dietary supplement, is known to influence immune responses and to exert protective effects against oral mucositis in animal models. Recently, zinc has been administered directly to the oral cavity using a gel-based formulation allowing the local prevention of mucositis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. However, so far this approach has never been tested as a randomized controlled trial (RCT), because RCTs are not sufficiently reliable to determine the true effects of such interventions. We propose to test the efficacy of ZG-based oral rinses (or lozenges) vs. standard care in a large multi-center RCT in patients undergoing radiotherapy for malignant lesion of the upper aerodigestive tract. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of zinc-gluconate gel for prevention of radiation-induced oral mucositis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

Periodontal Diseases (PD) are not completely controlled. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), at least 30% of the world's population aged 35-45 years has severe or very severe periodontitis. As of 2017, approximately 15% of the European adult populations suffered from periodontal diseases. The current diagnostic methods are not sufficient to distinguish the level of severity of the disease. With new scientific findings, especially from the area of biomarkers in saliva, the diagnostic of the disease and the progression can be distinguished.
This study has designed 21 biomarker-salivary-analytes to diagnose the severity of the disease in the early period. For inclusion in the study-patient groups, in periodontally healthy, gingiva patient, patients with treated & stable periodontitis, patients with treated & unstable periodontitis, patients with periodontitis stage-I & II and patients with periodontitis stage III and IV is planned.
The total number of participants calculated for each periodontal health status is 360 (3 groups of patients, healthy, periodontitis stage I/II and stage III/IV, all in 3 levels of severity of the disease). The total study population was calculated as 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 participants. Based on the number of people required for the study, the number of patients examined will be based on the inclusion, exclusion and drop-out criteria determined by the study."

The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of white noise, heart sounds, or music that the mother listened to most frequently during pregnancy on reducing neonatal pain during heel lance. It was hypothesized that listening to heart sounds and music can reduce the pain of the infant compared to white noise.
                The design of the study is a randomized controlled experimental design. The sample of the study was chosen as 84 infants with a gestational age of 28-42 weeks. Infants in the first group listened to white noise, while those in the second and third groups listened to heart sounds (at an average rate of 70 beats/min) and music (which the mother listened to most frequently during pregnancy at a rate of 70 beats/min), respectively. The NIAPAS pain score, the duration of the procedure, and the crying time were recorded.
                As a result of the study, it was found that using music that mother listens to most frequently in a heel lance significantly reduced neonatal pain and also crying time. The researchers stated that mothers should be aware of the effect of music, white noise sound, and heart sound and should take this into account, especially while in the hospital."

This retrospective study evaluates the verbal scores of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) before and after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Children aged 2 - 17 years diagnosed with ASD by a qualified practitioner who completed a verbal test every six months (either VBMAPP or the ABLLS) were screened for eligibility. Those who elected to receive HBOT received 40 sessions of 60 minutes in an HBOT chamber at 2.0 ATA. Those who did not receive HBOT also received verbal testing every six months. The verbal scores of the treatment group of subjects were compared to those who did not receive treatment and found to be non-significant. The primary outcome measures were change in verbal scores from baseline at 6 months (VBMAPP and ABLLS). The verbal scores were significantly higher for children aged 10 - 12. The VBMAPP scores were significantly higher in the HBOT treatment group subjects. The second outcome measure was safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy as measured by number of participants with hyperbaric oxygen treatment related adverse events."

Postoperative pain is the most distressing experience for patients undergoing surgery. Improperly managed, pain may cause complications, including decreased wound healing, gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, and other physiologic disturbances (Lee J, Lin T, Ma J and Chiu K, 2006). Nerve blocks are well recognized as an effective method in the management of post-operative pain. To avoid motor block or nerve block associated with neurological defects and to use single injection technique, several peripheral nerve blocks, as saphenous nerve block, femoral nerve block, sciatic nerve block and obturator nerve block, were identified to relieve acute post-operative pain (Mengshiang, 2018). Adductor Canal Block (ACB) is performed in middle third of the medial side of thigh using ultrasound at point of inlet of adductor canal, deep to sartorius muscle, and anterior to femoral artery between the medial head of rectus femoris muscle and adductor longus muscle of femur (Bhattarai, Raju & Sharma, 2017). ACB anesthetizes the branches of femoral nerve which innervate knee and ankle joint and provide sensory innervation to the anterior medial parts of the thigh. Adductor Canal Block is performed safely and effectively with no important adverse effects (Bryant, 2019). An innovative technique was described by Roy R, Agarwal G, et al (2018) called 4-in-1 block technique as a single injection technique to block femoral nerve, sciatic nerve, obturator nerve, saphenous nerve. The technique was reported to cover almost the whole leg distal to knee. In the adductor canal block, some important branches (branches of obturator nerve) are not covered (Eckart, Oderda & Smith, 2012). In the adductor canal block, as 80% of the patients undergoing knee surgery suffer from sciatic nerve block related complications. The adductor canal block may be performed as an alternative to sciatic nerve block (Guerbaa-Cherkaoui Kassou D, Ait-Mellal H, et al, 2008). Also, the 4-in-1 block is less effective than sciatic nerve block and adductor canal block (Roy R, Agarwal G et al, 2018).

Our aim is to compare 4-in-1 block and adductor canal block analgesic efficacy in terms of VAS scores, side effects, motor block, respiratory depression and nausea and vomiting."

Unilateral axillary lymph node dissection is the standard operation for breast cancer patients. It removes several lymph nodes from the axilla, but also causes lymphedema. Lymphedema arises from the fact that it inhibits the drainage of the remaining lymph nodes, causing edema in the upper limb. Research studies indicate that reducing the amount of lymph nodes removed by maintaining the main lymphatic vascular conduit reduces recurrence of lymphedema. 
Immediate postoperative lymphatic reconstruction has been done and has shown that reconstruction surgery can significantly decrease the risk of lymphedema if the procedure is done when lymphatic surgery is done on the same day. It is important to know whether immediate lymphatic reconstruction can reduce the risk of lymphedema in breast cancer surgery. The aim of the current study is therefore to study whether reconstruction lymph node drainage after axillary lymph node dissection can be used as a prophylactic treatment to prevent lymphedema. The investigators propose to conduct a prospective randomized study to determine whether immediate lymphatic reconstruction can actually prevent lymphedema after axillary lymph node dissection. 
In this study, the investigators will evaluate axillary lymph node dissection by the standard surgical technique in 250 women with cT 1 to cT 4a tumors who have not undergone other adjuvant treatments. In this study, patients will be randomized into two groups. 
The immediate lymphatic reconstruction group will receive axillary lymph node dissection and immediate lymphatic reconstruction while the non immediate lymphatic reconstruction group will receive axillary lymph node dissection only. Data will be collected on demographic data, lymphedema symptoms, lymphedema risk factors, drainage amount, lymphatic reconstruction characteristics. If the participant still has lymphedema, clinical photographs will be made and circumference will be measured before and after the operation."

Breast cancer is a very common disease, which now allows patients to have a long-term survival, thanks to the early diagnosis and a better therapeutic protocol. These important results have led to an increasing interest about late effects occurred after cancer, which impact on the quality of life, not only during the treatment period but also during follow-up period. Patients can have the fear of cancer recurrence, the difficulty to relate, to work, to have children and a lack of autonomy. But it is also a question of how to manage the disease and the therapeutic treatments in a complex socio-environmental context. Nowadays, to evaluate the quality of life in the oncologic setting, many questionnaires have been developed . Some of them have already been translated and adapted to the italian culture, while others are still in a phase of development and validation. In this context the aim of this project is to develop a new questionnaire (PRO Survivorship concerns) which represents an evolution of the previous model (FRE-QOL questionnaire) and which is aimed at assessing the problems reported by Italian cancer survivors during their follow-up. The PRO Survivorship concerns is also aimed at assessing the problems reported by Italian cancer survivors during their follow-up. The PRO Survivorship concerns is made up of 17 items which evaluate the problems of survival, the level of concern about problems related to the care of patients, screening, symptom management, family and genetic problems and the fear of disease recurrence, on a scale of 0 to 3. A further aim of the project is to validate this questionnaire in terms of validity, reliability and responsiveness. For these reasons a sample of at least 280 will be enrolled. The recruitment of patients will be conducted in a multicentric, representative way, involving five Italian hospitals. The main goals of this multicentric study are the translation, adaptability and transcultural validation of the PRO questionnaire survivorship concerns to put in evidence rehabilitation needs in breast cancer patients in early stage."

The objective of this study was to compare the effects on pain, functional status and quality of life of connective tissue massage and classical massage in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain. Therefore, participants in the classical group (n=10) received classical massage, and participants in the connective tissue group (n=10) received connective tissue massage. The control group (n=10) received usual physiotherapy practices, including superficial thermal heat, deep transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and superficial thermal ultrasound.
The mean age of the participants was 46.46±14.92 years, with no significant difference between the groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of height (p=0.262), weight (p=0.365), BMI (p=0.495), duration of low back pain (p=0.982), Visual analog scale (VAS) pain score (p=0.619), Sit and Reach test (p=0.323), Modified Schober test (p=0.265), Back Pain Functional Scale (p=0.864), Roland Morris Disability Score (p=0.883), S-36 physical health (p=0.549), S-36 social functioning score (p=0.502), S-36 bodily pain score (p=0.228), S-36 emotional role score (p=0.552), S-36 mental health score (p=0.753), and S-36 mental health scores (p=0.588). However, the S-36 general health score was found to be significant (p=0.01). Although there was a significant decrease in pain intensity and an increase in functional status in the classical and CTM groups compared to the control group, there was no significant change in body awareness or quality of life after massage treatments. It was concluded that both classical and CTM massage decreased pain intensity, and increased flexibility and functional status in patients with chronic low back pain. Therefore, both classical and CTM massage can be applied as adjuvant therapies. Larger studies are needed to draw more definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of connective tissue massage in terms of quality of life."

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Colonoscopy is a routine screen for the detection of pre-cancerous or malignant polyps and surveillance of participants at high risk. As with all screening tests, compliance is a critical factor in their usefulness. Text messaging has been shown to be effective in improving compliance with other types of medical procedures. The goal of this study is to investigate whether it could improve compliance with colonoscopy, especially among older, minority patients with high rates of non-adherence. In a randomized controlled trial, consecutive veterans due for repeat colonoscopy at the Memphis VAMC are randomized to receive either the Annie text intervention or no intervention control. The Annie is a set of instructional and motivational text messages that helps participants complete the bowel preparation process for the colonoscopy by using real-time reminders to take each dose of laxatives. The text message intervention does not cost money or require any data downloading. This study is the first to use real-time reminders to improve compliance with colorectal cancer screening. If successful, this approach can be easily scaled up to a national level, providing a cost-effective strategy for increasing compliance with colorectal cancer screening. This study will not involve any medical procedures with risk or harm."

In Europe, there are approximately 150,000 early miscarriages per year. Incomplete early miscarriage is defined as early miscarriage with persistent intrauterine material on ultrasound. Intrauterine retention of trophoblastic debris is not an uncommon phenomenon. These retentions may initially be asymptomatic but are often responsible for persistent metrorrhagia and endometritis. This symptomatology often accentuates the psychological distress of patients mourning the pregnancy. Incomplete miscarriages are mainly managed by the gynecological emergency department. The recommendations of the Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français (CNGOF) suggest as a first line of treatment: either surgical management or expectant care. The choice between the two is left to the discretion of the doctor and the patient. there are no clear recommendations as to the choice between hysteroscopy and aspiration. Within the teams, the choice is often made according to the habits and protocols of the service, according to the equipment available and the skills of the gynaecologists. This study aims to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration versus management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal ultrasound.

Arms and Interventions

| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Experimental: Arm A: Hysteroscopy<br>Patients randomized to the hysteroscopy arm will receive misoprostol antibiotic prophylaxis to dilate the cervix before surgery, and anti-adhesion barrier gels will be used, according to routine procedures at each center. In case of intrauterine retention complicated by endometritis, antibiotic treatment for 48 hours (penicillin, metronidazole, fluoroquinolones or a combination of these antibiotics) will be administered according to the standard practice of each center. Evacuated retention product will be sent for pathological examination. Rh-negative women will receive prophylaxis to prevent Rh alloimmunization. | Procedure: hysteroscopy<br>* The procedure is performed by a gynecologic surgeon under general or spinal anesthesia, depending on the standard practice of the center involved, with the patient in the gynecologic position. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be administered according to the standard practice of the center. The equipment available at each center will be used for operative hysteroscopy. The use of energy is usually unnecessary and saline will be preferred. Before the operation, the appearance of the uterine cavity will be described. The selected design product will be resected from top to bottom using the surgical resector, without electrical energy, as this method is known to be the most protective of the endometrium in previous studies. Electric current should be used only as a last resort, in cases where the selected design cannot be removed without it. If there is active bleeding after the procedure, elective coagulation via the hysteroscope may be performed to stop intrauterine bleeding.<br>|
| Experimental: Arm B: Aspiration<br>Patients randomized to the aspiration arm will receive misoprostol antibiotic prophylaxis to dilate the cervix before surgery and anti-adhesion barrier gels will be used, according to routine procedures at each center. In case of intrauterine retention complicated by endometritis, antibiotic treatment for 48 hours (penicillin, metronidazole, fluoroquinolones or a combination of these antibiotics) will be administered according to the standard practice of each center. Evacuated retention product will be sent for pathological examination. Rh-negative women will receive prophylaxis to prevent Rh alloimmunization. | Procedure: Aspiration<br>* The aspiration will be performed by a gynecological surgeon, according to the center's standard protocol.

This project will examine human inference across multi-timescales. We will administer three experiments that each tap the same cognitive process. Our main goal will be to investigate how people use samples of the environment, and then produce inferences about both the near-term environment (the state of that environment after some number of updates, or transitions), and the subsequent environment (the state of that environment after some number of subsequent updates). Using the same set of data (i.e., samples of the environment), people will produce both near and far-term inferences from the same information. Each experiment will be conducted online using Prolific. Our goal with this online approach is to generate a large sample of participants and thereby make powerful statistical inferences. These experiments will be conducted during the COVID pandemic, using secure and well-established online crowdsourcing platforms, and following recommendations for online experimentation under COVID.

The experiments will share the following set-up: Participants must predict an environment state, using samples of that state (e.g. the current configuration of red and blue ball in a jar) and their knowledge of how jars transition. They will complete a pretest before beginning the experiment to ensure that they correctly understand the task at hand. Participants will perform each task in three blocks, each with a different purpose but sharing the same task structure:

1. Short-term Inference: Subjects must identify which of the equally likely jars is currently in use (where ""current"" is subjective relative to the participant) based on a visual sample of the two jars. The subject will receive feedback on whether their inference was correct. The task repeats many times with different jars. The feedback provided is only a binary statement whether the participant's inference was correct, without explanation..

2. Multi-timescale Inference: Subjects must report the current jar in use, as well as predict the subsequent jar in use on the next trial. Feedback remains binary (accurate or not).

3. Long-term Inference: Subjects must predict the subsequent environment state (i.e., the jar after some number of further updates). Long-term inference differs from the other two tasks in that it cannot rely on visual information about the environment, but must draw from past experience of how transitions between jars occur. Feedback is binary (correct or not), although more informative feedback would likely improve subjects' performance.

In each of the three tasks, the experiment will use different combinations of environmental features. The ""red/blue balls"" scenario corresponds to environmental features that cannot be updated by the task. We will also use multiple other environmental features that will alternate across participants during each task block, keeping approximately half of the experimental environment constant. These features include the number of red and blue balls (i.e., the size of the environmental feature), the position of the red balls within the jar (i.e., the spatial information), the number of times the jar has been used (i.e., the current history), and the number of red and blue balls to appear on the next trial (i.e., the upcoming history). These last two manipulations are of particular note, as they should provide participants with different sorts of feedback about the environmental transitions, which may in turn influence how participants use the feedback to generate inferences.

While most of the experiments are likely to involve visual stimuli (as is the case with red and blue balls), we also anticipate running control experiments that use different stimuli, such as lines of different widths, tones of different frequencies, or abstract symbols. We will keep the total number of different experimental features roughly fixed between both visual and non-visual versions of the experiment. 

Subjects will complete many trials in each task, and will receive frequent feedback on their performance. We estimate that each task will take approximately 5 minutes if subjects work at a moderate pace. Each task block contains about 125 trials, with at least 25 on each of the five different set of conditions. Participants will be compensated for completing the task, with payments expected to be approximately 5 USD per hour.

Gregory Smith, Nicholas Kyratsis, James McDonnell, Peter Dayan, and John Guckenheimer at Yale University are members of the Inference and Neurodynamics lab.

Black women are two times more likely to suffer a cardiovascular (CV) event. This study is designed to understand risk and protective factors in Black women between 18-49 years old with no diagnosed CV condition. This study aims to answer the following questions:
Q1: What is it like to be a Black woman and live with hypertension-related risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, poor diet and food/drink choice, physical inactivity, poor sleep patterns, tobacco use, socioeconomic adversity (e.g., poverty and neighborhood segregation, and social discrimination/stress)?
Q2: What are the key physiological mechanisms driving CV disease and poor CV health status in Black women across the life course (from adolescence to young adult)?
This multi-method study is designed to answer these questions by collecting information (e.g., behaviors/life experiences) via questionnaires and biological information (e.g., the role of the heart, brain, lungs and key organs) via laboratory assessments using devices. The study findings will provide insights into the relationship between Black women's cardiovascular health and biological measures and other factors."

The aim of this study is to determine if higher doses of tranexamic acid (TXA) given after cardiac surgery are associated with a lower incidence of post-operative delirium (POD). Delirium after cardiac surgery affects one in five patients and is associated with increased mortality, poor functional recovery and reduced health-related quality of life. Although it is possible to identify patients at the highest risk of delirium and POD, currently there is no effective treatment. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is commonly used as a clotting drug to minimise bleeding after surgery and has anti-inflammatory activity, which may protect the nervous system. In recent studies TXA has been associated with less neuro-inflammation and reduced incidence of delirium in other surgical specialties, such as colorectal and vascular surgery. TXA may also protect the brain from blood-brain barrier disruption and improve brain oxygenation during cardiac surgery with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Although TXA is routinely used in cardiac surgery, current published guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of higher doses of TXA to reduce bleeding or complications after cardiac surgery. However, clinical data demonstrates that increasing doses of TXA improves clotting in patients with haemophilia, suggesting that the dose used is important. A recent trial in abdominal surgery demonstrated that TXA reduced mortality, infection, blood transfusions and delirium when TXA replaced intra-operative blood conservation therapies (Lippi G et al. Tranexamic acid to reduce delirium after gastrointestinal surgery: the TRIGs-D trial. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04556056). Inclusion Criteria: All patients undergoing elective or in-house urgent cardiac surgery at RPH between 05/2018 and 08/2022 Exclusion Criteria: Patients undergoing operations involving deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, operations involving thoracic vessels other than the ascending aorta, solid organ transplantation or mechanical assist device implantation, emergency operations The primary aim of this study is to determine if higher doses of tranexamic acid (TXA) given after cardiac surgery are associated with a lower incidence of post-operative delirium (POD). Delirium after cardiac surgery affects approximately one in five patients and is associated with increased mortality, poor functional recovery and reduced health-related quality of life. Currently there is no effective treatment. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is commonly used as a clotting drug to minimise bleeding after surgery and has anti-inflammatory activity, which may protect the nervous system. In recent studies TXA has been associated with less neuro-inflammation and reduced incidence of delirium in other surgical specialties, such as colorectal and vascular surgery. Our hypothesis is that higher doses of TXA can reduce inflammation within the nervous system and improve health outcomes after cardiac surgery. TXA will be associated with lower delirium and other outcomes in adults undergoing cardiac surgery for heart valve and/or coronary artery disease. TXA may protect the brain from blood-brain barrier disruption and improve brain oxygenation during cardiac surgery with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest."

There are many challenges facing restorative materials used in dentistry. One of the main challenges facing the dental community is restoring dental caries in patients at high risk for caries. Clinical performance of restorative materials is influenced by several factors including preparation design, application techniques, contour design and restoration technique. Based on above-described concept glass ionomer cements are widely used in dental practice due to its many advantages such as fluoride releasing ability to inhibit demineralization. The most important drawback for using glass ionomer cement is its inferior mechanical and physical properties that cause poor clinical performance. Therefore, many studies were published about improving these properties with using chemically activated glass ionomer cements with application of various techniques such as enhanced by radiant heat or ultrasonic vibration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinically the performance of chemically cured conventional glass ionomer cements after enhancement of radiant heat.
This randomized controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of radiant heat enhancement on the clinical performance of chemically cured conventional GICs in first molars.
                Molar teeth were randomly assigned in order to receive chemically cured conventional GICs either with radiant heat enhancement or without enhancement. Restorations were checked at the end of each clinical visit using FDI criteria and evaluating both the biological and functional performance of cement.
                After 12 months of evaluation, the result of this study showed that chemically cured conventional GICs had acceptable clinical performance without evidence of failure. Meanwhile, cement enhanced with radiant heat failed in a higher percentage of the restorations (27.3%) compared to the conventional chemically cured GICs without any enhancement (14.1%). This finding suggests that radiant heat enhancement did not improve the clinical performance of chemically cured conventional glass ionomer cements in this study.

This interventional study was conducted exclusively at the Heart Institute of the Clinics Hospital of the Medical School of the University of São Paulo (InCor - HCFMUSP). It was a single-center study divided into six phases. The first phase involved outpatient preoperative care, where patients underwent a comprehensive anamnesis during the preoperative consultation and were informed about the study. In the second phase, patients were hospitalized and provided with the Informed Consent Form (ICF) if they met the inclusion criteria. Demographic data were collected during this phase. During the surgical phase (third phase), intraoperative data were collected after cardiac surgery. The fourth phase focused on postoperative care, where patients were evaluated, and health measures such as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were collected using the SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 smartwatch and reference devices. After discharge, the fifth phase involved a 30-day telemonitoring period, where patients were remotely monitored using the smartwatch. Health data, including BP, HR, ECG, and SpO2, were collected three times a day during this phase. The medical team provided clinical interventions when alerts were received via the FAPO SI³ platform. In the final phase, patients returned for an outpatient visit at InCor, where health measures were collected again using the smartwatch and reference devices. Additionally, a World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) questionnaire was administered to assess patients' quality of life. ECG reports issued by the smartwatch were also reviewed. The control group consisted of patients with heart disease who underwent surgical procedures and received standard outpatient and post-surgical follow-up according to institutional routines and protocols. Overall, the study aimed to develop and validate an assisted digital telemonitoring platform for patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). The telemonitored group used the SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 smartwatch for remote monitoring, while the control group followed standard care protocols."

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is one of the most prevalent conditions worldwide with around 50 % prevalence in the EU. Moreover, hypertension is the greatest risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, which is the major cause of morbidity and mortality both in Europe and worldwide, accounting for around 48% of all deaths in Europe. Hypertension is an important cause of preventable complications, which are often long before diagnosed due to their silent onset. Furthermore, even if diagnosed in a primary care setting, hypertension remains often uncontrolled. As in all chronic diseases, blood pressure is typically monitored in a longitudinal manner, with measurements performed by the patient outside in between visits to healthcare professionals. This measurement process can lead to over- and undertreatment, with patients visiting the outpatient clinic too often when the condition is well controlled or not often enough when it is not. As such, it is necessary to develop new means for patients to maintain control of their condition, and this, in turn, can enable the healthcare provider to monitor the patients' health and adjust the therapy more precisely. This objective is the main target of the proposed pilot study. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of adopting HSMonitor solutions on hypertension management in primary care. According to this aim, two non-competitive, non-commercial solutions have been developed: solutions based on the technology solutions developed in the framework of the EU PCP project HSMonitor. The study falls within the scope of the HSMonitor pre-commercial tender, whose main objective is the development of telematics solutions aimed at optimising patient health status and disease management. This will be a randomised controlled trial where patients with hypertension will be randomised either to one of the two digital solutions or to standard care."

Language and learning disorders (LLD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) encompass a wide and heterogeneous range of phenotypes with an unknown etiology in most cases and often inadequate treatment or follow-up. The search for a pathogenic mutation can be done with an etiological consultation, which can be carried out by the reference centres. However, they are accessible when a diagnosis has been made and most often when there is already a known dysfunction (e.g. vision, hearing). They are relatively limited in number and time, and it is still possible that they do not explore all the causes envisaged by genetic analyses. The clinical and biological conditions of the child (language delay, learning disability, hyperactivity) are not always the same as that of the parents and the child's relatives. The number and type of dysfunctions may also depend on the developmental phase. In fact, the etiologies of LLD and ADS are heterogeneous with genetic, neurological, and psychological factors. The current treatment options rely on pharmacological products whose efficacy is still uncertain, and non-pharmacological treatments (assistance, education, and rehabilitation measures) that vary significantly within and between geographical areas and are sometimes discontinued by families after the intervention. Genetic techniques such as array CGH (using 300,000 markers) have been used in recent years to identify pathogenic genetic alterations responsible for some LLD phenotypes. In some cases, the presence of a rare cause of etiology allows the patient to benefit from specific and adapted support, and it seems logical to suspect a similar situation for LLD more frequently observed in the general population. The aim of this project is to carry out a whole transcriptome sequencing of index cases whose parents are also sampled and in whom no diagnosis of LLD or ADS exists or has already been rejected. Children will be recruited within participating reference centres. We will include 500 index cases whose blood samples will be screened using genome-wide sequencing to identify at least one pathogenic variant, validated according to the recommendations of the ACMG classification. A clinical and biological description will then be established to check that the pathogenic mutation is causal to the LLD or ADHD described."

The 5 days for health (FDH) is a short behavioral program on healthy nutrition, physical activity and psychological support that is led by endocrinology-diabetes consultants and a multiextended team of nutritionist, psychologist. It is aimed to educate people on lifestyle modification necessary to lose weight.
The program is going to be carried out within 5 days in groups of 7-9 people lead by experienced experts. Participants in groups are adults with the indication of overweight (25-30 kg/m2) or obesity (30-45 kg/m2). During the first day of education the participants will measure their height and weight, waist and hip circumference, and they will get the advice how to measure their body weight regularly. They will also learn how to read food labels and how to estimate the portion size with their hands. There will be a series of interactive lectures and discussions lead by experts who will explain the basics of obesity and metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular consequences, the differences between emotional and physical hunger, identification of personal triggers and how to find alternatives to emotional eating, the effects of body image on mental and physical health, how to have a positive or negative body image and how to improve it, and more. The 5 days of education involves educational lecture, physical activity and discussions, and the participants will wear the accelerometers during these 5 days.
After the program, participants will receive practical guidelines and instructions of how to continue with lifestyle modification at home.
The evaluation will take place during the weight loss program and one month, three month, six month and one year. We will examine the participants' weight change, fat percentage and fat accumulation in the body, blood pressure, metabolic parameters, waist and hip circumference, body height, body mass index, and basal metabolism. Patients will complete questionnaires of eating habits, physical activity and psychological support."

Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), It is a disease characterized by incomplete vascularization of the retina seen in premature and low birth weight infants, the etiology and pathogenesis of which are unknown, causing vision loss. It is a problem below 32 weeks of gestation in developed countries, but it is reported to develop severely up to 34 weeks of gestation in developing countries. In a multicenter study conducted by the Turkish Neonatology Society in our country, the frequency of ROP in very low birth weight preterm infants was found to be 42%, and the frequency of advanced ROP was 11%. The incidence of ROP was found to be 6.1%, and advanced ROP was 6 per thousand in babies with a birth weight of 1500-2000 grams. The frequency of ROP was found to be 10.3% in babies with a gestational age of 33-35 weeks, and severe ROP was reported in 19 of these babies. Premature babies who developed ROP and underwent ROP inspection experience pain, stress and discomfort.
                Premature newborns are prone to pain during painful stimuli and ROP examination is one of the pain stimuli that may be applied. After this examination, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, and a decrease in oxygen saturation are observed. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (non-pharmacological) methods are used to reduce pain. In a study evaluating the effectiveness of sucrose combination with non-nutritive sucking, they reported that pain was moderately reduced and more studies are needed. In another study (2015), it was concluded that topical anesthesia and oral dextrose were not effective in reducing pain in both groups. In a study comparing the effectiveness of breast milk and sucrose, it is recommended to use breast milk because of the rapid recovery of the baby after the ROP examination. In another study, it was stated that the mother's voice as music therapy also showed an analgesic effect and accelerated the recovery after the ROP examination. The study will be conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of the research hospital. The sample size of the study was calculated as 30, considering the difference in 1 of the PIPP scales. It is aimed to be completed in 6 months."

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of combined topical 3% Diquafosol and intense pulsed light (IPL) in the management of DE.
Patients with DE were randomized into three groups. Group 1 (IPL+) was administered 3% Diquafosol tetrasodium eye drops 6 times per day for four weeks, along with two sessions of IPL, 2 weeks apart. Group 2 (IPL) received IPL treatment sessions once at 2- weeks interval. Group 3 (DQS) will be administered 3% Diquafosol tetrasodium eye drops six times per day for 4 weeks. After a washout period, groups 1 and 2 will be placed in the same arm with group 3 to complete the treatment for another 16 days. At the end of 28 days, all participants will be in the same arm (DQS). The investigators hope this cross-over design will increase the power in the statistical analysis and reduce the total number of participants involved and the duration of the study.
Each patient was required to visit the clinic on Days 0, 14, and 28 to have outcome measures recorded. The primary outcome measures will be tear breakup time (NIBUT), Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Fluorescein and lissamine conjunctival and cornea staining (CFS), Meibomian gland function and secretion quality, Tear Film Lipid Layer Score (TFLL), Tear meniscus height (TMH), and Conjunctival hyperemia (RS score). All measurements were obtained at the same visit. Each investigator will be blinded for the participants' group assignment."

This study will compare the efficacy of two different mental health interventions (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) versus Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)) to improve mental health outcomes, quality of life, well-being, and functional impairment in autistic adults with co-occurring anxiety and/or depressive disorders. The study aims to contribute to the development of a personalized, integrated treatment approach for mental health problems in the autistic adult population.
Aim 1 will examine the effectiveness of CBT versus MBT for improving patient-centered mental health outcomes, quality of life, well-being, and functional impairment in autistic adults. Researchers will compare the two treatments on the effects of self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, well-being, self-acceptance, quality of life, functional impairment, treatment retention and participation, therapeutic alliance, negative side effects, and satisfaction with treatment among participants. Based on prior pilot research on CBT for ASD, the study team predicts that CBT will be more effective than MBT, particularly in the sub-sample of participants with milder expressive and intellectual abilities/skills.
Aim 2 will explore patient characteristics (including clinical, sociodemographic, and patient-mediated variables) that may moderate the effects of CBT or MBT on mental health outcomes in participants with ASD. By identifying individual predictors of response to therapy, the study can inform tailoring of mental health treatments based on patient needs.
Aim 3 will assess the implementation outcomes (i.e., feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability) of CBT versus MBT as reported by therapists and participants. The study team will assess the processes, experiences, and outcomes of engaging in/providing CBT versus MBT. This information can inform strategies for improving access to high quality mental health care for people with ASD."

The overall aim of the study is to determine the differences between general and regional anesthesia on patient sleep quality.
A prospective randomized evaluation of 60 patients will be planned.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria of the patients will be determined. In total, 60 patients included in the study will be divided into two groups by randomization, as the general anesthesia (GA) group and regional anesthesia (RA) group. The PID-20 scale will be used to evaluate the sleep quality of the patients in the two groups. The VAS and Wong Baker Pain Scale will be used to evaluate immediate pain and anxiety levels.
Hemodynamic changes will be recorded in the intraoperative period. If complications develop in the postoperative period, this will be recorded as an immediate complication. Early complications will be evaluated in the postoperative three months. Information will be recorded for mortality (30 days), complication (length of stay in hospital, cardiac and respiratory events, sepsis), and readmission.
Anesthesia management, complication and patient satisfaction scores will be evaluated.
This assessment and comparison can contribute to the development of a new protocol to be applied to patients who will undergo total hip arthroplasty in the future, as well as to determine the impact of general and regional anesthesia on recovery time, hospital days, immediate complications, and the frequency of delirium in postoperative patients."

This clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy of efgartigimod (also known as VYVGART™, a biological treatment for GBS) compared to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which is the current standard-of-care treatment, in treating Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). GBS is a debilitating autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness, and in severe cases, muscle paralysis. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of patients who had a complete recovery after 12 weeks as assessed by the Guillain-Barre Syndrome Disability Scale (GBS-DS). The proportion of patients reaching a complete recovery on the GBS-DS at 12 weeks as assessed by a blinded Independent Endpoint Review Committee will be compared between the treatment groups. Safety will also be assessed by monitoring the number and seriousness of adverse events. Patients who participate in this study will also undergo quality of life questionnaires, a sensory examination, nerve conduction assessment, and blood tests to evaluate disease progression and the response to treatment.

The addition of Letrozole to the intravenous MTX combined with intra-amniotic MTX and uterine evacuation in cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) leads to less blood loss than traditional therapy with MTX alone. This study tested the hypothesis that the addition of Letrozole would improve clinical results in women with cesarean scar pregnancy.
This randomized, prospective cohort study compared intra-amniotic + intravenous MTX combined with uterine evacuation to intravenous MTX combined with intra-amniotic MTX and uterine evacuation + Letrozole in women with an intrauterine pregnancy in a Cesarean scar (CSP), confirmed on ultrasound, and increasing B-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) concentrations. Women were treated with a single dose of 100 mg MTX intravenously and 50 mg MTX in intra-amniotic injection (day 0), along with 30 mg potassium chloride in case of positive fetal heartbeat (FH). Women treated with Letrozole received 5 mg orally (from day 0) for 10 days in conjunction with the standard treatment. Blood parameters (B-hCG, hemoglobin, total blood count, creatinine, urea, alanine/aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, bilirubin) were tested on days 0,4,7, followed by B-hCG concentration measurement every 7 days until POC surgical removal. Intra-amniotic insertions of Letrozole have a progestational effect on decidualized endometrial cells and may contribute to a physiological response to the invasion of the trophoblasts. The investigators aimed to use Letrozole as an add-on in the treatment of CSP. The aim of the study was to compare blood loss parameters and frequency of laparoscopy/laparotomy conversion during removal of POC in women with CSP treated with intravenous MTX combined with intra-amniotic MTX and uterine evacuation with or without adjuvant administration of Letrozol."

During liver transplantation (LT), blood loss is considerable, so that often the intraoperative blood replacement is necessary by means of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.
Recently, it has opened the possibility of transfusing units of allogeneic RBCs from heart or lung donors with the same ABO-type. RBCs from liver donors offer the unique advantage of being already available during the organ recovery procedure, making the transfusion process more time-sensitive and less likely to have a delay in transfusion support. The first objective is to demonstrate that this procedure is technically feasible, while the second is to prove that it is not associated with an increase in complications and graft failure."

Background: Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is an emerging breast imaging modality that is based on dual-energy mammography and the injection of iodinated contrast agent. A typical CEM study consists of a low-energy image (equal to a FFDM image) and a recombined image (in which areas of contrast enhancement can be appreciated). However, the situation can occur that lesions are visible only on the recombined (contrast) images (in this protocol defined as 'recombined-only lesions' or ROLs). In these cases, we need to perform 'contrast-enhanced stereotactic biopsy' (CESB), in which CEM is used as a targeting modality. However, experiences with CESB are still limited and one of the most urgent questions that need to be answered is the amount of tissue sampling that is required to reach a final diagnosis. Objective: To determine the minimum number of CESB-guided tissue samples needed to establish a final histopathological biopsy diagnosis for ROLs. Study design: Prospective, single center, observational cohort study. Study population: Non-pregnant women (>18 years) able to provide written informed consent and with a ROL recently observed during a regular CEM examination. Intervention: Included subject will undergo CESB, consisting of an intravenous injection of iodinated contrast agent prior to image acquisition. After administration, a contrast-enhanced stereotactic localization will be performed of the ROL to determine the location and depth of the lesion within the breast. After targeting, 18 samples will be acquired using a 9 Gauge vacuum-assistend biopsy (VAB), collected in six separate and numbered cassettes, to be able to determine the chronological order of the tissue sampling. Each specimen will be histologically analyzed in this chronological order and findings will be compared with the final histopathological result after assessment of all 18 specimens. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary study aim will be to calculate the cumulative diagnostic yield per specimen, enabling us to define a minimum number of biopsies required (or tissue volume needed) to establish a reliable diagnosis using CESB. Secondary study outcomes will be general parameters of the biopsy procedure itself, such as patient characteristics, histopathological results, pain experienced during the procedure, and complication rates (hematoma, infection)."

Bioactive Hyaluronan fragment HA35 of 35kDa was isolated from human colostrum. Literature studies have shown that female breast hyaluronidase and male testicular sperm acrosomal hyaluronidase PH20 come from the same gene. The investigators, recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 and neutral hyaluronidase (PH20 or SPAM1) of bovine testicular sperm acrosome were used to cleave macromolecular Hyaluronan. Regardless of the cutting time, the Hyaluronan fragment HA35 with an average molecular weight 35kDa was produced (Registration number L20200708MP07707, Ministry of Health, Mongolia). Hyaluronidase injection is often used to improve the penetration and absorption of other injectable drugs. Hyaluronidase injection is also used to degrade excessive use of cosmetic injection or improper use of cross-linked macromolecular Hyaluronan fillers, which is an off-label drug use of hyaluronidase (https://www.realself.com/news/hyaluronidase-dissolve-fillers). In this study, Hyaluronan Fragment HA35 of 35kDa was used by mixing hyaluronidase injection extracted from bovine testis (hyaluronidase for injection) and hyaluronidase injection extracted from bovine testis (hyaluronidase injection) at room temperature for 20 minutes. Its analgesic effect on herpes zoster pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, back pain, and temporal pain was studied in this clinical trial."

Septum in the uterus is a congenital anomaly, which occurs in in 0.8-0.9% of women with 2-10% incidence per each decade of life. It develops during the second trimester of pregnancy. When the septum enlarges, as a result of menstrual cycle or pregnancy, abnormal uterine bleeding, pregnancy loss or preterm birth may occur. Removal of the septum by hysteroscopic surgery could be an effective therapeutic way in preventing these complications, particularly in preliminary phases of pregnancy. The commonest technique for septum resection is with the use of a monopolar 26 French resectoscope with the collin's knife, and glycine 1.5% as the distension media
However the high fluid deficit may lead to inadequate uterine exposure, impaired ovarian function, decreased ovarian blood flow with increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. On the other hand, the cost of the surgery is higher and require a longer time of learning the technique for the endoscopic surgeon.
The traditional method of septum resection used a scissors to cut the septum. This method has been reported to take long time of operation and relatively lower incidence of complications. Scissors used to cut the septum is easy to handle and is cost effective.
The present study was designed to directly compare scissors with 26 French monopolar resection, with glycine1.5% as the distension media, in all sizes of the septum, under direct vision, regarding the operative time, fluid deficit, operative and post operative complications and need for second intervention."

Current and future pandemics remain a major health issue throughout the world. The main concern is not viral transmission but the severity of the disease and the long-term sequelae. Long COVID, the term used to describe ongoing health issues associated with COVID-19, is defined by the World Health Organization as new or ongoing health problems that appear after the initial recovery of a person who has had COVID-19 infection. To date, no specific treatment for long COVID has been identified. The severity of symptoms and physical de-conditioning suggest an important impact of the disease on the exercise of respiratory muscles, respiratory control and the cardiovascular system. Cardiac coherence (CC) is a method of controlled breathing that has been shown in a previous RCT to be particularly effective in improving respiratory and cardiovascular control and therefore, in improving the recovery of patients with acute myocardial infarction, ischemic diseases or heart failure. The goal of this clinical study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a respiratory control training to CC on reducing the symptoms of long COVID and cardiovascular and respiratory complications in this population. Secondary objectives will be to evaluate the effect of the training on specific symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, cognitive impairment) and on the impact of the disease on Daily life. This study will involve patients at the Reunion University Hospital who will present a clinical profile for long COVID and a positive history of COVID-19. These patients will be randomly assigned to either a CC training group with reinforcement (experimental group) or a CC control group without reinforcement (Control group). Patients will be evaluated at the start of the study (T0) and at different times thereafter (1 month follow up, 2 months follow up, 3 months follow up and 6 months follow up). The primary outcome will be the clinical improvement (scoring on the LCSQ-10 scale) which include 3 parameters (total score, fatigue, anxiety and depression scores).

Background: Major depression is a prevalent disorder for which pharmacotherapy and psychological interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy are effective, but their long-lasting efficacy is not always optimal.
Objectives: The purpose of the study is to evaluate new strategies for the treatment of depression in order to improve long-term outcomes. In this study, neurobiological intervention - the transcranial direct current stimulation - is used to modulate cortical activity in the prefrontal cortex of depressed patients, together with a cognitive therapy intervention metacognitive therapy (MCT).
Method: It is a multicenter randomized controlled trial, where treatment is allocated to one of three possible arms of treatment, each consisting of 8 sessions: 1) neuromodulation (tDCS), 2) metacognitive therapy (MCT), 3) the combination of the two (tDCS-MCT). In the last phase, a subgroup of patients will be explored, in the context of a pilot study, the TMS-EEG correlates of the change in depressive symptomatology.
Fundation: The Lions Clubs International, through the Lions Clubs Foundation of Liguria - ONLUS, has decided to support this research, as is the common tradition of the Lions in the world to support projects involving the improvement of people.
The main sponsor of the study is the University of Genoa.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a rare but severe complication of dual antiplatelet drugs including aspirin and thienopyridine (also known as dual antiplatelet therapy or DAPT). Gastrointestinal bleeding tends not to be fatal (40% morbidity, 8.8% in-hospital mortality), but has associated long-term mortality of up to 20%. The high relative risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients using DAPT makes it necessary to consider the risk-benefit balance of dual antiplatelet treatment in patients with coronary artery disease. According to a recent expert consensus on DAPT, it is recommended that the use of gastrointestinal protective drugs (proton pump inhibitors or H2RE) should be considered in patients known to have a moderate or high risk for GI bleeding. However, there is no clinical benefit of PPI use with aspirin and clopidogrel in patients with stable coronary disease or PCI. To date, whether PPI-based gastroprotection is necessary at all in those who are at moderate or high risk of bleeding using PPI in everyday clinical practice is unknown."

The reference standards for celiac disease include serology (i.e. anti-TG (classical antibody test), anti-EMA (enolase immunostatin), plus small intestinal biopsy (normal or abnormal duodenal villi and intra-epithelial lymphocytes of 30/100) or duodenal histology as the reference standard.
Serology of intestinal antibodies (detected on serum) should be performed in every patient with suspected celiac disease, and intestinal biopsy should be performed when serology is strongly positive, equivocal or negative to histology.
Intestinal biopsies involve submitting a small piece of intestine (endoscopy) to histological examination. This must be done under special conditions, and with trained personnel. This often involves a delay in diagnosis of celiac disease, and, when serological tests are negative, histological examination is not necessary.
Recent advances in medicine and gastroenterology have resulted in the development of techniques that can be used at the bedside to detect various biochemical parameters in a blood sample, as well as in a urine sample. These tests can provide diagnostic results in a few hours. Some of these tests do not require highly specialized personnel and some have lower cost and are therefore easy to use.
The present study will evaluate whether a new rapid anti-TG2 diagnostic test, on a blood sample, can make it possible to diagnose celiac disease a little faster. This rapid test, which detects intestinal anti-TG2, could be performed for patients who cannot have an endoscopy.
The current study also aims at comparing with the reference standard (serology + histopathology), the anti-TG2 rapid test on mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens, and in comparison with culture-EMA. This new technique could simplify the diagnosis of celiac disease and avoid the need for intestinal biopsy in some cases.
The investigators also propose to determine whether the anti-TG2 antibodies detected on mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens (ELISTAT method) could help to select patients for whom an early confirmation of celiac disease will be made by a rapid serological test.
The investigators will examine the effectiveness of the anti-TG2 assay performed on mechanically lysed intestinal biopsies, by comparing it with culture EMA, which is currently used in routine practice in France. Based on the literature and our preliminary data, the investigators estimate that the use of the Anti-TG2 assay on mechanically lysed intestinal biopsies is a method that could help to provide a rapid serological diagnosis without the need for intestinal biopsy in some situations."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases an individual's risk of stroke, and oral anticoagulation (OAC) reduces stroke risk by 65%. Clinical prediction rules are recommended to assess stroke risk, but rates of risk-discordant stroke prevention therapy persist despite recommendations, representing a major knowledge translation challenge. This RAPID AFib pilot study will evaluate the acceptability of a web-based atrial fibrillation patient decision aid in persons with recent onset AF, and the impact of the decision aid on the process of shared decision making before stroke prevention therapy. This will be a pilot cluster-randomized trial, with a randomized participant stratification by clinic site. The primary outcome will the SDM-Q-9 score, a measure of quality of shared decision-making. This study will be performed at two cardiology clinics in Ottawa, Ontario."

It is reported in the literature that hypercapnic respiratory failure is the leading reason for intubation and mechanical ventilation requirement. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is commonly used for ventilatory support in those with this. High flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) is less invasive and might be preferred in some cases, especially when patients are too frail to tolerate NIV. In this study, we planned to compare the efficiency of the two methods in a prospective, randomized fashion in patients with Acute Hypercapnic respiratory failure.
Inclusion Criteria: Adult patients of both sex who were admitted to ICU with acute moderate hypercapnic respiratory failure. We excluded 9 Patients 4 patients in HFNC group and 5 patients in NIV group did not meet the inclusion criteria, so they were not included in the study.

Background: Heart Failure (HF) is associated with poor mortality and recurrent hospitalizations that place an enormous burden on health care costs and systems. Over 3.5 million Ugandans experience HF, and HF-related hospitalizations are common, with over 50% of Ugandan patients hospitalized due to HF within 1 year after diagnosis. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for innovative health approaches to address the burden of chronic diseases, such as HF. One promising approach is mHealth interventions, which hold promise for reaching patients in diverse, resource-limited settings. Despite this potential, challenges related to scalability, integration with existing health systems, and sustainability have prevented uptake of such interventions into clinical practice. To address these challenges, the investigators' goal is to establish a sustainable implementation package across RRHs that can be integrated with existing clinical care strategies and scaled to meet patients' need for sustained HF care. The proposed approach leverages novel digital health methodologies that are tailored for use in Uganda, and it is driven by engagement of stakeholders, including clinical care providers and patient advocates, to inform iterative program modifications. Methods: The investigators will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial with embedded implementation science and cost effectiveness assessments to establish the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a multi-component implementation strategy for HF care. We will randomize three RRHs in Uganda to intervention and intervention control groups, and we will recruit 2,100 participants with HF to provide core- HF care, including a clinician and patient-facing mobile application intervention. Randomization will be performed using a randomization software. We will apply a Learn-As-You-Go (LAaYG) design at each site that guides iterative modifications of specific implementation components, including mobile applications, and patient-provider communication, using feedback from patients and care providers. The investigators will assess the change in HF self-care, clinical outcomes, patient fidelity to self-care, facility fidelity to implementation strategies, acceptability, and cost effectiveness of the interventions throughout the study. Achieving feasibility requires a careful balance between the depth of the intervention, the pace of implementation, and the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention strategies. Aim 2: Develop and refine the implementation strategy through formative research via an embedded implementation trial.

Background- Phytoregulation of pain and sleep disorders is important for the basic treatment of most diseases nowadays, and there are more and more studies on drugs that control pain, sleep disorders, etc. However, for most diseases nowadays, the phytoregulation of pain and sleep disorders is the important basic treatment, and there are more and more studies on drugs that control pain, sleep disorders, etc. However, the existing drugs have certain defects. This study intends to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ibuprofen and diphenhydramine hydrochloride modified-release tablets to provide reliable evidence for the use of compound drugs. Objective- To evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the tablet formulation in both the test and reference periods. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the modified-release tablet formulation in healthy adults under normal conditions, especially to confirm the safety profile of the ibuprofen and diphenhydramine hydrochloride modified-release tablet formulation. Eligibility criteria- Healthy adult subjects from both sexes, aged 18 years or older, BMI in the range of 19.0 to 26.0 kg/m2, weighing at least 45 kg or 55 kg, and healthy by physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory test results. Design- It is a randomized, balanced, double-blind, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, four-period, single-dose, parallel-group comparison study, and each subject takes the test drug and reference drug in two periods. The researchers randomly divide 16 healthy subjects into 2 groups, T-R and R-T, with 8 participants each. The selected subjects are admitted to the phase I ward of the clinical research center 1 day before each cycle. And after the 1st cycle, the researchers will analyze the plasma concentration of subjects under the condition of fasting (each blood specimen has a time reference for arterial blood collection).

(About 2 to 3 minutes before the end of bleeding for arterial venous blood collection, the investigator should be equipped with necessary surgical tools and dressings, and the operator should be ready to stop the bleeding promptly as soon as the blood collection is observed to have a certain blood volume, the blood collection is ended. Each blood collection can stop the bleeding after 5 minutes or more to ensure that the whole blood collection process is 5 minutes or more, including preparation for blood collection and bleeding; The blood collection method is a clean, rapid, effective and easy operation. At all time points, except for the first time point, at least 4 ml blood sample can be collected. After the 48 h blood collections, the subject was judged to have completed the 2nd period of the whole clinical trial, or withdrew from the subject's consent, or adverse events to terminate the study, or the researcher decided to stop the study, all blood specimens were tested."

Background: Venous cannulation is the most common invasive procedure and a source of anxiety and significant pain for many patients. In 2019 the introduction of ultrasound-guided peripheral venous catheter insertions in Denmark have resulted in less inaccessibility of veins. However, there are no studies on how this affects the number of attempts per procedure and the level of pain for the patients.
Objective: To test whether an 8-week training program for the upper arm muscles before treatment initiation reduces the level of pain in patients receiving an increase in peripheral venous catheter number, the number of attempts per procedure during treatment, and/or the number of venous catheters. The effects on pain will be measured during catheter insertion and general activity and the number of attempts during the procedure, and the number of venous catheters. Furthermore, we examine how patients experience vein status, pain, and fatigue when undergoing venous catheters in treatment with cytotoxic agents.
Eligibility criteria: Patients who receive more than one peripheral venous catheter in chemotherapy and are placed under ultrasound guidance.
Design: Patients are randomized to one of two groups: training group or non-training group (normal care). The training group will be offered a structured 8-week daily arm training program. To strengthen the superficial veins of the upper arms before treatment start.

Early pregnancy loss is very common, approximately one in four women will experience a miscarriage in their lifetime. The etiology of pregnancy loss remains largely unknown, although genetic, anatomical, endocrinological and immunological abnormalities have been implicated. It is known that embryonic/fetal chromosomal aberrations contributed to approximately 50% of early pregnancy loss, among which 60-70% were aneuploidies, largely can be detected by the current gold standard karyotyping approach recommended by various international societies.
Besides the well-known karyotyping method commonly used in the clinical practice, the advent of next generation sequencing offers an excellent opportunity to explore the genetic factors that may be involved in the pathogenesis of miscarriage. The proposed study will utilize the non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) approach by low-pass genome sequencing to detect genome-wide copy-number variants, chromosomal mosaicisms, structural rearrangements, absence of heterozygosity (AOH), and single-nucleotide variant (SNV). In other words, the investigators plan to perform low-pass whole genome sequencing of the product of conception (POC) from women who had termination of pregnancy below 13-week gestation. The investigators intend to recruit 10-20 women to undergo the procedure of ultrasound-guided manual vacuum aspiration (USG-MVA) to collect POC samples for genetic testing.
In addition, the investigators hope that this novel approach may provide a better understanding of the complex genetics of early pregnancy loss. The investigators also hope to determine the genetic causes of early pregnancy loss in order to provide more precise and accurate diagnosis for women with recurrent pregnancy loss. The investigators further anticipate that this study could lead to better diagnosis and improved management, which may have the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of early pregnancy loss and bring the significant improvement of women's health.
In this observational study on the role of immunologically-mediated mechanisms in uterine rejection of the preterm fetus, the investigators plan to study the following: 1. the difference of cytokines in the decidual tissue between women with normal pregnancy and those having with early pregnancy loss. The investigators intend to establish a model of immunological rejection in normal decidual tissue with the hypothesis that the activation of immune cells in normal first trimester decidual tissue contribute to fetal demise in women with pregnancy loss. The investigators will also examine the proportion of CD4+ T-cells producing IFN-gamma, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-12 (Th1 cell) compared with CD4+ T-cells producing IL-4 and IL-10 (Treg cell) in decidual tissue between women with normal pregnancy and those having with early pregnancy loss. The proportion of decidual CD8+ T cells also expressing the Th1-associated cytokine interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) will also be examined. 2. the difference of cytokines in the decidual tissue between women having with pregnancy loss and those with chromosomally normal or aneuploid miscarriages. The investigators will study whether a Th1 dominated cytokine profile in decidual tissue was associated with pregnancy loss. The investigators will also examine whether the chromosomal status of the conceptus influences uterine immunity. 3. the difference of cytokines in the decidual tissue between women having with unsuccessful and successful outcomes of ultrasound-guided manual vacuum aspiration (USG-MVA). The investigators will establish a prospective, randomized, study comparing decidual tissue samples obtained from patients with failed and successful outcomes of USG-MVA."

Seasonal influenza vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent seasonal influenza. Most countries in Europe and North America vaccinate the high-risk groups' elderly, pregnant women, and children. The annual WHO recommendation for offering inactivated influenza vaccine for people aged ≥60 years, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic medical conditions began in 2010. On the contrary, only 14 countries in Africa recommended influenza vaccination for the high-risk groups. Bangladesh is one of those countries, but no comprehensive policies and programs have been developed so far. The seasonal influenza vaccination is an ongoing challenge in developing countries. Most of the high-risk groups' vulnerable populations cannot afford vaccine costs, and as a result, the majority of health facilities do not have the required capacity to deliver vaccines. This study will investigate the acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the facility-based influenza vaccination to vulnerable populations (children six months to 8 years, pregnant women, elderly individuals, and patients with chronic diseases) who were targeted by the government's influenza vaccination policy in Bangladesh. The study will also estimate the needed capacity for a well-functioning seasonal influenza vaccination program in the high-risk group targeted hospital. Finally, the researchers will evaluate the cost associated with healthcare utilization and health outcomes among the high-risk group individuals before and after vaccination. The overall objective is to assess the feasibility and evaluate policy and program options for a well-functioning, cost-effective vaccine delivery and vaccination among Bangladesh's high-risk individuals. The investigators expect that the results of this research will provide insights into improving a well-functioning, cost-effective, facility-based influenza vaccination program in Bangladesh, ultimately saving lives and reducing human suffering from the severe complications of seasonal influenza."

However, concerns related to duodenoscope-related cross-contamination and infections have been reported. The purpose of this national multicentre Italian study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of single-use duodenoscopes in a real-world setting from an interventional standpoint. The goal of this study is to perform an observational prospective research on a group of patients planned for a duodenoscopic-related procedure involving the use of a single use duodenoscope (DUKE®, Boston Scientific) in a real-world setting to report the outcomes of the technical and procedural performances of the scope.
Objective: This study is an observational prospective research on a group of patients planned for a duodenoscopic-related procedure involving the use of single-use duodenoscopes.
Study design: All patients planned for any procedure involving the use of a single-use duodenoscope will be enrolled in a real-world setting.
Study population and intervention: Patients aged 18 years or older willing to undergo a procedure for which the duodenoscope was the sole endoscopic tool that was indicated for the procedure and a device (Cook-Williams DUKE® Endoscopic System - Boston Scientific, US) that was not commercially available at the time of enrollment was prescribed. After each procedure, the duodenoscope will be discarded. The study duration will be at least 24 months and a minimum of 3000 procedures will be performed.
The main objective will be to determine whether single-use duodenoscopes perform as well as the currently widely used conventional duodenoscopes, and whether they are safe.
The secondary objectives will be:
- to assess the ability of single-use duodenoscopes to provide a diagnostic image of the upper GI tract (sensitivity and specificity)
- to evaluate the technical and procedural performances of single-use duodenoscopes
- to evaluate the ability of single-use duodenoscopes to obtain a pancreatic/biliary ductal cannulation
- to evaluate whether using single-use duodenoscopes may reduce the risk related to contamination/infection in the upper GI tract or cross contamination between procedures
- to evaluate the device usability and patient safety/security during the procedure
- to evaluate the adhesion and clinical outcomes related to duodenoscope use
- to evaluate the impact of single-use duodenoscopes on procedural time, adverse events, technical difficulties and need for additional interventions

Hybrid Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Patients with COPD: a Feasibility Study (UKCA/CE Class 1-approved and DTAC-certified Active+me REMOTE App)

Objectives: The aim of this feasibility study is to address two key NHS needs for digital health. The first is to generate evidence of the effectiveness of remote Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) to support the development of a fully-digital PR programme. The second is to support NHS England to understand the value and benefits (both to the individuals and to wider society) of remote PR, which currently offers very little return on investment (ROI) and only limited savings in health care staff time. The study will use real-world study design, drawing on routinely collected data to compare outcomes for patients recruited to a hybrid PR intervention with a propensity matched control group that has previously received standard PR.

Design: It will test the success of integrating the hybrid PR system (Active+me REMOTE) into routine practice and the ability of the system to overcome barriers to hybrid PR delivery and service implementation. It will also evaluate patient outcomes and identify whether any cost savings can be achieved by implementing the app on a larger scale.
A pragmatic sequential mixed methodology will be employed which includes both quantitative data collected from routine practice, and qualitative data collected via focus groups/interviews with patients and health care professionals. Patients, health care professionals, managers and commissioners, including patients who have self-discharged early from a pulmonary rehabilitation service, will be recruited via an information pack, which will include details of the study. For each arm of the study, participants will be recruited by being referred from their general practitioner (GP) or Hospital Consultant, and being matched according to age, sex, measure of respiratory disability, disease severity, Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), location of service (Hospital vs Community), baseline health outcomes, and ability to self-care.
The first phase is a retrospective study to compare the baseline characteristics of patients with COPD who will receive hybrid PR with patients who will receive standard PR to ensure that there are no meaningful differences between groups of patients.

Interventions:
After participants have signed the informed consent, a member of the clinical research team will download the Active+me REMOTE App onto patients' smartphone, providing them with a simple instruction sheet. Participants will be given a preliminary assessment with a member of the Harefield Pulmonary Rehabilitation Team as part of routine care. Participants will then follow the 8-week hybrid PR intervention involving two exercise classes per week. While this is an 8-week programme, additional weeks of in person, online or hybrid classes may be provided for those participants wishing to attend more than 16 sessions. On completion of the programme, participants will be discharged by their clinician.

Main study:
This study will be a hybrid design (randomised, parallel-group, non-inferiority, unmasked, pragmatic control, mixed method, patient level) to compare two modes of delivery of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme (hybrid vs standard) in COPD patients. This study will provide evidence about the effectiveness of hybrid PR with patients with chronic respiratory conditions.
Participants: 60 participants in two arms: hybrid PR intervention and propensity matched control group.
Intervention/Treatment: An onboarding session at the start of the HRB study will be attended by a member of the clinical research team.
Reasoning: To ensure a pragmatic and realistic approach to recruitment, the control group will be recruited to match the participant group/arm in the intervention group.

Study Arms: Arm 1: hybrid pulmonary rehabilitation
Arm 2: Standard pulmonary rehabilitation (retrospective data) collected from routine care practice.

Reasons for designing an observational study with a hybrid design: To overcome the challenges of standard RCTs in digital health, we will use real-world study design. Real-world studies draw largely on routinely collected data, for example from patient health records, to assess outcomes of a digital health intervention in a real-world population. To assess whether the results of this study can be successfully translated into clinical practice, this observational study will include recruitment of patients and gathering of clinical data in real-time. Participating patients will be randomised to either an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will be recruited to take part in a hybrid pulmonary rehabilitation programme involving technology-based remote PR and two in-person sessions per week. The control group will have participated"

A new pre-exposure prophylaxis regimen has been recently approved in Japan which is 2-dose anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody given subcutaneously (SC). Tixagevimab and Cilgavimab, a combination therapy, demonstrated a significant reduction in COVID-19 by 73% (95% CI = 65% - 79%) compared with placebo in the Phase 2 PREVENT trial. Several observational studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of this new therapy as PrEP against COVID-19. However, its effectiveness and safety vary by patient characteristics depending on countries or regions. Due to the different patient populations, and the limited information available on the real-world situation of this therapy in Japan, this observational study will describe baseline demographics and clinical characteristics. To identify the main characteristics that may influence the effectiveness and safety of this therapy, information including medical history, laboratory tests and demographics will be collected.
Participants aged 12 years or more who were administered EVUSHELD as PrEP in Japan between 17th of March, 2022, to 4th of August, 2022, will be identified from the medical databases of the healthcare provider institutions. All baseline demographic and clinical characteristics collected within the 24 months of the medical database will be used for the purpose of baseline description.
The following information will be used for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics: demographic (gender, age), comorbidity (premutually identified diseases including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, cancer, HIV and immune suppression), concurrent medication (immunosuppressive drugs, anticoagulant therapy, immunomodulatory drugs), COVID-19 treatment history, and laboratory test results collected prior to the administration of the study therapy. Baseline demographics and characteristics will be described and potential risk factors for COVID-19 associated with treatment failure or breakthrough infection will be identified.
Finally, to understand the real-world efficacy, safety and tolerability of this new therapy as PrEP in Japan. For follow-up period after EVUSHELD administration, data about COVID-19 will be collected from medical databases.
This study is not intended to provide direct benefits to any participant. This study will help to provide real-world information about patients and treatment characteristics of this therapy as PrEP in Japan, and to identify potential indicators for treatment failure or breakthrough infection. This information will be helpful to prevent or minimize treatment failure and/or COVID-19 breakthrough infection."

Parkinson's disease (PD) patients suffer from motor deficits leading to impaired manual dexterity and poor touchscreen skills. These deficits may be caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms than impaired handwriting, which is also common in PD. In line with the literature, the investigators propose an innovative strategy to improve manual dexterity at home, resembling daily life movements, and they will examine the training of touchscreen sliding motions delivered on a tablet enabling practice in the home setting. The effects of this innovative training program will be examined immediately after two weeks of targeted training as the primary outcome in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The learning and transfer effects of two weeks of training will also be examined.

Postpartum depression and anxiety are frequent, often unrecognized, and underestimated phenomena acknowledged by WHO. Despite a widespread use of psychological questionnaires to diagnose disorders occurring during the first postpartum years, their mechanisms, possible causes, and treatment are still strongly investigated. The present study should establish whether intensified tactile contact between a mother and the newborn should be implemented as an obligatory part of the care program of the newborn during the first week of life (applied in the form of Shantali massage).
This is the pilot phase of a longitudinal research project which should be continued by the project of the Polish Research Grant. The project started in October 2010 and ended in July 2013. The main purpose of the intervention group vs. control group and between the two groups should be tested using the standardized scales (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Self-reports of Anxiety Scale (STAI) and the subscales of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The study will be conducted on a group of 43 randomly selected participants after physiological delivery, their level of happiness will be measured twice before and after the 12th week after delivery. If the results of this phase are satisfactory, the project of the Polish Research Grant will be activated, where the number of subjects should be increased and the study will be carried out in 7 cities, including one metropolis. If the main hypothesis is confirmed, the effects of this simple intervention should be evaluated in a multistage, comprehensive clinical trial."

Persistent symptoms that follow recovery from acute COVID-19 are collectively referred to as ""long COVID"" or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). Despite significant interest in understanding the nature and underlying mechanisms of the PACS, there are no accepted diagnostic criteria or a gold standard treatment approach for it. A growing body of evidence suggests that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may have a beneficial effect in some of the patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and the PACS may have some common features. This pilot RCT was performed to examine the feasibility and safety of OMT for patients with the PACS, and to evaluate its potential effectiveness on symptoms related to PACS. Eligible participants were consecutive and incident patients aged 18 and above who had one or more persistent symptoms following COVID-19 for at least 4 weeks and were recruited by the study investigator. All participants received standard of care that included OMT which was prescribed and performed by a licensed D.O. participants were asked to assess their physical and neurocognitive symptoms, and their global health on questionnaires. The data from this study can be used to inform a larger confirmatory RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of OMT in patients with the PACS.

Inclusion criteria: at least one symptom of post-COVID-19 (eg, fatigue, dyspnea, anosmia, arthralgia, headache, sleep disturbances, anxiety/depression, or other problems related to mental health) which was new after diagnosis with COVID-19 and has persisted for at least 4 weeks after diagnosis.

Exclusion criteria: unable to speak, read and write in English, not mentally competent to give informed consent, inability to complete surveys/questionnaires on-line.

Design: Each enrolled eligible patient has been seen by the PI at least once. On average, each patient was seen ten times within the first four months. For eligible participants, the standard of care may include treatments prescribed by the primary care physician, the neurologist, or other specialists such as physical therapists and occupational therapists. The participants received osteopathic manual treatment based on their response to previous treatments. The total number of OMT sessions were decided by the treating physician with the patient's input. The data from the questionnaires were collected at the first visit, 3 days after every OMT session for up to 4 months after enrollment, and 2 months after the participant's final OMT session.

Outcome measures: Preliminary observations from a similar but smaller study support the feasibility of OMT in patients with PACS. The number of participants who enrolled in the study were assessed. In this study, participants were asked to assess their symptoms using PROMIS and RPCCS questionnaires. We also evaluated global health using PROMIS SF v1.2. The data on the participants' return to work status was obtained from the participants.

This feasibility study is designed to test the feasibility of conducting an RCT in patients with a diverse spectrum of PACS symptoms. It will provide important information on the acceptability of OMT and its role in management of PACS. If the feasibility criteria are met and preliminary evidence of effectiveness is obtained, a larger RCT is warranted. If the larger RCT supports the effectiveness of OMT, it may pave the way for integration of OMT in the standard of care for patients with PACS. OMT may have a role in management of the PACS but its role is not fully understood and requires further research."

Frostbite is a significant source of morbidity and mortality for those in cold climates. As the body cools, ischemia and clotting within the tissue occur, causing significant damage. Upon rewarming, the tissue is assessed to determine the extent of damage and the need for further treatment. The main goal of these assessments is to determine if there is a vascular cutoff causing tissue ischemia. Over the past 20 years, Regions Hospital has used conventional angiography to assess vascular patency and to deliver thrombolytics directly into the affected vessels. Other imaging modalities are being used, but it is unknown how accurately these imaging modalities demonstrate the vasculature.
Indocyanine Green (ICG) microangiography is a promising technology for evaluating tissue perfusion in several diseases. Unlike conventional angiography, ICG does not require ionizing radiation, is easily administered intravenously, and can be repeated as needed. Therefore, the investigators will investigate the ability of ICG microangiography to correlate with conventional angiography in patients with severe frostbite."

Colorectal cancer is a global disease, with a high incidence and mortality rate in older patients. The impact of this pathology is complex, associated with an impact not only on morbidity and mortality but also on the evolution of quality of life. Preventive care, early diagnosis, surgical management are all important issues in the geriatric patient.
We propose to focus on geriatric care of the oldest patients (aged 70 and over) operated on for colorectal cancer. These patients already have an impact on their functionality since the preoperative period.
The study will be conducted in a cohort of 120 patients. Two arms will be compared: patients in the control group will be managed, in all respects, in the hospital's conventional surgical activity. Patients in the second arm will be treated in the Peri-Operative Geriatrics Unit for 10 to15 days prior to surgery (depending on the grade of nutritional status). The objective of the intervention is to improve the preoperative preparation of geriatric patients in order to anticipate complications, optimize the perioperative care and improve the functional status at discharge. In this, the patient in the GPOU is managed differently, in particular with regard to mobilization. Mobilization is the main factor in a global care process and is an essential parameter for the patient to recover his functional status, including the ability to perform daily and instrumental activities, important for autonomy in daily life. Finally, a multidisciplinary meeting will be planned for each patient in the Geriatrics Unit in order to optimize management and organization.
In clinical research in surgery there is little data on the elderly. Very few published studies have evaluated the impact on functional status by using geriatric assessments. The preliminary studies performed locally confirm the interest of an intervention prior to surgery in this patient group.
The proposed study will evaluate the change in functional status between patients treated in the conventional surgery department and patients treated in the Geriatrics Unit with a specific protocol. It will also evaluate the management of surgical care by surgeons and by the anesthesia resuscitation team."

Background: Metastatic disease is the most common cause of cancer related death and treatment options are limited in patients with metastatic disease. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an important treatment modality for patients with metastatic disease, especially in cases of oligo-progressive disease, where only a small number of sites are progressing.

Current palliative treatment for metastatic patients involves systemic therapies and radiation therapy to radiated local sites, which may cause tumor regression but rarely complete tumor control. Pembrolizumab, an antibody blocking the interaction between Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 has shown impressive results in metastatic solid cancer populations with durable tumor shrinkage and reduced toxicities. The use of Pembrolizumab with radiation therapy may enhance the immune response mediated by pembrolizumab and therefore synergize the treatment mechanism of SBRT.

Objectives: Our hypothesis is that we can enhance the anti-tumor immunity, using a combination of pembrolizumab and SBRT in metastatic cancer patients. With this goal in mind, this Phase I trial aims to establish the safety of giving escalating doses of 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab as measured by dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). This trial will also analyze the changes in 64Cu-DOTA-pembrolizumab uptake as the dose increases to identify the optimal dose for future studies.

Design: We plan to recruit 7-10 patients per dosing cohort. We aim to enroll 2-3 eligible patients into each of 3-4 escalating dose cohorts. Toxicities will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). DLT will be estimated over the first 3 days after administration of study drug. The study duration for each patient, including the pre-screening, screening, PET procedure and SBRT is approximately 6 weeks.

Introduction:
Infection remains one of the main causes of secondary functional failure. Its incidence varies between 1 and 5% post-artroplasty . Aseptic loosening (AL) is observed in most patients undergoing revision of the implant, thus the diagnosis of infection is not obvious. FJA is an essential step in the diagnosis and management of patients with an infected prosthesis. It allows for the visualization of the infected synovial fluid, the identification of biomarkers (CRP, Lysozyme, alpha defensing, leukocyte Esterase) and microbiological diagnosis. However, it has some limitations such as the inability to detect the cause in 40 to 60% of patients in the case of negative FJA (0/21 and 0/49) . However, even in the case of positive FJA (100% sensitive), negative perioperative cultures are frequently observed, thus giving a lack of confidence in the prognosis and the treatment of patients.
The use of biomarkers in joint fluid of knee, elbow and shoulder arthroplasty for the diagnosis of infection was tested in a prospective multi-center study and a systematic review . These biomarkers had limited utility for the diagnosis of infection, and the results must be interpreted with caution due to the potential limitations (sample size, heterogeneity of the studied population (primary and secondary arthroplasties), and variability of the biomarkers measured according to the pathology concerned (acute infection, chronic infection, aseptic loosening) .
The purpose of this study is to assess whether the dosage of joint fluid biomarkers (CRP, alpha defensing, leukocyte Esterase and protein) by FJA adds additional information to the antibiotic pre-treatment therapy (APT) and the dosage of CRP in blood. Investigators believe that the use of these biomarkers in association with the clinical, radiological and evolution will improve the diagnosis and the initial treatment.
Secondary objectives:
1. Correlate the results of biomarkers in joint fluid to the bacteria isolated in intraoperative samples (culture, PCR and mass spectrometry) and histological analysis of peri-prosthetic bone biopsies. 2. Characterize the population of patients in each group. 3. Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the association of joint fluid results to the aseptic or infectious origin of the symptoms of the patients in this cohort. 4. Describe the results of peri-operative cultures and peri-operative histological results. 5. Analyze the incidence of bacteriological contamination during surgery in patients benefiting from APT. 6. Determine the influence of bacteriological contamination during surgery with APT. 7. Describe the functional results after joint prosthesis revision at 3 months for patients in whom joint fluid biomarkers were associated with the diagnosis of infection. 8. Evaluate the influence of joint fluid biomarkers on the evolution of functional results in infected patients. 9. Evaluate the influence of bacteriological contamination during surgery on the evolution of functional results in infected patients. 10. Analyze the correlation between the number of revisions and the long-term evolution of patients in this study.
Study population:
This prospective multi-center cohort study will include 100 patients followed in the Department of Orthopedic and Rheumatology Surgery at the University Hospital of Nancy (CHU) or at the Department of Orthopedic and Traumatology Surgery at the University Hospital of Mulhouse (CHU), for: 
- one or multi-joint prosthesis dysfunction requiring an arthroplasty change or revision (septic or aseptic origin) and with a positive clinical suspicion of a septic origin (symptoms >30 days, symptoms improving after preoperative antibiotic therapy) - or chronic PJI (Faix score 15 to 30) with a suspicion of re-infection due to persistence of symptoms.
Procedure:
Infection is a major obstacle to the success of joint total or unicondylar prosthesis and therefore to its long-term functional evolution. Revision in patients with infection will be performed without the benefit of antibiotic therapy, except for an antibiotic pre-treatment as described above. Antibiotic therapy in the course of the surgical procedure will be initiated in all patients. At each consultation, a FJA will be indicated according and is carried out in the"

The purpose of this study is to identify new clinical, structural, and biophysical imaging tools which would help identify early lung dysfunction in CF children, adolescents, and adults.  This is an initial feasibility study to develop and validate in CF.  The study is designed to assess the effectiveness of a gas breathing contrast MRI system used in conjunction with a standard MRI system in healthy controls and individuals with CF.
Participants will undergo a 1 hour 3.0 Tesla combined MRI as part of this study. The MRI will measure their airways ventilation patterns. After that, they will be asked to inhale the contrast gas- PFP- through a valve on a mask worn in the MRI scanning environment.  The subject must hold their breath during the MRI scan, either for five breath hold cycles of increasing duration (5-30 seconds), or during the duration of one shallow tidal breath (5 - 7 seconds). This is a non-invasive procedure, but may cause some discomfort, such as feeling short of breath. We have found that most people are able to complete one of the breath holding tasks, and subjects can choose which breath holding they want to attempt."

The use of double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) has become more widespread in thoracic surgery. The DLT is usually placed in a position with the right main bronchus and the left main bronchus being completely occluded to achieve total collapse of one hemithorax or lung lobar selective ventilation for unilateral surgery. However, the DLT can be pulled and kinked in the bronchial channel during the patient's change of position. The use of a conventional ventilation circuit will cause the DLT to be pulled by gravity, the risk of malposition of the DLT will increase, and the possibility of bronchial obstruction will also be increased. There are currently no clinical trials focusing on the prevention of bronchial dislocation with the help of anesthesia breathing circuits to avoid postoperative pulmonary complications.
To improve the safety of DLT patients before and after thoracic surgery, the investigator designed a multi-center, randomized controlled study. The investigator hopes to evaluate the effectiveness of this new method.
The investigators will recruit 380 patients aged 18 to 65 in the Thoracic Surgery Department and the Department of Anesthesia, Anesthesia Assessment, Respiration, Wujin People's Hospital, from August 1, 2018 to January 31, 2021. The investigators divide the subjects into two groups based on the disconnection of the circuit. One is an experimental group (disconnected group), and the other is a control group (connected group). The investigators will evaluate the incidence of double-lumen endotracheal tube malpositions, complications, intraoperative and postoperative patient satisfaction and outcomes. At the same time, the investigator will evaluate the incidence of double-lumen endotracheal tube malpositions, complications, intraoperative and postoperative patient satisfaction and outcomes.

Inclusion criteria: 1. Elective surgery.
2. ASA I-II patients who need postoperative care in the intensive care unit under thoracic surgery.
3. Patients undergoing thoracic surgery requiring a left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube.
4. Sign the informed consent form for this clinical study.

Intervention model: parallel assignment
Masking: double

Design details: This is a multi-center, randomized controlled study. Three hundred eighty patients aged 18 to 65 years in the Thoracic Surgery Department and the Department of Anesthesia of Wujin People's Hospital will be recruited from August 1, 2018 to January 31, 2021. The subjects will be divided into two groups based on the disconnection of the circuit. One is an experimental group (disconnected group), and the other is a control group (connected group). The subjects in the control group will undergo thoracic surgery as usual and have the anesthetic breathing circuit connected during the patient's changes in position. During the process of changing the supine position to the lateral decubitus position, the anesthesiologist in the experimental group will disconnect the anesthetic breathing circuit first, and then perform lung collapse and ventilation to the other lung, and connect the anesthetic breathing circuit after lung collapse and ventilation.
The investigators will perform one double-lumen endotracheal tube by random number table method. The investigator will evaluate the incidence of double-lumen endotracheal tube malposition, complications, intraoperative and postoperative patient satisfaction and outcomes. At the same time, the investigator will evaluate each group on the same basis to achieve the purpose of comparison."

Periodontal health may be enhanced by gingival augmentation in patients with thin-gingiva. Gingival recession is more commonly seen in patients with thin gingival phenotype, which may lead to various aetiologies. Gingival recession can be a serious problem for both patients and dentists. Several methodologies for gingival recession have been suggested. One of them is gingival augmentation surgery which is most commonly done using different approaches like free gingival graft (FGG), subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) gingival flap (GF), pedicle graft using mucogingival flap (GMF) and connective tissue graft (CTG). All require surgical techniques that involve tissue manipulation to enhance the blood flow supply which is of importance for the healing process of the surgical site. Hence, there are limitations such as donor site morbidity, lengthy surgical procedures with prolonged healing phases, unpredictable wound healing and patient discomfort.
   In recent years, an alternative, minimally invasive method for achieving gingival augmentation has been the use of microneedles in oral tissue. It offers superior results without causing any pain, postoperative discomfort, inflammation or scarring. Microneedling (MN) involves the creation of microchannels in the oral mucosa using 30 gauge lancet needles at a depth of 1.5 mm with manual and/or mechanical instrumentation. This procedure may cause micro wound-healing response, thereby leading to an increase in the gingival tissue dimension and width of keratinized tissue. 
A recent study proved the advantage of microneedling in gingival recession cases. But many cases of recessions were managed by periodontist, and the gingival phenotype in those cases were not mentioned. Another study showed gingival thickness increase when Microneedling (MN) was performed along with I-PRF in thin gingival phenotype.
   This study will be conducted to comparative evaluation of microneedling alone and along with hyaluronic acid on thin gingival phenotype. The present randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in the department of periodontics and oral implantology,Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak, India. 20 systematically healthy patients having thin gingival phenotypes will be included in this split-mouth randomized controlled trial. For each patient, each side of the anterior mandible will be randomly allocated to one of the two procedures (MN or MN with Hyaluronic acid)using chit system. In the MN group microneedling will be done 1 mm below the gingival margin with 30-gauze lancet needles. In the HA with MN group, the selected sites of the gingiva will injected with cross-linked HA using a 30-gauge microneedle followed by microneedling. This described procedure will be repeated in both groups three times with intervals of 10 days. The GT, KTW, and periodontal indices: gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), and probing depth (PD) will be measured at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 9 months. To measure gingival thickness (GT) from the apical 1.5 mm of the gingival margin, a No:15 endodontic spreader with a 3-mm-diameter silicone disc will be placed in the centre and will be measured on Vernier caliper, and the distance will be measured from the deepest point of gingival recession on the gingival margin to the crestal interproximal line (KTW) with respect to the midpoint of tooth. A periodontal probe (PCP, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL-USA) will be used to measure the PD and it will be recorded from the gingival margin to the deepest point of the sulcus and Bleeding on probing assessed at different time points."

Colon cancer surgery leads to the loss of organs and increased metabolic demand that can trigger a catabolic state, altering adipose tissue function and negatively impacting the body's endocrine system. Previous studies showed that this catabolic condition is associated with the risk of surgical site infection (SSI), anastomotic leakage (AL), and length of stay (LOS). Recent research has demonstrated that surgical site infection and AL are associated with a different distribution of gut microbiota in the inflammatory infiltrate. Oral Impact is an immune-nutrient composition that has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of AL in patients undergoing colorectal surgery by modulating the gut microbiome and altering the metabolic profile of adipose tissue. The main aim of the proposed research is to investigate whether pre-postoperative oral immunonutrition with Impact could lower the incidence of SSI, AL, and LOS and change the tissue distribution of gut microbiota and the adipose tissue function in terms of adipo-dermal markers of inflammation, fibrosis in the tissue, and fat mass in the abdomen. The secondary aim includes the construction of a predictive model for clinical and nutritional variables influencing complications and the assessment of the correlation between the changes in the gut microbiota and the impact on surgical and nutritional outcomes in colorectal surgery for neoplasm.
This is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) with a parallel assignment. 200 patients are randomized to receive Impact or a placebo for 10 days prior to colorectal resection surgery. The surgical approach for resection will remain unchanged. The primary endpoints are the incidence of SSI and AL at 30 days and the length of hospital LOS in days. Secondary endpoints include: the number of inflammatory cells in the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues at one month after surgery, the number of fibroblasts at one month after surgery, the number of adipocytes cross-sectional area, the tissue distribution and quantity of gut microbiota, the adipo-dermal inflammatory marker, and the nutritional markers of liver function."

Migraine is a neurological disease/disorder originating in the central nervous system with difficulty modulating responses to common sensory stimuli. It is characterized by being unilateral, frontotemporal, pulsatile, of moderate or severe intensity, nausea and/or vomiting, sensitivity to movement, visual, auditory, and other afferent stimuli may appear. In addition, other symptoms such as fatigue, neck stiffness, decreased concentration, mood swings and yawning may appear, and the headache may be anticipated up to 48 hours.

It has been hypothesized that the possible relationship between the eyes and the pathophysiology of migraine is due to the trigeminal-cervical complex, since if there is an alteration it would be established by a nociceptive impulse that can trigger central sensitization in the trigeminal nuclei.

Today, the quintessential treatment is pharmacological where the excessive use of medications can trigger possible side effects such as depression, anxiety, weight gain, fatigue and drowsiness, among others, causing an alteration in the patient's quality of life more than of the migraine attack.

Several studies show that there are other non-pharmacological treatment options such as manual physiotherapy and therapeutic exercise for migraines, and that it is effective for reducing the intensity and frequency of attacks, the use of medication and improving the quality of life.

Being preventive treatments in order to avoid the frequency and intensity of these attacks.

At present, the role of oculomotricity in headache, although it may be promising, has not been extensively studied. In the literature that the investigators have reviewed, the investigators have found very few studies that investigate manual therapy directly on the eyeball, despite the great relationship of the trigeminal-vascular nerve with migraines and how it influences the different variables.

The main objective of the present study is to investigate the impact and possible additional benefits of adding an oculomotor treatment to a manual therapy protocol of the cervical region in patients with migraine."

Morbidity, mortality, health care cost and loss of patient autonomy for older persons when they are hospitalized are linked to several factors, including the use of drugs. Therefore, the French Agency for Health Safety (HAS) advocates the use of clinical decision support (CDSS) to enhance this population's management.
In particular, the HAS reports a need to provide pharmacists with a CDSS adapted to the hospital environment, able to identify in a preventive way (when a drug is still prescribed) one or other adverse drug reaction like acute renal failure (ARF) or hyperkalemia in older hospitalized patients.

The investigators aim to investigate whether an adapted CDSS that combines CDSS alerts and a dedicated action protocol, applied to older hospitalized patients, would reduce the prevalence of these adverse drug reactions. The investigators intend to study this intervention in 18 hospitals, in order to identify possible factors that explain success or failure of the intervention. An epidemiologist and a pharmaco-economist specialized in CDSS and adverse drug events will join this research program.

First, investigators aim to evaluate how the use of the CDSS alerts with the patient note record of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) influences the rate of adverse drug reactions occurring after hospital admission in older patients.
Second, investigators aim to test the impact of a structured pharmaceutical care intervention including the use of the CDSS alerts on the management of these two adverse drug reactions. In order to achieve the objective, investigators will use a randomized controlled trial design and a stepped-wedge cluster sampling design. A total of 72 hospitals in France will be recruited according to a stepped-wedge design, allowing each recruited hospital to move to the intervention group.
The outcome will be the rate of occurrence of ARF or hyperkalemia in older hospitalized patients.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the CDSS alerts, investigators will use a computerized alert generator in the patient record system, which will be operational in approximately one-third of French hospitals. This system has been implemented in the investigators' hospital, and it is already operational. This tool will use a standardized and consistent pharmacist alert generator, with the opportunity for the hospital team to decide the time to receive a new alert.
To reach the goal of increasing the number of ARF or hyperkalemia cases found thanks to alerts generated during the hospitalization, investigators will train all the pharmacists of the participating hospitals on how to generate alerts and also on the specific work organization to ensure the pharmacist's alert management role.
To evaluate the impact on the management of ARF or hyperkalemia after entry into the hospital, investigators will create an alert management system which includes a structured decision-path with a standardized clinical pharmacist's feedback letter given to the physician.
Qualitative system engineering methods will allow investigators to study the impact of the intervention on pharmaceutical care management processes, work environment and professional interactions. Qualitative analysis will be led by a sociologist, and it will aim to highlight the difficulties and opportunities that exist to change these processes.
The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated at the end of the study based on health care costs for treating an adverse drug reaction and cost related to alerts generation and management."

Background: 
Preoperative short-course radiation (SCRT) is a simple and safe treatment strategy, which has achieved good oncological outcomes in patients with unresectable locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. However, it has no significant effect on the survival rate of patients with MSS type of rectal cancer. Therefore, combined with other drugs such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy to improve the therapeutic effect is of great significance for patients with MSS-type locally advanced rectal cancer. It is confirmed that PD-L1 monoclonal antibody is expected to play a certain role in adjuvant treatment of colon cancer. But the combined effect for rectal cancer at different stages is still unclear. 
Objectives: 
The purpose of the PRECAM-R study is to evaluate whether the short-course radiotherapy of rectal cancer combined with Envafolimab plus CAPEOX regimen can improve the pCR rate of mid-low rectal cancer patients and compare the long-term survival and surgical safety with the traditional short-course radiotherapy of rectal cancer combined with TME surgery. 
Study population: 
A total of 108 patients with MSS-type advanced middle-low rectal cancer will be enrolled in this clinical trial. 
Intervention/Treatment: 
Patients in Group A and Group B will receive SCRT (25Gy/5F) and TME surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with oxaliplatin and capecitabine, respectively. Group A will receive 125mg Envafolimab (ivgtt) 1 week (QW) once a week 4 weeks after the completion of short-course radiation, at the same time, 1000mg capecitabine will be orally daily (d1-14) three weeks after the completion of short-course radiation; Group B will receive the same chemotherapy.

Background: White kidney bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris) is rich in amylase inhibitors which can inhibit starch-digesting enzymes and delay gastric emptying in the gastrointestinal tract. It acts in multiple ways to reduce nutrient absorption, promote satiety, and lower postprandial blood glucose.
Objective: This study attempted to investigate both acute and long-term effects of white kidney bean amylase inhibitors on serum glucose and insulin level.
Methods: Eighteen healthy, male participants (25-45 years), were randomized to one of four diet periods: placebo; oral placebo; oral Phase 1 (day 1) + oral placebo (day 4); and oral Phase 2 (day 4) + oral placebo (day 8). Each period was separated by a 72-hour washout.
Results: Blood glucose levels after glucose loading were significantly reduced by the oral administration of white kidney bean amylase inhibitors. Glucose peak time in Phase 1 was 51 min compared to 169 min in Phase 2 (p<0.05). The oral administration of white kidney bean extracts also reduced glucose absorption (phase 1: p<0.05; phase 2: p<0.01 vs placebo) and improved insulin sensitivity (phase 1: 37.2 ± 10.8 vs 74.4 ± 30.7 p<0.05; phase 2: 29.8 ± 7.3 vs 50.0 ± 10.1 p<0.01 vs placebo). Plasma insulin levels immediately post-meal ingestion and at 120 min were statistically lower when consuming white kidney bean amylase inhibitors. This study also suggested that white kidney bean amylase inhibitor supplementation improves glycemic and insulinemic responses in health individuals. Conclusion: This study shows that white kidney bean amylase inhibitors modulate plasma glucose and insulin levels acutely and the improvement may become greater after repeated oral administration."

Depressive disorders are highly prevalent in primary care and are associated with substantial burden, not only in terms of symptoms but also in terms of healthcare costs and disability. Treatment is still largely inaccessible to the population, due both to a shortage of specialised mental health service centres and to high costs for individuals at risk. This is exacerbated in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to the limited availability of trained professionals in this field. Despite advances in treatment (e.g., evidence-based interventions including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), the majority of individuals living with depression and experiencing symptoms do not receive any treatment at all. Psychological therapies are highly effective for depression. However, it will take a very long time to increase the number of trained specialist mental health workers needed to address the large burden of depression. There is an urgent need for cost-effective and scalable behavioural interventions that do not require any special qualifications in mental health, and can reduce the treatment gap for patients with depression.

The key objective of this study is to understand how an integrated delivery platform can facilitate the provision of a scalable and sustainable model for delivering evidence-based treatment, specifically the Healthy Activity Program (HAP), to individuals with depression in rural, underserved, areas in India. The effectiveness and costs of two different models of delivering HAP, namely facility and community, and the interaction between these two models will be compared.

The HAP has been shown to be effective across multiple randomised trials conducted in different parts of the world. It is also culturally applicable to populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like India and has been shown to be acceptable and effective when conducted by local healthcare workers. These healthcare workers, called counsellors, are already an integral part of the existing primary healthcare system in India. However, the HAP has yet to be tested in a community setting and in a model that combines facility and community-based delivery. The current study, if successful, will provide a platform for scaling up the reach and effectiveness of treatment for depression at a local level in India.
Our goals are to demonstrate how a scalable and sustainable treatment delivery platform can be developed and implemented using existing primary healthcare resources, in a way that is acceptable and accessible to poor rural communities."

The primary objective of this study is to identify acute and chronic effects of BFR protocols combined with low-intensity resistance training on lower-body's blood-flow restriction and dynamic muscle strength endurance, strength and muscle size, as well as the systemic response in terms of catecholamine and inflammatory responses in normoxia and hypoxia conditions. The secondary objective of the study is the identification of physiological and psychological responses to BFR protocols combined with low-intensity resistance training in normoxia and hypoxia conditions. The investigators also aim to compare the effects of different training protocols (low-intensity resistance training, high-intensity resistance training, BFR exercise in normoxia and hypoxia conditions) combined with blood-flow restriction, at different altitude, to see how these are influenced by the conditions, including the comparison to placebo (normoxia and hypoxia without combined with BFR). It is hypothesized that BFR exercise with resistance exercise for low-intensity effort for a prolonged period of time will have similar benefits of traditional high-intensity effort for short duration training sessions."

Rationale: Standard first line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma and symptomatic disease is immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The most commonly used treatment regimens are rituximab plus bendamustin or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), rituximab plus lenalidomide or rituximab monotherapy. The long-term outcome is similar for these regimens; 75-80% of patients are alive 10 years after initial treatment. A subgroup of 20-40% of patients does not respond to or relapse within 24 months of initial treatment (abbreviated POD24 for progression of disease within 24 months), and they risk poorer effect of second line treatments and shorter survival. Only 30-70% of these patients are alive 5 years after initial treatment, depending on the type of first line treatment, and they are in need of improved treatment options. Mosunetuzumab is a new, bispecific, T-cell engaging antibody that has shown very high response rates and long response duration in B-cell lymphoma patients with multiple relapses or lack of response to standard salvage regimens. It is therefore possible that mosunetuzumab will benefit patients with POD24. The main hypothesis of this trial is that mosunetuzumab is better than standard 2nd line salvage regimens in terms of progression free survival 2 years after the initiation of 2nd line treatment in POD24 patients. Objectives: The main objective is to investigate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab monotherapy in follicular lymphoma (FL) with POD24. The secondary objectives are to investigate safety of mosunetuzumab in patients with a current POD24 event prognostic significance of 18F-FDG-PET-CT response to mosunetuzumab rate of transformation to higher grade lymphoma following mosunetuzumab patients´ self-reported quality of life during and after mosunetuzumab resource usage related to mosunetuzumab Interventions: Mosunetuzumab is administered SC as described below. Patients are followed for at least 2,5 years and a maximum of 5 years in the trial. Study-specific sampling of peripheral blood for exploratory research amounts to 330-380 mL (depending on the number of treatment cycles) collected over 3 years. Study-specific tumor samples for future research will be collected by fine needle aspiration before the start of treatment and after the third treatment cycle. Ethical considerations: Previous studies have shown that mosunetuzumab is highly effective and well tolerated in heavily treated B-cell lymphoma patients. The safety profile is favourable compared to standard immunochemotherapy. Mosunetuzumab can be safely administered to older patients with co-morbidities, and there is no upper age limit for participation in the trial. The potential beneficial effect of mosunetuzumab in a population of follicular lymphoma patients with POD24 outweighs the risk for rare and undiscovered serious adverse events. The total volume of blood samples is considered acceptable for patients in clinical trials. The extra tumor samples for research purposes will only be collected if deemed safe and not to cause unreasonable discomfort for the participating subject. The extra number of CT scans is 2-3 compared to standard practice and represents a minimal increase in radiation exposure. In total, the benefit to risk balance is deemed positive for this trial.

Background:
Postoperative pain after open renal surgeries is one of the most painful conditions after surgery with sever impact on the patient and affect his postoperative course. Many techniques were applied to manage postoperative pain such as Erector spinae plane block (ESPB), Thoracic Paravertebral block (TPVB), Quadrtus lamborum block (QLB), each has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost, side effects and efficacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of these blocks in postoperative pain in patients after elective open renal surgeries.
Methods: This was randomized, controlled, single-blinded study, conducted in urology operating theatre, Al-Azhar university hospital. Forty eight patients of both sex and aged from 21-65 years in period between February 2022 to January 2023 scheduled for elective open renal surgeries under general anesthesia were enrolled in this study. The procedure was explained to the patient and informed consent was signed after his agreement then the patient was classified to one of three groups.
                Group 1 : Erector spinae plane block, group 2: Thoracic Paravertebral block group 3 control group.
                The patient was placed in lateral position with head down to maximize the distance between thoracic paravertebral space and pleural space. A high frequency linear probe (GE LOGIQ e, USA) was placed in sagittal plane in paramedian position on the thoracic spine. The transducer was held with the patient's spinous process and the transversal process as guides. A block needle (GELOGIQ e, USA) was inserted in plane (Sonovue; Hologic Inc, Bedford, USA) with 22G for Eerector spinae block in 6th-7th thoracic level, a block needle (GELOGIQ e, USA) was inserted in plane with 22G for Quadrtus lamborum block in the 6th-7th thoracic level, and a block needle with 22G for Thoracic Paravertebral block in the 10th-12th thoracic level, with each group received after the induction of general anesthesia before performing any surgical incisions and before emergence. 1/2 ml/kg of Bupivacain (Ropivacaine®; Ropivacaine 5mg/ml of Astra Zeneca®) was deposited at Erector spinae plane block, Quadrtus lamborum block and TPVB. The control group receive 0.1 mg/kg morphine (Morphine Ibn Sina Company).
                All patient's were observed with PACU follow up and then followed up by telephone call to measure Visual analogue scale 24 hours postoperative VAS (0-10) also opioids consumption 24 hours postoperative. The data were collected by one person who was not aware the type of block which the patient received. The data were analysed using SPSS version 23 and compared using one way ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test as appropriate.
                The results: Forty eight patients were enrolled in the study. The Erector spinae plane block group received erector spinae plane block. The TPVB group received TPVB. The QLB group received Quadratus lamborum block. The total morphine requirements 24 hours postoperatively in erector spinae plane block group of 7 (56%) patients of that group needed no medications, In patients with TPVB group of 2 patients (17%) received morphine while 1 or 8.3% needed Diclofenac and 10 or 83% received tramadol. In control group of 3 patients (25%) received morphine, In patients with TPVB group of 1 patient (8.32%) received morphine while 2 or 16.66% needed Diclofenac and 9 or 75% received tramadol. There is a significant difference in opiate consumption 24 hours postoperative of 3 or 25% in the Erector spinae block group compared to TPVB group (16.66%) and control group (25%), also the opiate consumption 24 hours postoperative was significantly lower in the Ere"

Post-Intensive Care Unit (PICU) Survivors often experience post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), an umbrella term for adverse health conditions that can last months to years, following critical illness. An estimated 100,000 people are admitted to each of the 25 million ICU beds yearly, worldwide. As one of the leading drivers for aging, 5.1 million U.S. adults over 75 years of age are licensed to drive without the need for vision or hearing screenings. The investigators hypothesize that in-vehicle driving assessment and monitoring is a feasible and acceptable approach to assess and address ICU survivor driving safety. The investigators seek to implement novel in-vehicle cloud-data collection technology developed by the investigators' team. The investigators propose to pair neurocognitive assessments with in-vehicle kinematic driving data to conduct essential formative work to develop data-based insights into driving behaviors of older adults with ICU-acquired cognitive declines. The investigators aims to determine protocol feasibility and acceptability of neurocognitive assessments and in-vehicle sensor deployment (Aim 1). The investigators will enroll a cohort of older ICU survivors (n=24) with risk factors for ICU-acquired cognitive impairment to complete neurocognitive measures and participate in driving data collection via in-vehicle sensors over a 6-month post-hospital discharge period. Next, the investigators will evaluate the relationship between neurocognitive assessments and driving behavior and safety in older ICU survivors (Aim 2). Lastly, the investigators will conduct stakeholder advisory panels on the priorities and data presentation needs of driving assessments for older ICU survivors (Aim 3). The stakeholder advisory panel insights will provide scientific justification and protocol feasibility to evaluate recruitment, acceptability and attrition for future full-scale implementation."

Background and Significance: Obesity is a risk factor for mortality and many other chronic and life-limiting health conditions. Psychological interventions that increase self-regulation strategies to approach healthy eating and physical activity show promise for treatment and prevention. This proposal outlines the design for a brief, 4-hour workshop to increase self-regulation strategies related to healthy weight behaviors. Methods: The main objective of this study is to pilot test the development and implementation of an empirically-based workshop for promoting healthy weight behaviors. 70 women (age 40-65; BMI >30 kg/m2) will be randomly assigned to an 8-week weight management workshop that will teach self-regulation skills in the form of an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy-based workshop. Study data will be collected at baseline, 1-week, 1-month (workshop completion) and 2-month post-intervention. Participants will complete surveys assessing dietary habits, physical activity behaviors, body weight, psychological flexibility, weight self-stigma, body image, and emotional eating. Results: Findings will help refine the workshop and will inform an RCT to test efficacy."

GIST is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. The guidelines recommend that patients at high risk of recurrence should be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib for at least 3 years after surgery. Recent studies have reported that some GIST patients who have achieved disease control through long-term use of imatinib can still achieve a long progression-free survival after drug withdrawal, and those who relapse after drug withdrawal can still achieve disease control after re-use of imatinib. These findings suggest that for some selected patients, a treatment mode of drug holiday could be possible. This model, also known as intermittent therapy or on-off therapy, will be observed to observe whether the drug holiday or temporary withdrawal of drug can meet the goal of tumor clearance while reducing the drug's side effects for the patient and improving his or her quality of life. This mode of treatment can only be realized based on MRD detection. Therefore, this one-arm prospective observational clinical study will assist some high-risk GIST patients who have been treated with imatinib for 3 years after surgery and have achieved disease control to adopt the treatment mode of drug holiday based on MRD detection. This study is designed to assist patients to withdraw the oral use of imatinib within 3 years after operation, monitor MRD status and guide drug re-use according to MRD conversion at an early stage, and at the same time observe the occurrence of drug-resistant mutations."

Children with medical complexity (CMC) are increasingly prescribed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) for chronic respiratory failure. NiPPV effectively corrects abnormal gas exchange, improves sleep quality, and reduces symptoms of chronic respiratory failure. The use of NiPPV has been associated with increased survival and improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To ensure effectiveness, NiPPV must be used for all periods of sleep and settings must be individually-titrated. Unfortunately, poor adherence results in many CMC being undertreated for chronic respiratory failure. Successful NiPPV initiation is critical because early negative experiences are commonly reported barriers to adherence and early usage predicts longer term use. Standard of care is the initiation and titration of NiPPV during a one-night in-hospital PSG. A PSG is challenging for CMC and families due to their medical fragility and lasting effects of travel and a disrupted routine, the significant amount of equipment and supplies that must be brought to the study as well as the financial implications and additional psychosocial stress for caregivers. Furthermore, negative experiences with NiPPV may be exacerbated by introduction of the therapy in an unfamiliar PSG laboratory with burdensome monitoring. Recent technological advances in remote NiPPV monitoring coupled with a shift to virtual care models has enabled a patient and family centered opportunity to bypass the PSG laboratory and initiate NiPPV at home. Remote NiPPV monitoring extends data collection beyond discrete health care encounters and provides real-time data on adherence and efficacy that can be wirelessly transmitted to facilitate setting adjustment by clinicians. Home NiPPV initiation is increasingly being requested by patients and caregivers. The potential benefits of this innovative care model include increasing patient and family empowerment, improving the delivery of high quality patient-centred care at home, and optimizing NiPPV use. Although there is growing data in the adult population to support home NiPPV initiation via telemonitoring, this cannot be simply extrapolated to CMC. There are key differences in the etiology and manifestation of chronic respiratory failure in CMC compared to adults. Furthermore, family caregivers play an important role in NiPPV acceptance and adherence. Canadian guidelines acknowledge the lack of evidence for the setting in which NiPPV is initiated. Home NiPPV initiation in CMC is a novel model of care that may result in large health system impacts, but requires a feasibility study before embarking on a large-scale trial. This proposal will evaluate the feasibility and safety of an innovative model of care for NiPPV initiation in the home environment utilizing remote telemonitoring compared to usual care which is in-hospital polysomnography (PSG) laboratory-based initiation. The incidence of CMC requiring NiPPV is exponentially growing. NiPPV effectively corrects abnormal gas exchange, improves sleep quality, and reduces symptoms of chronic respiratory failure. The use of NiPPV has been associated with increased survival and improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To ensure effectiveness, NiPPV must be used for all periods of sleep and settings must be individually-titrated. Unfortunately, poor adherence results in many CMC being undertreated for chronic respiratory failure.

The study will be a single-blind, randomized clinical trial. A total of 24 volleyball athletes with latent myofascial trigger points in gastrocnemius on both sides will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: the intervention group and the control group. The inclusion criteria for participation in this study was being a healthy female volleyball practitioners, without lower limb injury in the last 6 months, and having latent MTPs in gastrocnemius. Exclusion criteria include experiencing needle phobia, presence of active MTPs in the lower limb, pathology that prevents the use of dry needling, and pathology that prevents the performance of vertical jump test.

Both groups will perform a standard warm-up session consisting on continuous running, dynamic lower limb stretching, and vertical jumps for 10 minutes. Then, the principal investigator will apply the dry needling technique to those allocated to the experimental group on the latent trigger points diagnosed on the selection phase. They were allocated according to the presence or absence of even numbers. Subjects in the control group will be asked to wait on the intervention couch for a similar time the ones who received the treatment. The intervention group, along with the control group, will perform three countermovement jumps (CMJ) in each of the study points. CMJ-style jumps will be recorded with an iPhone 15 high-speed camera app.

The primary outcome measure was the counter movement jump (CMJ), which will be measured immediately after the needling technique (T1), 72 h after (T3), and 7 days after the intervention (T4). The difference in flight times between pre and post dry needling and pre and post control was computed for both groups and statistical differences were analyzed using a two-tailed independent t-test. We expect to find an increase in CMJ flight time in the intervention group compared to the control group after dry needling."

The purpose of the ETMS for Stress Project is to conduct a 10-week clinical research trial investigating the safety and efficacy of combining a novel, EEG-guided device called Neuromodulation (NMD) with standard behavior and medication treatments for Chronic Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders (TSRD). 500 Veterans from the Cincinnati Veterans Affairs (VAMC), Dayton, and Cleveland VAMCs and the University of Dayton will participate in the ETMS for Stress Project. Participants will be at least 22 years old; they will have been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan at least once (or served more than 90 days during Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom) and have a current diagnosis of PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, Substance Use Disorder, or Chronic Pain Disorder. They may have other psychiatric disorders. To be included in the study, participants must have completed treatment with their primary therapist or psychiatrist. The study will last for 10 weeks, not including screening or follow-up. The study has 3 phases: Phase 1 - 30 days of daily eTMS as an adjunct to standard of care and integrative treatment; Phase 2 - 7 weeks of up to 3 eTMS treatments weekly for a total of up to 21 treatments; and Phase 3 - 8 weeks of a tailored taper schedule to safely reduce eTMS treatments to once weekly.
TMS is a non-invasive procedure that will be conducted at the participating VAMCs and the University of Dayton. Prior to beginning with their study TMS sessions, participants will take an electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure activity of the brain waves. A sensor net will be attached to the head - without any direct contact with the brain - to measure and analyze the brain signals. The session will last up to 45 minutes without the use of any medicinal preparation on the day of the session. Before, during, and after the sessions, participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires to measure their symptoms, assess their depression and anxiety, and record any adverse effects. They will have 6 weeks of up to 3 eTMS treatments weekly plus the 7- and 8- week tapering period during which they may have up to 1 or 2 eTMS treatments weekly. Participants will continue with their standard treatment in the outpatient setting throughout the 10-week study. The investigators will conduct a 10-week study with a 5 year follow-up."

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), the selection of patients for treatment with synthetic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (c-DMARDs) and biologic therapy (b-DMARDs) is based on the following criteria:
(i) Disease duration;
(ii) Disease severity;
(iii) Age of the patient;
(iv) Prior treatment with specific anti-arthritic treatment;
(v) Comorbidities;
(vi) Concomitant drugs affecting arthritis progression (NSAIDs);
(vii) Evidence of disease inflammation (DAS/CRP/ESR).
Currently, biologic DMARDs (b-DMARDs) revolutionized the treatment of PsA and RA. b-DMARDs targeting specific pathways of the arthritic process (IL-17, TNF-alfa, IL-12/23, IL-6, IL-23) have been proved efficacious in the management of RA patients. In PsA patients, the selection of b-DMARDs remains a challenge. Indeed, the response to TNF-alfa and IL-17 inhibitors is variable and unpredictable and the risk of developing b-DMARDs-induced arthritis at 6 months of treatment varies from 8,9 to 44% depending on the treatment indication.
In PsO, the role of b-DMARDs is also controversial as well. On one hand, PsO is a chronic inflammatory disease that could be driven by some of the same inflammatory pathways targeted by b-DMARDs. On the other hand, PsO is a multifaceted disease that is characterized by the onset of psoriatic arthritis in a subset of patients (25 to 30%) and the use of b-DMARDs to treat patients with PsO might not be indicated.
There is a need, therefore, to identify the population of PsO patient at risk of developing PsA and the PsO-related biomarkers relevant for differentiation between PsO and PsA patients and the treatment response.
This study focuses on the optimization of patient selection for treatment with b-DMARDs in PsA and RA, and in predicting the treatment response in PsO patients at risk of PsA. The study is conducted in coadjunction with the clinical study EURASA. As there is no consensus on the role of biologics in PsO, the investigators hypothesize that:
(i) The use of non-invasive technology for ultrasound joint assessment could predict the risk of PsA development and treatment response in PsO patients at risk of PsA development and patients with PsA;
(ii) Psoriasis and arthritis biomarkers identified from serum, skin and synovial tissue might provide a more comprehensive tool for the monitoring of biologic response during the treatment with b-DMARDs in PsA, RA and PsO patients.
(iii) The use of new technologies for synovial tissue biopsy analysis, such as single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic studies (CITE-seq and spatial transcriptomics), might identify novel cell population and biomarker relevant for the optimization of treatment in PsA and RA.
To achieve these goals, the investigators will use non-invasive imaging (ultrasound) to predict the risk of PsA development and treatment response in PsO patients at risk of PsA development and patients with PS. PsO lesions and clinical and laboratory parameters of peripheral arthritis will be recorded and correlated to serum inflammatory markers.
To increase the understanding of the role of b-DMARDs in the management of PsA and RA and to explore new treatment protocols for PsA and RA patients, the investigators will monitor the response to bDMARDs in patients in a long-term follow-up and in patients with treatment-induced remission (with or without the withdrawal of b-DMARDs). The investigators will also conduct a pilot study on the use of b-DMARDs in PsO patients to predict the risk of PsA development and treatment response.
Finally, the investigators will analyze the synovial immune and stromal cells of PsO patients at risk of developing PsA"

The use of statins to prevent metastatic diseases is an area of intense research in clinical oncology. Data from basic research suggest that high levels of LDL in the blood may promote the growth of cancer and spread of cancer that has already formed. In addition, there is increasing evidence that cholesterol-lowering statins like atorvastatin (lipitor) may have an anti-cancer effect that may prevent the spread of cancer or tumor cell invasion of other tissues. This may be an important step in developing a long-term prevention approach for patients with melanoma. Studies have been performed in laboratory animals where mice and rats were fed statins and given cancer causing chemicals that promote the growth of cancer. In these studies the use of statins prevented the spread of tumors and/or the formation of metastases to other organs. These pre-clinical studies must be confirmed by studies in humans and therefore patients enrolled in this clinical trial will receive either atorvastatin (Lipitor) or matched placebo and will have their outcomes assessed over a period of up to 5 years.
The aims of this trial are focused on several key objectives:
1. Evaluate the ability of statins to prevent the spread of cancer in patients where surgical resection removed the primary cancer and who are at a very high risk of recurrence.
2. Assess whether adjuvant high dose statins impact overall survival in this group of patients.
3. Explore the clinical utility of gene expression profiling in the management of high risk melanomas and its potential association with melanoma spread and recurrence within this specific clinical trial population.
This clinical trial will determine whether high dose atorvastatin therapy will improve recurrence-free survival in patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to a treatment arm with either atorvastatin or placebo and followed for recurrence-free survival over a 5 year period. During this time they will undergo imaging and evaluation of gene expression to see how gene expression may impact on response to treatment.
Recurrence-free survival (RFS) is an important endpoint and refers to time from surgery, in which no new local or distant cancer is detected and there is no cancer tumor related mortality assessed up through year 5. Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) refers to the time from the study entry to appearance of cancer in distant locations. Overall survival (OS) is defined as time from the study entry to death due to any cause. DMFS will be assessed using a stratified log-rank test. The median and survival rates at each time point will be derived from the Kaplan-Meier estimate along with their 95% confidence interval. Survival curves for the treatment and placebo groups will be compared using the Log-Rank test and hazard ratios and its 95% confidence interval will be provided. OS will also be assessed using similar methodology. The primary comparison between two treatment groups will be performed using a stratified log-rank test with a 2-sided 0.1 level of significance. Gene expression profiling will be used to develop a predictive model, which can identify high risk for distant recurrence and guide therapeutic management. The gene expression profiles will be correlated with gene pathways that promote melanoma spread and identified targets may be further validated for their impact in melanoma spread.."

Hypertension during pregnancy is a leading cause of pregnancy-related death and serious maternal medical complications. Prenatal care is a critical setting for detecting and managing hypertension during pregnancy. This clinical trial will test the effectiveness of three implementation strategies designed to support 20 prenatal care clinics in providing more effective care to pregnant patients with high blood pressure. The three strategies include facilitation (guiding teams towards high-quality improvement and coaching (offering recommendations on ways to improve performance).
Through a multi-component implementation strategy, the clinics will work to deliver timely care to women with high blood pressure. If effective, the results will have significant public health implications for the millions of pregnant women and their babies who receive prenatal care annually. The intervention has the potential to improve maternal and infant health outcomes, decrease costs to the health system, and prevent avoidable maternal deaths. This pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial will build upon a previous study that developed a bundle of evidence-based practices for managing high blood pressure in pregnancy."

One in 5 US adults are age 50 and older and 7 in 50 adults age 65 years and older, which constitutes the world's oldest and most rapidly growing population. Older adults face a higher risk of alcohol-related diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease due to alcohol use. Yet, it is understudied due to social stigma and misconceptions about drinking behavior among older adults. There is an urgent call for effective assessment, prevention, and intervention for older adults to reduce health risk from alcohol and encourage healthy aging. Brief, low-burden, and low-cost digital interventions are an effective solution to overcome barriers such as stigma, access to care, and aging-specific behaviors among older adults. Text-messaging health interventions are an effective way to deliver health behavior interventions, scalable, tailored and cost-effective method of intervention delivery that can promote behavioral change. Contrary to stereotypes, older adults use mobile technology and seek online and mobile interventions, and they often engage longer compared to younger populations. This study will design and evaluate three behavioral interventions based on gain- and loss-framing to reduce hazardous drinking among older adults. This study focuses on gain- and loss-framing of behavior change goals (i.e., the positives of change and the negatives of remaining with the status quo), critical components of behavioral science, and health behavioral interventions. The investigators will design and evaluate three behavioral interventions based on loss-framing, gain-framing, and a combination of loss- and gain-framing to reduce drinking among a sample of 150 older adults with hazardous drinking. Participants will be randomized to one of the three experimental conditions: Experimental: Loss-framed text messaging control condition Experimental: Gain-framed text messaging control condition; Experimental: Combined loss- and gain-framed text messaging control condition. Participants will undergo cross-sectional online assessments before and after the intervention to track drinking behavior, and they will also complete a mobile assessment (via text message) once per week to track drinking over the course of 8 weeks. The effects of the group on drinking behavior will be compared at weeks 4, 8, and 16 months, and attrition will be closely monitored. Finally, the investigators will explore how the effects of condition are impacted by gender and age."

The purpose of this Phase 1, open-label, single-arm study is to evaluate the biodistribution and safety of [ 18F]-Fluselenamyl 18F-Fluselenamyl is a novel PET tracer that binds to brain regions associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). We plan to conduct scans using PET and MRI modalities to assess the sensitivity of [ 18F]-Fluselenamyl to image Amyloid beta in participants with AD. The scans will be read blinded by an expert panel and the results will be compared with [ 11C]-Pittsburgh Compound (PIB) imaging, a reference standard PET tracer for AD. An objective comparison of 18F-Fluselenamyl with PIB in the same participant using both PET and the MRI component (either Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)) will provide data regarding the sensitivity of both tracers, their ability to detect Alzheimer's pathology, as well as any differences in sensitivity based on imaging technique. Participants with and without AD who are at least 18 years old will be enrolled. Each participant will receive both PET imaging with [ 18F]-Fluselenamyl and [ 11C]-Pittsburgh Compound, with each test involving between 3 and 8 injections of the respective PET tracers. Blood samples will be obtained on approximately four occasions for all enrolled participants. Each enrolled participant will be followed for a period of 1 hour, which includes the PET scanning session, imaging interpretation and completion of study interviews. The total period of follow-up for each participant, not including repeat participation, will be between 10 and 12 months. The study will also examine the pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of 18F-Fluselenamyl as measured by whole body PET/CT scan and blood sampling.

Background: Primary progressive aphasia is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive language deficit with impairments in listening comprehension and conversation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique capable to induce modulation of cortical activity over a specific region by magnetic fields delivered by TMS coil. Neurostimulation in PPA and its potential effects on brain circuits and behavior have not been systematically investigated. Objective: This clinical trial will assess the long-term effects of TMS combined with language training in PPA patients. A multisite study in an inpatient setting will use fMRI and behavioral tests to measure treatment outcomes at the individual and brain level in PPA patients. 
Design: 15 PPA patients will be recruited in two centers. PPA patients will be assigned into two arms, one receiving active and the other sham TMS followed by daily language training using a language and auditory game at home. Each TMS session comprises a single block (30 trains) of theta bursts delivered over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (i.e., 30 trains of 3 pulses at 80 Hz repeated every 2s, total duration of the train is 6 seconds) and followed by language therapy. TMS and language therapy will be offered five days a week during two weeks, followed by one session per week for 6 months. FDG-PET imaging and behavioral assessment will be performed at baseline and six months.
Analysis: FDG-PET imaging will be conducted using SPM12 to compare the treatment groups on the standard uptake value ratio between baseline and 6-month scan. Changes in brain metabolism will be also related to clinical and behavioral measures."

Malnutrition affects 30% of all hospitalizations, producing important consequences in terms of increased morbidity, prolonged stay in the hospital, treatment costs and mortality. The diagnosis of malnutrition is currently based on the loss of lean body mass (LBM) in 5% or more of the total baseline, or a body mass index less than 20 Kg/m2, measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis. The current diagnostic criteria, based on the loss of muscle mass, do not focus on the factors that cause muscle mass loss. Inflammation is one of the leading causes of muscle mass loss, especially in chronic diseases, affecting up to 70% of patients with malnutrition. Inflammation causes muscle wasting and a decrease in muscle strength in the absence of food restriction, with consequences on functional status and quality of life. This study aims to identify, in patients with malnutrition and chronic inflammation, whether an oral nutritional supplement with anti-inflammatory effect (rich in omega-3 and olive oil polyphenols) and a programme of physical exercise with the intention of decreasing inflammation and muscle mass loss. Secondary objective: To compare the clinical results (albumin, glucose, total cholesterol, total proteins, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte count, platelet count, neutrophil count, glycosylated hemoglobin and creatinine clearance), nutritional status (total energy and macronutrient intake) and quality of life assessed with SF-36 questionnaires in patients in the two groups, at baseline, 1st, 2nd and 3rd month of follow-up. It is suspected that patients included in the study group, will have an improvement in these parameters. Third objective: To identify the main variables of metabolism in relation to dietary habits, nutritional status, functional capacity, clinical status and quality of life. It is hypothesized that the study group may show an improvement in these variables compared to the control group, due to the change in diet to an anti-inflammatory profile and the nutritional rehabilitation promoted. Fourth objective: To compare the weight change, muscle mass and fat mass, as evaluated with bioelectrical impedance at the beginning and end of the study (3 months) in the study group, with the aim of evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a physical exercise program based on functional activities. It is suspected that patients in the study group will show more weight loss due to an increase in muscle mass and fat mass, without loss of LBM, and a better quality of life compared to the control group. Fifth objective: Describe the nutritional habits, body composition, weight change, physical activity, functional capacity, muscle strength, inflammation status and quality of life in the patients who voluntarily participate in the study, through a two-day dietary survey, bioelectrical impedance analysis and questionnaires used in clinical practice."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the prolongation of evaporation time of the solvent of two universal adhesives increases its longevity. This will be evaluated by the retention of restorations of Non-Carious Cervical Lesions (NCCL). This is a randomized prospective controlled clinical trial, with double-blind masking of participants, in which participants will be divided into a control group and an experimental group. Both groups will receive two different universal adhesives with different evaporation times of solvents, which will be clinically applied in one surface of a dental lesion located in the cervical part (NCCL). All will receive the same type of resin restorations and be light-cured in the selective enamel etching strategy. The primary end-point will be the number of participants whose restorations have been removed due to fracture during a maximum period of 24 months. Also, secondary end-points will assess retention, marginal adaptation and marginal staining. Statistical analysis will use the chi-square test of independence, to verify changes in retention, marginal adaptation, and marginal staining during the study. The analysis will have 95% confidence, and the significance level will be set up at 0.05. Both groups will be compared with the chi-square test of independence, to verify differences between each other. The sample size will be 140 (70 participants in each arm)."

L1CAM-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells may help the body fight small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective L1CAM-specific CAR T cells are in treating small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer. The FDA has approved one type of CAR T cell for the treatment of a blood cancer. Researchers want to see how well this treatment works for prostate cancer. L1CAM is found on the surface of most SCNPC. CAR T cells are immune cells (T cells) that are changed in the laboratory so they can seek out and kill cells with L1CAM. These CAR T cells are then infused into a vein. The CAR T cells circulate throughout the body until they find and kill prostate cancer cells with L1CAM. In this study, patients infused with these L1CAM-specific CAR T cells will also receive chemotherapy before the T cell infusion to make room for the new T cells.

Inclusion criteria: Patients must be at least 18 years old and have a diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer.

Pancreatic resection has drastically changed in recent years. Likewise, the treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). In most cases, pancreatic total pancreatectomy (TP) has been recommended as an initial treatment due to the tendency of early recurrence after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). However, WOTSA has become popular as a surgical treatment for pancreatic head cancers. Recently, more and more PDA has been performed for leftward extension of pancreatic parenchyma transaction line during Whipple. This case report shows that leftward extension of pancreatic transaction line for pancreatic head cancers is a common finding in the initial pancreatic surgery. In addition, in 2020, leftward extension of parenchyma transaction line occurs in 82.7% of patients who have undergone Whipple in our hospital. 
In that case, TP can be replaced by WOTSA. Therefore, we performed WOTSA for PDCA which abuts or involves both gastroduodenal and splenic arteries and analyzed the efficacy and safety of this technique. 
A total of 40 consecutive patients who underwent Whipple over the splenic artery (WOTSA) for PDCA were compared with 30 patients who underwent total pancreatectomy (TP) between 2008 and 2018. T1DM or severe diabetes developed in 17 WOTSA patients. However, these patients did not show severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia after the operation. The remnant pancreatic volume of WOTSA patients became 39% of the total and only one case had a clinically symptomatic postoperative pancreatic fistula or recurrence during the 5 years. The remnant pancreatic volume was similar to that of TP patients at 1 week after the operation. The average tumor burden in WOTSA patients was significantly greater than that in TP patients. The 5 years overall survival rate was 38.5%, which was slightly lower than that of TP patients.
TP could be replaced by WOTSA for PDA. Further studies might be necessary to evaluate the clinical outcomes."

MS is an immune-mediated and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that is markedly increasing in prevalence amongst older adults. Older adults with MS present with poor health status and functioning, cognitive and ambulatory difficulty, dependence for activities of daily living, and reduced physical activity participation. Exercise training has been recognized as a promising approach for maintaining and/or restoring physical and cognitive health in older adults from the general population and younger adults with MS. To date, there is a dearth of research examining the benefits of exercise training among older adults with MS. The current study proposes a remotely-delivered exercise training program for improving cognition and mobility among older adults with MS. The proposed research adopts an innovative intervention approach via telerehabilitation and is convenient and accessible for older adults with MS. This exercise training program adopts an innovative intervention approach via telerehabilitation and is convenient and accessible for older adults with MS. This research may have practical relevance for improving physical activity among older adults with MS through alleviating travel concerns and reducing environmental/social barriers. If successful, the proposed project will provide foundations for implementing larger, high-quality RCTs using remotely-delivered exercise intervention for managing the consequences of aging and MS and ultimately contributing to successful aging with MS.

Vasoplegic shock affects one in every four to five patients admitted to intensive care. A rapid and effective reduction in the dose of vasoactive medications, especially catecholamines, in the management of this condition greatly reduces mortality. However, achieving it is problematic as it often requires the use erythrocyte concentrates and hydroxyethylstarch with risks of acute transfusion reaction, haemoglobinuria or acute intrarenal vasoconstrictor syndrome. Blood or plasma purification with hemofilters eliminates catecholamines but cannot remove free hemoglobin released with erythrocyte haemolysis; and vasoactive mediators that accumulate in the renal impairment often seen in this group of patients. Moreover, the risk of transmission of the prion protein increases the more frequent the use of these devices becomes an area for study. In septic shock, inflammation amplifies vasoplegia by producing vasoactive mediators (such as angiotensin II) and causes an overproduction of free hemoglobin and erythrocytes. Free hemoglobin is also toxic for the kidneys, which may further impair their filtration function. The new oXiris membrane developed by BAXTER, with its low permeability to free hemoglobin, may reduce the haemodynamic instability, the inflammatory response and the rate of renal impairment observed with the use of conventional haemodialysis membranes. The oXiris membrane was tested in a small pilot study, in septic shock patients, that suggested improvements in these three parameters. These encouraging results need to be confirmed in a larger cohort. To avoid a potential bias, the study will include patients with or without acute renal impairment. The goal is to determine the influence of oXiris -Prismaflex on the evolution of endothelial permeability, the markers associated with sepsis-induced immunosuppression and the evolution of catecholamine therapy. If the results of this study are positive, the use of the oXiris membrane in these patients could reduce the rate of acute intrarenal vasoconstrictor syndrome and reduce the risk of acute transfusion reaction caused by erythrocyte concentrates. The goal over the medium term is to make a randomized controlled interventional study at the national level, the main difficulty being the organization of this study since oXiris -Prismaflex is now used in most adult intensive care centres in acute renal impairment."

Hysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed gynecological operations. It is carried out because of a variety of indications, such as presence of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, myoma uteri, adenomyosis and adnexal mass. Hysterectomy can be performed using abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic or robotically methods. According to the results from a study performed in the United States, the incidence rates for hysterectomies using abdominal, vaginal and laparoscopic methods are 66%, 22% and 12%, respectively. The rate of hysterectomy performed through laparoscopic approach was 28.3% in 2001 and 46.8% in 2009 in Turkey, increasing from 26.1% to 49.9% in Europe, and from 18.6% to 29.7% in USA in 2015. There is still no consensus on which of these approaches is the optimum surgical method for hysterectomy. Abdominal hysterectomy is the most frequently performed approach, but current clinical practice mandates that, when appropriate, the surgical method should be vaginal rather than abdominal, since the former is associated with better outcomes and lower complication rates. Moreover, when vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible or not indicated, the surgical method should be laparoscopic, because total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) provides a faster return to normal activity, shorter hospital stays, lower intraoperative bleeding and fewer wound infections, compared with abdominal hysterectomy. However, longer operating times and higher incidence of urinary system damage are seen in laparoscopic hysterectomies.
Cesarean section (CS) is the most commonly performed surgery on women and has increased significantly in the last 15 years. Various reasons account for the increase in CS, including an increase upon maternal request, changes in maternal demographics (e.g., increasing maternal age), changes in physician practice patterns, more conservative practice guidelines, and mounting legal pressures. Because of the gradually increasing rates of CS (CSs) over the last two decades, the number of hysterectomized patients with previous CS has increased. In a recent review article, previously performed CSs were demonstrated to be an important risk factor for lower urinary tract injuries, and the recommendation that abdominal hysterectomy might be preferable for these patients was emphasized. TLH may be technically difficult in patients with previous CSs, due to surgical adhesions, and is associated with a higher risk of perioperative complications. Mobilization of the urinary bladder off of the cervix is an important step in total laparoscopic hysterectomy, and is always performed before dealing with the uterine pedicle. If the uterus is unscarred, bladder mobilization may not be technically difficult. However, if the uterus is scarred, there can be adhesions not only between the uterus and the bladder but also to the anterior abdominal wall, which can make dissection challenging.
The investigators conduct a prospective randomized control trial in which the efficacy, operative time and the rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications between the central and the lateral dissection techniques will be compared. The investigator hypothesizes that the lateral approach may cause less bladder injury and less surgical trauma."

Asthma is a chronic lung disease. It affects over 250 million people worldwide. A minority of patients will have significant morbidity from their asthma. Despite existing guidelines for treating the condition, there are a large number of patients who continue to have poorly controlled asthma. As asthma treatment has not changed significantly in the last fifteen years, there is an urgent need to identify new treatment targets. Recent studies have shown that the human microbiome can influence immune responses to infectious and inflammatory threats and that disturbances in the microbiome can contribute to chronic inflammatory disease, including asthma. 
The goal of this research is to explore the role of the respiratory microbiome in the maintenance of asthma and its influence on treatment response in asthma patients participating in a standard care clinic. 102 patients aged 18-90 years will be recruited from the Asthma Clinic at St James Hospital, Dublin. Participants for this study will be identified from patients attending the clinic and fulfilling the European Respiratory Society Task Force definition of asthma. Patients will be assigned to different study arms - biologic naïve, or established on biologic therapy - and their asthma severity and treatment will be categorized. Participants will attend for clinic visits over a year, along with providing samples for analysis of their microbiome. The data generated will be used to evaluate the microbiome profile and its impact on disease character.  We aim to identify the microbiome signature associated with different asthma phenotypes, and to determine if this signature correlates with changes in symptom control and treatment response. In addition, we will explore the role of the microbiome in the development of asthma co-morbidities such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis , nasal polyps and GERD. This information will be used to determine if specific changes in the microbiome have prognostic value in terms of disease progression and response to therapy, helping to improve the early detection of poor treatment outcome.  Understanding the influence of microbiome composition on disease character and response to therapy may help to identify specific microbial interventions to improve the quality of life of patients with asthma."

This is a descriptive pilot study of providing cancer care for multiple myeloma care at St. Luke's Hospital, a satellite site, or at the primary Siteman Cancer Center site. The main goal is to compare patient satisfaction, burden from treatment, and financial toxicity in patients who transition their care to a satellite site. We hypothesize 1) that patients who transfer care location will have equal or higher satisfaction with patient-provider relationships, report lower burden of treatment, and less financial toxicity relative to those with care located at the primary Siteman Cancer Center site; 2) that patients who transfer care location will have equal or more care provided by a specialist; and 3) that patients who transition care will not have decreased access to high tech diagnostic and treatment modalities. We aim to enroll approximately 300 patients with multiple myeloma over a total of 18 months. Data collection will occur at the time of transition decision and 2-4 months thereafter or when off study. This study will be conducted in collaboration with the Cancer Care Delivery Program, which is also a site of the Multiple Myeloma Integrated Care Consortium."

This is a prospective, randomized controlled, interventional therapy utilizing virtual reality goggles as a method of distraction. Data will be collected during and after the procedure on the type of behavior displayed and the child's response to standardized questions. Children aged 4-12 years who only require nitrous oxide to complete a painful dental procedure which necessitates anesthesia will be included in this study. These patients exhibit Frankl 2-3 behavior, requiring behavior guidance in order to complete the procedure. Frankl 1 or 4 children, those who do not need behavior guidance at all (Level of cooperation 1=patient accepts or prefers treatment; no difficulty in completing procedures, the patient's usual behavior with minimal guidance) or children with heavy behavior guidance (Level of cooperation 4=patient rejects and refuses all attempts to complete procedure or treatment; not capable of receiving treatment, and child refuses all attempts from parent to cooperate) will be excluded. Participants will be recruited in the clinic, during a new patient exam, routine hygiene or operative dentistry appointment. Following the Frankl behavior score diagnosis, an evaluation of behavior will happen during the beginning of the appointment, specifically watching for acceptance of treatment plan, openness to conversation, and any defiant behaviors or crying. The parent and child being recruited for the study will be informed of the nature of the study, the possible risks benefit and alternatives, and written consent will be obtained from the parent or legal guardian. Assent from child 7 to 12 will also be required as well. The qualifying patient will enter the operatory and be admitted into the study. Participants will be briefed on how the study will proceed, and will be randomized into a control group or treatment group. The groups will be selected at random prior to treatment in the study. Both Groups will use of Faces, Legs, Arms, Crying Consolability(FLACC) Scale, WongBaker FACES, and Houpt Behavior scales to access the pain or discomfort of subjects. Patients will rate their pain using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale by indicating which face best depicts the pain they are experiencing. Each face has a corresponding number: 0 = doesn't hurt at all to 10 = hurts as much as you can imagine. Patients will be observed during injection and assessed by the operator using the Faces, Legs, Arms, Crying Consolability (FLACC) scale. Each category will be rated from 0 to 2. Zero indicating normal positions and no sign of discomfort and 2 indicating discomfort in movements or unable to console/comfort. Patients will be observed during the procedure using the Houpt Behavioral Scale. Each category is scored on the 0-2 scale which results in a total score of 0-10. Assessment of Behavioral Score: 0 = Relaxed and comfortable, 1-3 = Mild discomfort, 4-6 = Moderate pain, 7-10 = Severe discomfort/pain. Patients receiving N2O during their visit will follow the standard of care procedures. The VR goggles will be placed on the head and in front of the eyes. Patients using the goggles are automatically set to start media as soon as the wearer dons them. The patient will be reclined, and placed in an ideal setting, and the goggles will be calibrated to the patient's current view. The dental procedure will then follow. Most procedures require a local anesthetic injection, and if the patient receives this injection, participants will be graded with FLACC score during the injection. At the end of the procedure the child will be evaluated using the Wong-Baker FACES scale, the Houpt Crying and Movement Scales, and a survey will be given to the patient to be completed. Participants will participate in the study during two restorative dental appointments, however, some patients may need more than two visits. Participants who require multiple restorative treatments will only being include in the study during first two visits and no other research activities will occur after. Most appointments are projected to last a maximum of 1 hour. The limiting factor in all treatment in this study, will be the participant's willingness to participate in future appointments."

There is not enough evidence to determine how to prevent or accurately diagnose all health conditions such as malnutrition. Therefore, early detection and monitoring of different kinds of malnutrition is key to increasing understanding of causes and mechanisms that may influence disease conditions. The proposed ""Science Against Malnutrition"" (SAM) project includes three Work Packages (WP) that are integrated into seven Work Package Areas (WPA). WPA1 focuses on untargeted microRNA expression profile in blood samples; WPA2 focuses on plasmatic extracellular vesicles; WPA3 focuses on metagenomic analysis of faecal samples; WPA4 focuses on metabolomicanalysis of faecal samples; WPA5 focuses on untargeted microRNA expression profile in saliva samples; WPA6 focuses on salivary extracellular vesicles; and WPA7 focuses on metagenomic analysis of salivary samples. All these WPAs have been designed to provide data to validate the existence of biomarkers associated to different kinds of malnutrition. It is expected that the biomarkers will be found at the plasma and saliva level due to the passage of the excretions from the intestinal and respiratory tracts in this compartment before being eliminated. In addition, the project will consider the potential role that extracellular vesicles (EV) will have in the identification of malnutrition types and the quantitation of specific membrane proteins present in them.

Stroke is a common cause of adult morbidity and mortality, responsible for up to 20% of disability. Despite recent improvements in acute stroke care, over half of stroke patients will never regain their lost function and one in five stroke patients will die of their stroke. Non-cardiac surgery is a significant trigger of stroke, but current perioperative neuromonitors are unable to detect covert stroke due to spatial limitations and susceptibility to signal contamination from extracerebral tissue. The current study investigates the feasibility of using multi-channel functional near infrared spectroscopy (a non-invasive and bedside neuromonitor) to detect specific regions of the brain at-risk of covert stroke during surgery. To this end, full-head coverage tr-fNIRS will be used to continuously monitor regional differences in cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics in up to 200 patients undergoing shoulder surgery performed in the beach-chair position under general anesthesia. By having a better understanding of the regional differences in cerebral oxygenation and the temporal relationship between hemodynamic parameters and cerebral oxygenation, the investigators hope to: I. Predict which patients may be at risk of covert stroke, and B. Develop a predictive model based on the perioperative monitoring data to help guide clinical practice for an improvement in patient outcomes after non-cardiac surgery."

The prevalence of moderate or severe functional tricuspid regurgitation is around 19% in patients with heart failure. Despite that there are few medical therapies for functional TR and only loop diuretics are cautiously recommended for relief of congestive symptoms in patients with severe TR and signs of right ventricular failure. In patients with functional TR associated with systolic dysfunction, medical therapy for heart failure with a reduced EF may diminish functional TR by improving LV systolic function. On the other hand, other therapies including digoxin, diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may worsen functional TR. Therefore, medical therapy for functional TR has not been well established yet. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors induce urinary excretion of glucose and sodium by blocking the SGLT2 transporter in the proximal tubule. SGLT2 inhibitor-induced natriuresis lower cardiac preload and reduce pulmonary congestion and systemic edema. SGLT2 inhibitors also restore tubuloglomerular feedback and lower the intraglomerular pressure by vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles and consequently reduce hyperfiltration-related renal damage. The beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the heart and kidneys may halt the vicious cardiorenal cycle in patients with functional TR, which results in deterioration of renal function, hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Accordingly, the Enavogliflozin Outcome Trial in Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation (EVENT) will test the hypothesis that, compared with placebo, therapy with the SGLT2 inhibitor enavogliflozin for 18 months would improve clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in HF patients with functional TR and preserved LVEF. A total of 700 patients will be randomized into two arms."

There exists a critical time window during which neural and muscular changes are taking place that could have a lasting impact on a person's ability to participate in activities such as walking and ultimately their functional recovery. Researchers have begun to examine this period of time around injury and the possibility that it may be a window of opportunity for improving recovery, yet no clear time frame has been delineated. This study will provide new critical time windows for investigating the possibility of intervention in this window. Specifically, this study aims to identify the critical time window for improvements in mobility, determine if the same improvements can be achieved at different time points post-injury, and determine if the intensity of the intervention will impact improvements in mobility."

Psychosis is a debilitating mental disorder which causes intense anxiety and depression, as well as often disabling symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. The long-term prognosis for people with psychosis remains poor. People with psychosis are frequently at high risk of becoming homeless or incarcerated, and most die within 20 years of their first onset symptoms on average 10 years earlier than the general population. People at ultra high risk (UHR) of developing psychosis is the name given to young people who have not got psychosis yet but whose thoughts and behaviour indicate that they are at high risk of developing first episode psychosis (first episode of psychosis).
More than 50 scientific studies, including our own in Australia, have now shown that about 30% of young people with such a high risk status convert to psychosis within 2 years. This information has been combined into statistical models to try to predict their future chances of developing psychosis. We are confident that 30% will develop psychosis.
People at ultra high risk of psychosis do, however, have a 70% chance of not developing psychosis. These young people can be described as in clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis but not at ultra high risk. It is very difficult to predict if this 70% group will never develop psychosis. They may take years before they do. Even when symptoms do later emerge, these people still tend to have a much better outcome than those individuals who first develop psychosis at age 30 or later.
More than 80% of Australian young people with UHR have a condition called schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a severe and complex brain disorder that affects how you think, feel, and behave. For some people, the first symptoms of schizophrenia appear before adulthood, during the teenage years or earlier. For others, the first symptoms do not appear until the late 20s. It is the second group that are most difficult, and hence most in need of early interventions, to detect.
The long-term prognosis for people with psychosis is poor. People with psychosis are frequently at high risk of becoming homeless or incarcerated, and most die within 20 years of their first onset symptoms on average 10 years earlier than the general population. Early intervention is urgently required to develop effective interventions to prevent this.
At present, doctors know best how to predict the future of young people with UHR who are in clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. There are no good tests to identify the remaining 30% of young people at risk of psychosis.
The AMP SCZ program proposes that clinical and biological features in UHR (ultra high risk) subjects and early psychotic disorder (schizophrenia) patients will be characterised and related to disease progression by a multi-modal data analysis (AMP SCZ observations and assessments), data sharing, and data integration (AMP SCZ Data Management, Integration and Coordination Center [DPACC-2]), along with genomic and cell-based approaches (AMP SCZ Cohort Consortium [CC]), including:
Assessing biochemical/cellular abnormalities;
Identifying, correlating, and integrating data from multiple modalities (e.g., brain imaging, electrophysiology, and genetics)
Pursuing mechanistic and functional characterisation of biological and clinical markers;
Using data integration to develop algorithms for predicting psychosis onset and treatment response;
Improving data quality and efficiency using innovative and integrated data systems (e.g., a central data management and integration system);
Identifying potential drug targets (using omics and computational approaches); and
Exploring early interventions, drug development and repurposing, and individualised (personalised) approaches to disease treatment.
Data from multiple centers and patients from Australia, Europe, and Asia in the CHR phase will include:
Structural and functional MRI of the brain;
Psychophysiological (e.g., event-related potentials, pupillometry) measures;
Assessments of mood, anxiety levels, cognition, and symptoms of psychosis;
Computational analysis of speech and facial expression;
Cognitive testing (including neuropsychological and cognitive tests);
Assessments of sleep;
Assessments of personality;
Potential drug target identification using data collected from blood and urine samples using metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and exosome analyses.
Data from multiple centers and patients from Australia, Europe, and Asia in the psychotic phase will include:"

The research findings of this pilot study will provide important information on the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted PM+ intervention in Dutch prisons. These pilot results can be used to inform the design of a larger trial. In addition, the pilot results can help identify any modifications or adjustments needed to successfully implement the intervention in Dutch prisons. The pilot results may inform decisions about the continuation of the intervention during the full clinical trial (RCT2). There are no anticipated financial implications of this study, as the RCT is being conducted as an adjunct to ongoing services and there is no additional risk to individual prisoners to their day-to-day care, nor to their freedom. If PM+ proves to be acceptable to the prison population, the findings of this study will serve to support the integration of evidence-based practices into regular mental health services for this population."

Due to a growing need to treat patients who are not eligible for cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy, there is a need for an alternative treatment modality. The objective of this phase I study is to determine the best safe dose of xevinapant combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel when given together with a standard course of radiation therapy. The second goal of this study is to determine the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. This is a phase I, non-randomized sequential assignment (escalation with safety run-in) clinical trial of xevinapant administered in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel and concurrent radiation therapy. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker assessments will be performed following treatment with xevinapant. Subjects receiving xevinapant will be enrolled on a dose escalation regimen and will receive xevinapant daily on two days out of three with carboplatin and paclitaxel for 7 weeks, then an additional 3 three week cycles with xevinapant alone. Dosing of xevinapant will be adjusted starting from 150 mg daily on two days out of three. The study will be conducted in the United States."

Background: Depression accounts for 6 years of potential life lost per person, making it the leading cause of disability worldwide, with estimates of 2.8% of the world's adult population living with depression. The need for efficient treatments for depression is paramount, especially for those with treatment resistant depression. This condition accounts for 20-30% of cases seeking help in the healthcare sector and is often refractory to anti-depressant medication and psychotherapies. The goal of this project is to investigate whether psychological treatment, specifically Schema Therapy, can be helpful in people with treatment resistant depression. In a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, superiority trial, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of Schema therapy in comparison to treatment as usual.
Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of Schema Therapy for the treatment of depression in adult patients refractory to anti-depressant medication.
Hypothesis: We expect the Schema therapy to lead to a more substantial reduction in depression symptoms than treatment as usual.
Methods: This is a randomized, placebo controlled, inferiority trial, using a parallel design to evaluate the efficacy of Schema therapy among patients with treatment resistant depression in the healthcare sector in Denmark.
Participants: We include 200 patients with persistent depression, irrespective of type of previous psychiatric treatments.
Intervention/Treatment: Schema therapy, Psychological Treatment as Usual, placebo intervention called Control as Usual, and an option to receive usual psychiatric care at home.
Main Outcome Measure: The primary outcome measure is change on the clinician-rated Hamilton-6 Rating Scale for Depression at 12 months.
Secondary Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint is assessed after 12 months with the clinician-rated Hamilton-6 Rating Scale for Depression. The effect of Schema therapy compared to treatment as usual is evaluated, controlling for age, gender and previous depression history.
Other secondary outcome measures include changes in Work and Social Adjustment - Revised (PSYCHLOPS), Mentalization - Reflection on Feelings Index Questionnaire (REFQ), Metacognitive Anger Processing scale Shor Version (MAP), Quality of life as measured by Euro-QoL-5D (EQ-5D), Health related quality of life, Self efficacy for health-related behaviors, Depression Change Expectancy Scale - pessimistic (DCES-P), Perseverative Avoidance Cognitions Questionnaire (PACQ), Depression Self-efficacy Questionnaire (DSEQ), The Depression Negotiation Scale (DNS), Personal Struggles on Negative Symptoms (PIANO), Social Support Questionnaire, Ways of Coping Index, Quality of Life in Depression Questionnaire (QLDQ), Social Recovery Questionnaire (SRSQ), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Schema Mode Inventory (SMI), Interpersonal Processes in Psycho-therapy-II (IPT-II), Schema Mode Inventory-Short Form (SMI-SF), Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-S3), Psychological Outcome Profile Questionnaire (PSYCHLOPS), Negative Effects Questionnaire (NEQ) 6 item (NEQ6), Short-Form 36-Item Health Status Survey Version 2.0 (SF-36 V2.0), Quality-of-Life after Chronic Disease (QoL-40), Sheehan Disability Scales - Adult Patient (SDS-IV) and Anger management in therapy scale (AMI).
Design: We use a multi-centre randomized controlled trial design with masked (double-blind) assessment of primary and secondary outcomes. The design is parallel-group assignment with a ratio of 2:1. The study is expected to last 2-3 years and includes recruitment, screening and evaluation procedures to qualify and allocate patients.
Data Analysis: We use a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach to evaluate primary and secondary outcomes over time, controlling for baseline levels, age, gender, previous chronic medical illness and previous depressive treatments.
Expected results: This randomized controlled trial is the first one in the field that includes a systematic approach to the problem of treatment resistant depression and we expect that the study will confirm the efficacy of Schema therapy and demonstrate that treatment resistant depression can be effectively treated with 30-40 weeks of Schema therapy.
Conclusion: This study will be the first randomized controlled trial of Schema therapy in Denmark and the aim is to contribute to a more general knowledge and evidence based health care"

The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) has become the leading cause of death in intensive care medicine. Lung damage has become the most frequent cause of death in intensive care. The incidence of ARDS continues to increase, especially in the elderly population; it is now estimated at 100,000 cases per year in France, with a mortality rate close to 40%. ARDS can appear on several occasions during the course of a severe respiratory tract infection or a major extrapulmonary infection, after a severe trauma or surgery or as a complication for a patient admitted to an intensive care unit. ARDS is characterized by progressive respiratory failure due to a lung injury induced by a number of risk factors. It is characterized by diffuse aeration by pulmonary edema. The treatment of ARDS requires respiratory assistance using mechanical ventilation. In this context, the best clinical condition is associated with a low tidal volume, a high respiratory cycle frequency, the use of positive end-expiratory pressure and low oxygen doses. In addition to limiting ventilatory overdistension during ventilation, it seems to reduce the severity of the disease which decreases mortality and reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation. The care protocols for the use of these modalities of ventilation are numerous and their implementation in the intensive care units varies widely, with the use of large tidal volumes. This heterogeneity of practices has led to the recent publication of international recommendations. The primary endpoint is mortality and days without mechanical ventilation. It consists of the combination of mortality and days without mechanical ventilation, in order to integrate both the ultimate goal, which is the death of the patient, and the severity of ARDS, characterized by a large number of consecutive days and the duration of mechanical ventilation, which is a prognostic criterion and a risk factor for nosocomial respiratory infections and a long stay in the intensive care unit. The secondary endpoints concern various important aspects of care. It is noted that the protocol does not dictate ventilatory management, does not change or modify the management of physicians or other staff caring for ARDS patients, does not change the respiratory secretion management procedure, the use of drugs to reduce lung or systemic inflammation , or the type of ventilation."

HIV-positive adults who migrated from Haiti to the US are among the most underserved groups in the country. Only 49% of Haitian immigrants living with HIV (HILWH) have achieved viral suppression (VS), compared to 60% of US-born HIV-positive patients. Further, 45% of HILWH have never had an undetectable HIV viral load and 58% of those who are VS have stopped taking their medicine, making intervention efforts a critical need. Our primary goal is to develop a health promotion intervention, the Haitian Immigrant Engagement And Retention IN Guided Health (H-iENGAGE). This pilot health intervention is a promising approach to improve health outcomes of HILWH. The pilot will be designed to examine (a) engagement and retention in care, and (b) viral suppression (VS). Mixed methods data collection will provide insights into the perspectives of health care providers as well as the experiences of HILWH related to their engagement in care and their experience with H-iENGAGE, including identification of facilitators and barriers to engaging in care and achieving VS. If preliminary efficacy is obtained, this promising, culturally tailored H-iENGAGE intervention may serve as a model for HILWH in the US, and may help optimize the reach and effectiveness of the US government's global plan to achieve HIV epidemic control by 2030.
This protocol builds on our prior work and will be tested in a prospective quasi-experimental single arm. The goals of this pilot study are to examine HILWH engagement in care (EIC) and viral suppression (VS) during baseline to post-intervention period. Additionally, a process evaluation of the H-iENGAGE intervention and its impact on providers and HILWH post-intervention will be conducted. The proposed protocol consists of a three-armed study. In AIM 1, the pilot portion, HILWH will complete questionnaires, participate in health assessments and intervention. In the second arm, Aim 2 to 4, photovoice sessions will be held with a sample of intervention participants at 3 and 9 months follow-up. If preliminary efficacy for improving engagement in care (EIC) and viral suppression (VS) is obtained, this tailored, culturally and socially relevant health promotion intervention will serve as a model to impact HILWH health outcomes. Aim 1. Mixed methods data collection from health care providers and HILWH to examine barriers and facilitators to VS among HILWH.
This study consists primarily of HILWHs, living with HIV who attended two of the six Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) that serve the majority of Haitians with HIV in Miami, Florida. A non-probability purposive sample selection method will be used to enroll 60 participants in the study. All new patients, HIV-positive patients who have been undiagnosed or not engaged with care at the clinics, those who are VS will be eligible for enrollment. If preliminary efficacy is achieved, the investigators will identify an additional 6 individuals who have completed the pilot intervention to participate in the photovoice portion of the study. The total time to completion for this study will be 12 months."

The Endoclean device is a novel root canal cleaning device using hydraulic inertial cavitation for effective root canal debridement and preparation. However, it is necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of using a cavitation device in routine practice. The study aims to compare the effectiveness of the Endoclean device to passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), which is the current gold standard, and conventional root canal preparation in the long-term.
The study will be performed using a prospective, randomized, and non-blinded, parallel-group, single-center pivotal study approach. It includes patients presenting ASA1 or ASA2 with symptomatic and/or asymptomatic apical periodontitis, who have no history of analgesic intake in the last 3 days or antibiotics in the last one month. They can present one mandibular and/or maxillary tooth with mature apical with closed apices and an intact tooth structure, which has never been treated with root canal therapy. All participants shall have full-mouth periapical radiographs and full mouth oral-hygiene status assessment with bleeding, gingivitis, and periodontal disease status evaluation and screening.
The primary effectiveness endpoints shall be successful healing of periapical lesion up to 12 months post-operatively and 24 months. Safety endpoint shall be freedom from post-operative pain up to 7 days post-operatively. Secondary effectiveness endpoints shall be successful healing of periapical lesion up to 24 months post-operatively. Safety endpoint shall be the incidence of serious and non-serious adverse events."

Fractures of the skeleton are the most common reason for Emergency Department (EDs) admission, accounting for approximately 15% of attendances. Accurate detection of bone fractures is a key task for radiologists and ED clinicians when reviewing X-rays. When the clinician is uncertain or unsure about the presence of fractures, further imaging may then be required, and referral to Orthopaedics or Trauma for assessment and management. Conversely, inaccurate detection of fractures may lead to undertreatment or failed diagnosis with subsequent adverse clinical outcomes for patients due to missed diagnosis of fractures.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great potential in augmenting radiologist's interpretations of complex images. This potential has been demonstrated in an increasing number of studies across different imaging modalities such as chest radiographs and mammography. However, to date, AI's effect on diagnostic radiology is unclear, and more research is needed before AI algorithms can achieve widespread practical use.
Aims: The main objective of the study is to assess the impact of AI algorithms in augmenting the performance of radiologists' and clinicians' detection of fractures on routinely-obtained X-rays. 
Methodology: A total of 1000 skeletal radiographs depicting fractures and normal findings will be reviewed in a randomised order by all readers twice: with and without AI overlay (Figure 1). The AI algorithm to be used is the Gleamer Boneview algorithm, which predicts the probability of the presence of a bone fracture from each pixel on radiographs. 
The reading will be done remotely via the Report and Image Quality Control site (www.RAIQC.com), an online platform allowing medical imaging viewing and reporting. Participants can work from any location, but the work must be done from a computer with internet access. For avoidance of doubt, the work cannot be performed from a phone or tablet. The project is divided into two phases and participants are required to complete both phases. The estimated total involvement in the project is up to 20-24 hours. Phase 1: Time allowed: 2 weeks - Participants must review 500 X-rays and express a clinical opinion through a structured reporting template (multiple choice, no open text required). Rest/washout period - Time allowed: 4 weeks, to mitigate the effects of recall bias. Phase 2 - Time allowed: 2 weeks - Review 500 X-rays together with an AI report for each case and express their clinical opinion through the same structured reporting template used in Phase 1.<"

The purpose of this study is to determine if dynamic MRI will improve the initial diagnosis of women with symptomatic pelvic endometriosis and to compare the results with those of a group of controls. It is a transversal prospective study. One hundred patients, with suspected pelvic endometriosis, will be recruited from the ENTENDOMOBILE service. One hundred patients will be chosen without pelvic endometriosis from the ENTENDOMOBILE service and the gynecological consultation group. The study is multicentre, with patients recruited from the Rennes site. Dynamic MRI will be obtained for each patient using an MRI cine sequence. MRI cine is a special MRI sequence obtained by taking up to 60 images during the scanning phase. A gynecologist expert in endometriosis diagnosis will independently score the diagnostic MRI at baseline (with 3 to 9 endometriotic lesions in each patient, in reference to the Revised American Fertility Society classification (R-AFS). The images are then scored by two other physicians trained in gynecological imaging to detect endometriotic lesions. The dynamic MRI for patients with pelvic endometriosis will be performed at baseline and at a 6-month interval, while patients who are not diagnosed with pelvic endometriosis (control group) only one dynamic MRI will be performed at inclusion. The mean vertical displacement of each pelvic organ (vaginal wall, cervix, uterosacral ligaments, utero-tubal junction) will be measured at 6-month intervals and at the first visit in the control group. It will be measured using MRI at inclusion and dynamic MRI which means that the participant will have to perform the same physical gesture, a simple thrust effort, so that the pelvic organ moves, without any external force, to make it move. The hypothesis is that endometriotic lesions will be detected on the image more frequently at the push thrust effort.

Inclusion Criteria:
patients referred for suspected pelvic endometriosis requiring pelvic MRI
Female, nulliparous
patient with signed written consent
patient with health insurance
patient willing to comply with all study procedures and duration

The purpose of the Childhood Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccination (LAIV) vaccine is to protect children against influenza A and B. It works by stimulating the immune system to make protective antibodies (raised after vaccination) that react against the flu virus. Influenza viruses are continually developing, and therefore the vaccine is reformulated every year. The study aims to assess the uptake of the influenza vaccine and to identify factors associated with the decision to vaccinate in children aged 2-<18 years. The study will utilise primary care data linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to examine the use of healthcare resources associated with influenza and its related health outcomes. The study will collect de-identified medical records from CPRD, a national research database of primary care data for 7% of the UK population, and will use these data to identify and follow up individuals who meet the eligibility criteria. The investigators will be provided with access to the anonymised data only. The results of our study will provide valuable information on vaccine hesitancy, uptake and its effect on the health care resources usage among children in England."

This is a pilot pre-post intervention trial. Our objectives are to examine the following: 
- Happiness reported by the students before and after the sessions, as well as twelve weeks later; 
- Acculturation, including the ability in speaking Chinese, interacting with local friends, and watching Chinese TV (report by students). Tang poems, a form of traditional Chinese literature, are being explored as a potential tool promoting happiness among ethnic minority students. Reciting Tang poems in Chinese-speaking setting was popular before the introduction of modern learning, and children could memorize and recite some poems like singing songs without knowing how to read and write. It is still popular today that Chinese kids learn to recite Tang poems, which may contribute to their Chinese cultural identity. The research aims to examine whether similar activities in non-Chinese families and communities may also promote happiness. Chinese children in primary schools normally start to learn Tang poems from grade 1 onward. The students aged from 6 – 9 can enjoy family learning together with parents’ support. This study will focus on the students with ages from 6 to 9 years who are able to communicate in either simple Cantonese or English. The parents will give consent for their children to participate in this study. The recruitment and randomization will be done through the community-based charity organization, Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS) in a non-randomized way. Participants will attend three weekly sessions of Tang poem classes, each lasting for 1.5 hours, and a final session to showcase their progress in reciting the poems. Informed consent will be obtained from participants before enrollment. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Research Centre at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Ref. No. CRE-2020.094). This study was not sponsored or received any funding.

Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth (aged 13-24). The incidence of suicide among adolescents ages 10-18 has increased by 63% from 2007 to 2018 in the US. Digital tools such as smartphones have the potential to address the critical barriers to screening and monitoring high-risk youth.
The goals of this clinical trial are to develop and test a comprehensive digital platform for use with adolescents and young adults at risk for suicide or at high risk for suicide attempt. The platform integrates smartphone monitoring of ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), and digital self-report assessments to support psychoeducation and skills training using Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), a treatment with evidence supporting its successful treatment of adolescents with suicidal ideation. The smartphone app called Vira will collect passively-collected data on sleep patterns, activities of daily living (sitting, walking, running) and language patterns that provide risk signatures for increased risk for suicide attempt or relapse to suicidal behaviors, and the frequency of these activities. These patterns are indicative of psychological and behavioral states of adolescents and young adults with suicidal ideation. The smartphone app will prompt them to answer a daily question ""How are you feeling today?"". The information collected from the smartphone app will be combined with self-report assessments (e.g., Columbia suicide severity ratings scale, scale for suicide ideation, mood and feelings questionnaire, sleep questionnaire, and Pittsburgh sleep questionnaire) in the app to provide practitioners with daily ratings of youths' mental health and mood during their entire treatment. If the digital monitoring of a youth indicates risk for suicidal behavior or imminent relapse to suicidal ideation, a clinician will be notified via a secure email or a message within the app. The therapist will then respond by calling the patient to assess if intervention is required or a face to face or tele-psychology session is scheduled. To summarize, the digital platform allows practitioners to integrate mobile sensing data and self-report assessment data (e.g., Columbia suicide severity ratings scale, scale for suicide ideation, mood and feelings questionnaire, sleep questionnaire, and Pittsburgh sleep questionnaire) into their management of these high-risk young people.
The digital platform can detect the emotional and interpersonal states underlying suicidal ideation and suicide attempt and provides interventional support to patients and therapists alike in preventing suicidal behaviors."

Humans rely on their eyes to help them navigate through the visual environment during the day. The eyes also play a larger role than just visual perception, where the eyes use non-visual light to help entrain or reset the internal clock with its 24-hour circadian rhythms. The internal clock or circadian rhythms controls many functions in our bodies including the release of hormones that help us sleep. The process that the eye uses to extract cues from light is controlled by different types of cells in the retina called intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGC). The purpose of this study is: a) to determine if there are differences in the response of the eyes to light that is not visible depending on the sex of the person, b) to determine how people of different sex and age groups respond to non-visible light and how this response changes with age, and c) to determine how non-visible light affects different people in terms of the timing of the internal clock and the release of hormones. Participants will have light exposure in their eyes during pupillometry measurements and will also undergo circadian timing assessment by exposure to non-visible light using a light box (spectacular device)."

A 1-arm design was used to examine preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention. Youth aged 14 to 18 who are disposed to community supervision (deferred adjudication or probation) and meet eligibility requirements (1+ indicator of substance use, under community supervisions, English-speaking, no indication of suicide risk or thought disorder) were sampled from a large urban Texas juvenile probation department. Protocol administration was proctored by a TCU research assistant at a private space within a juvenile justice office or mutually agreed upon location of participant's choosing. Youth were asked to complete all assessments and participate in the 4 individualized technology-based intervention sessions where youth received information and engaged in decision making scenario-based games about substance use, sex risk practices, and related health-risk.

The purpose of this trial is two-fold; to pilot the feasibility of performing RIC at home for 12 months and to pilot the outcomes assessed in RIC by showing whether RIC could prevent worsening of disability (timed 25-foot walk) at 12 months in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).
The specific aims of this trial are: Aim 1: Feasibility: Successful recruitment and retention of study participants for up to 12 months RIC will be performed at home by participants on a daily basis. We plan to enroll 10 participants. If more than 4 (of 10) participants can be recruited and retain for up to 12 months, the trial will be deemed feasible. Aim 2: Primary endpoint RIC is expected to prevent disability worsening as assessed by the timed 25-foot walk, in a pilot open-label manner. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that the rate of disability worsening (defined as a 20% increase in the timed 25-foot walk) will be < 50% in the RIC group compared to an historical control average rate of worsening of 30%. In order to rule out a treatment benefit of RIC with a probability of 80%, while using a one-tailed significance level of α = 0.05, enrolling 10 participants will be sufficient. The sample size was calculated using the MINIMUM software, which takes into account the number of stages (2) and the probability of an unexpected treatment benefit in each stage (-1 for conservative estimation).
RIC is a promising therapy for people with MS. There is no established therapy for progressive MS forms, such as Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) and Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) and therefore the investigators consider a conservative design, with an early stopping rule, to be appropriate.
If the investigators find no effect of RIC on MS progression, the trial will be stopped to avoid further RIC treatment in all other patients. If the investigators find some effect of RIC on progression (i.e., less than the 30% disability worsening expected to occur), the trial will be continued with an additional 11 patients with a 3-fold greater recruitment duration.
RIC is a safe therapy that has been tested in people with acute ischemic stroke. RIC has shown benefits in several clinical conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, vascular dementia, and stroke. Although the rationale for the use of RIC in autoimmune diseases such as MS is compelling, this is the first study testing the hypothesis directly in MS. RIC has potential for people with multiple sclerosis, such as PPMS and SPMS, thus it is important to test this therapy in these populations."

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) can lead to cirrhosis and may result in the need for liver transplantation. Current treatment for severe AH is corticosteroid treatment for 28 days, with or without addition of pentoxifylline. However, approximately 50% of patients do not respond to steroids and die or undergo liver transplantation. Early prediction of treatment failure would help to select those patients who would benefit from immediate liver transplantation at day 7 after diagnostic. Despite the use of Maddrey's Discriminant Function (MDF), prediction of prognosis is still poor and therefore there is a need for additional predictive markers."

The purpose of this randomized control trial is to compare two different intervention models (functional task training group- walking on flat surfaces and ramps and functional therapy program group- goal directed training) to evaluate their effect on gross motor function, range of motion on, and balance in cerebral palsy children with hemiplagic cerebral palsy. The study will include hemiplagic cerebral palsy patients with GMFCS level (Gross Motor Function Classification System) between 1-11. Patients will be assigned randomly to the intervention model and their gross motor function, range of motion and balance will be assessed via GMFM-88 (Gross Motor Function Measure scale), Pediatric Balance Scale and goniometre. All data analysis will be done on a PC with IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29 (Armonk,New York: IBM Corp., 2017). The hypothesis of the study is to compare the two interventions with respect to their effectiveness in gross motor function, range of motion and balance in children with cerebral palsy. A total of 20 participants will be included in the study for each study arm for a total of 40 participants. Both interventions will last eight weeks (a total of 24 treatment sessions) in the form of 3 days a week and 50 minutes sessions one on one session. The outcome measure will be assessed in the last session of each group.

A retrospective observation on tetralogy of fallot (ToF) primary repair in National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita, which was done from January 2020 until December 2022. Blood cell and differential count must be tested no later than 14 days before the operation. The number of days of the most recent blood test, leukocyte count, percentage neutrophil, percentage and absolute lymphocyte count, thrombocyte count, derived variables such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and thrombocyte-lymphocyte ratio (TLR), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), CPB time, aortic cross-clamp (AOX) time, postoperative mortality, the rates of additional or corrective surgeries, hospital length of stay, and postoperative length of stay were studied. ToF primary repair was associated with reduced survival odds (P=0.01) for patients with higher NLR levels. However, the higher TLR levels were significantly associated with increased postoperative mortality (P=0.04) and reoperation rates (P=0.001). High ALC levels were associated with reduced postoperative mortality (P=0.01) and complications (P=0.04), shorter hospital length of stay (P=0.001), and shorter postoperative length of stay (P=0.001). ToF primary repair was the best procedure for patients with lower NLR levels and ALC levels."

The increasing demand for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) has led to a need for innovative ways to provide this type of contraception to women in an effort to decrease unintended pregnancies. Women requesting IUD insertion report 40%-60% experience an increase in anxiety leading up to the procedure. The use of patient-applied pre-treatment analgesia in the form of a tampon soaked with aqueous lidocaine may provide a low-cost treatment option for women, allowing for easier placement and reduce unnecessary obstetrical and gynecological visits. This study will evaluate the use of this procedure for future implementation."

How does capillary blood sampling compare to conventional blood sampling for the detection of early chronic autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes?
This paper compares capillary blood sampling using capillary blood sampling devices with conventional venous blood sampling for the early detection of type 1 diabetes and describes the diagnostic characteristics of some autoantibodies for early detection of type 1 diabetes. After 2 years, 450 patients underwent both conventional and capillary blood sampling. The prevalence of positive anti-GAD and anti-islet cell (ICA) antibody results was similar with capillary and conventional blood samples, thus providing an alternative to conventional blood sampling for the detection of early chronic autoimmune disease.
Capillary blood sampling provides a faster and easier way to obtain blood samples compared to conventional blood sampling. Capillary blood sampling is a noninvasive, simple technique that involves the quick acquisition of capillary blood with the use of lancet, a device to pierce the skin and to draw the blood into a container. Blood samples are collected through capillary blood sampling devices from capillaries, small blood vessels that branch off from arteries and veins, and then transferred in tubes via a syringe. This simple technique allows a quick recovery from the site of the sample, reduces pain and reduces the risk of infection at the puncture site.
Conventional venous blood sampling, on the other hand, is associated with a higher risk of bacterial infections, bruises or bleeding, fainting, dehydration and discomfort. Thus, it's necessary the acquisition of at least 3 blood samples by venous canulation (4.5 mL each) and the separation of plasma, serum, blood cells and other blood components, and so on, which could be an additional source of pain and discomfort for the patient.
In conclusion capillary blood sampling is an effective way to detect autoantibodies and other key laboratory parameters, in addition to providing patient safety. This data support those from previous studies, and they all suggest that the availability of capillary sampling may improve the efficiency of preclinical detection for type 1 diabetes. With the development of more sophisticated tools and reagents, in the future, it will possibly be possible to use capillary blood sampling to achieve a complete clinical evaluation for patients at risk of these disorders.

Mobile technology has become the most widespread technology globally and has recently become ubiquitous in most of our social interactions (Park et al., 2019). According to the Global Web Index Report, global smartphone usage has reached 64% in 2020 and adults are spending more than two and half hours on their mobile phones every day (Global Web Index, 2020). Breastfeeding is an essential infant feeding practice and has been shown to yield many positive effects for babies who are exclusively breastfed. As a result, breastfeeding promotion and initiation have been an important global health challenge in recent years. However, breastfeeding mothers' smartphone usage and the impact of this usage on breastfeeding and mother-infant interaction remains a critical unanswered area. The current study is in line with our research center's interest in the study of brain mechanisms related to addiction, risk-taking in addiction and compulsive behaviors, and we would like to focus on compulsive/addictive behavior of breastfeeding mothers towards their smartphones. Therefore, the main aim of the current study is to examine the mechanisms of brain activity, physiology and attention toward the infant while being exposed to the cues of their smartphones during breastfeeding."

Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a non-invasive, energy-based drug free modality that has been widely used in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions in the last decade. The device, LightForce Therapy®, emits light in the visible and near infrared spectrum of light which increases tissue oxygenation and stimulates repair processes which improve tissue health. The proposed study is designed as a single-blinded randomized controlled trial, to assess the efficacy of PBMT in the management of Plantar Fasciitis (PF). The study will recruit 90 participants from the active-duty military population aged 18-54, with an index episode of PF and pain >= 3 on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) who are seen and/or treated in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R), at Madigan Army Medical Center. Participants will also be enrolled in a concurrent interventional, observational behavioral study which will provide them with a standard care behavioral protocol including stretching and cryotherapy. Those enrolled in the observational study will be randomized to receive either active PBM treatment or placebo sham treatment for the active-duty military participants. The active treatment condition will receive active PBM treatment for 3 consecutive weeks for a total of 9 treatments, while the sham treatment condition will receive sham PBM treatment. For both conditions, the treatment sessions will take approximately 5-10 minutes to administer. The goal of this protocol is to evaluate the potential efficacy of using PBM for patients reporting symptoms of PF."

Brain networks rely on synchronisation of neuronal activity to operate properly. However, the brain is a complex organ that is not uniform. The structure of the brain varies in fine detail across the entire brain (centimeter-scale resolution) and can have many different manifestations of pathology, and these manifestations can be associated with differences in how neurons operate and interact in specific brain regions (millimeter-scale resolution) and within specific functional brain networks (micrometer-scale). Consequently, characterising the fine-scale structure and function of the brain using advanced neuroimaging techniques may bring a revolution in research on many brain disorders.
In this study, participants will be imaged using cutting-edge devices called simultaneous electroencephalography/functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG/fMRI) at ultra-high magnetic fields (7T). We will record detailed brain activity through the use of these devices in healthy participants and in participants who suffer from essential tremor, psychosis or epilepsy. The detailed and fine-scale brain information will be used to advance our understanding of the brain, particularly in understanding the mechanisms underlying the aforementioned disorders."

The study aimed to investigate the effect of weight loss on serum hepcidin, iron status, inflammation, and oxidative stress in men and women with obesity and iron deficiency. In phase I, a cross-sectional study was conducted to compare the levels of these variables between two groups of women and men with obesity, and to correlate them with iron deficiency. In phase II, a randomized clinical trial with a dietary intervention was conducted to assess the impact of weight loss on serum hepcidin, iron status, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers in men and women with obesity and iron deficiency. The results suggest that a macronutrient balance in the diet can increase iron status parameters in individuals who undergo weight loss."

Pregnant women in need for maternal and/or fetal monitoring are hospitalized at the obstetric high care (OHC) of Máxima Medical Center (MMC). They are monitored for up to three times a day with conventional cardiotocography (CTG). In the meantime they reside at the OHC, but the status of the fetus and uterine activity (UA) is not monitored. Nemo Healthcare developed a wireless abdominal electrode patch for measuring fetal heart rate (FHR) and UA: The Nemo Fetal Monitoring System (NFMS). Previous research on non-invasive electrophysiological CTG (eCTG) has yielded promising results in monitoring FHR and UA both during pregnancy and labor. With the use of eCTG technology, safe continuous 24/7 monitoring is possible, which is not possible with conventional CTG. The investigators hypothesize that by introducing continuous antepartum eCTG monitoring perinatal and maternal outcomes will improve. The investigators aim to include 1911 pregnant women ≥18 years old with a singleton pregnancy between 23+0 and 32+0 weeks of gestation requiring hospitalization on the OHC for maternal or fetal surveillance (including 1400 historical controls). Additional objectives: The collected NFMS and demographic data will be used to develop and verify a mathematical model for the prediction of time until (preterm) birth, which may be used in clinical practice to reduce unnecessary OHC admissions and facilitate a better timing of interventions. Furthermore, data collected in this study (NFMS, accelerometric, annotated ultrasound) will be used for the development and verification of a mathematical model for the automated detection of fetal movements in NFMS data. This latter model might provide new opportunities in non-invasive monitoring of fetal health."

Severe and/or recurrent infectious diseases remain a significant burden on human health and are often accompanied by multiple morbidities, and in some cases, death. While advances in modern medicine have dramatically increased the chances of survival for young and immunocompetent patients, they are often accompanied by permanent sequelae. Infectious diseases are characterized by a particularly high heterogeneity of their etiology, their susceptibility genes, their pathophysiology and their prognostic, making it difficult to develop treatments or to follow patients in homogeneous groups. This makes it difficult for scientific research to address the problem of susceptibility of certain patients or to propose specific therapeutic strategies. Genetic predisposition can influence susceptibility to infections by modifying the response of the immune system, the pathophysiology of the disease (bacterial virulence) or the course of the disease. Our aim is to use modern genomics tools to identify chromosomal regions and mutations associated with severe and/or recurrent infectious diseases, with a focus on rare but fatal pathologies. To carry out this work, we plan to recruit a cohort of patients with rare and severe infectious diseases, whose precise diagnosis has previously been established by a multidisciplinary specialized panel of experts. In order to identify common genetic factors between different pathologies, we want to use methods of population genetics. The analysis of the genome of the index case and their relatives will indeed allow us to precisely estimate the proportion of the genome shared between patient relatives, thus identifying the genomic regions that have the most chance of carrying genetic loci. Associated with this, we plan to conduct an exome sequencing project within large families and/or multi-cases. These two approaches should identify chromosomal regions of potential interest in the study of infectious pathologies. If a mutation associated with severe and/or recurrent infectious diseases, either in the proband or in his relatives, is identified, we will seek to demonstrate its pathogenic nature in infectious diseases models or functional assays on lymphocytes from patients. In parallel, epidemiological data should allow us to identify new risk situations for each severe or recurrent infectious disease. In order to carry out a large field work as close as possible and within the deadlines of the disease, we have set up a network of expertise and patient support throughout the French territory, associated with a research platform specializing in medical genetics, cellular and molecular immunology and bioinformatics, and with a platform dedicated to molecular biology (sequencing and microarrays). This organization and the methodology of the project should allow us to characterize the genetics and epidemiology for each severe infectious disease studied and to identify candidate genes. A better understanding of the links between genotype and infectious pathologies will contribute to identifying more specific diagnostics, preventing or reducing recurrence in these pathologies, and, as a consequence, improving patient care."
