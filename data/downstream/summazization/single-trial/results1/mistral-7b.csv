270,"[/INST] Summary:
============

The study was designed to assess the vaginal axis in female patients undergoing apical prolapse surgery. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three arms: laparoscopic lateral suspension, pectopexy, or sacrospinous ligament fixation. MRI images capturing the vaginal axis were obtained pre- and postoperatively and analyzed to compare the differences in vaginal axis between the three arms.

The primary outcome measure was vaginal axis distance, measured between selected anatomical landmarks on MRI images. Secondary outcome measures included prolapse symptoms, urinary symptoms, sexual function, and QOL measures.

The study results indicated significant differences in vaginal axis measurements between the three surgery arms, with the lateral suspension group demonstrating narrower vaginal axis distances compared to the other two groups (pectopexy and sacrospinous ligament fixation). The study also reported significant improvements in prolapse symptoms, urinary symptoms, sexual function, and QOL measures following the surgeries compared to the preoperative baseline. However, postoperative de novo dyspareunia was more prevalent in the group undergoing sacrospinous ligament fixation. Overall, the study suggests that these three alternatives to radical hysterectomy can effective correct apical prolapse without compromising female sexual function."

368,"[/INST] Title: High-dose Cephalexin for Cellulitis (HI-DOCC)

Background:
Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the subcutaneous tissue that can lead to pain, redness, swelling, and induration in the affected area. Group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), beta-hemolytic streptococcies, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacteria causing this condition. Patients typically present to the emergency department (ED) and are treated with antibiotics. The ED physician must select the appropriate agent, oral versus intravenous (IV) route, dose, frequency, and duration.

Objective:
To compare the efficacy, safety, and health service utilization of high-dose (1000 mg QID) cephalexin versus standard-dose (500 mg QID) cephalexin in treating ED adult patients with cellulitis.

Methods:
The study is a multicenter, parallel-arm double-blind randomized controlled trial. The investigators will recruit 446 adults diagnosed with non-purulent cellulitis and deemed eligible for outpatient oral antibiotics. Patients will be randomly assigned to either high-dose cephalexin or standard-dose cephalexin. Both interventions will be taken for seven days. The study will measure oral antibiotic treatment failure, clinical cure, clinical response, unplanned visits to a healthcare provider within 30 days, unplanned hospitalization within 30 days, adverse events, antibiotic intolerance, antibiotic allergy, medication adherence, and health-related quality of life.

Expected results:
If high-dose cephalexin is found to be superior to standard-dose cephalexin, it will change practice, reduce unnecessary IV antibiotic use, hospitalization, and costs. The results will help inform future skin and soft tissue infection treatment guidelines."

Summary:
---------

The study is a phase I trial of the combination of osimertinib, cetuximab, and tucatinib for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with acquired resistance to EGFR-mutant tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The primary objective is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this combination, as well as to evaluate its safety and antitumor activity in participants with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who have acquired resistance to an EGFR-TKI. The secondary objectives include evaluating the toxicities and anti-tumor activity of the combination in this patient population. The study uses osimertinib, a TKI that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain, along with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the EGFR signaling pathway, and tucatinib, a selective EGFR small molecule inhibitor. The study is designed using a dose-escalation scheme, where the doses of each study drug are increased from starting doses to a maximum dosage. The study is double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and is designed with a safety monitoring board that is responsible for stopping the study if any dose-limiting toxicities are observed. The safety and toxicity evaluations are performed at specific times throughout the study, including during dose escalation and after the study has completed. The primary measures of clinical endpoints in this study include the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities and the objective response rate, which is measured by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1). The study will run for up to 2 years after the last dose of study treatment, and the findings will be used to inform the development of new combination therapies for EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

The study is a comparative analysis of the clinical course and aesthetic results between collagen matrix (Fibro-Gide) and autogenous graft (connective tissue graft) for the augmentation of soft tissues in the area of an intended dental implant placement.

In 32 patients with partial edentulism, a deficiency in the thickness of soft tissues was detected, which prevented the successful placement of dental implants in the distal part of the lower jaw. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the first group underwent the augmentation of soft tissues using a free connective tissue graft from the tuberosity area of the upper jaw, while the second group underwent the augmentation of soft tissues using collagen matrix Fibro-Gide.

The two groups were comparable in gender, age, and other parameters. The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources Management and Environmental Protection.

The intervention was carried out according to the established protocol, and the follow-up period was 6 months. The primary endpoint was the amount of soft tissue thickness gain, measured using an intraoral scanner and an optical impression technique before and after surgery.

The study included 60 primary outcome measures (i.e., the amount of soft tissue thickness gain) and 6 secondary outcome measures (i.e., the severity of pain, the amount of soft tissue thickness gain, and the collateral edema).

The study found that the augmentation of soft tissues with a collagen matrix resulted in a significant increase in the thickness of soft tissues compared to the augmentation with an autogenous graft. Additionally, the study found that the collagen matrix group experienced less pain and collateral edema after surgery compared to the autogenous graft group.

========

The title of the study is ""Psychosocial Transitional Support and Group Therapy for Mental Health Outcomes following Limb Loss"". The study is a pragmatic trial, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an inpatient psychosocial group therapy intervention in improving mental health outcomes of individuals with limb loss, compared to the standard care they receive without the group intervention.

The intervention group will undergo weekly 6-week sessions of a modified supportive-expressive (SEGT) group therapy approach, which will be facilitated by either a psychiatrist and/or two allied healthcare professionals. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (SEGT) or the control group (standard care or TAU).

The primary outcomes for the study are the changes in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) scores before, during, and after the intervention. Secondary outcomes include changes in PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5) scores and Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) scores.

Participation criteria for the study are individuals over 18 years of age who are admitted to St. John's Rehab inpatient facility in Toronto, Canada, with any etiology of limb loss and no history of major psychiatric disorders. Eligible participants will be provided with information, including a risk-benefit statement, about the study and their informed consent will be obtained.

The study will be conducted over a period of 2 years, during which participants will be recruited and informed consent will be obtained. Data will be collected from participants at baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 months after discharge through standardized questionnaires.

The study is being conducted at St. John's Rehab in Toronto, Canada, by an interprofessional team consisting of a psychiatrist, social work, physiatry, occupational therapy, and patient advisors. Funding for the study is being provided by Sunnybrook Research Foundation and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). The study protocol is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with the trial registration number NCT04263462.

The study's specific objectives are:

1. To evaluate the effectiveness of a modified supportive-expressive (SEGT) group therapy intervention for reducing symptoms of depression (measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item) in individuals with limb loss.
2. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a modified SEGT intervention in a routine clinical setting.
3. To evaluate the potential impact of social support and stress management strategies on coping self-efficacy in individuals with limb loss.
4. To evaluate the impact of social support and stress management strategies on improved quality of life and reduced healthcare costs in individuals with limb loss.

The study's statistical analysis will include descriptive analysis of the main outcome and secondary quantitative measures, t-tests, repeated measures ANOVA, and non-parametric equivalents, if necessary.

The study's results have the potential to provide insights into the effectiveness of evidence-based supportive-expressive approaches in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, improving coping self-efficacy, and improving quality of life and reducing healthcare costs in individuals with limb loss. It may also contribute to the development of pragmatic interventions for individuals with limb loss, which can be implemented in routine clinical settings."

474,"[/INST] Title: The Effects of Different Strategies of Mean Arterial Pressure Management on Neurological and Renal Outcomes During Cardiac Surgery: A Multi-Center Randomized Trial

Background: During cardiac surgery, ischemia-reperfusion in the heart and brain can lead to neurological and renal dysfunction. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is a key determinant of tissue perfusion and oxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This study aims to compare the effects of different strategies of MAP management on neurological and renal outcomes during cardiac surgery.

Methods: This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: standard MAP management, high MAP management, or patient-tailored MAP management. The primary endpoint is maximum serum lactate level detected during CPB, which is an indicator of tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Secondary endpoints include the area under the curve of serum lactate levels, the number of cases with a maximum serum lactate level > 3 mmol/l, evaluation of cerebral perfusion using neuroimaging techniques, and evaluation of renal function using serum creatinine and urine output. The study will be conducted at three participating centers, with a target sample size of 150 patients per group, for a total of 450 patients. The study will be designed using the CONSORT flowchart and will be reported using the STROBE checklist.

Eligibility criteria: The study will include patients with an estimated EuroScore II < 9%, a planned CPB time of ≥90 minutes, and who are undergoing elective cardiac surgery for ischemic heart disease, valvular surgery, or congenital heart disease. Exclusion criteria include emergency surgery, age < 18 years or > 80 years, preoperative renal dysfunction, preoperative hepatic dysfunction, preoperative neurological dysfunction, and use of anticoagulant therapy.

Interventions: The three groups will receive different strategies of MAP management during CPB. The standard MAP management group will receive MAP values between 50-60 mmHg during CPB. The high MAP management group will receive MAP values between 70-80 mmHg during CPB. The patient-tailored MAP management group will receive MAP values comparable to the patient's preoperative MAP, which will be calculated using a preoperative blood pressure measurement. The MAP management strategies will be maintained throughout the CPB period.

Outcomes measures: The primary endpoint is maximum serum lactate level detected during CPB, which will be measured at the beginning of CPB, every 20 minutes during CPB, at the end of CPB, and at the end of surgery. Secondary endpoints include the area under the curve of serum lactate levels, the number of cases with a maximum serum lactate level > 3 mmol/l, evaluation of cerebral perfusion using neuroimaging techniques, and evaluation of renal function using serum creatinine and urine output. All data will be collected prospectively and will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis."

Title: Evaluation of the Therapeutic Effect of Adding Letrozole to the Protocol of Cesarean Scar Pregnancy Treatment

Study Overview:
A prospective cohort study was conducted among women with Cesarean Scar Pregnancy (CSP) to evaluate the efficacy of letrozole when added to the MTX monotherapy treatment. Participants received MTX in combination with hysteroscopic evacuation of products of conception (POC) or MTX with letrozole add-on followed by the same procedure. Blood parameters, including B-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG), hemoglobin, total blood count, creatinine, urea, alanine/aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, bilirubin, were measured on days 0,4,7, followed by B-hCG concentration measurement every 7 days until surgery. The primary outcome was blood loss during the procedure, expressed as a decrease in hemoglobin concentration, and secondary outcomes included conversion rate from hysteroscopy to laparoscopy or laparotomy, as well as changes in red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, liver function, and kidney function over the course of treatment.

Participation Criteria:
Eligible participants had confirmed CSP on pelvic ultrasound and were willing to undergo termination of their pregnancy. Exclusion criteria included heterotopic pregnancy and decreasing B-hCG concentrations.

Intervention/Treatment:
The study included two arms: MTX monotherapy vs. combined treatment with MTX and letrozole add-on. In both arms, patients received MTX intravenously (100 mg) and intra-amniotic injection (50 mg) on day 0, with subsequent hysteroscopic evacuation of POC. In the letrozole add-on arm, patients also received letrozole (5 mg) orally for 10 days from day 0. Blood loss parameters, frequency of conversion from hysteroscopy to laparoscopy and laparotomy, and laparotomy were measured.

Primary Outcome Measures:
Blood loss during the procedure expressed as a decrease in hemoglobin concentration on day 1 after the procedure compared to the pre-procedure concentration.

Secondary Outcome Measures:
The effect of treatment on bone marrow function (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets), liver function (serum total bilirubin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase), and kidney function (serum urea, serum creatinine) in the course of treatment.

=================================================

Study Overview
===============

This study is a prospective, randomized controlled interventional therapy trial examining the use of virtual reality goggles as a method of distraction during dental procedures on pediatric patients. Participants will be randomized into either a control group that receives nitrous oxide and VR goggles in the second visit or a treatment group that uses VR goggles as a precursor to nitrous oxide. The study will measure the effectiveness of VR distraction in controlling pain and discomfort during dental procedures. Data will be collected using various scales, including the FLACC, WongBaker, and Houpt scales, and will be collected at different points during the procedure. The study will include patients aged 4-12 years who require nitrous oxide sedation for a dental procedure, have a Frankl scores of 2-3, and are able to enter the operatory and provide informed consent. This study will be conducted over two visits, with each visit lasting approximately one hour. The study aims to recruit 20 participants in total, and the study period is expected to last 12 months.

Study Overview:
Photobiomodulation Therapy (PBMT) is a non-invasive treatment option for plantar fasciitis. A single-blind randomized control trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of PBMT for plantar fasciitis. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PBMT group or a control group receiving usual care. The PBMT group received active therapy, while the control group received sham therapy for 3 weeks, twice a week, for a total of 9 treatments.

Outcome Measures:
Primary outcomes were measured at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks after treatment. Measures included the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), Pain Diary Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), and plantar fascia thickness using ultrasound. Secondary outcomes included demographic characteristics, baseline data collection, and adverse events.

Eligibility Criteria:
Eligible participants were those with DEERS eligibility, ability to read and understand English for consent purposes, currently experiencing pain in their bottom of foot, diagnosed with plantar fasciitis by a healthcare provider using accepted diagnostic criteria, and willing to commit to the study procedures. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or plans to become pregnant during the intervention period, history of traumatic injury to the affected limb, significant portion of calf area covered in tattoos or scarring, and sensitivity to heat or light.

Masking:
The study was single-blinded, meaning that the participants were unaware of whether they received active PBMT or sham therapy. The study team was aware of the group assignment, but the device used was not revealed to the participants during treatment.

Randomization:
Participants were randomly assigned to either the PBMT group or the control group using a computer-generated randomization model.

Conclusion:
The study found that PBMT was effective in reducing plantar fasciitis pain, improving functional outcomes, and increasing plantar fascia thickness compared to the control group receiving usual care. Overall, the results suggest that PBMT is a viable treatment option for plantar fasciitis."

Title: A Randomized Controlled Prospective Trial Comparing Clinical Outcomes and Efficacy of Single vs. Double Pyloromyotomy Technique for Gastric Peroral Endoscopic Pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) in the Treatment of Gastroparesis

Overview:
The study aims to compare the clinical outcomes and efficacy of single versus double pyloromyotomy in G-POEM for refractory and severe gastroparesis. Prospective subjects will be randomized into one of two study groups: Single pyloromyotomy vs Double pyloromyotomy G-POEM and followed up at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (one year) after procedure per routine care.

Participation Criteria:
Eligible participants are adults 18 years or older with refractory and severe gastroparesis based on GCSI > 2, confirmed with impaired gastric emptying. In excluded persons have previous attempts with prokinetic drugs, previous gastric surgery, esophageal or gastric varices and/or portal gastropathy, pregnant patients, malignant or pre-malignant gastric diseases.

Intervention/Treatment:
The intervention/treatment is gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM). In the single pyloromyotomy group, selective circular pyloromyotomy is performed at the 6 or 7 o'clock position after identifying the pyloric ring, whereas in the double pyloromyotomy group, another selective cut is performed at the 4 or 5 o'clock position to keep at least 1 cm between the two pyloromyotomies.

Primary, Secondary Outcome Measures:
Primary Outcome Measures: Clinical success at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up and Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) score before and after GPOEM at 3, 6 months and 12 months follow-up.
Secondary Outcome Measures: Total procedure time for each method, adverse events like pneumoperitoneum, gi bleeding, perforation, infection, and abdominal pain, and recurrence of symptoms.

745,"[/INST] This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined intervention approach that uses acute intermittent hypercapnic-hypoxia (AIHH) and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) in improving respiratory and upper extremity motor function in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). The study will recruit 29 participants who are able to undergo physical rehabilitation and have at least 20% impairment in maximal inspiratory or expiratory pressure generation and/or abnormal reflexes.

The study will consist of three arms: active comparator, experimental, and sham comparator. Participants will randomly be assigned to one of the three arms. In the active comparator arm, participants will receive exposure to AIHH followed by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS)-paired respiratory and upper extremity strength training. In the experimental arm, participants will receive exposure to SHAM AIHH followed by tSCS-paired respiratory and upper extremity strength training. In the sham comparator arm, participants will receive exposure to SHAM AIHH followed by SHAM tSCS-paired respiratory and upper extremity strength training.

The study will measure changes in respiratory cortical and spinal drive, upper extremity cortical and spinal drive, maximum respiratory voluntary force production, airway occlusion pressure (P0.1), and forced vital capacity. The primary outcome measures will be changes in respiratory cortical and spinal drive, upper extremity cortical and spinal drive, maximum respiratory voluntary force production, and changes in airway occlusion pressure (P0.1).

The study will use a mixed-methods approach, including both quantitative and qualitative data collection. Qualitative data will be collected through semi-structured interviews, which will be audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. The interviews will be conducted at baseline, immediately after the AIHH/tSCS intervention, and at a 1-week follow-up appointment.

Further, the study aims to validate a model of dysregulated inflammation and neurotrophic deficits in chronic SCI by measuring several pre- and post-intervention inflammatory markers and neurotrophic factors.

The expected outcome is the significant improvement in respiratory cortical and spinal drive and upper extremity cortical and spinal drive with the combined intervention of AIHH and tSCS in individuals with chronic SCI as compared with the active or sham comparator groups. Furthermore, the study aims to validate the model of dysregulated inflammation and neurotrophic deficits in chronic SCI and assess its effectiveness as a predictor of treatment response. 

The study will begin with a pilot phase and, if the pilot phase is successful, the full study will be conducted."

This study will use a parallel sample method where the same patients will receive both interventions (lignocaine-impregnated microneedle patch and EMLA patch) and be randomized to receive either lignocaine or EMLA first in the order of intervention. The study will be conducted in a randomized, triple-blind, double-masked manner.

A total of 20 healthy volunteers who are aged 18 years and above, weighing less than 150 kg, and with no history of any sensitization or allergy to lignocaine or EMLA or the materials used in the study will be recruited for this study. Eligible patients will be recruited from Hospital Canslt M. Toh Huat Chong (KLUMPC), Malaysia.

The study will have two phases: Phase I will consist of a non-randomized, single-blind, safety review, and is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerance of lignocaine-loaded microneedle patch in a limited number of healthy patients and those with local ocular conditions requiring routine venous cannulation. The Phase II study will be a randomized, double-blind, efficacy review, which will compare the analgesic properties of 12.5 mg lignocaine-loaded microneedle patch with the EMLA patch. The primary endpoints in Phase II will be the participant's visual analog scale (VAS) score and skin algesimeter index, which will be measured 30 minutes after the application of the lignocedne-loaded microneedle patch or EMLA patch.

All patients will be given verbal informed consent before the start of the study, and written informed consent will be obtained at the screening stage. Adverse events will be assessed according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 17 (MedDRA version 17.2) and will be recorded throughout the study. Safety assessments will be conducted according to a standardized adverse event reporting form, and a severe adverse event (SAE) reporting form will be provided to the investigators for reporting any SAEs that appear during the study.

Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics for the safety review and non-inferiority in the efficacy review. Non-inferiority will be tested using a 95% confidence interval at a two-sided level of 0%. A p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant for the two primary endpoints."
