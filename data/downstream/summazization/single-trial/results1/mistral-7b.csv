The study is randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. Patients received standard general anesthesia and had a 22 G 50 mm needle advanced from caudal to cranial direction to the sacral crest. The ESPB was performed at the end of surgery and compared to a control group that received no block. The primary outcome measure was patient pain scores, assessed using Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) for 24 hours. The secondary outcome measures were total opioid consumption, nausea-vomiting, and patient satisfaction. The study was conducted in patients undergoing elective lumbar discectomy and followed the Consolidated Reporting Trials Standards (CONSORT). The study found no statistically significant difference between the ESPB group and the control group."
38,"[/INST] The study proposes to use ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a noninvasive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain. The investigators will study the echogenicity of trigger points, the deformation of thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, and the viscoelastic properties of the tissue using ultrasound shear wave elastography. They will use established validation methods to test the ability of the biomarker to predict myofascial pain and to classify the myofascial components of pain. The study will measure the diagnosis of one of four MP-related categories as well as the presence of substantial MP as determined by standardized clinical examinations. The study will recruit healthy normals and individuals with chronic low back pain and myofascial pain. The study is designed with five arms and will last for three years. The primary outcome measure will be the diagnosis of one of four MP-related categories and the secondary outcome measure will be the presence of substantial MP.

49,"[/INST] The study is titled ""Development of Activity MRI (aMRI): Direct Comparison to PET in Human Subjects"" which aims to directly compare the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach with ¹⁸FDG PET in patients with glioma. The primary objective of the study is to characterize how the metabolic aMRI parameter kᵢₒ*V differs in tumor versus normal brain, with secondary objectives including evaluating the utility of aMRI to differentially assess the metabolically active tumor periphery and necrotic core regions compared to ¹⁸FDG PET's SUVmax. Post-gadolinium (Gd) T1 MRI will be used to distinguish the contrast-enhancing ring region indicating the metabolically active tumor periphery from the less viable and/or necrotic tumor core. The exploratory objective is to compare how the aMRI metabolic parameter kᵢₒ*V within disease lesions change with different disease types, their disease stage, and their treatment status. Patients receive ¹⁸FDG IV and gadoterate meglumine IV during the scanning period which takes 45-60 minutes and includes contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography. The study measures primary and secondary outcomes, including the mean values of kᵢₒ*V of the entire tumor region and the mean value of kᵢₒ*V in the tumor periphery and core regions. The study evaluates the efficacy of aMRI in metabolically distinguishing regions and evaluates its correlation with the co-registered ¹⁸FDG PET data. The exploratory objective is to compare how the aMRI metabolic parameter kᵢₒ*V within disease lesions change according to disease type, stage and treatment. Terms related to the study include glioma, contrast-enhancing ring region, normal appearing brain sub-regions, tumor periphery, tumor core and Gadoterate meglumine."
