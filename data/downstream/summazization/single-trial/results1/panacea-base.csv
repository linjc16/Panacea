0,"1. Nociplastic pain (NP) is a form of pain that is often associated with a variety of physical and psychological symptoms. 2. Patients with chronic migraine (CM), fibromyalgia (FM), and vulvodynia (VU) tend to present with common psychosocial features, such as central sensitization, trauma history, personality traits and defensive styles. These features are often associated with poorer management of pain and worse prognosis. 3. The researchers hypothesize that CM, FM, and VU may be grouped by a number of specific psychosocial factors that could be useful in providing a better understanding of the symptoms associated with NP, and consequently could be useful in implementing more effective interventions. 4. For this purpose, the researchers propose to develop a study that will assess the presence of specific psycho-social clusters in patients with CM, FM, and VU, and will try to identify the most suitable intervention strategies.This will make it possible to define the characteristics of each cluster, to develop specific tailored interventions, and to use them as a therapeutic strategy.
Patient population: Patients with CM, FM, or VU participating as clinical sample. Control group (no chronic pain condition): 2nd year psychology students (not selected) or people from the general population with no medical history. No previous diagnosis of chronic pain conditions. Inclusion criteria: age range 18-65 years education > 5 years diagnosis of FM according to Wolfe, 2016 diagnosis of CM according to Olesen, 2017 diagnosis of VU according to Bornstein et al., 2016 Exclusion criteria severe psychiatric disorders and/or cognitive impairment difficulties in comprehension/expression in Italian history of other chronic pain disorder(s) history of other neurological disorders besides migraine

=================
Define the most common psychological clusters in patients with pain of nocurplastic origin.

Study design
=================
A descriptive, multi-center, open, uncontrolled study will be conducted on 150 patients with FM or CM or VU, compared to 50 controls (without previous diagnosis with chronic pain conditions) will be conducted.

Study objectives
=================
1. To highlight the most prevalent psychosocial variables and the existence of specific clusters in patients with different CP conditions 2. To identify the most suitable intervention strategies for each cluster. 3. To implement a new model of psychological assessment and intervention for CP conditions.


Secondary study objectives
=================
To identify the most suitable intervention strategies for each cluster. 5. To implement a new model of psychological assessment and intervention for CP conditions.

Study design
=================
The participants will be recruited by the research team at the University Policlinico of Milan.
After providing informed consent, and based on the inclusion criteria, they will be asked to take part in an assessment of the main psychosocial characteristics. These will be assessed through online questionnaires. A questionnaire will then be administered to collect epidemiological data (e.g., age, education level, previous diagnosis of chronic pain).
To identify the presence of the main psychosocial clusters, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire. A total of eleven psychosocial variables will be taken into account; the following are: (1) central sensitivity index; (2) traumatic experiences index; (3) personality traits; (4) defense mechanisms; (5) mental pain; (6) environmental sensitivity; (7) environmental hypersensitivity; (8) sensitivity to social rejection; (9) physical pain; (10) sexual pain; (11) depression; (12) anxiety; (13) psychosomatic symptoms; (14) health perception; (15) quality of life; (16) alexithymia; (17) perceived social support; (18) pain-related sexual disorder; (19) pain-related sexual dysfunction; (20) sexual satisfaction.  Finally, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the level of satisfaction with the treatment received for pain. The investigators expect that the results of this study will be of great interest to the scientific community. They will help to develop more effective interventions for patients with chronic pain conditions. Additionally, they can help to identify the most appropriate treatment for each patient.
The investigators also hope that this study will help to improve the quality of life of patients with chronic pain conditions.

Study population
=================
150 women with chronic pain conditions (FM, CM or VU) and 50 women with no previous diagnosis of chronic pain conditions"
1,"Patient education and awareness about the use of these mattresses is important and has been published by the manufacturer. Patient education and awareness programs may also help with a gradual shift from the traditional use of low air-loss beds to the use of massage beds. This, in turn, will reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in nursing homes. Patient education about this may include providing information about pressure sores, their risk factors, and their prevention, as well as the importance of using a pressure sore prevention device.

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The objective of this study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and the potential for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) associated with chronic oral 412 (dose range: 2 to 900 mg) administration for 12 months in healthy, non-smoking male and female subjects from the United States and elsewhere. This was a Phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study with 9 cohorts. Subjects received 2 to 900 mg of study drug daily for up to 12 months in capsular formulation and were randomly allocated in 9 cohorts: 6 cohorts with ascending doses (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 900 mg; N=60 across all cohorts), and 3 cohorts at a dose level of 6, 30, and 900 mg (N=30 across all cohorts) based on PK and PD analyses from earlier cohorts. The first 6 subjects recruited in the initial cohort were selected to enable evaluation of safety, tolerability, PK, and PD in this pilot cohort. The first 2 subjects in the first cohort received BI 412 in a blinded fashion (placebo), while the remaining 4 subjects in this cohort and all subjects from the subsequent cohorts received BI 412 and were unaware that they were receiving active drug.
Dose adjustment considerations in subjects with renal function abnormalities as well as treatment guidelines were based on available pharmacological data (e.g. IL-17 levels). Patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr, by Cockcroft-Gault formula) ≤ 80 mililiters/minute were not eligible for enrollment. Adequate kidney function and no history of kidney disease at the time of assessment was a requirement for enrollment in the study. Subjects with moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction as well as active, clinically significant infection including tuberculosis, herpes zoster, and hepatitis B virus or C virus were not eligible for enrollment. Pregnant or lactating female subjects were also excluded from the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential and males not willing to practice effective methods of contraception after consent and until 30 days after the subject stopped treatment with BI 412 were not eligible for enrollment.

2,"A total of 30 children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) who are in the age group of 10-13, have been followed clinically at the Pediatric Diabetes and Endocrinology Unit for at least six months, will participate in the study. All children will give written and verbal informed consent. Patients will be randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group will be exposed to a moderate exercise program with augmented reality (AR) glasses twice a week for a 12-week treatment period. In the control group; No exercise will be done, routine follow-up will be made. Exercise with AR glasses is thought to be more effective for the treatment of children with T1DM because of its dynamic structure. In addition, as an additional study method, the effect of exercise with AR glasses on the quality of life of children with T1DM will be examined."
3,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of virtual reality on preoperative anxiety in abdominal surgery patients. It is known that abdominal surgery patients have high preoperative anxiety levels. In addition, the development of technology, especially the use of smart devices in daily life, makes it possible to try different solutions for the treatment of anxiety in preoperative patients.

It is known that the most stressful period for individuals before surgery is the preoperative period, at least as much as the postoperative period due to the fear of surgical treatment. During this process, due to fear of unknown treatment and fear of anesthesia, the patient's concerns increase even more and can cause stress-related symptoms (Duncan et al., 2017). Excessive anxiety, which may cause complications, must be avoided in order to avoid negative outcomes such as increased pain and muscle tension, prolonged recovery from anesthesia and anxiety. In recent years, the use of virtual reality glasses has come to the fore to reduce preoperative anxiety. A meta-analysis found that the use of virtual reality glasses significantly reduced preoperative anxiety in children and their caregiving parents, and had long-term results in terms of decreasing stress and maintaining calmness (Schuh et al., 2018). The positive effect was observed especially in the group with high anxiety scores, and a significant reduction in negative emotions was observed in the group without virtual reality glasses (Bailey et al., 2019). In the study conducted by Moss-Magnier et al. which is related to the research problem of our study, they found that a large part of the patients preferred virtual reality glasses more than watching a documentary before laparoscopic surgery (Moss-Magnier et al., 2009 ). In addition, a study conducted by El-Boghdady et al. in Egypt showed that patients using virtual reality glasses experienced less negative emotions and had a better surgical experience (El-Boghdady et al., 2020).
Although the literature showed that there are positive results in terms of reducing preoperative anxiety with the use of virtual reality glasses, there is no scientific study conducted in our country on the effect of virtual reality glasses on reducing preoperative anxiety. Since it has been observed that the use of virtual reality glasses reduce preoperative anxiety in surgical patients, it is necessary to conduct an original research to contribute to science. It is envisaged to collect both objective and subjective data in this study. After the patient is taken to the surgical unit, the digital video to be watched will be watched for the first time in the placebo group, in the intervention group with virtual reality glasses, and in the control group, the measurements will be measured with the visual anxiety scale and the stress level will be measured with the smart bracelet in both groups. At the end of the measurements, the smart bracelet will be stored by taking the name and mobile number of the participant. It is expected that the preoperative anxiety level in the placebo group will decrease only due to the normalization and adaptation process, while in the intervention group, it will be seen that the preoperative anxiety level decreases to a greater extent by the use of virtual reality glasses.

5,"The study investigates the possible development of immunotherapeutic strategies for patients who are insensitive to radiochemotherapy or tumor recurrence following this type of treatment. 
The objective is to determine which patients are particularly sensitive to immunotherapy due to a possible deficiency of the immune system against the tumor. The assessment and analysis of the immune system is done by studying different blood markers, saliva and metabolic profiles in these patients. This immunophenotyping characterization is performed using both laboratory procedures as a deep immunological analysis. These results are compared among groups of patients who will be given immunotherapy with another group of patients who do not receive such treatment. These results serve as a basis to identify patient groups who are best suited for future immune therapy.

| Experimental: SG<br>The participants in the experimental group will be proposed to play the serious game with their asthma educators twice a week for 15 minutes during a year. Before starting to play, each participant will receive an introductory session to get familiar with the activity, which will take place at the children's hospital in a dedicated room in accordance with existing standard operational procedures. During the session, the physiological parameters that will be included in the study design (heart rate and skin temperature, measured and recorded by wearing a smartwatch) will be acquired and analyzed in order to assess the patient's level of physical activity. The data analysis will be performed with the software SAS®, using proprietary algorithms. The educational asthma game will be played at 2 different times: 1) morning hours to reinforce daily activities and habits to stay healthy, and 2) early evening in order to support asthma management in the case of aggravation. At the end of the SG therapeutic period, which lasts 6 months, the participants will be encouraged to engage in more physical activity to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent further asthma exacerbations. | Device: Serious Game (SG)<br>* SG which was conceived as a running game, in which an Avatar runs through the forest and overcomes obstacles through the player's performance of physical exercises. Children will play while watching an imaginary Avatar, who shows the right movements to perform in order to collect rewards. SG will be projected with a 4K projector and controlled by the child's movements, which will be tracked in markerless mode using Azure's Kinect sensor. SG will include an adaptive tool to enable the experience based on the child's specific motor skills. The dynamics of SG will be adapted by considering real motor and physiological data acquired during each SG session via a wristband. These data are necessary to keep the child in the aerobic zone (60-80% of maximum heart rate). The movements are: Side bending: Moving an obstacle to open a passage. High jump: Overcoming a low, frontal obstacle. Side lunge: Avoiding a side obstacle. Squat: Passing under a low, frontal obstacle.<br>|

The present project seeks to investigate neural correlates of pavlovian to instrumental transfer (PIT), a behavioral paradigm for addiction, in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. Furthermore, the present project explores how both acute and chronic stress affects PIT and its neural correlates. The long-term goals of this project are to increase the understanding of pavlovian to instrumental transfer and stress effects and to further develop our knowledge for treatment planning (e.g., using PIT as an early diagnostic biomarker, predictors for relapse, and to promote the identification of potential pharmacological agents and behavioral therapies)."
13,"This is a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized control trial involving premature neonates born between 23 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks gestational age. The trial will take place in four Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) within the Rady Children's/University of California, San Diego network, including Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego, Jacobs Medical Center, Scripps La Jolla (Rady NICU) and Rancho Springs (Rady NICU). The investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no). The investigators set the alpha error rate at 0.05 and power at 80%. To achieve a 50% reduction in the CPAP weaning failure rate, they aimed to enroll a total of 80 infants < 28 weeks and 50 infants 28-30 weeks (130 infants in total). Consent will be obtained after the eligible infant has been extubated or has been stable on NIS (defined as CPAP/NIMV/NIPPV- all modes of pressure reliant respiratory support) for over 72 hours. NIS is delivered via occlusive (Fischer & Paykel [F&P]) or non-occlusive (RAM TM/Nioflo TM) interfaces at any pressure and oxygen need. A standardized maintenance/weaning protocol will be implemented for the treatment group (standardized NIS wean) while the control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born at 28 0/7 to 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations.

16,"Background and aims: Ovarian reserve measures the number of oocytes remaining in ovaries and have ability to oocyte recovery. Since ovarian reserve declines in proportion to age therefore the reproductive age is defined. The age of natural menopause varies among women but in general, menopause occurs during the fourth decade of life with normal variation (±2 years); the average age of menopause in Western countries is 50.5 to 51years. The average menopause age in Saudi Arabia is early, i.e., 46.1years. In our medical center, the average age of menopause is 48 years, but there is a lot of variation in the range of (42-54yr) (Almutairi, Ibraheem; Saudi Medical Journal 2016). Hysterectomy is the most common gynecological surgery in Saudi Arabia and approximately 80% of women undergoing hysterectomy in our medical center in 2019 were aged <45 years. In this context, we aimed to estimate the ovarian reserve before hysterectomy and evaluate its association with age by analysis of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC),  inhibin B, Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), and estradiol (E2) levels.

18,"The purpose of this study is to prospectively analyze the relationship between the initial body weight, body composition, and the incidence of postoperative hypotension caused by desflurane use in the operating room. 200 patients undergoing general anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery (10-20) are randomly divided into five groups, each group having 40 people. According to their body weight and body composition, they will receive different doses of desflurane (%) according to their body weight and body composition, which will be used for maintenance of general anesthesia. The dose calculation scheme was based on the body weight and body composition of the patients. The percentage of desflurane (%) used for anesthesia maintenance was obtained from the calculation scheme. The purpose of this study is to prospectively analyze the relationship between the initial body weight, body composition, and the incidence of postoperative hypotension caused by desflurane use in the operating room. The proportion of desflurane (%) is obtained by body weight and body composition calculated.

Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been implicated as the cause of several immune-based complications in thoracic organ transplant recipients (TOT). These include a variety of CMV-related clinical syndromes (e.g., pneumonitis, gastritis, end-organ disease), immune dysfunction, graft loss and death. As CMV infection is common following stem cell and organ transplantation, current standard of care recommendations suggest prophylactic treatment of CMV infection. Letermovir is a novel, oral agent with favorable safety and tolerability profiles in subjects with CMV infection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of letermovir compared with approved antiviral prophylaxis for CMV following thoracic organ transplantation. Aims: To evaluate whether a 365-day regimen of oral letermovir is more effective than historical standard of care antiviral CMV prophylaxis from 12 months prior to initiation of the study. To evaluate whether a 480mg daily regimen of oral letermovir is more effective than historical standard of care antiviral CMV prophylaxis from 30 months prior to initiation of the study. To assess the safety and tolerability of letermovir compared to historical standard of care antiviral CMV prophylaxis from 12 and 30 months prior to initiation of the study. Objectives: Primary: The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of oral letermovir 480mg daily for the prevention of symptomatic CMV viremia during the first 180 days after transplantation and/or during the entire year after transplantation at the dosage of 480mg daily (n=50 to 250), with the efficacy of oral valganciclovir as pre-intervention standard of care antiviral prophylaxis from 12 to 18 months prior to initiation of the study (n=50 to 250) in subjects with heart or lung transplantation. Secondary: The secondary objectives are to compare: The efficacy of oral letermovir 480mg daily for the prevention of symptomatic CMV viremia during the first 180 days after transplantation and/or during the entire year after transplantation to historical standard of care antiviral prophylaxis from 30 months prior to initiation of the study (n=50 to 250) in subjects with heart or lung transplantation. The safety and tolerability of letermovir 480mg daily to historical standard of care antiviral prophylaxis from 12 and 30 months prior to initiation of the study (n=50 to 250 in each cohort).

21,"Rationale(s): Rationale: The incidence of oropharynx cancer (OPSCC) has historically been low, and even more uncommon are cases occurring in younger adults (age 30-50) and in females. More recently, the incidence of oropharynx cancer (OPSCC), particularly at sites where human papillomavirus (HPV) is the predominate causative agent, has dramatically increased over the last several years.
Treatment for locally advanced OPSCC consists of definitive radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy. Local treatment outcomes have dramatically improved in the last 20-30 years with overall survival with locally advanced OPSCC nearly 80-100%. Local treatment modality is dictated by the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) with definitive treatment for OPSCC confined to primary tumor site or neck disease based on clinical staging. Adjuvant radiation therapy has been demonstrated to decrease local failure rates for OPSCC. The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy in cases with positive surgical margins has been questioned as patients with positive surgical margins also tend to have microscopic extracapsular extension (ECE) and are more likely to present with node-positive disease.
Risks: Risks: In addition to common acute toxicities, their favorable overall survival potentially places these patients at increased risk for developing long-term treatment-induced side-effects. Therefore, it is important to establish novel management approaches that maintain excellent current clinical outcomes while effectively reducing acute and long-term side effects. The SAVAL study tests the hypothesis that patients currently recommended for surgery (TORS) and have positive ctDNA will be offered registration for the study prior to surgical resection.
Study Goals and Objectives: Study Goals and Objectives: The goal of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients currently recommended for surgery (TORS) and have positive ctDNA will be offered registration for the study prior to surgical resection. After TORS, all patients will have ctDNA drawn within 2-14 days post operatively. Combined with pathological criteria, all patients will be stratified into one three risk groups; low risk, intermediate risk, high risk. The low risk group will be observed (no radiation) per standard of care (SOC). The intermediate group (intermediate pathological features and negative ctDNA) will also be observed (no radiation) per the experimental arm. The high risk group will receive adjuvant treatment (RT +/- chemotherapy) per SOC.

Individuals with multiple myeloma face significant symptom burden related to their disease and its treatments, including nausea/vomiting, anxiety, depression and decreased physical activity. Many of these symptoms arise from factors external to the patient; for example, fear of disease recurrence, side effects associated with treatment, and challenges with managing a disease known to have an unpredictable trajectory. There is a need to better quantify this symptom burden and explore effective interventions to optimize patients’ medical and psychosocial management. As technology evolves, the opportunities for digital technologies to play a role in symptom management are becoming increasingly apparent. The feasibility and potential efficacy of a digital health intervention to augment symptom and symptom-related management in individuals with multiple myeloma is not known and will require a dedicated prospective investigation. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of such an intervention and to preliminarily explore its impact on patients' symptom burden, health self-efficacy and overall well-being. This is a prospective study of individuals with multiple myeloma to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of digital health coaching and its potential to augment existing standards of care for patient support. Patients will be enrolled and will complete all assessments at baseline, 30, 60 and 90 days after consent. A digital health coaching intervention will be provided to all patients. Throughout the engagement, patient reported outcomes (PROs) will be collected at multiple time points to assess the patient status and will be used to explore relationships between medical management, health related quality of life (HRQoL), and engagement in the program. Findings from this study will establish feasibility of a DHC intervention for individuals with multiple myeloma and will provide greater insight into their symptom burden, health self-efficacy, and financial, physiologic, and psychosocial well-being.

Background: The intake of dietary fibers have proven beneficial for inflammatory bowel disease patients. However, it is unlikely that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases consume sufficient amounts of dietary fibers because it is not a part of their regular diet.
Commercial fibers are often not well absorbed by patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, which can lead to bloating, flatulence, and a poor absorption of other nutrients like calcium, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. Additionally, they have limited effects on the composition of the gut microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
Hypothesis: The consumption of a dried vegetable (WholeFiberTM) that contains a range of different types of fiber can improve inflammation, bowel irritation and quality of life, and alter the composition of the intestinal microbiome and related metabolites in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This is a pilot study to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of a WholeFiberTrademark (TM) intervention in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in a proof-of-principle manner.

27,"The primary goal of the WEAN-EDAPTIC trial is to assess the prognostic value of dyspnea on discharge from the hospital for patients admitted to the intensive care unit following an acute exacerbation of pulmonary disease, with or without a previous diagnosis of COPD.
The investigators hypothesize that:
- dyspnea is an independent predictor of hospital discharge.
- patients with severe dyspnea have 60% higher probability of dying within 6 months of inclusion in the trial.
- the dyspnea measured at day 1 predicts hospital discharge on day 9.

=================
Study Design Allocation Heterogeneous (multicomponent), prospective, observational, open-label, longitudinal, non-randomized study, single-center, recruiting patients admitted to intensive care after an acute exacerbation of non-cystic fibrosis pulmonary disease. This 9-day study will therefore identify 3 groups of patients with dyspnea on the first day of admission that will vary according to the degree of impairment (mild, moderate or severe dyspnea).

Intervention
=================
On the day of the first hospital assessment (day 1), participants will be assessed in a standardized manner using validated tools for the assessment of dyspnea and pulmonary function. Assessment will be performed for all patients in intensive care up to (but excluding) 5:00 p.m. on the day after the scheduled trial assessment on day 1 (day 2). Assessment on day 1 will be carried out between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. Participants' survival status will be determined by reviewing their medical records 3 months and 6 months after enrollment.

29,"Background
The term MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) refers to the transitional state between normal cognitive changes associated with aging and very early dementia. It is a disorder characterized by impairments in both short-term and long-term memory, but without functional deficits. MCI is considered a precursor to dementia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that in 2014 there were 5.0 million adults with cognitive impairment (CI) in the population aged 65 years and older, and it is projected that by 2060, this number will increase to nearly 14 million . A study by Gómez on sentinel health networks in Spain describes a prevalence of MCI among individuals aged 65 years and older ranging from 14.5% to 17.6% , which increases with age. Another study reports a prevalence of 11.6% in individuals aged 65 to 69 years, which rises to an average of 22.9% among those aged 85 years and older. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 9 Spanish studies on different types of dementia showed a prevalence ranging from 3.2% to 12.3% in individuals aged 70 years and older, with higher prevalence in women and increasing with age.
 The diagnosis of MCI can increase the likelihood of individuals requiring admission to specialized care centers. Gait and balance impairments are common in individuals with dementia, including slower gait speeds, decreased stride length, altered swing time, among others. However, these motor alterations are often overlooked when addressing CI . Balance impairment combined with gait deficits significantly increases the risk of falls, with approximately 60% of individuals with CI experiencing falls annually, twice as frequently as cognitively intact counterparts . Individuals with CI are also more prone to falls resulting in injuries, with up to a three-fold increase in the incidence of hip fractures compared to those without CI. Recognizing and addressing this connection between cognitive and motor deficits is crucial . A systematic review from 2018 concluded that combining physical training with cognitive training in a functional context can help mitigate some aspects of CI. Therefore, the evidence supports that cognitive intervention should be concurrent with physical exercises rather than separate . Action Observation Therapy (AOT) involves observing a motor gesture performed by another individual and then imitating the same movement. This technique has been developed as a physical rehabilitation approach that promotes brain plasticity by activating the mirror neuron system . Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of action observation learning. A study conducted with children with cerebral palsy, presented by Naura et al. , showed that motor learning through observation is more effective and provides more evident benefits when subjects learn from other patients with the same condition but less severity, compared to learning from a therapist or another person without motor impairment. However, these results have not been corroborated in older patients or those with CI. The current literature includes various studies consistently demonstrating that AOT is an effective way to learn or improve specific motor skills. Buccino's work summarizes several studies that have employed AOT, including one in which the intervention was carried out with healthy individuals to imitate a motor action in a new environment for them. Another study showed that AOT facilitates motor learning and the construction of a motor memory trace in adults and in patients who have had a stroke. In another study, it was demonstrated that, in healthy adults, AOT is superior to motor imagery as a strategy for learning a complex motor task, at least in the early phase of motor learning. Buccino concludes that these results can have significant implications in educational activities, sports training, and neurorehabilitation. Specifically in the field of pathology, evidence exists regarding the application of AOT for upper limb rehabilitation in patients who have had a stroke. A pilot study by Yu-Wei Hsieh concluded that AOT resulted in improvements in most outcomes, suggesting it as a promising alternative to contemporary bilateral arm training interventions (i.e., active control intervention) for subacute stroke patients . In a randomized controlled pilot study by Mancuso et al., it was proposed that AOT is a promising treatment for functional recovery and upper limb function in individuals with moderate to severe upper limb impairment following a stroke. AOT could become a useful strategy in stroke rehabilitation programs, as it improves functionality of the paretic upper limb and allows for regaining maximum independence in ADL . Evidence also exists for AOT in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, spec"
30,"66 patients will be included in the study during 2020. We expect 60 to 70 patients to participate fully. In case of emergency procedures, the operator can be randomized again within the next 72 hours. In case of insufficient operator experience, the procedure can also be repeated later by the same operator. The investigators' hypothesis is that the time in seconds it takes to complete a central venous line placement with ultrasonographic guidance using an ultraportable ultrasound device (SONOSite™ Xporte) will be significantly reduced compared to conventional ultrasound. The investigators' hypothesis is that the incidence of first-line central venous line placement failures, as defined as the need to attempt another placement, will be significantly reduced when using an ultraportable ultrasound device (SONOSite™ Xporte) compared to conventional ultrasound. The investigators hope that the central venous line placement will be more successful in case of emergency, and in this case, there is a significant need for an efficient technique.

Study hypothesis
=================
The main hypothesis of the study is to determine whether placement using an ultraportable ultrasound device significantly shortens the time. A secondary hypothesis of the study is to assess whether the incidence of central venous line placement failures is significantly lower when using an ultraportable ultrasound device compared to conventional ultrasound. This may help the operator more efficiently during medical emergencies.

31,"Mediolateral episiotomies are a common obstetric event that is associated with severe genital pelvic pain due to the scar tissue formation in the episiotomy area. Vulvar pain can severely complicate the sexual life and may lead to mental problems such as depression and anxiety. Therefore, postpartum patients experience a decreased quality of life due to discomfort during menstrual period, during defecation, during sexual intercourse and while urinating. This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial that aims at investigating the therapeutic efficacy of Er:YAG laser (2940 nm) in the treatment of episiotomy scars with respect to the rate of scar tissue healing and the reduction of genital pelvic pain. The hypothesis to be tested is that Er:YAG laser significantly reduce the chronic genital pain felt by postpartum patients with episiotomy scars. In this study, postpartum patients with episiotomy will be randomized into 2 groups - the study group will receive 3 sessions of Er:YAG laser therapy in total and the sham group will undergo to the same therapy but with a sham handpiece."
32,"Objective
-----------------
To determine the short-term and long-term effects of an intensive upper limb somatosensory discrimination therapy compared to an equal dose of active control therapy on upper limb sensorimotor outcomes in children and adolescents with unilateral cerebral palsy.

Study design
-----------------
This study is designed as a prospective single-centre open-label two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Study population
-----------------
Children and adolescents with spastic unilateral cerebral palsy, aged 7-15 years old.

Interventions and Treatment Duration
-----------------
Participants in both groups will receive three session of 45-minutes, which will be conducted over a period of 8 weeks, resulting in an total therapy intensity of 18. The participants in the intervention group will receive an intensive upper limb somatosensory discrimination training program, consisting of component-based training and occupation-based practice. Treatments will be scheduled once per week. Component-based training includes graded and structured practice of three components of somatosensation (i.e., tactile object recognition, texture discrimination and proprioception), including finger recognition tasks, hand recognition tasks and proprioceptive tracking tasks. Component-based practice will be complemented by occupation-based practice tasks (i.e., self-chosen activities of daily living) to enhance transfer to a functional context. Examples of activities include: opening a drawer, cleaning a table or arranging flowers. For all treatment components a progressive approach, gradually challenging their ability to perform, will be used. All therapy sessions will be performed under supervision of a trained physical and/or occupational therapist. Therapy adherence and progression will be closely monitored by the therapist. Participants in the control group will receive an equal amount of active control therapy, consisting of unimanual motor tasks and bimanual goal directed training. The unimanual motor tasks will be selected by the therapist and tailored based on the main difficulties of the child (e.g., grip strength, supination). Bimanual goal directed training includes whole task practice of self-chosen activities of daily living. All therapy sessions will be performed under supervision of a trained physical and/or occupational therapist. Therapy adherence and progression will be closely monitored by the therapist.

Study Outcome
-----------------
Primary Outcome: The assessment of bimanual performance will serve as a main outcome parameter. Bimanual performance will be captured using the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) and Adolescent Assessment Hand Assessment (Ad-AHA), which are video-based observations.
Secondary Outcome: An extensive array of secondary outcome measures will be selected to ensure an adequate evaluation of upper limb sensorimotor outcomes. These outcomes will be measured on the following domains: uni- and bimanual motor skills, functional hand use and occupation performance, proprioception, somatosensory perception, tactile perception and (cognitive) brain measures.

Time Schedule
-----------------
Baseline, post-intervention (within one week after intervention completion) and follow-up (6 months after intervention completion).

Data Collection
-----------------
Data will be collected during three different sessions on three separate dates. The first two sessions will occur as close as possible to each other (max. two weeks) at the start of the intervention period. Follow-up assessments will further occur as close as possible to the intervention completion (max. one week). The neuroimaging data will be collected at baseline, within one week after the post-intervention.

Objective
-----------------
To determine the short-term and long-term effects of an intensive upper limb somatosensory discrimination therapy compared to an equal dose of active control therapy on upper limb sensorimotor outcomes in children and adolescents with unilateral cerebral palsy.

33,"1. This is a prospective cohort study. A prospective cohort study is a study where a set of subjects (with a specified characteristic) are studied at a number of time points. This set of subjects is called a cohort, and this is what we are studying here.
The study is being set up as a nested case-cohort design, with all patients included in an initial observational (prospective cohort design) phase, and patients that develop complications of gallstone disease (case) will be included in an in depth, more detailed, observational and intervention phase (case-only). The case phase consists only of cases or controls that have been selected specifically for inclusion and exclusion in the study e.g. based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and outcomes. The case-cohort sampling design is a powerful design enabling both the identification of potential causes of disease, whilst simultaneously being less expensive than other trial designs. The nested (case-only) case-cohort design consists of a cohort design nested within a case-control design by including all subjects that are present in the full observational cohort at one or more timepoints. Both the cohort and the case-cohort sampling strategies are being used to explore the association between factors associated with the development of complications of gallstones and the microbiome.

2. Stool samples will be collected to understand the changes in gut microbiome in patients with gallstones during presentation and during their surgical journey. Stool samples will be collected at 10 timepoints or readmission/ follow-up appointments: at time of diagnosis at 6 month timepoints after diagnosis prior to cholecystectomy immediately post-surgery at 6 month timepoints post-surgery. These have been selected after discussion with the surgical department. The stool samples that will be taken at each time point will be used to study the gut microbiome.

Study design: In this study an observational cohort (with stool samples collected for analysis) will be expanded upon by obtaining additional samples (additional stool samples) from those individuals within the primary cohort that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Biospecimen collection strategy: The samples will be taken directly from the participant at each time point.

The samples will be collected in a clean and sterile fashion, within a clinical environment by clinical staff following the appropriate infection prevention practices.

Stool samples will be collected and placed into appropriately labelled sample collection tubes using the protocol described within the SOP (Appendix 10b).

These samples will then be stored for 24 h at ambient temperature (472-471oF) followed by placement in the patient’s fridge at home (339-424oF) and will be picked up from a box left at the patients home by the research team. On collection these samples will be placed into a clinical biorepository within the Trust and stored under -80oC.

Primary outcome measures: There is no primary outcome measure as the primary aim of this study is exploratory with the focus of understanding changes in the gut microbiome in patients with gallstones.

Secondary outcome measures: The secondary outcome of this study is to understand the impact of changes in the gut microbiome on patient outcomes (e.g. length of stay, wound healing, post-cholecystectomy diarrhoea, short and long-term patient outcomes)."
34,"1 SALD has not been clearly defined. In this study, the occurrence of SALD is defined as patients with serum transaminase level (AST or ALT) greater than 20 fold of upper limit of normal or serum TBIL level greater than 2.0 mg/dL.; 2 For SALD patients, we further distinguished the two following disease conditions: Hypoxic liver damage (hyaline degeneration) and SIC. In this study, hyaline liver damage is defined as patients with both significantly elevated AST or ALT greater than 800 U/L and normal serum TBIL level.; SIC is defined as patients with either significantly elevated serum TBIL level (≥2.0 mg/dL) or significantly increased AST or ALT level (≥20 fold of upper limit of normal without elevated serum TBIL level) in this study.; 3 The incidence of sepsis, intra-abdominal infection, severe sepsis, and septic shock in the study patients from ICU admission to death or discharge; 4 The occurrence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications (arrhythmia, myocardial dysfunction, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) in the study patients from ICU admission to death or discharge; 5 The need for non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, and the duration of non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation.; 6 Changes in the level of routine biochemistry, haematology, and acute inflammation test indicators at different time points of ICU patients.; 7 Changes in the Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Oxford Acute Severity of illness Score (OASIS) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) to assess the patient's prognosis, and mortality for sepsis and SALD."

36,"350 nulliparous women who applied to the training and research hospital between December 2021 and May 2022 and who had a normal birth with a single neonate were included in the study.The group that agreed to participate was assigned to two groups as the Skin-to-Skin Contact and the Control Group. The control group in this study was the routine mother-newborn care procedure performed in the delivery room.After consenting and applying the criteria of inclusion, women were divided into 2 groups, the Skin-to-Skin Contact Group and the Control Group. The Skin-to-Skin Contact Group (n:180) was given early skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth for a minimum of 15 minutes, and then, 2 hours after birth, the routine postpartum care procedure for normal birth was applied to the mother and the baby. 2 hours later, mothers were told to fill in a personal questionnaire and a traumatic birth scale. Maternal Attachment Scale score was also measured at the 1-month control follow-up. The control group was monitored according to the routine care procedure carried out in the delivery room and 2 hours later, mothers were evaluated together with neonatal routine care procedures after normal birth was asked to fill in a personal questionnaire and a traumatic birth scale, and 1 month after birth, the Maternal Attachment Scale score was also measured. To evaluate perception, the scores of the Traumatic Birth Perception Scale were recorded in both groups in three different dimensions (cognitive, affective and behavioral). The 4-item perception scale was scored within the 10-point Likert scale range. 1 point signifies no perception, 2 points signifies perception, and 3 points signify strong perception. Positive perception scores are considered as perception of a pleasant experience, and negative perception scores are the opposite."
37,"Postoperative pain after lumbar discectomy surgery is a significant problem preventing patients from walking, early recovery, and even causing chronic pain. Ultrasound-guided sacral erector spinae plane block is used to reduce pain after lumbar spine surgery. The investigators proposed that this study could provide information on the incidence of postoperative pain and nausea, as well as the total amount of postoperative morphine consumption, in the form of Visual Analogue Scale and patient satisfaction score. It is accepted that the success of regional anesthesia is due to the correct implementation of the application techniques. In our study, the aim is to provide information related to the success of this application technique in reducing postoperative pain and the time it takes to start these drugs in lumbar spine surgery."
38,"The primary objective of the study is to develop and validate a noninvasive ultrasound-based imaging biomarker that can predict the presence of pain, along with the underlying tissue characteristics (e.g., thoracolumbar fascia abnormalities and viscoelastic tissue properties, such as stiffness and strain rate) for patients suffering from low back pain of myofascial origin.

What"
39,"Pain is a common cause of ED visits in the US. Current best practices in Emergency Department (ED) suggest that most acute musculoskeletal pain (MSP) can be treated with non-opioid therapies. One concern is that many patients with acute MSP fail to adequately recover and seek additional medical intervention. Furthermore, a recent study showed that there is an association between acute MSP and prolonged opioid use. For some patients, a single ED visit represents their only medical contact. Thus, ensuring pain recovery and preventing prolonged opioid use are critically important ED outcomes. However, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence on effective approaches to address these needs in the ED. The objective of the current study is to develop a pain management educational video that could be used to prevent subsequent opioid use among ED patients with acute MSP."
40,"130 children and 12 teachers will complete surveys to asses their ADHD symptoms' impact on behavior at school, the triggers affecting these behaviors, their progression regarding school-child triggers, and their concentration capacity and hyperactive behavior. The researchers will implement an appropriate intervention adapted from Neural-linguistic programs with one group of 138 schoolchildren suffering from ADHD symptoms. This approach will allow for better identification of risk factors related to ADHD and triggers at school. The school children's performances will be followed up at baseline and two months later to measure the progress of symptoms regarding concentration and hyperactivity, as well as measuring their triggers at school and their behavior."
41,"Students are currently taught clinical medicine in the emergency department of the Brest University Hospital. This department is characterized by the heterogeneity, multiplicity and intensity of emergency situations. In the light of the health crisis, the training course has been redesigned in order to anticipate the implementation of tele-radiology, to limit the contact surface and to implement learning based on concrete examples. It is proposed to structure the teaching of clinical medicine in the emergency department of the Brest University Hospital through a multi-professional and interdisciplinary team. This emergency situation clinical teaching method will be structured around an Emergency Care OSCE planned at the end of the internship. An emergency structured clinical examination (ECOS) is a clinical teaching and evaluation method based on a practical case. The emergency structured clinical examination is the cornerstone of the acquisition of the basic clinical skills of junior clinicians. It is a tool based on clinical situations of various complexity which are confronted with a simulator in order to structure, evaluate and document the clinical skills of the various actors in the emergencies. Its aim is to ensure that patients receive the same standard of care and are treated in the best conditions, whatever the period of the day and the place of consultation may be. It provides a framework in which junior clinicians can learn and assess their clinical skills in real time in a standardized and safe situation.The development of clinical skills requires the implementation of clinical cases as part of the daily emergency department activity. This study tests the relevance of a new teaching tool for all health professions in the emergency medicine OSCE. This tool is called ECOX: Emergency Care OSCE e-Xpress. ECOX is the same emergency structured clinical examination (ECOS) except that each stage is equipped with a large range of material that can be used immediately before the stage is performed. At the end of the stage, the time used to solve the case is evaluated. This material is arranged in boxes that can be placed in the workstations. This study is a pre-test / post-test of the same clinical teaching method between the two groups (experimental arm / control arm). It is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open, parallel-designed study.

43,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing motor neuron disease characterized by motor function weakness and death due to respiratory failure. Once respiratory function is reduced to an insufficient level life expectancy is measured in months. Ventilation support is an important means of prolonging life for a large proportion of ALS patients. The potential for improved quality of life among partners and children following this kind of support for adult ALS patients has not been studied. The primary objective of this study is therefore to examine the impact of treatment with LTMV on quality of life among patients ,partners and children over a period of 18-21 months.  This includes assessments of quality of life, burden, disease-specific symptoms, physical and respiratory function and respiratory complications.

The secondary objective is to examine whether there are changes in specific patient characteristics over time. This includes assessments of the patient’s swallowing function, respiratory function, nutritional status, muscle strength and sleep quality and frequency of respiratory tract infections.

44,"Neurologic deficits in acute and peri-acute chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) occur in many patients and the timing and severity of recovery of these deficits has been poorly understood. cSDH is a collection of blood accumulating between the brain surface and the tough dura mater outer coat of the brain. The dura mater and the underlying brain do not expand as the subdural hematoma enlarges and as the associated mass effect develops. To alleviate the associated increased intracranial pressure and to prevent seizures, surgery is indicated once a certain size of hematoma is reached. The surgical evacuation cures the symptoms related to the mass effect of the hematoma; however, many patients experience cognitive deficits related to the brain itself. It has been proposed that the subdural hematoma promotes the release and spread of cytotoxic excitatory neurotransmitters (such as potassium and glutamate) which triggers neuronal injury/death. This can be observed using Electroencephalography (EEG) as spreading depolarization (SD) waves. SD waves correlate with spreading cortical dysfunction that is associated with the impairments in cognitive function. SD waves have been detected in acute and peri-acute traumatic brain injury but have not been assessed in chronic subdural hematoma specifically.  
The primary hypotheses is that 40% of patients will experience SD events that will correlate with a decline in Markwalder or Glasgow Outcome Scores within 72 hours after surgical evacuation of cSDH and that the presence of SD waves predicts a more significant decline in MMSE, MoCA and SDMT. A better knowledge of the neurological recovery in cSDH has implications for the timing and selection of patients for rehabilitation post acute subdural hematoma evacuation."

46,"Surgical resection is the mainstay of curative therapy in patients with colo-rectal cancer. Although many older patients can cope with surgery and achieve complete cancer eradication, 30 % of elderly patients do not. In these patients oncological outcomes are often impaired and the patient experiences a long-lasting recovery from surgery. In order to improve postoperative outcomes and patients experiences we have designed a new surgical approach, where we combine the advantage of minimally invasive surgery with an organ sparing principle. The combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection makes it possible to remove 82% of the tumour with an intact colon while the surgeon is spared the dissection of the superior mesenteric vessels. Compared to standard resection, this procedure reduces the extent of the surgical resection, minimizes the trauma in the body, and thereby reduces the risk of postoperative complications. CELS will be tested in an elderly colo-rectal cancer population, comparing CELS with standard resection. Primary objective is to evaluate the patient-reported outcome postoperatively 3 months after the randomized surgical intervention. Secondary objectives are patient reported outcome up to 30 days postoperatively, assessment of health related quality of life and assessments of long-term oncological outcomes, hospital readmissions, rate of secondary surgery, length of hospital stay, 30-day mortality, duration of surgery, blood loss and rate of complete resection margin.

What is the"
47,"Respiratory infections are one of the most common comorbidities in people with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) and neurodisabilities, and often require treatment with antibiotics. However, they are a significant risk factor for acute exacerbations and respiratory hospitalizations, which can be costly to resources and also harmful to patients. In addition, people with NMDs and neurodisabilities are also more prone to recurrent respiratory infections, particularly those with an underlying neuromuscular disease. This makes it harder to achieve long-term immunity, and increases healthcare costs.

This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of nebulised hypertonic saline to reduce respiratory infections in people with neuromuscular disease or neurodisabilities. The study will include people with a wide range of NMDs and neurodisabilities, including cerebral palsy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. The study will be conducted in London, UK, at the Royal Free Hospital for Children (RHFC). 

The study will include 50 participants aged 5 and over. Participants will be randomised to either receive nebulised hypertonic saline or normal saline (placebo). Participants will be followed for 52 weeks, during which time they will be asked to provide information about their respiratory infections, as well as other measures of health and function. The study is open to all participants, including those who may require hospitalization or other supportive care. 

Inclusion Criteria:
In order to ensure the validity and reliability of the results in this study, a rigorous systematic approach to selecting the population of interest will be employed. 

The following participants will be considered eligible for study inclusion and study retention:

• Diagnosis of neuromuscular disease or neurodisability confirmed by a physician based on standard criteria.
• Age 5 years and above.
• Have a history of at least one respiratory exacerbation requiring antibiotic treatment with or without the need for hospitalisation in the 12 months prior to recruitment.
• Must be able to tolerate nebulised 6% hypertonic saline.
• Must have the ability to provide informed consent, or consent will be obtained on their behalf from a parent or legal guardian.

Exclusion Criteria:
Not all participants are suitable for this study. To ensure the safety and wellbeing of participants, certain exclusion criteria will be used.

The following participants will be excluded from the study:

• Patients with additional diagnosis, for example, CF, but those with aspiration and/or bronchiectasis secondary to respiratory complications of NMDs will be included.
• Patients who are already prescribed daily HS in any concentration (i.e, 3%, 5%, 6%, 7%) will be excluded, but those who are on daily NS or have HS prescribed as part of their escalation plan (i.e., PRN) will be included.
• Patients with life-threatening, rapidly deteriorating or rapidly progressive disease processes that would make the study impractical (e.g., rapidly worsening motor function in the setting of critical illness due to neurotoxicity and/or poor treatment compliance, or rapidly progressing respiratory failure in the setting of life-threatening respiratory complications).
• Patients with significant ongoing cardiac, gastrointestinal or other non-respiratory comorbidities.
• Pregnant or lactating patients.
• Patients who are likely to require antibiotic treatment within the next 12 months.

In addition, the following participants will be excluded from the study:

• Patients who are less than 5 years of age.

54,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the photosensitiser methylene blue in the intra-canal delivery of photodynamic therapy administered with diode laser on root canals in patients with apical lesion as an adjunct to conventional endodontic therapy. A randomized, clinical, superiority trial will be carried out, controlled, blinded and masked, with 3 arms. The patient sample will be randomized in 3 treatment groups: the first is the placebo group which will receive conventional endodontic treatment (ET) and a simulated treatment with the equipment in which no irradiation will be emitted; the second group will receive conventional ET associated with PDT with diode laser at 660 nm, fluence 10 s/canal; and the third group will receive conventional ET associated with PDAT with laser at 660 nm, 20 s/canal. The photosensitizer used in the PDT will be methylene blue. Disinfection of the root canals will be evaluated by analysis of colony formation (ufc/ml); biological samples will be taken with paper cones inserted into the root canals to the apical region at two moments: Baseline (before treatment, T0); after instrumentation with PDT (experimental groups) and without PDT (placebo group). Clinical and radiographic examination of all the patients will be used to obtain baseline values (T0) and values 6 months post-treatment (T1). Conventional ET will be performed according to standard clinical practice. The teeth to be treated will be cleaned of tartar and debris, the crown will be slightly filled and anaesthesia will be applied. The pulp chamber will be opened and cleaned until healthy tissue is found. Canals will be irrigated with NaOCl 5.25% (1:2). Patients in Group 2 (PDT) will receive PDT with conventional ET with the use of diode laser at 660 nm, fluence of 1W for 10 s, with an optical fiber coupled to the equipment that will remain in the apical third of the canal for 10 seconds for photo-sensitisation. Patients in Group 3 (PDAT) will receive photo-activated disinfection (PDAT) using the same setting as for PDT but for 20 seconds. The irrigation protocol and the medicaments used will be the same for all the groups. After the PDT and/or PDAT procedure, the canals will be re-cleaned with saline solution and final irrigation will be performed with 5 ml of 17% ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid. The paper cones used for sample collection will be prepared and packaged in the same manner. The biological samples collected for the evaluation of colony formation will be packaged in a sealed box identified by the investigator. After obtaining the results of the colony formation assay, the biological samples will be used for the characterization of their intra-canal microbiota, using previously characterized methodology based on a polymerase chain reaction amplification of the gene encoding 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (16S rRNA). All patients will be evaluated by clinical and radiographic evaluation at baseline (before treatment, T0) and 6 months after treatment (T1). In addition to assessing the presence and size of lesions, the reduction in lesion size between groups will be compared. The success rate will be assessed for each group 6 months after completion of the treatment. Disinfection of the root canals will be evaluated by analysis of colony formation (ufc/ml); biological samples will be taken with paper cones inserted into the root canals to the apical region at two moments: Baseline (before treatment, T0); after instrumentation with PDT (experimental groups) and without PDT (placebo group). Clinical and radiographic examination of all the patients will be used to obtain baseline values (T0) and values 6 months post-treatment (T1). The presence and size of apical lesion will be assessed at T0 and T1, the percentage reduction of the lesion will be calculated and the PAI index will be used as a scoring system to assess the lesion. The success rate will be assessed for each group 6 months after completion of the treatment. Adverse events will be analysed; a serious adverse event for this study is any unfavourable odontological event that the investigators believe to bear a causal relation with the experimental intervention."
55,"40 years old female participant with 14 years of education. Current occupation: social worker and mother. Education level: high-school level (H) as a social worker and a social worker assistant in a daycare center. Her work involves handling of children from 0 to 10 years of age. Her duties as a social worker assistant require direct interaction in group work. Her day often involves handling of multiple subjects simultaneously with unpredictable mood swings and behaviors. In order to keep up her pace, she engages in a healthy lifestyle. The participant has a high level of fitness and has always been interested in health and nutrition. She has practiced strength training, and her goal is to participate in the World Championship of strength fitness in autumn 2023. Pre-existing conditions: The participant has used paracetamol during her lifetime, and the participant has only been admitted to hospital once in her childhood. The participant has been previously diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). She has also been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum with a high-functioning neurotype. The participant's mother was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in 2018 (not by this researcher). The participant has a high level of fitness and has always been interested in health and nutrition. She has practiced strength training, and her goal is to participate in the World Championship of strength fitness in autumn 2023. The participant's blood plasma showed unusually high testosterone levels and low estrogen levels at a gynecological check-up. This could indicate an imbalance in the female endocrine system. There is, however, no official diagnosis of hormonal imbalance. No known mental disorder history. Recent disorders: The participant has been recently referred to psychiatry in order to receive a psychiatric examination and treatment. She showed multiple symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia (PDA), and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Her symptoms include: i) Fear of public areas; ii) Tachycardia, panic attacks, and dizziness; iii) Fear of public speaking; iv) Excessive worrying, and crying. In the context of anxiety-driven behaviors, it is interesting to note the participant’s recent experience of a traumatic event: On the 20th of February 2023, around 1:15 AM, two individuals attempted to break into her home. The traumatic experience, combined with a suspected case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), is a factor that would likely lead to a worsening of her condition. The participant has been referred to specialized anxiety treatment. No medications have been prescribed for the time being. Treatment: The participant was referred for both short-term (3-months) and long-term (1 year) treatment. She is currently undergoing a 15-session weekly treatment using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmaceutical treatment using SSRI and SNRI. The participant undergoes psychoanalytic assessment, psychiatric testings, and medical assessment. Psychiatric Testing: Differentiated evaluation according to DSM-5 criteria. The participant is tested using DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria, the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV ADIS-IV, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ADIS-IV, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview MINI, and the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-16). Medical Assessment: The participant had a routine ECG test and was referred for laboratory blood analysis with clinical chemistry profile. Lab blood analysis included blood samples with blood counts, coagulation measures, and liver function. Mild hypercholesterolemia was found at 7.4 mmol/L (normal range: 3-7.8 mmol/L), and the participant was referred for cardiovascular screening and examination. Medication: The participant was offered a combination of SNRI duloxetine 20 mg/night in Jan. 2023, and 50 mg/d in Mar. 2023. The dosage was adjusted based on her personal reactions (mood change, side-effects, and physical/mental stamina) to the medication. An SSRI dosage of 50 mg/d in Aug. 2023 was chosen instead of increasing the dosage of duloxetine. The participant was also using 12 tablets of SSRI (Lupin Sertraline"

Input Text: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Trajectory Control of a Humanoid

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Humanoid robots are intended for human interaction. The control structure used to interact with humans on dynamic human environments are inadequate to make humanoid robots a good tool to perform this task. Our proposal is to control a humanoid robot based on the principle of the movement of the human body. We propose to learn the skills of how we perform daily actions, such as walking and going up or down stairs, from direct interactions with the environment. We propose to model the environment based on the movements of individuals with limited mobility. We propose to use Deep Learning Reinforcement to learn motor coordination of a biped humanoid robot from human data and learn to walk, climb stairs, and recover from perturbations.

63,"700 prepubertal children with idiopathic short stature and no diagnosed growth hormone deficiency  are recruited as this study includes patients who respond very well to GH treatment along with patients with low or no response. Children who take part in this study receive no experimental treatment and do not need to make any changes to their therapy. All study participants will be recruited from the departments of pediatrics in the Stockholm region (Stockholm County Council). Children are being screened for this study by their paediatrician or nurse. Only children who meet the inclusion criteria will be contacted by telephone, where parents are being given oral information about the study. If parents want more information, they will be sent written information about the study. Informed consent must be obtained from the child's legal guardian before any further study activities take place such as sample collection, which will be done when the child comes for follow-up. Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent to participation in the study will be enrolled in the study.
Study participants have routine follow-up visits during their first year of GH treatment during which blood and urine samples are routinely collected. In addition, these participants will be asked to provide one additional, new 20 ml blood sample.
If a participant withdraws consent the medical treatment of the participant will be unaffected.
During the study period the GH treatment will be the responsibility of the paediatrician or nurse at the participants' medical centre."
64,"Rationale: Neurocritical care patients are often awakened for neurological examinations after craniotomy for elective or emergent reasons. There are no data regarding the frequency of neurological examinations that would facilitate sleep. Objective: The objective is to compare the effect that varying frequency of neurological examinations has on both sleep in hospitalized neurocritical patients and patient recovery and neurological outcome. We hypothesize more frequent neurological examinations will increase sleep efficiency at the expense of time spent awake or time spent in a more profound sleep stage (e.g. deep sleep), thus, there will be less recovery in patients awakened more frequently. Methods: This will be a prospective, randomized study of consecutive patients enrolled at 9:00 pm on the first post-operative night and continued until discharge to the hospitalist service. Patients will be randomized to the group that is awakened for neurological examinations every hour or every other hour. An overnight sleep study (polysomnogram) will be performed on the same first night following surgery and again on the following 2-4 nights at the discretion of the clinical team. Polysomnograms will be scored using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) international scoring manual.
Results: This study was presented and discussed at Society of Critical Care Medicine Critical Care Congress, February 16-19, 2019, San Diego, California. There were no published data presented in scientific journals at the time of this submission. Discussion: This is the first study to compare the effects of varying the frequency of neurological examinations on sleep quantity and quality in critically ill neuroscience patients after neurosurgery. The study aims to determine the ideal frequency to balance the need for frequent examinations to ensure neurological stability and to allow adequate sleep quantity and quality for optimal recovery."
65,"95% of HNSCC are squamous cell carcinomas and 10% to 20% of these cases are positive for Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). HPV-positive SCC of the oropharynx are thought to have a better prognosis when compared to HPV-negative SCC. The current 7th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), World Health Organization (WHO) TNM staging system distinguishes two distinct categories of HPV-positive SCC; namely in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), the nodal status has prognostic significance whilst this is not the case for the nodal status in HPV-positive SCC elsewhere in the head and neck region (non-oropharyngeal SCC). In the present study, the investigators will examine the radiographic/clinical features, including extranodal extension (ENE), in order to delineate these two groups from one another.


Detailed Description

66,"Background and Aims:
Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is a common and severe complication of diabetes. Bedside blind bone biopsies (BBB) are a simple, safe, and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete DFU healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological BB. In addition, BBB can be performed in patients who have not yet received antimicrobial treatment and before definitive diagnosis of DFO. Our hypothesis is that BBB is non-inferior to conventional BB in DFO outcomes and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO. Aims: 
To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of both procedures. To compare the microbiological culture results between the two procedures. Main and Secondary Outcomes: 
The main objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of bedside blind bone biopsy, compared to conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological), on DFO remission without surgery at 1 year. The secondary objectives are to: (i) compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy (ii) compare microbiological culture results between groups (iii) compare the safety of both procedures. Methods: A single-centre open-labelled, randomized non-inferiority controlled trial comparing the clinical, microbiologic and safety outcomes of bedside blind bone biopsy and conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological). 
Randomisation, Blinding, and Implementation: 
Randomisation will be open-labelled, controlled, and non-inferiority, with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients with DFO will be asked to participate in the study and, if they accept, they will be registered. Registration includes the acquisition of informed consent, inclusion and exclusion criteria fulfillment, baseline evaluations, and randomization. Both patients and the clinician responsible for patient care cannot be blinded. The intervention will take place in the patient’s room; therefore, patients will not be unaware of the intervention type. An external statistician will be responsible for data safety, as well as for the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of the data by the principle investigator. All researchers will remain blinded until all results are published. Ethical considerations will be considered throughout the study, especially during the design phase. In the event of a conflict of interest, no team member other than the first author will be involved in the article's publication. A copy of the data set will be provided if requested by journal. Statistical Analysis: 
The sample size was determined to assess the non-inferiority of BBB over CCBB. Using the published results1, a one-side (superiority) test with a non-inferiority margin of 20%, power of 90% and type 1 error of 5% would include 152 participants (76 in each arm). This non-inferiority margin was determined based on the primary published trial in 20181 which reported a DFU remission rate without surgery at 1 year of 50.5% in the bedside blind bone biopsy group. We plan to enroll at least 350 patients. To account for losses due to withdrawals or loss to follow-up, we planned a minimum sample size of 350 patients. This target enrollment will give us a total of 1150 patients across two groups of which approximately 55% will be allocated to either BBB or conventional bone biopsy. For the analysis of the main outcome, we will use a one-sided 0.05 Fisher’s exact test, with the non-inferior hypothesis being established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less than 20% with respect to the DFO remission rate without surgery. The secondary outcome is the need for surgery. The non-inferior hypothesis will be established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less than 20% with regard to the need for surgery. In both cases, the non-inferiority margin corresponds to the non-inferiority margin chosen for the main outcome. These non-inferiority hypotheses apply whether the study is considered as superiority or not; therefore, there are no superiors or non-inferiorities hypotheses. If the non-inferiority hypothesis is not met, the superiority hypothesis cannot be verified. In terms of safety, adverse events will be assessed in both groups and tabulated by system organ class and preferred term. 
Patient and Public Involvement:"
67,"β-TrCP2 is a novel protein that directly controls β-catenin, a key regulatory protein that mediates the Wnt signaling pathway. Mutations in Wnt genes and activating mutations in β-TrCP2 have been linked to several cancers, including colon cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer. In this study investigators will explore the potential role of inhibiting β-TrCP2 in human colon cancer. The study will be in the form of a randomized clinical trial comparing a β-TrCP2 inhibitor-RK2-001 to placebo in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The study is limited to subjects with mCRC, K-RAS tumor status and no active CNS metastases who are not candidates for curative therapy. Subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio, stratified by tumor KRAS status and number of prior fluoropyrimidine adjuvant treatments. The study will consist of the screening and baseline periods; the treatment period that is 56 days; and a follow-up safety assessment period. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of RK2-001 compared with placebo on duration of objective response (measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of RK2-001 compared with placebo on progression-free survival (according to RECIST Version 1.1) and overall survival in subjects with measurable disease.


Detailed Description
-----------------
β-catenin overexpression plays a major role in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) disease. It is also well recognized that over-activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is tightly linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which is a characteristic feature of metastatic disease. Wnt signaling pathway is controlled by a multi-protein complex comprising β-catenin, APC, Axin and GSK3β. Tumor suppressor genes (e.g., APC) or mutations in GSK3β tend to lead to over-activation of β-catenin and consequentially, to cancer formation. Thus, inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway would have tremendous potential in treating many cancers. Since β-catenin directly controls the Wnt signaling pathway, inhibiting β-catenin has become an attractive strategy to treat tumors mediated by the Wnt signaling pathway. In contrast to inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway, which often leads to compensatory changes in the cell to sustain β-catenin activity, inhibiting β-catenin directly eliminates any β-catenin activity and consequentially, the Wnt signaling pathway that needs constant β-catenin activity to sustain. Recently, we have reported that β-TrCP2 is a novel protein that regulates β-catenin activity via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Therefore, inhibiting β-TrCP2 will result in increasing β-catenin activity and consequentially, the Wnt signaling pathway. Over 20 different cancers have been reported to over-express β-TrCP2. Using β-TrCP2-deficient human colon cancer cell lines, we have shown that inhibiting β-TrCP2 prevents β-catenin degradation and inhibits Wnt signaling. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that inhibition of β-TrCP2 will block β-catenin degradation and increase Wnt signaling, leading to inhibition of tumor growth in patients with colon cancer. This hypothesis can be tested by investigating whether β-TrCP2 inhibition has an anti-tumor activity in patients with mCRC. The study investigators plan to conduct a randomized dose-finding study with a fixed dose (250 mg, twice daily) and then a randomized dose escalation study. In this study investigators will explore the potential role of inhibiting β-TrCP2 in human colon cancer. The study will be in the form of a randomized clinical trial comparing a β-TrCP2 inhibitor-RK2-001 to placebo in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Eligibility for the trial is limited to subjects with mCRC, K-RAS tum"
68,"Background
-----------------

Objective:

This is a retrospective study carried out on pathology specimens of oropharyngeal or oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas (HPV+ vs. HPV-), to be analyzed on the following aspects:

1/ Molecular typing: The analysis will consist of targeted panel sequencing (a method of DNA sequencing that allows sequencing of DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples to detect somatic mutations, gene fusions and gene expression profiles)

2/ Identification of gene expression signatures for response to immunotherapy

3/ Identification of gene expression signatures for radiosensitivity and drug sensitivity

Rationale: the aim of this study is to determine the predictive role of molecular diagnosis to improve the therapeutic management of head and neck carcinoma patients, as well as to improve their prognosis.

Study design:

Histology specimens will be obtained from patients with HNSCC diagnosed with HPV+ or HPV- treated at our Institution between January 2011 and September 2019 for oropharyngeal cancer and from January 2013 to September 2019 for oral cavity cancer. It is estimated that it will collect 50 patients per group (positive and negative to HPV).

Primary outcome:

The primary objective of this study is the evaluation of molecular alterations (both somatic and germline) on a targeted panel sequencing with the aim of establishing molecular profiles and their impact on the evolution and disease (survival) in HPV+ or HPV- patients.

Methodology:

FFPE samples (pathology specimens) will be subjected to the targeted panel sequencing to investigate the impact of molecular alterations (mutations, gene fusions), gene expression and copy number variation on the evolution and prognosis of the tumor in HPV+ or HPV- tumors.

Samples will be screened for 87 Hotspot genes (BRAF, EGFR, ALK, CDH1, …), full genome analysis of 48 genes (MUTYH, NF1, RAD51C,…) copy number analysis of 43 genes (GATA3, NF1, RAD51C …) and gene fusion (inter and intra genic) of 51 genes (CDH1, FGFR1 …).

Gain-of-function mutations in onco genes, focal amplifications and gene fusions will be assessed in each sample. To identify gene translocations and expression profiles, Illumina RNA Flex Chip was used. Data will be analyzed using the R2 Genomic Analysis and Visualization Platform (https://r2.amc.nl)

Intervention Description:: Alveolar ridge preservation will be placed on sockets extracted in need of implant placement or denture fabrication. A free palatal graft will be harvested, then a bone particle derived from human-cadavers will be inserted inside socket before the palatal graft will be used as cover. In group B, a free palatal graft will be harvested and vascularized by use of a periosteal-pouch. In group C, a collagen membrane will be inserted before the palatal graft become inserted. Finally, in group D, a non-resorbable membrane will be inserted before the palatal graft become inserted. Sockets will be randomized into groups A,B,C and D. 
Time will be measured in cm for socket wall and ridge width after tooth extraction and grafting. The healing time period will be divided into three different time intervals from 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. At these points in time the soft tissue thickness will be measured by a Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) unit. Three CBCTs will be obtained where the patients will be required to smile: baseline at extraction, after one month and after six months.
The radiographic evaluation of the soft tissues will be performed by means of CBCT and  STereoLithography (STL). The CBCTs data will be imported in the Mimics software, and the 3D STL files will be used to determine changes in soft and hard tissue.
The soft tissue changes will be further confirmed by means of photographs and silicos.
Cone Beam Computertomography (CBCT)
Cone Beam Computertomography (CBCT) is an x-ray based device capable to render high quality, low dose images with a limited field to improve patient health and minimize radiation exposure. With use of CBCT, there will be a lower marginal bone loss than with 2D periapical imaging.
CBCT will be set at 90 Kv, 10 mA and a 261 scan time at 12 bit resolution. With use of a special CBCT-tray, the patient will be seated in the dental chair under the scanner, and will be required to bite on a bite-bar. For the purpose of this study, the patient will also be asked to smile.
The radiographic evaluation of the soft tissues will be performed by means of CBCT images. Three CBCTs will be obtained where the patients will be required to smile. CBCTs will be imported in the Mimics software to determine changes in soft and hard tissue.
Antero-superior, antero-medial, antero-inferior and posterior-superior areas of interest will be defined for the assessment of thickness in the soft tissue of the ridge. Two points will be selected for each area of interest from the same cross sectional area where it will be marked on the lateral edge and at the level of the alveolar crest. 
The distance between the two points will be measured by the software and used to calculate the thickness in each area of interest. All the measures will be done by two examiners separately and the results will be compared to ensure a precision of the measurements.

74,"Pemetrexed is a treatment plan for nonsquamous NSCLC patients, but due to the immune-tolerable side effects, the administration procedure requires careful management. In addition, the low response rate and rapid resistance lead to unsatisfactory prognosis. In addition, the incidence of lung squamous cell carcinoma tends to increase as the diagnosis becomes younger, which results in poor quality of life and poor survival. Therefore, it is necessary to develop additional immune checkpoint inhibitors that are effective in lung squamous cell carcinoma and to develop novel immunotherapy to resolve the problems associated with the administration of Pemetrexed.

A randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liraglutide in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with metastatic brain disease who cannot receive brain radiotherapy

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Malignant brain metastases (MBM) occur in at least 50% of patients with lung cancer and they are associated with poor prognosis. In patients with advanced lung cancer, brain metastases are a common source of pain, and they also reduce life expectancy. Currently, stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS) is the main therapeutic option for the treatment of brain metastases in patients with advanced lung cancer. However, not all patients respond to SRS and the disease is often recurrent. New strategies to treat patients with MBM and with brain metastases recurrence are required. The investigators propose Liraglutide, a glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) agonist that acts on the brain, can prevent the development of brain metastases in patients with lung cancer. Previous studies have shown the efficacy of this medication in reducing or preventing the risk of brain metastases. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that Liraglutide may act on the gut-brain axis with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses in the brain. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liraglutide and its effects on the gut-brain axis in patients with lung cancer with MBM or with brain metastases recurrence. The investigators believe that Liraglutide may act on the gut-brain axis, thus preventing or delaying the development of brain metastases.

Detailed Description

Phase II, multicenter, controlled, clinical trial. Patients with advanced lung cancer and not eligible for stereotactic radiotherapy due to the multifocal and multicentric nature of brain metastases will benefit because all patients with lung cancer will be offered to be randomized to the study. The trial will include patients with advanced lung cancer, treated or without treatment with immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy, with brain metastasis or with brain metastasis recurrence. Imaging will be performed at enrollment. Patients who develop new brain metastases during the follow-up of the trial will also be evaluated. The primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients who develop new brain metastases during the follow-up of the study in the group of patients treated with Liraglutide compared with the group of untreated patients. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Trial subjects will be selected from all eligible patients at the Oncology and Radiotherapy Department of the Hospital de Santa Creu i Sant Pau-Institut de Recerca Sant Pau (IR-SP) and the Institut Català d'Oncologia (ICO).

76,"The objective of this study is to assess the impact of acetaminophen (paracetamol) on blood test values that are used to estimate the severity of the patient's liver disease and the likelihood of a liver transplantation being necessary, both during treatment and when treatment has completed, in the context of drug-induced liver injury in the patients under investigation. This study will compare three different treatments, namely one placebo (dummy) treatment with two different acetaminophen treatments. It is important to do this, because although acetaminophen is very important in the treatment of patients with liver disease, its use can still cause serious liver injury in some patients. The study results will help decide what should be done to make sure that using acetaminophen does not cause serious liver injury in any patients. 

The main objective which this study is trying to answer is: How does ASA (Paracetamol) influence the inflammatory response after acute severe traumatic brain injury? There are 4 main questions in the study:

1. To estimate the degree of inflammation (the immune system response to injury) and its changes over time in severe TBI patients and the effect and timing of acetaminophen use on their inflammatory response in the first days after the injury.

2. To assess the impact of acetaminophen use on the level of the protein called β-Trace Protein (β-Tp; a substance which indicates the severity of TBI in patients with a good initial outcome) in the first 72 hours after the injury.

3. To assess the effect of acetaminophen use on prognosis, neurobehaviour and functional outcome in the first 6 months after the injury.

4. To investigate whether certain parameters, such as age, level of consciousness after the injury and the use of acetaminophen, can predict outcome."

78,"Background of the study:
The majority of mortality and morbidity associated with burn injuries result as sequelae of sepsis, multiorgan failure, and hypovolemic shock. Thus, optimizing and sustaining the fluid balance and minimizing the inflammatory and catabolic responses is essential to improve the outcome of burn- injured patients. Although there is growing evidence that resistance exercises can improve lean body mass (which plays an anti-inflammatory role) and reduce plasma liver enzymes level post burn, but no studies have investigated the effect of resistance exercises on liver enzymes reduction post burn in patients. This study aimed at investigating the effect of resistance exercises on liver enzymes level post burn.

Objectives: 
This study aimed at investigating the effect of resistance exercises on liver enzymes level reduction post burn.

Study design: 
Sixty patients who have partial thickness burn with burned body surface area (BBSA) about 30% to 50% will participate in this study after their release from intensive care unit. Their ages will be ranged from 20 to 45 years. The participants will be selected from Orabi hospital and randomly distributed into two equal groups. 1. Group A (Study group): This group includes 30 burned patients who will receive resistance exercises 8 weeks (3times/week) by using dumbbells and sand bags in addition to their physical therapy program (splinting, stretching ex. and ROM ex.) and medical treatment. 1. Group B (Control group): This group includes 30 burned patients who will receive their physical therapy program (splinting, stretching ex., strengthening ex. and ROM ex.) and medical treatment.

Procedures: 
Upon admission to the ICU, clinical assessment and laboratory tests will be done. Then, randomization numbers will be generated using computer software (www.random.org). The investigator will ask the patients who have partial thickness burn 15-25% of total body surface area (TBSA) either to do resistance exercises or not. The potential participants in each group will be explained all details of this study (including its purpose). Then, the written informed consent will be obtained and if they refuse, they will be excluded from the study. The patients who accept to participate in the study will be randomly assigned into the study group or the control group. A physician who is a part of this study but blinded to the outcomes of this study will be present at randomization and allocation processes and record all allocations. Upon admission, medical records of the patients to identify demographic data, type of burn, burn percentage, burn depth, medical history, etc will be reviewed. Also, anthropometric measurements (Height, Weight, and waist circumference) will be taken. Then, blood samples of the patients will be taken. Blood specimens will be used for plasma liver enzymes level. 1H NMR spectroscopy technique will be used for measuring the plasma liver enzymes level. The samples will be stored at –80 degree Celsius for further analysis after the end of research protocol. Resistance exercises will be performed using the gym. The resistance exercises program will supervised by physiotherapist for 12 weeks (3 times per week). Resistance exercise will perform three sessions per week for 12 weeks (3 sets of 12 repetition of resistance exercises with 2-3 minutes rest between sets). A physician who is a part of this study will be present at all treatment to make sure that no problems occurred during resistance exercise. Clinical monitoring and assessment will be done at the beginning of treatment, every two weeks, and at the end of treatment, including measuring waist circumference, body weight, and taking blood samples to measure plasma liver enzymes level. 

Outcomes: 
Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at admission, every two weeks, and at the end of treatment as mentioned before.

Secondary outcomes include waist circumference, body weight, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level, Plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP), plasma Total Protein Content (TPC), Total Bilirubin (TB), Albumine, blood Hemoglobin (Hb) level, blood creatinine level, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, plasma Triglyceride level (TG), plasma total cholesterol level (TC), blood HDL cholesterol level (HDL-C), blood LDL cholesterol level (LDL-C), and blood glucose level (GLU).

79,"------------------ Cervical spondylosis is a common cause of neck pain, which can lead to decreased range of motion, disability, and other health-related outcomes. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a specific intervention involving upper fibers of trapezius stretching in reducing neck pain, improving neck range of motion, and reducing disability in patients with cervical spondylosis. Eligible participants undergo assessment including self-reported pain intensity, disability, cervical range of motion, and additional physical and psychological assessments. Participants are then randomized into either the intervention or the control group. The intervention group received the specific upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention in addition to standard care. The control group received standard care only. The duration and frequency of the interventions were standardized across participants, and adherence was monitored throughout the study period. Participants in both groups also completed self-reported measures of pain intensity, disability, and additional health-related outcomes at baseline (pre-intervention), after the 4-week intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. Data were interpreted and analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention compared to standard care alone in reducing neck pain, improving neck range of motion, and reducing disability in patients with cervical spondylosis. Additionally, the study also aimed to evaluate the efficacy of other interventions such as physical therapy, medication management, and behavioral approaches in reducing disability and improving outcomes in patients with cervical spondylosis. The results of the study may provide valuable insights for future treatment strategies for patients with cervical spondylosis."

81,"endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory gynecological disease that affects about 7% of women and women. Its origin being largely unknown, it remains an inflammatory disease that can only be treated in part with medical treatment. Indeed, about 30% of affected patients require surgical resection. Unfortunately, even if endometriosis is not a benign disease, patients remain fertile and therefore often seek infertility treatments. Although cell-free DNA in follicular fluid has already been studied in cancer settings, we aim to show that patients with endometriosis have an elevated rate of cell-free DNA when compared to other causes of infertility. Such markers could allow monitoring of endometriosis as well as other causes of infertility."

84,"----------------- Dementia is an umbrella term associated with the decline of a person’s ability to think, remember and perform daily functions. Studies show these symptoms are more prevalent in patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factor. In addition, patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those without cardiovascular disease. Many of these patients have mild cognitive decline, which can be prevented with cognitive stimulation therapy. Cognitive stimulation therapy is a 14-week program, developed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and proven to help older adults with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The purpose of the project is to recruit 2,000 patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to test whether dementia patients who have cognitive stimulation therapy will score higher on a cognitive assessment than those without therapy. The project will also test whether the acceptance rate of cognitive stimulation therapy is greater than 60% among healthcare-referrals. The results of the project will help patients with dementia and MCI receive improved and accessible healthcare services.


Explanation of the methods and analyses (Protocol): -----------------
Background Dementia is an umbrella term associated with the decline of a person’s ability to think, remember and perform daily functions (NIH 2019). Dementia is common in older adults. It is estimated 39 million people are living with some form of “dementia” worldwide. Dementia has become the costliest condition to treat—with 1 trillion in worldwide costs (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics 2021). With aging populations the prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease are projected to rise throughout the next century (World Health Organization 2020). These statistics reflect a serious public health problem. The NIH and several other U.S. agencies are engaged in finding new ways to treat dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (Amyloid Treatment and Prevention Initiative; https://www.alzheimers.org/research/clinical-trials-and-treatments/clinical-trials-and-you/amyloid-treatment-and-prevention-initiative). Dementia is often a result of cardiovascular disease (Gilbertson et al 2012). It also often co-occurs with metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (Rajan, et al 2019). While many are aware of this link, what remains unexplained is why this association exists. One possible link to this association is the development of blood coagulation (Raz and Yassuda 2019). The end product of this cascade is the formation of a clot (Yassuda 2008). Clotting of blood in the brain leads to a condition known as a “stroke.” Cognitive Impairment is defined as a change in a person’s ability to function normally in daily situations. These changes are categorized as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. There are many forms of dementia: Alzheimers disease (the most common), vascular dementia, or a combination (dementia with mixed-features). Dementia with mixed-features is the second most common type of dementia. It is common for individuals with dementia to have multiple types of dementia. MCI and dementia are common conditions among older adults (Al-Kandari, et al 2019). It is estimated 16% (Gitlin et al 2005) of individuals with MCI are likely to progress to Alzheimer’s disease within 4 years. When MCI is associated with physical impairment due to cerebrovascular disease, the risk of progression to dementia increases four-fold (Jacobsen, et al 2005). Among individuals who received care for a dementia-related diagnosis in 2013, 16.1% died compared to 8.8% of the general U.S. population (Johnson et al 2017). The high prevalence and mortality rate of dementia are significant public health problems. Most public health interventions have a preventive focus. This includes the promotion of physical exercise, brain stimulation and/or cognitive training. Research shows that cognitive stimulation is beneficial for patients with MCI and mild dementia (Martin et al 2009, Livingston et al"

88,"Background: Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the most common intra-abdominal surgical emergencies. Despite this, there is a paucity of evidence to guide the management of these patients. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of non-operative management (NOM) of ASBO for children with favorable clinical characteristics. A trial of NOM allows time for an assessment of clinical improvement as non-operative measures are administered to correct the imbalance of ileus. When initiated at the right time, this is successful up to 80% of the time according to the recent literature. Previous literature on NOM has focused on general principles of management including non-operative resuscitation, pain control, decompression of distended loops on physical examination, gastric decompression, and a low-residue diet. More recently, studies have suggested a potential role for enteral contrast administration (ECA). ECA may have utility in identifying complete small bowel obstruction. In adult literature there is Level 1 evidence supporting the use of enteral contrast in patients presenting with adhesive small bowel obstruction. The authors of those publications recommend the use of an enteral water soluble contrast followed by post contrast imaging. There have been no studies published to date reviewing the use of an enteral contrast challenge specifically in children with ASBO. Although there is some evidence to support the use of contrast at the decision to operate (DTO), there is no Level 1 or 2 evidence to support the use of early contrast. The addition of contrast imaging may aid in the management of children with ASBO by assisting in the decision to perform surgery, particularly when an enteral challenge can be administered with minimal risk. Objective: To study the effect of the use of an enteral contrast challenge for the management of children with ASBO, on the incidence of surgical intervention, as well as complications from contrast exposure in children with ASBO. Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study across nine sites that enrolled patients from May 2020 through September 2022 . The study population included children aged 1 to 20 years admitted to the hospital with a radiographic diagnosis of ASBO who underwent an enteral contrast challenge. Patient demographics, medical and surgical history, clinical presentation, laboratory studies, and imaging were included. Data were collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tool hosted at the University of Colorado. Patient groups were evaluated including those who received enteral contrast and those who did not. Comparisons were made between those who received contrast and those who did not. A subset analysis was performed among patients who received enteral contrast. Comparisons were made based on type of contrast agent used and final osmolality of contrast administered. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between contrast and need for operation adjusting for age, body mass index for age z-score (or weight for height z-score for patients under 24 months of age per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards), volume of contrast administered, and number of previous laparotomies (< 3 v. ≥3). A second subset analysis was performed based on whether a contrast challenge aided in the management of an ASBO when comparing children who underwent an enteral contrast challenge and required an operation with those who required an operation with no prior contrast challenge.

Overview

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which generally manifests in the second or third decade of life and can persist for a long period. In the Netherlands, there are currently 66,440 people with chronic intestinal disease, of which 9,014 people suffer from Crohn's disease. Patients with Crohn's disease frequently present with episodes of severe abdominal pain and disabling diarrhea with blood and mucus. Complications such as stricture formation, fistula formation, and abscesses can contribute to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. In addition, the disease places a financial burden on our health care system and its patients. Patients require long-term management and there is currently no cure. For most patients, treatment will begin with mesalamine and corticosteroid use is often necessary when symptoms progress. If symptoms persist, the use of immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate is suggested. For patients not improving sufficiently, biologics (e.g. anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab or ustekinumab) are used as a last resort. There is currently no cure and in some patients, the disease can persist for a long time and treatment will need to be adjusted regularly to ensure that symptoms remain under control.

TNF

Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) plays an important role in the inflammatory process of Crohn's disease, as well as the formation of complications such as strictures or abscesses. Targeting TNF-α can reduce the burden of disease through reduced inflammation, reduced stricture formation and reduced abscesses. The first biologics to target TNF-α was infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to TNF-α and prevents its interaction with the TNF-α receptor. The efficacy of infliximab was studied in a number of studies, including a phase III trial by Sandborn et al (2007) where infliximab was shown to be superior to placebo. In this study, the treatment with infliximab resulted in significantly higher remission rates and significantly fewer episodes of abdominal pain, disabling diarrhea, and hospitalization. Other studies showed similar results (Hanauer et al (2003); Feagan et al (2005); Sands et al (2003)).

IFX monotherapy, IFX and immunosuppressive therapy

In a number of studies, the efficacy and safety of infliximab was studied, focusing on different doses of infliximab and the use of additional immunosuppressants. In these studies, patients received either 10 mg/kg every 2 months or 5 mg/kg every 2 or 8 weeks. The treatment schedules studied also included a loading dose of 5 mg/kg at the start of treatment. The results suggest that a higher loading dose and higher maintenance doses achieved better results, with higher remission rates and better response to therapy. The efficacy and safety of infliximab in combination with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine was also studied. A systematic review by Schnitzler et al (2013) showed that the use of combination therapy was associated with a better response to treatment, as shown by higher remission rates, higher rates of clinical remission and a quicker time to remission. There was no evidence of increased side effects and toxic effects with the use of combination therapy.

Aim of the study and research questions

As there is currently uncertainty as to whether infliximab monotherapy is as effective as infliximab in combination with azathioprine in the induction therapy for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease, this study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab monotherapy with infliximab in combination with azathioprine during induction therapy. Additionally, the study aims to study the following:

• The efficacy and safety of infliximab monotherapy
• The efficacy and safety of infliximab in combination with azathioprine
• To what extent concomitant treatment with azathioprine or methotrexate improves the efficacy and safety profile of infliximab
• The relationship between HLA"
92,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now recommended as a first-line option in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation. However, current international clinical practice guidelines and product inserts suggest caution and/or avoidance in using DOACs in case of potential important drug-drug interactions, including potential DDI with anticancer therapies. Indeed, potential important DDIs can affect the efficacy and safety of DOACs and/or anticancer therapies and/or other interfering medications in these patients. Data about the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DOACs in cancer patients are scarce. By using a PK approach, this study aims : to describe the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting to identify factors (age, weight, renal function, co-morbidities, etc) influencing the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting."

Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on PFTs, reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. Although all individuals perform spirometry testing using the same maneuver, there is some possibility that this maneuver can induce bronchoconstriction in some of the patients with bronchiectasis which may be improved by bronchodilators administration or by performing the testing prior to administration bronchodilators. Despite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis, the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations. According to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society statement, the proper way to demonstrate BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most resent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered positive BDR. While many factors may influence BDR, some can influence the results of the spirometry evaluation alone or in combination with bronchodilators administration. Theoretically, in patients with bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry can potentially cause changes in lung function, for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in patients with bronchiectasis might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Secondary objectives will be to assess if BDR is associated with age, gender, specific bronchiectatic disease, baseline FEV1, and other clinical factors such as sputum cultures, IgE levels, eosinophil levels, computed tomography (CT) score, family history of asthma."
94,"1. Introduction:
Chronic migraine (CM) is a common form of headache that affects an estimated 3.6 million people in the United States (US). This type of headache can be debilitating and, at times, causes patients to miss work and school. While some people are affected by CM infrequently throughout their lives, other people experience these headaches more often and are considered to be chronic migraineurs (CMs). CM affects both genders and has been shown to have a negative impact on patients’ quality of life and overall well-being. The current medical treatment of CM involves acute and preventative treatment modalities. Preventative treatments include medications that are typically used to treat depression, seizures, and hypertension. As such, these drugs pose an increase risk of cardiovascular disease, sedation, and renal toxicity. In spite of these risks, acute and preventative drug treatment strategies are still considered to be the predominant methods used to treat CM. Unfortunately, as with any drug, the effects from acute and preventative drug treatments are highly patient specific. Therefore, some patients may respond positively to the drug, while other patients may not respond to the drug or have mild to moderate side effects. One particular area where significant advancements are still needed is the field of patient-specific treatments.
3. Personal significance:
Our research group has a long history of studying migraine headaches and chronic migraine. The group has used a variety of research methodologies including clinical studies and psychophysical pain testing. As a result of this history, one of our group’s researchers (J.G.) has encountered patients with CM many times during his career. These encounters brought to his attention the high prevalence of migraine headaches, as well as their negative impact on patients’ quality of life. Our research group has been invited to serve as part of a team at Emory University that is charged with developing and testing alternative treatments for patients with CM. This new role provided J.G. with the opportunity to expand his thinking and focus on the potential effects of hormonal treatments on pain perception.  This line of enquiry and associated research questions grew out of a long history of experience working at Emory University and seeing patients with different migraine headaches including CM. Although CM has been shown to affect patients differently, little is known about how gender identity impacts pain perception and the potential treatment outcomes for these patients. Therefore, the current proposal represents the first step towards exploring the possible relationship between gender identity, hormone status and pain sensitivity among patients with CM. This type of research is important because the information that we learn from these studies can influence both the prevention (prior to the onset of a headache) and treatment of CM.
4. Research history:
The field of neuroscience has witnessed a rapid increase in its understanding of the central and peripheral nervous system. Advancements in pain research were a direct result of these technological advancements, and neuroscientists were among the first researchers to understand how these technologies could be used to further their studies. The scientific methods and technologies that have been used to study pain perception include non-invasive brain imaging, pharmacologic modulation, psychophysical testing, and behavioral assessment. Our group has used a variety of these methods including brain imaging and psychophysical testing to examine pain perception in patients with migraine headaches. One of our major research discoveries has been that patients with migraine headaches show deficits in pain tolerance compared to healthy participants. Furthermore, these deficits have not been shown to be related to differences in brain activity (as indicated by brain imaging). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that deficits in pain tolerance may be directly related to differences in endogenous pain modulation systems. To test this hypothesis, we examined differences in pain tolerance among 4 groups of patients: controls, non-painful CM, painful CM, and patients with migraine headaches. Our results showed that these patients exhibit different levels of endogenous pain modulation, which could explain their observed differences in pain tolerance. Furthermore, our results showed that the presence of a migraine headache alone can reduce pain tolerance among these patients.
5. Scientific objectives:
Our primary scientific objective will be to understand how gender identity, hormonal status and pain perception are related among patients with CM. This relationship has never been investigated, which is a major scientific shortcoming in the CM literature. In order to address these issues, we propose to use a variety of scientific methods and technologies including brain imaging and psychophysical pain testing. The information that we learn from these studies can be used to develop and test alternative treatments for patients with CM. Furthermore, our research proposal will provide our team of investigators with important information about the relationship between gender identity, hormonal status and pain perception among patients with CM"

Introduction
When the respiratory failure of ALS approaches, the persistence of dyspnea is often perceived as one of the major determinants of suffering induced by this disease. The only treatment capable of improving respiratory distress, prolonging the survival of ALS patients and alleviating suffering is non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Numerous therapeutic approaches have been evaluated in the past in order to alleviate dyspnea independent of its treatment (vasopressors, corticosteroids, cannabinoids, antidepressants, intravenous lidocaine, but also thoracic paravertebral injection of a bupivacaine local anesthetic, transcranial electrical stimulation). It has been suggested that virtual reality (VR) applied to ALS patients treated by NIV could reduce the feeling of respiratory effort and allow breathing to sound less labored, thus relieving dyspnea 1). A randomized controlled study involving 80 ALS patients treated with NIV has shown that VR can reduce the feeling of respiratory effort (40% improvement) and dyspnea intensity (12% improvement), thus increasing the quality of life of patients by improving sleep and preventing the premature use of NIV . 1.

Concepts about the pathophysiology of dyspnea in ALS 2).

ALS patients develop the symptoms of respiratory failure only when there is a loss of function of respiratory muscles with an imbalance of ventilation / perfusion. Dyspnea in these patients is mainly sensory in nature, corresponding to the perception of the afferent information from the respiratory receptors and the central nervous system and not to a cardiopulmonary deficit. This dyspnea is characterized by a predominance of the affective component (dyspnea is experienced as undue), which is not linked to any organic alteration, but rather to the difficulty that ALS patients have in maintaining their autonomy and in particular their self-respect. 2)
Apart from dyspnea, ALS patients often experience anxiety, which results in anticipatory anxiety and an inability to remain calm and at rest. 3).
Although the sensory component of dyspnea is the main target of current therapeutic approaches, it should be noted that they are based on symptomatology and no mechanism of action has been identified. 4).

Current therapeutic approaches are based on the use of bronchodilators (bronchodilators), sedatives (hypnotics such as benzodiazepines) and NIV, without addressing the emotional aspects. Currently, there is no standardized way to measure dyspnea. The Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire is widely used for the evaluation of dyspnea. It consists of 30 items, 12 of which are specific to respiratory dysfunction. Each question is marked on a numerical scale from 0 to 10. The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 300. MDP questionnaires were administered to 34 ALS patients treated with NIV. The average score of these patients was 166 . 5).

Problems related to the measurement of dyspnea.

MDP questionnaires are used by clinicians to determine the effectiveness of dyspnea treatments in clinical trials. However, the results are variable even when the symptoms appear to be the same. We believe that this is due to the emotional aspect of the disease, the lack of involvement of the patient in the choice of his care program, and the place where the measurement of dyspnea is performed and therefore the psychological context in which he finds himself. There are differences between the way dyspnea is perceived at home, where the patient is in a private environment, and during the medical consultation, where the patient feels the influence of the medical environment, the clinician and the presence of his entourage in an unfamiliar place , even if this visit is programmed and scheduled within the routine of his disease. Another aspect to consider is the impact of this measurement on the patient’s psychological condition. The evaluation by questionnaire of the dyspnea felt may change the way it is perceived, thus further exacerbating the problem. Although MDP questionnaires are commonly used, they are criticized for a number of reasons. First of all, the use of an ordinal scale makes the data inconsistent. Secondly, the wording used to explain the scale is not always self-explanatory and clinicians often have to adapt to the patient’s level of understanding. In this study, patients have the option of completing the questionnaire at home"
97,"2020 marks the tenth anniversary of the WHO 'antibiotic resistance' action plan. Although this plan was quickly adopted by several countries, the rate of antibiotic prescriptions has generally continued to rise in parallel to the emergence of bacterial resistance. In particular, there is a lack of evidence regarding interventions that may support GPs in better targeting their antibacterial prescriptions. In primary care, antibiotic prescriptions often rely on urine culture results. Due to the time it takes a laboratory to analyze these cultures and return their results to GPs, many patients receive treatment based on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Loire Atlantique and Maine et Loire districts (France), with a primary care cohort of women presenting with a Escherichia coli urinary tract infection (UTI). Each patient will be attributed to either the intervention arm, receiving a targeted antibiotic susceptibility testing result, or to the control arm, receiving a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing result. Outcomes of interest are broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing in the same primary care practice and rate of de-escalation (=a shift from broad-spectrum to narrower-spectrum antibiotic therapy). The investigators hypothesize that targeted antibiotic susceptibility testing will reduce the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing and that these reductions will be sustained after one year.

99,"Background: Ventral hernias (VH), defined as bulges in the abdominal wall, occur in 1 in 200 individuals. VH present a lifetime risk to the patient, resulting in morbidity, mortality, and quality of life decrease. VH are exacerbated when a patient is obese based on the individual’s BMI. Weight reduction has shown to reduce the rate of re-herniation in patients undergoing elective ventral hernia repair. However, only 0.1-5% of the patients lose weight successfully prior to their scheduled VHR. Previous methods used to help with weight loss have not been successful. Studies suggest that the use of behavioral coaching may significantly enhance an individual’s ability to successfully lose weight when compared to self-motivation alone. New technologies like virtual weight loss coaches have the potential to offer a cost-effective, scalable intervention for obese VHR patients to lose weight. The success of a virtual weight loss coach also heavily depends on the amount of interaction or engagement a patient has with the coach, as a lack of engagement results in greater than 80% of weight loss programs to fail. 

Given this lack of success with the current interventions for weight loss in obese hernia patients, we propose using the MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach, and to test whether the virtual coach will increase overall weight loss as compared to the standard weight loss program (standard preoperative weight loss tools) or other intervention methods. In addition, given the lack of studies measuring whether patient engagement with the virtual coach translates to increased weight loss, we propose a secondary analysis to determine if a virtual weight loss coach increases the degree of patient engagement, as we hypothesize that this will lead to more weight loss in our subjects.

Does a Virtual Coach Offer a Better Solution for Weight Reduction in Ventral Hernia Patients With Obesity?

Description
-----------------
Hypothesis: The MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach will lead to the most weight loss in patients undergoing elective ventral hernia repair compared to patients using current standard preoperative tools or other weight loss programs. The overall purpose for this study is to determine if the MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach increases the total amount of weight loss when compared to standard preoperative tools. In addition to looking at the degree of weight loss, we hypothesize that the most successful intervention will also result in higher levels of patient satisfaction and will lead to more patient engagement when compared to a less successful intervention. Subjects will be recruited from the in-office and hospital-based clinics at UT Southwestern Medical Center and will be recruited by all members of The Division of Plastic Surgery and The Division of General Surgery. Subjects who fit each inclusion criterion will have the option to enroll in the study, which is a randomized trial. A total of 160 subjects will be needed to ensure adequate statistical power to measure any differences in the weight lost within each group and between each of the three study groups. Randomized enrollment will occur across three different groups, each with 53 subjects. We will record patient information such as demographics, BMI, and type of hernia repair. We will perform measurements on patients both preoperatively and 6 months post-op. Study enrollment will occur on the last scheduled pre-op visit, which will typically be 1-2 months prior to surgery. Participants will attend a total of four study visits, 2 of which will be virtual visits (pre-op and post-op), the other two will occur in-person with the research team. During the first two encounters, we will gather baseline information, patient demographics, and BMI of each subject. We will then give each subject a study code that will remain anonymous throughout participation in the study, as well as a phone number that will be directly in contact with the participant’s assigned coach for the duration of the study. We will explain to each subject their respective methods of weight loss and guide them accordingly for the remainder of the study. The subject will be given the virtual coach number, login information, and directions on how to use the Mychart enabled virtual coach. Subjects assigned to the Standard group will be given a reference list for the most common obesity-related diet and exercise plans and a paper calendar where they will track their weight progress and diet/exercise plan compliance. Subjects will also have the opportunity to use their own pre-op weight loss program.

100,"1. Research Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (nebulized) combined with conventional therapy for the treatment of moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 patients through a multicenter, randomized controlled, single-blind clinical trial. Our main goals revolve around developing a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that can be widely utilized to efficiently ameliorate the clinical symptoms of patients with moderate pulmonary and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and mitigating the clinical symptoms of patients with critical pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2. Research Design: (1) The study adopts a multicenter, randomized controlled, single-blind trial design. (2) A total of approximately 101 participants will be enrolled in the trial. (3) The control group will receive nebulized saline solution twice a day (BID) for 5 days, while the experimental group will receive 5ml of nebulized umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles twice a day (BID) for 5 days. (4) The safety and effectiveness of the treatment plan will be evaluated by comparing the differences in symptom remission time, improvement of serum inflammatory markers, changes in lung lesions on CT as well as be hospitalized time and nucleic acid turn time of two groups during and after treatment. 3. Innovation of the trial: This is the first multicenter randomized controlled single-blind trial with clinical efficacy evaluation through pathogenesis studies on the application of stem cell-derived exosomes for coronavirus disease 2019 treatment. The outcome of this study can provide clinically valuable data for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in the future and also provide a methodological reference for the future conduct of multicenter and large-sample studies on stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of various diseases. A systematic approach for standardizing manufacturing processes has also been established, and the obtained extracellular vesicles will be stored for future basic studies (such as disease pathogenesis, immunotargeted drug delivery, and toxicity studies). 4. Outstanding characteristics of the trial: (1) Compared with other clinical applications of stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of various diseases, this trial provides a more systematic approach to the development and research of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, which can promote the development of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle production technology and provide support for the production of new drugs for clinical treatment. (2) Compared with other clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, by selecting patients with moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 infection, the results of this trial are more directly applicable and can provide direct evidence that stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles can effectively reduce lung injuries and improve patient outcomes. 5. Risk and side effects evaluation: (1) According to the literature review on the efficacy and side effects of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of COVID-19 infection and the known side effects of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes, we conclude that the adverse reactions of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of COVID-19 infection remain unclear, and there are no reported cases of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes to treat patients with COVID-19 infection. (2) During the study period, participants will be closely monitored and their vital signs, lung function, laboratory tests, and adverse events will be investigated to ensure their safety during the study period. (3) The specific details of the trial monitoring and risk management will be formulated as part of the trial, and the investigators will also conduct regular safety and tolerability assessments of the trial. In the event of any adverse events that occur during the study period, the investigators will promptly provide appropriate medical care to the participants and report the event to the Drug Safety Committee and the Drug Administration Committee in time. 6. Ethical considerations: Participants in this study voluntarily agreed to participate in the study, and the trial strictly abides by the principles of Good Clinical Practice (CGCP, Chinese version), and the trial adopts a rigorous clinical trial design."
101,"Background: Calcium silicate cement is a novel material used in endodontics and dental materials, consisting of tetrical calcium silicate, water and alkyl/methacrylate monomers. Some studies have shown that Calcium silicate-based sealer (CSS) have several advantages of the currently available epoxy resin-based sealer (ERS), including higher antibacterial effect, biocompatibility, good sealing ability, high pH and biomimetic remineralization. However, the evidence on clinical effects of Calcium silicate-based sealer is still insufficient. Therefore, this project aims to investigate and compare the clinical effectiveness of Calcium silicate cement and Epoxy resin-based sealer in patients with single-tooth irreversible pulpitis under one-visit endodontic treatment.

104,"Diseases or conditions associated with the use of central intravenous catheters (CIV) are common, and a potentially life-threatening complication is septic thrombophlebitis (STP) which may require catheter extraction. STP occurs mostly on implantable chamber (IC), implantable port (IP), central venous jugular (CVJ), central femoral (CFF), central subclavian (CSC), PICCline and dialysis catheter. The diagnosis of STP is based on clinical diagnosis of thrombophlebitis (erythema, warmth and edema, sometimes painful), combined with a positive blood culture. STF is responsible for the majority of infections in ICU and is a major healthcare problem. For patients with STP and central line, a curative management is not available in current guidelines. Antibiotic therapy is recommended for 3 to 7 days, but relapses or new infections are frequent with this approach. A catheter-related bacteremia not associated to STP can occur with a central line. This is defined as blood cultures positive for the same germ present in a central catheter and / or by catheter culture positive at 103 CFU (CFU, colony forming unit) per ml of material removed and with the same microorganism. In this study, the investigators hypothesis is that the diagnosis of STP on central venous line will be higher and earlier by Doppler ultrasound of the catheter injection area, and that the duration of signs of STP on Doppler ultrasound will allow to determine whether early extraction of the central line is justified in case of bacteremia."

107,"The main objective of this study will be to investigate the impact of gaseous ozone application, besides of non- surgical periodontal treatment, in periodontitis patients. After a thorough periodontal check-up to determine the treatment needs, all included patients will be treated with non- surgical periodontal treatment. However, during this treatment, the patients will be divided into two groups: half will receive gaseous ozone application and another half a placebo treatment. The participants will be re-examined after 3 months, and the treatment effect will be evaluated. 

Introduction
The periodontal disease is a chronic infection and inflammation condition of the supporting tissues of the teeth including the gingival, periodontal ligament, cementum and alveolar bone. 
Untreated, the periodontal disease may progress and lead to the destruction of gum and bone, which supports the teeth in the mouth. This, in turn, may lead to loosening of the teeth, and even complete tooth loss. Thus, the management of patients with periodontal disease, through scaling and root planing (SRP), is the gold standard of treatment. However, in cases of patients with moderate or severe periodontal disease, the use of adjunctive therapies have been proposed as possible alternatives to improve the clinical and periodontal parameters. 
Accordingly, many different biological (systemic antibiotics) or non-biological (subgingival irrigation, photodynamic therapy using lasers, application of ozone gas or topical antibiotic solutions) therapies have been proposed to improve the clinical and periodontal parameters. However, to date, no adjunctive approach is considered as the standard of care and clinicians should, therefore, choose the methods of adjunctive treatment based on their own experience, expertise and the best available evidence. 
In this context, the use of gaseous ozone, as an adjunct to SRP, has been suggested in the past as a treatment with minimal invasiveness and risk of side effects. Ozone is a strong oxidizing agent with chemical activity on the surface of the bacteria; such as periodontal pathogens, where it can damage their membrane function and inactivate their metabolic functions. In addition, ozone also has an immunomodulatory effect and can help to reduce the inflammatory response of the tissues in patients with periodontitis. 
This study is a single-center, randomized, assessor-blinded clinical study to investigate the impact of gaseous ozone application, besides of non- surgical periodontal treatment, on periodontal clinical parameters, periodontal probing depth, bleeding on probing, and inflammatory parameters in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF).

Objectives
The primary aim of this study is to investigate and compare the treatment effect of periodontal subgingival scaling and root planning, with and without ozone application, on the periodontal clinical parameters including probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP), as well as inflammatory parameters in the GCF. 

Study design
The study will be a single-center (Faculty of Dentistry, University of Bergen, Norway) assessor-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT).

Inclusion criteria

108,"The pathogenesis of pterygium remains unclear but the main risk factors include exposure to UV radiation, increased production of collagen and matrix metalloproteinases(MMPs) and increased angiogenesis.We have recently reported a significant correlation of PCNA, CD44 and E-cadherin expression levels with pterygium dimensions and recurrence rate. The current study is planned to confirm the correlation between PCNA, CD44 and E-cadherin expression levels and the dimensions of primary and recurrent pterygia.CD44 and E-cadherin are potential biomarkers  for the detection of the early stage of pterygia by immunohistochemical (IHC) methods."
109,"1. Hypothesis The loss of nasal T cells during ageing is associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and the development of a pro-inflammatory environment. 2. Background Aging is associated with a progressive decline in immune function. Immune senescence, in particular the loss of T cell immune responses, may contribute to frequent infections and increased susceptibility to severe infections during older age. However, our understanding of how the ageing immune system contributes to an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections still lacks. This is particularly an important knowledge gap when we observe that around a third of younger adults become infected with a respiratory pathogen after symptomatic influenza infection. We hypothesize that there are important individual differences in disease susceptibility, which may partly be explained by age-associated changes in the antiviral T cell response. Previous studies have revealed that T cell homeostasis in the nose is altered in older compared to young adults and that the T cell compartment in the nose is substantially reduced in older adults. The loss of nasal T cells is, however, an understudied phenomenon that has not been linked to susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. 3. Objective The main objective of this proposal is to identify the underlying mechanisms and consequences of the loss of nasal T cells in older adults of different health conditions. 4. Study design We will study the effects of ageing on the nasal T cell compartment and to elucidate the consequences of altered nasal T cell function in aged individuals. For this, we will recruit 180 volunteers (aged 18-40 and 65-95). For a subset of participants (n=60) with frequent respiratory tract infections a nasal swab will be collected in symptom-free periods to identify respiratory tract pathogens. We will furthermore perform detailed studies on nasal T cells, the nasal microbiota and the systemic immune responses during respiratory tract infections in a subgroup of participants. 6. Rationale Older age and pre-existing respiratory conditions are major risk factors for severe viral infections, such as influenza-related pneumonia, as well as severe bacterial infections. In this proposal we will use a combination of advanced molecular and cellular technologies to dissect immune mechanisms in the nose, which are expected to contribute new insights into how infections in the respiratory tract are linked to immune ageing. The findings may inform future development of preventive interventions that may help to reduce the number of severe infections in older age.

110,"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of ascites that can lead to death and can be described as an acute infection of ascites without any certain source of infection. Patients in Child B or higher class can have SBP. Also patients with any of the following risk factors are prone to develop SBP: presence of gastroesophageal varices, ascites that accumulates in short intervals, history of urinary tract infections, active malignancies, history of infections, history of neutropenia, and renal transplantation. The microorganisms that cause SBP can be both gram-positive and gram-negative.The usual treatment of SBP is antibiotics to prevent the risk of deterioration of the patients' condition. The choice of the antibiotic therapy is usually based on the results of the culture. The most common treatment regimen involves two or three different types of antibiotics, based primarily on the results of the culture if it performed in less than 12 hours. The antibiotics used for the treatment of uncomplicated SBP are ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem or meropenem. Antibiotics are usually given for at least 7 days. Cirrhotic patients with SBP are treated for a few days while their condition is stable. If the patient remains stable, the antibiotic therapy may change to oral therapy, and some studies have shown that this change has not been associated with increased risk of re-infection. Cirrhotic patients with SBP must be carefully followed, particularly if the renal function is deteriorating or if the patient's clinical condition does not improve. If the patient's clinical condition does not improve, he or she must be referred to the intensive care unit. If the patient's liver function deteriorates, he or she may require liver transplantation.

OBJECTIVES: Primary outcome: Platelets to Lymphocytes Ratio and Monocytes to Lymphocytes Ratio as Predictors of Response to Treatment in Cirrhotic Patients with Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis . Secondary outcome: We study the role of neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) on bacterial peritonitis and the outcome of the same.

113,"This is a first-in-human, Phase IB study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of Tislelizumab + Nab-Paclitaxel + Gemcitabine + Canakinumab before neoadjuvant surgery in patients with locally advanced and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The primary objective is to estimate the rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of the combination of Tislelizumab, Canakinumab, Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine by Cycle, Cycle 1, and Cycle 2, within the first 56 days of combination therapy. The DLT rate is derived from a safety population (SP) consisting of all patients with at least 1 dose of Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine. All toxicities (adverse events (AEs) and abnormal laboratory values) that occur within the first 8 weeks of study treatment will be evaluated for their relationship to study drug and considered a DLT. The SP is enrolled in two stages. The first stage enrolls 6 patients (SP1) during which the DLT rate is estimated. The second stage enrolls 9 additional patients to assess the DLT rate if the DLT rate observed in the first stage is > 20%. If the DLT rate lies within the range of 0.0-0.20, then further enrollment in the SP will be closed. If, after enrollment of 15 subjects (SP1 + SP2), the DLT rate is > 20%, then further dose escalation will be undertaken. This phase of the study will be terminated upon the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) when the pre-specified DLT rate for SP has been reached. If the DLT criterion is not met within the first 15 patients who have been enrolled, then enrollment will continue until either the maximum dose of the combination regimen has been determined, or the study is determined by the DMC to be unlikely to ever meet the DLT rate criterion. This study is powered to meet the DLT rate criterion based on a single dose of each study treatment. In the event of fewer than the total number of patients who consented to enrollment and receive the combination regimen actually receiving the respective study treatments, the upper limit on the DLT rate (1.36) will be adjusted, while still maintaining a 2-sided alpha level for the Stage I design of 0.20. Stage 2 enrollment will commence upon the recommendation of the DMC. 
The secondary objectives are to estimate the overall response rate (ORR), resection rate (R0), PFS, and survival (OS) of the combination regimen in patients with PDAC. The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with BOR of CR or PR, according to RECIST 1.1 (assessed by investigator). The surgical team will review whether there are any delays in outcome in surgery that is attributed to study drug. The surgical team will also review whether there are any change in outcome in surgery that is attributed to study drug. Aside from this clinical study, additional immunology analysis of circulating blood samples will be completed to explore the changes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) following treatment with the experimental combination regimen that may predict the onset of toxicity or the likelihood of response to this unique drug combination."
114,"Mental health services play a critical role in supporting youth well-being. However, despite the known effectiveness of such services for youth, youth-reported rates of receiving mental health services are relatively low. Moreover, there are racial/ethnic and SES disparities in the rate of engagement in mental health services. One explanation for a lack of access is the lack of connection to providers: referrals to mental health services are not well-matched to youth needs and often fail to engage youth and/or their families in services (i.e., failure to establish a linkage). Furthermore, due to structural racism and socio-economic stress (e.g., poverty, discrimination, trauma), mental health problems may co-occur with physical health illnesses and/or social problems which further complicate engagement with mental health services. The Connected for Wellness (CFW) project is a longitudinal multi-site collaboration to identify, implement, and evaluate innovations in the provision of mental health and social support services to improve access to care for high-risk school age and primary care youth. The CFW model represents a transformative approach to mental health service delivery that promotes linkage to high quality, low-stigma care and services tailored to youth needs. Specifically, The CFW model will bring together community members, youth and families, community institutions such as schools, clinics and government organizations, and policy makers to improve the quality, efficiency and equity of the mental health system. The investigators developed an app-assisted system to link youth with mental health needs to prevention strategies, mental health services, and social support resources. The intervention involves connecting youth in need with a diverse team of certified peer navigators who help support app adoption and engagement. Navigators are trained to be culturally-competent, and can connect youth to both in-person and online resources. Peer navigators support youth to use the CFW app. Through the app, youth complete the UCLA DICE-9 assessment (i.e., the UCLA Development and Interruptive Events Screen 9, a brief mobile mental health screen widely used in community settings), and receive age-targeted psycho-educational and resiliency-based intervention content tailored to their needs. For youth endorsing potential clinical needs, the app also provides them with curated suggestions for both online and in-person mental health services that are specific to their needs. The app can also connect youth to other types of prevention-based interventions for youth mental health, including mindfulness apps, yoga classes, nutrition classes, parenting classes and other community resources. In this study, we propose to test the CFW model in both schools and primary care clinics. In addition, this proposal is intended to establish a strong infrastructure that will prepare a workforce of certified Mental Health Navigators (MHNs) who can expand access to mental health care in under-served communities."
115,"The purpose of this study is to discover the influence of tranexamic acid vs oxytocin injection in an elective cesarean section in term primigravidae on maternal blood loss and transfusion rates .
Brief Summary
-----------------
Cesarean section is the most frequently performed surgery in the world. During cesarean section, a significant amount of blood is lost due to the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in developing countries. Uterotonics are the first-line drugs used to control PPH, even though not all uterotonic drugs are equally effective.
Oxytocin is a natural hormone that stimulates uterine contractions following delivery and is used to prevent bleeding after the delivery. It is the most commonly used uterine stimulant for bleeding after cesarean section. Transfusion risk is associated with postpartum hemorrhage. Blood transfusions are associated with an increased risk due to the shortage of blood in emergencies and the high cost of blood transfusion. Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in Egypt.
There is a paucity of information regarding the effectiveness of intramyometrial oxytocin vs intramyometrial tranexamic acid injection in controlling postpartum hemorrhage in elective cesarean section in term primigravidae.

116,"1,546 women, 32 years on average, of 13 nationalities, were included in the present study. The aim was to describe vaginal microbiome in women with and without a history of infertility. Additionally, vaginal microbiome was assessed in relation to successful implantation in an assisted reproduction treatment (ART) cycle, regardless of pregnancy. The overall conclusion is that vaginal microbiome has a profound influence on the implantation process and the subsequent pregnancy. Furthermore, the results demonstrate how the microbiome is affected by ART interventions in the reproductive process.
The vaginal microbiome of women with a history of infertility is more complex, but it has a higher chance to support implantation and the pregnancy that follow. In this group, a diversity was found in the microbiome at baseline. We therefore conclude that a healthy vaginal microbiome is not necessarily the same for all women. This study has highlighted that the microbiome undergoes dramatic changes in an ART cycle, and that the timing is crucial for the success in fertility treatment. The impact of microbiome was most significant during the two-week waiting period before a pregnancy test was performed. The vaginal microbiomes of the two groups in which pregnancy occurred and those in which no pregnancy occurred were significantly different in this time period. These results can be applied in clinical practise to improve women’s pregnancy chances."

121,"70-80% of adults will suffer from heel pain at some stage in their lives. Many studies have focused on how to best treat this condition, plantar heel pain. One of the studies concluded that the extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) reduced the duration and recurrence of heel pain symptoms and allowed patients to resume exercise sooner than those in the placebo ESWT (sham/silent ESWT) group. ESWT is applied at a very low energy level and there are doubts as to how effective it is. The aim of this investigation was to analyse how these treatments (ESWT and KT in addition to ESWT) could reduce the pain perception of patients with plantar fasciitis.
It was observed that patients with placebo ESWT obtained similar results in pain reduction, when compared with real ESWT, as patients treated with ESWT and kinesiotape.
This study confirmed that ESWT is effective in reducing the symptoms of plantar fasciitis. However, kinesio taping could not reduce the perceived level of pain in the short term."

124,"---------------- In acute stroke, the blood clot is believed to be the primary cause of brain injury. The blood clot in most of the stroke patients can only cause temporary damage, but in some of them, the blood clot can cause severe and permanent damage to the brain. The damage to the brain and the degree of brain injury depends on multiple factors such as the size of blood clot and the place where the blood clot block the brain blood vessels. To treat blood clot, the use of medications, such as intravenously aspirin and clopidogrel, is very important for blood clot and reducing the risk of stroke. However, for most of the stroke patients, clots need to be removed by surgery or by using thrombolytic drugs. The current study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a medication called tirofiban for certain types of stroke patients. The study will be divided into 2 parts: The first study of safety and efficacy will evaluate certain stroke patients who are at a high risk of developing serious complications on treatment with either tirofiban or standard antiplatelet therapy. The second study in the trial, a controlled trial, will be conducted to identify an optimal dose of tirofiban for treating blood clots in a group of patients. We will compare the effect of treatment with either 12 microgram per kilogram per minute (mcg/kg/min) or 24 mcg/kg/min of tirofiban on treating blood clots in a group of patients.

126,"400-600 (4:1) subjects aged 18-70 with suspected sleep apnea were randomized in the ratio of 1:1 for in-person assessment (control arm) or telemedicine assessment (intervention arm). They will complete a 3-month intervention and will be followed for 1 year. All subjects will have 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (cuff) monitoring at enrollment, at 3months, and then at 6months and 12months. 200-300 subjects with known or suspected cardiovascular disease will be randomized to a separate control group in which the intervention arm consists of the same intervention and outcome measures as the main study, but the intervention will extend for a 5-year study period.

Description: Cardiovascular complications are well established in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), especially among patients with significant cardiovascular disease. In parallel, recent reports indicate that daytime blood pressure (BP) levels among OSA patients are significantly higher compared with the same population without OSA, and these increased BP levels are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular complications.
However, it is not clear why patients diagnosed with OSA have higher BP levels compared with the same population without OSA, or whether treatment of OSA with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) could influence daytime BP levels. This proposal aims to address these important questions using a clinical trial among patients with known or suspected OSA.
Hypothesis: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is characterized by increased nighttime BP levels due to repeated cycles of breathing cessation, sleep fragmentation, and intermittent hypoxia. Increased nighttime BP levels among OSA patients could be related to increased sympathetic activity leading to increased BP levels during daytime. The study hypothesis is as follows - increased daytime BP levels among patients with OSA are mediated by increased sympathetic activity caused by OSA-related cyclic activation of the sympathetic nervous system. If this hypothesis is confirmed, we expect the following results: (1) OSA and CPAP therapy are strongly related to elevated nighttime BP levels, (2) OSA is not related to elevated daytime BP levels, and (3) elevated nighttime BP levels are mediated by elevated sleep sympathetic activity.
Methods: A detailed description of the methods has been published elsewhere. In this proposal we will focus on the main objectives and specific aims of the study.
The main objective: To study the association between OSA severity and BP response to CPAP treatment.
The specific aims: (1) To measure nighttime BP levels at enrollment among patients with severe OSA and the same population without OSA. (2) To measure daytime BP levels at enrollment among patients diagnosed with OSA and the same population without OSA. (3) To evaluate the BP response in the following cohorts: (a) patients with severe OSA not treated with CPAP, (b) patients with severe OSA treated with CPAP over the course of ≥ 1 year, and (c) patients not diagnosed with OSA treated with CPAP over the course of ≥ 1 year. We will use a novel portable wireless BP monitoring system for daytime BP monitoring. (4) To evaluate the effects of CPAP therapy on BP levels during daytime by comparing patients treated (intervention) or not treated with CPAP. (5) To identify the mechanisms underlying changes in BP levels after CPAP therapy. We will use high resolution plasma profiles to identify specific BP regulation pathways and their interaction with OSA and CPAP therapy.

128,"Lung cancer is the commonest cause of cancer death in the UK. With rising tobacco consumption in many countries, the number of current and former smokers in the population is increasing. As the population ages, we expect a rise in the incidence of age-related cancers such as lung cancer. Improved knowledge about the molecular pathobiology of cancer, coupled with technological advances in functional genomics has enabled the rapid development of targeted therapies for lung cancer. This is particularly useful when identifying mutations such as EGFR, ALK and ROS-1, which can be targeted by specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, patients not harboring actionable mutations are still deprived of treatment options. Consequently, the development of new biomarkers could lead to a paradigm shift in the clinical management of patients with lung cancer. The goal of the present proposal is to develop novel tools to improve the early detection and management of lung cancer. We will use a multi-omic approach, including DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolomics, to identify potential molecular biomarkers for early lung cancer detection. Ultimately, the new molecular and immunological insights will enhance the performance of current risk prediction models and improve diagnostic procedures, enabling clinicians to better tailor treatment strategies for patients with lung cancer, and ultimately leading to improved clinical outcomes."

Brief Summary
-----------------
Purpose: To examine the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) plus standard medical management (SMM) versus SMM alone on cognition and functional capacity of individuals with mild Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), and to ascertain the effect of MBCT + SMM versus SMM alone on the caregiver burden, depression, and anxiety. Participants with mild AD dementia will be randomized to receive SMM alone or SMM plus MBCT in an outpatient research clinic in order to test the feasibility of the intervention and the potential effects on cognition, function, quality of life, and caregiver burden. All participants will receive individualized medical management of AD (including management of behavioral symptoms of AD) at least once per month by board-certified geriatric psychologist on staff, in accordance with standard medical management for mild AD dementia as determined by the National Institute on Aging consensus guidelines (1993).

This study will examine the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) plus standard medical management (SMM) versus SMM alone on cognition and functional capacity of individuals with mild Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD), and to ascertain the effect of MBCT + SMM versus SMM alone on the caregiver burden, depression, and anxiety. Individuals with mild AD dementia will be randomized to receive SMM alone or SMM plus MBCT in an outpatient research clinic in order to test the feasibility of the intervention and the potential effects on cognition, function, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The MBCT intervention will be manualized, and the manualized protocol will be piloted in 5-10 patients (using individual and group MBCT) in advance of the study intervention. All participants will receive individualized medical management of AD (including management of behavioral symptoms of AD) at least once per month by board-certified geriatric psychologist on staff, in accordance with standard medical management for mild AD dementia as determined by the National Institute on Aging consensus guidelines (1993). The duration of randomized intervention for each participant is 6 months. To control variability in the intervention sessions, the intervention sessions will be videotaped and then rated for fidelity. A treatment adherence scale was developed that assesses each element of the mindfulness protocol. Rated protocol elements serve to measure the quality and quantity of each session, and are used to determine intervention dose by dividing the fidelity ratings by the number of expected protocol elements in the given session. An MBCT therapist will also rate the participant attendance at the sessions. The primary caregivers will also be assessed during the intervention, and will be administered the 30-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Studies Neuropsychiatric Inventory (ADCS-NP) in order to assess caregiver burden, depression, and anxiety. After assessments are made at the beginning of the 6-month intervention phase, a pre-post measure will be administered at the completion of the 6-month intervention period to measure changes in cognition, functioning, and quality of life, and changes in caregiver burden, depression, and anxiety. Because participants will be randomly assigned to either a 6-month intervention or an 18-month control condition, the control subjects will also receive assessment measures at the end of their 18-month waiting period in order to measure possible spontaneous changes that would invalidate interpretation of the results.

133,"Background: Primary brain tumors (gliomas) are highly heterogeneous tumors that are often difficult to diagnose accurately with imaging. Identification of biomarkers at diagnosis and during follow-up may aid in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment effectiveness and follow-up monitoring. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive modality that can be used in clinical studies to detect metabolites from tumor tissue which may inform about tumor behavior (e.g. tumor progression or response to treatment). 
Aim of this study / Research question: Our aim is to identify MRS biomarkers in high-grade gliomas that are associated with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p19q codeletion, as surrogates for epigenetic alterations (in particular IDH1 mutation and 1p19q codeletion) and chromosomal aberrations. 
Rationale: IDH mutations have been found to occur mainly in grade II gliomas. The histological classification of gliomas into grade II/III differs from a molecular or genetic perspective. In particular, IDH1 mutation is common in grade II glioma but only present in a small fraction of grade III gliomas (glioblastomas). Also, the 1p19q codeletion, which is the most common molecular alterations in glioblastomas, is present in less than 10% of grade II gliomas. 
By integrating MRS analysis and the results of ex vivo genetic profiling of tumor tissue, we expect to be able to characterize IDH mutation status and 1p19q codeletion with a high accuracy. Moreover, we expect that MRS analysis is capable of detecting IDH-related changes (e.g. altered concentrations of 2-hydroxyglutarate) in glioma tumors. 
Objective: The overall objective of this feasibility study is to further optimize our analysis pipeline for the identification of MRS biomarkers by investigating which MRS biomarkers can be used to reliably classify the molecular and genetic characteristics of gliomas. We will then use these biomarkers to conduct an explorative analysis in a separate cohort. 
Ethics: The study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (reference ID RCB 2018-A02614-52). All volunteers will sign an informed consent form before entering the study.

134,"β-thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by reduced or absent synthesis of beta-globin subunits of hemoglobin. This deficiency leads to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells, resulting in anemia that may require constant monitoring and care. Effective drug therapies, such as hydroxyurea (HU), act to reduce the clinical severity of the disorder. However, long-term therapy with the antifolate agent, folic acid antagonist (FAA) HU, is associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity and increased sensitivity to its effects. As of the study's inception, patients previously enrolled in HU studies were not permitted to receive thalidomide, a drug approved for treating myelodysplastic syndrome with a low risk of bone marrow aplasia. The initial phase of the study involved using monotherapy for HU, during which its efficacy and safety were evaluated. Once the initial therapeutic response was observed, thalidomide was added to the therapeutic regimen. This study aims to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of HU and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of hydroxyurea and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients. The secondary objective is to examine the effect of long-term therapy with the combination therapy on clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters. Furthermore, XmnI polymorphism will be analyzed in response to combination therapy, and the long-term safety of participants in the trial will be evaluated. The study is designed to enroll 30 patients aged 2 to 50 years with a documented clinical and genetic diagnosis of beta-thalassemia major and intermedia who are not candidates for bone marrow transplantation due to their health status or due to the lack of a suitable donor. The study will follow a single-arm approach, with all participants receiving both HU and thalidomide as a result of the initial 6-month monotherapy. After this initial period, 15 patients with good or partial response to HU alone will be randomized to receive a combined regimen of HU and thalidomide for 6 months, while the remaining 15 patients with poor response to hydroxyurea alone will be assigned to receive the same regimen, but their dose will be increased every 30 days instead of every 3 months. Adverse drug reactions will be recorded and analyzed if thalidomide is discontinued. Safety parameters, such as urea and creatinine levels, liver function tests, and measurements of liver and spleen size, will be consistently monitored and recorded throughout the trial. In addition, XmnI polymorphism will be determined among responders, partial responders, or non-responders who have completed 1-year, 2-years, and 3-years of combination therapy. XmnI polymorphism will also be investigated in patients receiving standard hydroxyurea therapy alone, or combined regimen with an intention to include 10 patients from each group."

136,"The primary goal of this project is to develop, implement and test a behavioral treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs). It is our hypothesis that the development of healthy alternative actions through the use of personalized avatars will help enhance prospective thinking and delay discounting, which are often impaired processes in individuals with SUDs.

This study will implement a Virtual Reality (VR) prototype, called the Virtual Reality Avatar (“VR Avatar”), to provide participants with an avatar-based, personalized social environment. In the VR environment each subject’s avatar, which is modeled after their face but is gender neutral, will undergo a series of positive social interactions with the subject. We hypothesize that experiencing a variety of social interactions will help to improve self-reinforcement, increase future time perspective and delay discounting. These changes are predicted to lead to fewer instances of substance use and longer periods of abstinence. In this study, we will investigate whether the VR Avatar intervention will provide effective support in recovery from SUDs. We will examine whether the VR Avatar intervention will (a) lead to reductions in drug use, (b) increase abstinence periods, (c) increase future self-identification, (d) increase future time perspective, (e) improve the ability to resist short-term rewards.

The secondary goal is to develop a novel computer-vision based avatar system that will help to enhance personalized treatment for behavioral disorders through the use of avatar-based social environments. Our approach is unique in that we can analyze the face of an avatar to understand how to adapt treatment protocols in real-time, rather than relying on subjective reports alone, to ensure the social environmental is sufficiently personalized. We will compare the efficacy of our computer-vision based approach to traditional approaches, which utilize more time-intensive manual procedures to generate new treatments. This approach holds promise for making behavioral therapies more cost-efficient, effective and customizable for the individual user. For instance, participants with certain facial features could be provided with personalized treatments to manage negative emotions or to delay the urge to consume drugs. These personalized treatments could be implemented in VR, mobile or video gaming environments.

In this study, we will compare the efficacy of two approaches to delivering the VR Avatar treatment. One of the approaches will utilize a manual avatar creation process (the manual group), while the other will utilize a computer-vision based avatar creation process (the automated group). We expect that the automated group will receive more personalized and responsive treatment than the manual group, leading to better outcomes in reducing drug use, increasing abstinence periods, and changing behavioral risk factors (e.g., impaired self-regulation, prospective temporal processing). We hypothesize that these outcomes will lead to improved outcomes in reducing the risk of relapse and increasing engagement in treatment.

In summary, through this study, we will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that govern changes in prospective thinking, impaired self-regulation, and risk-taking behavior in substance use disorders. We will also examine whether a personalized VR Avatar treatment will lead to improved outcomes in these risk factors, which will provide important insights for the development of more effective and personalized behavioral treatments for substance use disorders. This study will have important implications for the field of substance use disorders and could lead to the development of novel, efficient, and personalized treatments for individuals at risk for relapse."

Prospective Clinical Trial randomization split mouth

Study timeline or schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments
=================
After signing the informed concents, each patient will be subjected to a complete medical history and clinical examination. A full mouth clinical and periodontal examination will be carried out by a trained calibrated examiner using a single standardized protocol. Patients will be subjected to a cone beam computed tomography to assess the alveolar ridge height, and determine the optimal implant length to be placed in the selected site. The CBCT images will be performed by the dentist in the department of prosthodontics, using the iCat System (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, USA). Before implant placement, surgical guides will be fabricated to maintain the accurate surgical orientation for each case. 
A single standardized surgical protocol will be used for all cases. No anti-microbial agents will be used before implant installation.  Antibiotic prophylaxis will be prescribed in each case. Implant stability quotient (ISQ) will be measured immediately following implant placement (insertion torque). The peri-implant soft tissue will be probed for plaque index. In case of a normal ISQ value (ISQ=40), short implants will be used.  However, if a low value is registered (ISQ=<40), a standard implant will be placed under the crest, with an appropriate length of the implant. If the measured depth is <3 mm, the screw will be tightened to the implant collar (25 Ncm), however, in case of a depth ≥3 mm, the implant will be screwed to the first oseo-integration level, to ensure better primary stability for the implant.  The implant will be submerged for 3 to 6 months based on the initial stability score, so as for the proper bone remodeling process.
After the end of the submergence period, a second surgery will be performed and a surgical protocol similar to the first one will be followed. Screw-retained provisional restorations will be installed to obtain early proximal contact.
A follow-up protocol will be applied at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following the second surgical step. At each visit, probing depths will be assessed with a manual probe, the sulcus will be evaluated for the presence of plaque, and implants will be assessed for mobility. Panoramic radiographs will be taken and evaluated for peri-implant bone level changes.
If any implant shows a mobility index ≥2 during the follow-up period, it will be considered a failure case, and a new standard implant will be installed under another bone augmentation technique (maxillary sinus lift).

Intervention
=================
Patients will be subjected to implant placement using various sinus augmentations techniques. The bone augmentation technique will be chosen by the treating dental surgeon according to the amount of bone available before the surgery.

140,"The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial that will allow for the examination of a novel, theory-based, and culturally tailored intervention, namely, African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment (ASSET)-Partners Alleviating Perinatal Depression (PPD). Fathers play a key role in supporting parents in the first two years of the child's life. The goal of the intervention is to increase the father's sense of competency and self-efficacy in supporting the mother's mental health and active engagement in the family to reduce maternal stress. Additionally, we will also evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting ASSET-PPD and collect formative feedback from the fathers and mothers to improve ASSET-PPD and ensure that the needs of the families are met. We plan to enroll 50 parent dyads (100 individuals total, 25 romantic or non-romantic partners per arm). Our study will have 3 phases to assess the feasibility, recruitment, and acceptability of the ASSET-PPD intervention in the target population. During Phase I (Feasibility and Acceptability), we will conduct focus groups to obtain feedback about ASSET-PPD as a delivery format. During Phase II (Recruitment and Satisfaction), we will randomize 25 parent dyads with a mother who is receiving individual treatment outside of the study and the father is receiving the ASSET-PPD training; data collection will occur for 12-months. During Phase III (Clinical Efficacy), we anticipate that ASSET-PPD will reduce maternal depressive symptoms in a sample of 25 parent dyads with a mother who is receiving individual treatment outside of the study and the father is receiving the ASSET-PPD training; data collection will occur for 12-months. Outcomes: Our outcomes of interest include maternal depression, anxiety, parent-infant interactions, and breastfeed initiation. This study has the potential to impact maternal mental health by supporting and strengthening the familial bond between parents and children.

141,"BACKGROUND: Approximately one third of patients with cancer experience depression or depressive symptoms during their disease trajectory. Depression is associated with significant adverse personal, medical, and health systems outcomes. However, psychotherapy and psychoeducation related to depression among patients with cancer are not widely available. Mobile apps have been found to improve depressive symptoms in individuals in general, with positive results for both non-depressed and depressed. METHODS/DESIGN: To address the challenges of disseminating depression treatment to cancer survivors, we propose to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of a proactive digital mental health intervention targeting individuals with depressive symptoms within an academic cancer center. Over 12 months we plan to randomize 80 Illic patients with depressive symptoms to either a control (TAU) or Moodivate (mHealth treatment) group. Participants in both groups will be provided with questionnaires every 2 weeks for three months and monthly for six months in order to track changes in depressive symptoms, physical, psychological, and social wellbeing, and resource use. Participants who are assigned to Moodivate will be asked to use the app at least once per day from baseline (time of enrollment) to 12 weeks from enrollment. Discussion: The study findings will inform the development of effective tools and strategies to provide patients with cancer with accessible digital mental health interventions as a routine part of cancer survivorship care."

Intervention
=================
Intervention in patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with histologically confirmed high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma. They need to be without a treatment plan yet and will be treated with curative intent.
The experimental procedure consists of multidisciplinary tumour board involving STS professionals using PERSARC in treatment advice. In addition, PERSARC will be used in patient consultations where the oncological/orthopaedic surgeon will inform the patients about his/her diagnosis and discuss the benefits and harms of all relevant treatment options. Patients are randomized to either treatment advice with the use of PERSARC (intervention) or with standard treatment advice (control).

Intervention type

Primary outcome measure
=================
Decisional Conflict: Decisional Conflict Scale. 16 items is a) summed, b) divided by 16, and c) multiplied by 25. Scores range from 0(no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict).

Secondary outcome measures
=================
To assess the value of PERSARC in treatment decision making, we used the following secondary outcome measures.
1. Informed choice. Combined outcome incorporating knowledge (self-developed questionnaire), attitudes concerning trade-offs between quality and length of life (QQ_Questionnaire, see below) and treatment decision Items were given a score value of: strongly agree (0) - strongly disagree (4) Total score: 16 items are a) summed, b) divided by 16, and c) multiplied by 25. Knowledge item (SDM-K12) was assigned a score of 0 (incomplete knowledge) or 1 (complete knowledge). Informed choice score Total score range: 0 to 100. 0 point: lowest possible level of SDM.
2. Involvement in treatment decision-making according to patients, SDM-Q-9.
3. Knowledge. Self-developed knowledge questionnaire A knowledge score was considered to reflect adequate decision-relevant knowledge if at least 50% of knowledge statements were correctly answered, which means a knowledge score ≥3 for the present study; no knowledge (0) - high knowledge (6).
4. Satisfaction. Patients and professionals will be individually interviewed (max. 45 minutes).
Part 1: The semi-structured interview guide was based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify factors that influence the ability and motivation of patients and professionals to use PERSARC. The TDF is applicable in various situations that require behavioral change. Part 2: Questions were designed specifically and tailored to the process evaluation. The interviews were analyzed following the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist.
5. Absenteeism/presenteeism costs. To estimate absenteeism cost, the friction cost method was applied, where the first two months are regarded as the friction period and the cost of absenteeism will be calculated based on the assumption that during the second month a patient can be replaced by another. To estimate presenteeism cost, the human capital approach was used, where productivity is measured in lost output rather than in costs in productivity. As a standard, a loss of 5% of productivity is assumed as a result of being sick.
6. Health-related Quality of life. In this study we use PROMIS measures (Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) to assess the impact of extremity soft-tissue sarcoma and its treatments on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The PROM"
145,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) is a non-invasive material that acts as an alternative to direct fillings. This material is still in its evolution phase and has yet to reach a clear statement regarding its safety and acceptability. This study aims to collect enough evidence to support its use in children. METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study was designed to determine the prevalence of early childhood caries, its associated risk factors and to evaluate the acceptability of SDF when used as a caries preventive and arrestive material. A sample of 887 children was selected to estimate the prevalence of early childhood caries, and 159 children were selected to test the efficacy of SDF as a caries preventive and arrestive material. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of early childhood caries (dmfs) was 77.17% and significantly higher in low-income families. The caries incidence score was much higher in the low-income group than in the middle- and high- income groups, while the caries arrest index score was significantly high in the middle- and high- income groups but lower in the low-income group. The acceptability score of SDF application was not significantly different among the different groups. CONCLUSION: Low income families were at a higher risk of having severe early childhood caries whereas middle and high income families were at a higher risk of developing new caries lesions. SDF application was acceptable by almost all parents and SDF was clinically efficient as caries preventive and arrestive agent except for one child. These findings will hopefully allow clinicians to reach out confidently to parents of children with early childhood caries to choose this alternative and potentially cost effective preventive and arrestive material.

154,"As of 2022, the overall prevalence of stroke is 5.2%, making it a serious disease that has become an important social issue. The goal of stroke treatment is to prevent recurrent strokes and improve the quality of life of patients. However, it is difficult to achieve this goal because there is a low survival rate in the severely disabled patient group. Therefore, it is very important to find exercise programs that can improve the functional activities of stroke patients and help them lead more independent lives. In addition, in a community setting, most patients are limited to individual counseling due to the limitations of human resources or facilities, and there is little chance of meeting patients with the same condition, hindering rehabilitation. With the increasing frequency of digital access and the advent of big data analysis technologies, the idea of developing and utilizing a mobile application for stroke exercise programs has been raised. As a result, this study was conducted to develop and quantitatively evaluate community-based complex exercise programs using a mobile application (Stoke App) for stroke patients and to confirm their safety and validity through intervention. This study is designed as a 3x3 mixed design with three study groups and three intervention periods. The study group is divided into a study group that takes part in the complex exercise program (STOKE) and a control group that receives conventional exercise programs (CON). Each patient participates in the complex exercise program for 12 weeks, and the follow-up period is 4 weeks after the intervention.

155,"Study to Assess Adverse Events, Change in Disease Activity and How Oral ABBV-552 Capsules Moves Through the Body of Participants Aged 50 to 90 Years With Mild Alzheimer's Disease.  Mild Alzheimer's disease (mild AD) is a progressive brain disorder.

Patients with mild AD are in the beginning stages of the disease, showing short-term memory loss and trouble completing routine tasks. These patients also may have trouble maintaining social interactions.

At this time, there is no cure for dementia but medications may be able to help with the symptoms.

AbbVie is performing this study to find out whether ABBV-552 is able to treat mild AD.

Researchers are also looking at the number of people with adverse events or side effects. Adverse events are any undesirable experiences from a medical treatment.

The way oral ABBV-552 moves through the body (pharmacokinetics) and what happens to it within the body (pharmacodynamics) will also be measured. Pharmacokinetics includes studies of the rate, extent, and duration of exposure of a drug in the body. Pharmacodynamics includes studies of what a drug does to a human body (for example, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and what it causes to happen in the body (for example, target engagement, binding to receptors, or interaction with molecular targets).

This is an investigational study. ABBV-552 is an investigational medicine, which means that it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans.

The study may take up to 104 weeks for each participant, depending on the participant's individual study schedule. Participation is necessary for the entire duration of the study, unless withdrawn from the study. There will be approximately 40 participants in this study.

All patients will take an active investigational medicine called ABBV-552. The study involves 2 phases. The first phase will consist of a run-in period prior to the starting the double-blind clinical portion of the study. During the run-in period of this study, participants that are taking any prohibited medication will have at least a 12-week run-in period. During this run-in period, the participant will not be on any study medication (placebo). If during this time the participant shows any changes in their disease, they may leave the study. After the run-in period, participants will begin 1 of the 2 study medication period. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either ABBV-552 or placebo; participants, caregivers, and other study staff will be unaware of the assignment. Placebo is an inactive substance that is similar in taste, appearance and packaging as ABBV-552 that has no treatment value. Participants will take study drug (ABBV-552 or placebo) once daily (QD), 1 capsule oraly, each day for 12 weeks. Capsule weights for ABBV-552 Dose A and Dose B have been selected with the goal of delivering similar exposure of ABBV-552 to each dose in this population. The difference in the ABBV-552 Dose C and Dose B and between the ABBV-552 Dose A and Dose C will be small and the ABBV-552 Dose C regimen has therefore been selected to ensure availability of the formulation to reach the recommended dose in any co-existing population for this molecule. The ABBV-552 Dose C regimen may also provide additional information for any eventual further development of ABBV-552, particularly for populations in which high exposure is required or anticipated.

156,"Liver disease is responsible for 1.8 million deaths every year, and it becomes more prevalent over the years with increased life expectancy. The main causes of liver disease and cirrhosis death are viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease. It is estimated that one third of people with liver cirrhosis will develop acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) at some point during their clinical course. Acute liver failure (ALF) is an acute hepatitis of varied etiology, but of which only 60% are viral in origin. Acute liver failure (ALF) is defined as the development of acute hepatic insult associated with high mortality and the rapid development of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks in someone without liver diseases. ACLF is a systemic inflammatory response with clinical, biological and radiologic markers of ACLF. ACLF can be defined as an episode manifested by a rapid worsening of liver disease in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients that leads to organ failure(s). A large number of patients in ICU are suffering from acute liver failure or acute on chronic liver failure, but many of them die without a proper understanding of the causes and mechanisms of their disease. Our aim is to detect the different causes, complications and outcomes in a population of patients with ALF and ACLF admitted to the Intensive care units (ICU). Our hypothesis is that in addition to liver failure, the incidence and prevalence of extra-hepatic multi organ failure among hospitalized patients is high (30%+). Our hypothesis is that in addition to liver failure, the incidence and prevalence of extra-hepatic multi organ failure among hospitalized patients is high (30%+). We also hope to assess the impact of extra-hepatic organ failure and their management on functional outcome and survival in these patients. We expect our multidisciplinary and multicenter work to fill some gaps in the current knowledge about these diseases to enhance our chances in patient's survival and morbidity, and by doing so, offer a more tailored treatment. Our team work hard to make this project possible and accessible to all patients with ALF and ACLF admitted to our hospitals. Every effort will be done to include as many hospitals in Egypt as possible, to represent maximum population, to avoid any sampling or selection bias."

Measurements: the standard of care for cardiac rehabilitation and disease management; the program and the use of an evidence-based tool for improving adherence and self-management; an online questionnaire, filled in by rehabilitated patients at 6-month intervals after discharge for a 1-year period to assess self-management and disease adherence. Results: 78 cardiology patients (aged mean = 65 years, 52% females, with a mean of nine years of education) were included in the program and 11 were non-participants. In total, 74 clinical tests and treatments were performed during 24 visits. After two weeks of intervention, improved self-management and reduced health anxiety were reported by 20 of the 33 participants. No significant differences in self-care behaviours, physical activity and diet were found. Conclusions: The investigators found evidence of improved self-management, reduced health anxiety and reduced symptoms in cardiology patients."

Following study registration, screening, consent, and randomization will occur approximately with patient accrual of 12 months. Participants in both cohorts will start at the same time point on progestin. Approximately 50% of participants will begin the behavioral weight loss intervention at the same time. The other 50% of participants assigned to the behavioral weight loss intervention group will begin the telemedicine-based behavioral weight loss intervention at 1 year. Upon receipt of the study report, findings will be presented at the 2025 Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA. Subsequently, the results will be published in an appropriate scientific journal."
161,"We recently developed a simple but effective laparoscopic technique to approach and ligate the cystic duct in cases of difficult acute cholecystitis. Three to four centimeters of the inflamed gallbladder wall was then cut using an electrocautery hook. An incision was made in a safe zone at the junction of the infundibulum and the body of the gallbladder. The separation between the outer layer and inner layer was searched. This clear identification of the confluence between the cystic duct and the body of the gallbladder represents the way to determine if the procedure was safely completed using the current technique. After successful identification, the cystic duct was clipped. The gallbladder can then be lifted and turned over, leaving the unidentified CBD untouched, and cholecystectomy can be carefully performed as usual. The inflamed posterior wall remained attached to the gallbladder bed of the liver. The results of the procedure in the three initially cases treated showed an easy mobilization of the gallbladder with this method. The cholecystectomies were uneventful in two of them. The third patient had to be converted to open cholecystectomy due to small gallstones trapped within the gallbladder fossa. In general, this technique does not expose the common bile duct to trauma during the procedure, thus avoiding the potential risk of postoperative CBD leak."

With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers have implemented certain precautions in order to protect individuals against viral transmission.

E.g., when a patient is scheduled to meet with clinicians in the clinic, the patient's vital signs (pulse, SPO2, respiratory rate) will be measured in the hallway outside the treatment area. In addition to routine hand washing and wearing surgical masks, 0.3 M hydrogen peroxide will be applied for 3 minutes to all surfaces that may be contaminated by the virus (sensors, door locks, and pens). 
During the meeting, individuals will be instructed to continue wearing surgical masks and to stay 1.5 meters apart from each other.

163,"We have developed a patient-level clinical decision support tool to address this challenge. PT-PENCIL is a statistical model, which uses data from prior patients in an effort to predict discharge status as accurately as possible. The tool is unique because it accounts for daily interactions with the patient, including therapists' daily assessments of the patient's functional ability and the intensity of his or her physical therapy, as well as various disease characteristics. The model provides a single-number statistic that expresses the likelihood and the degree of certainty that a patient will be discharged home. The model can then be integrated with the electronic health record to guide decisions on physical therapist visitation frequency. Our primary goal is to determine whether a change in care-in particular treatment frequency-improves the rate of discharge to home, as defined in the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). A secondary goal is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementation among the treating therapists.

Study Overview

Brief Summary
-----------------
There is a growing concern for late recognition and diagnosis of eating disorders. This applies to all eating disorders, but the research focus has been on Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN), and Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). The results are alarming. Individuals with Eating Disorders are subject to poorer health, poorer education and employment outcomes, more suicidal ideation and greater difficulties re-entering society post treatment. In 2017, the Swedish National Eating Disorders Audit (SNEDA) showed a 350% increase of patients hospitalized for eating disorders from 2006 to 2016. According to the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) over 35 000 people in Sweden suffer from an eating disorder, and 5 % of 18-year-old girls and young women in Sweden show current or lifetime signs of an eating disorder (Fjellman-Wikland, 2018). Despite the increasing numbers of patients suffering from eating disorders, there is a lack of knowledge of the actual care process. Previous studies have studied factors associated with an eating disorder diagnosis, but there is a lack of knowledge surrounding the care process and care perspectives to support recovery. The overall purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of the perspectives and needs of people living with an eating disorder, their relatives and the healthcare staff working with them, and the value of a recovery-based perspective in the treatment of eating disorders. The overall aim of the study is to explore the experiences of patients’ with an eating disorder, that of their relatives and of healthcare professionals working with this patient group and how this affects the patient’s process of recovery. Primary study objectives and methodological approach: The aim is to explore the experiences of patients’ with an eating disorder, that of their relatives and of healthcare professionals working with this patient group and how this affects the patient’s process of recovery. The primary aim will be explored using qualitative methods. All three groups of participants; patients’ with an eating disorder, relatives and healthcare professionals will be included. All participants will be offered one individual interview. There is reason to believe that the results will be applicable to both adults and adolescents who are undergoing treatment due to their eating disorders.

170,"1.	Background and aims.
1.1	Background of the study
Surgical treatment is a routine procedure to provide adequate treatment to patients with spinal diseases. However, the postoperative recovery process is slow, and the incidence of complications such as infection of the surgical site, respiratory failure, delirium, etc. is high. Analgesia is the most effective measure to reduce pain and accelerate the rehabilitation process and recovery after surgery.
In recent years, ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia has achieved good clinical effectiveness and rapid recovery in the postoperative analgesia process. At present, interfascial (IF) block and erector spinae (ESP) plane block are widely used for surgical analgesia in clinical practice. However, few studies have used IF block and ESP block for postoperative analgesia after lumbar spinal surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to compare the clinical analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided lumbar IF block and ESP block for postoperative analgesia after lumbar spinal surgery. Secondly, we will make further recommendations for the implementation of nerve block in the perioperative period.
1.2	Significance 
Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia is a form of regional anesthesia (RA) after the development of nerve stimulation and nerve ultrasound guidance, which can improve the success and safety rate of regional anesthesia. This trial focuses on postoperative lumbar interfascial block and erector spinae plane block in the perioperative period, which is an important part of the anesthesia plan for lumbar spinal fusion surgery.
Although ultrasound-guided nerve block reduces the incidence of intraoperative adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory failure, and so on, but there is lack of evidence to clarify the clinical effects of these three regional analgesia methods. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct relevant research.
2.	Hypothesis
The postoperative analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided lumbar interfascial (IF) block is better than that of ultrasound-guided lumbar erector spinae (ESP) plane block in the perioperative period for patients with lumbar spinal fusion surgery.
2.1	Ethical considerations
This study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki. All research protocols and informed consent were approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of our university(Reference Number 2023-TJ-009).
2.2	Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The criteria for patient inclusion and exclusion were as follows:
(1)	Aged over 18 years old; 
(2)	Patients undergone lumbar spinal fusion surgery due to lumbar degenerative disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar spondylolisthesis; 
(3)	Patients scheduled for elective surgery; 
(4)	Patients with body mass index 18-26kg/m2; 
(5)	Patients who did not use any analgesic drugs, anticoagulants or antiretrovirals in the past 7 days; 
(6)	Patients who signed a written informed consent form.
(1)	Patients taking anticoagulant drugs within a 6-month period; 
(2)	Patients who are allergic to the nerve block drug used in this study; 
(3)	Pregnant women.
2.3	Grouping
Patients who meet the above inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria will be divided into three groups: ESP block group, lumbar IF block group, and control group.
2.4	The anesthesia plan
After entering the operating room, patients in all three groups are all connected with a three-lead electrocardiogram and pulse oximeter. The heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and SpO2 are continuously monitored during anesthesia. After anesthesia induction, the patients in all three groups received muscle relaxation with a non-pump injection of rocuronium 0.6mg / kg.

171,"1:1 randomized, parallel arm, open label, single centre study. Participants will complete a screening visit, and will then be randomized to the study. All participants will complete a 84-hour diary while taking tadalafil. They will then be monitored during a 6-hour period, where blood samples will be drawn for the measurement of biomarker levels.


Text of the Objective(s) of the Study
=================
This is a single centre, parallel arm, open-label, single-site study, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of twice daily tadalafil in healthy male participants.

Who is it for?
=================
Trial participating male participants aged 30 years or older will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment (tadalafil) or placebo.

Where will it take place?
=================
The study will be performed at the study site in New Zealand. Recruitment is planned to begin in August 2022.

When will it start?
=================
Recruitment has commenced, and the study is ongoing.

How will it be designed?
=================
This is a randomized phase I study.

The study is a randomized (2:1 ratio), parallel arm, open label, single-site study, where participants will either receive tadalafil or matched placebo.

How does it work?
=================
Tadalafil will be administered in a dose of 5 mg twice daily. A separate matched placebo will be dosed in a similar manner to the tadalafil. The sequence of participants, in either the tadalafil or the placebo group, will be determined by randomization.

In order to increase the likelihood of achieving the sample size to run the phase II/III trial with a suitable number of participants, 30 participants will be recruited for this phase I trial: 20 participants to receive tadalafil and 10 participants to receive placebo.

What is being tested?
=================
Tadalafil is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of Erectile Dysfunction. It is available as a 5 mg tablet (dose in participants).

Tadalafil is an inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase type five (PDE5) enzyme and has multiple functions in the body including smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilatation. This has been leveraged for erectile dysfunction in men. PDE5 is a widely expressed enzyme in the body, and there are many other effects of its inhibition that researchers aim to harness for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as pulmonary hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer, all of which are known indications for the use of tadalafil.

What does this involve?
=================
Participants will have the following study visits:
•	Screening visit (1-3 weeks prior to start of trial)
•	Trial visit 1 (Day -1)
•	Trial visit 2 (Day 0 - start of trial administration)
•	Trial visit 3 (Day 7)
•	Trial visit 4 (Day 14)
•	Trial visit 5 (Day 28)
•	Trial visit 6 (Day 84)


How long will it last?
=================
Participants will be in the study for 6 hours on 3 occasions (Trial visit 2, 4 & 6).

Who are the participants?
=================
Up to 30 male participants aged 30 years or older will be recruited.

The study entry and safety criteria can be found in the trial protocol in the trial registry: https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12621001686416.

What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
=================
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and PK profile of tadalafil in healthy male participants who are not on blood pressure medication.

Potential risks for the participants include:
•      A low risk of experiencing adverse events while on study drug
•      Risk of experiencing minor discomfort for some procedures e.g. blood draws and nasal swabs
•      Blood pressure measurement

The risks of taking part in the PK component include:

175,"INTRODUCTION: Sleep quality and duration is reduced in critically ill patients and has been associated with poor clinical outcomes [1, 2]. Sleep disturbance is multifactorial and includes both endogenous factors such as circadian disruption and neuroendocrine alterations, and exogenous factors such as invasive devices, sleep environment and environmental noise.
Nocturnal care is essential and recommended for critically ill patients. Moreover, nocturnal care in the ICU is associated with patient agitation and delirium. However, most studies about sleep protection and interventions to reduce noise have been conducted in pediatric patients, and the effectiveness of most interventions in adults remains unclear [3].
EEG-guided protection procedure: An algorithm has been developed from machine learning in healthy volunteer and patients in medical ICU to prioritize sleep  at low risk for the patient. 


Scientific background
-----------------
Studies on sleep quality of hospitalized critically ill patients
Most studies report that critical illness is associated with reduced sleep quality. Indeed, sleep is disrupted by interruptions and caregivers entries or by the environment (light, noise, pain…etc). In some studies patients display poor subjective sleep quality, whereas in others, objective sleep quality is affected with a high number of arousals [4, 5]. Other studies using EEG, demonstrated that a severe decrease in sleep quality is present and appears early after admission [6, 7].
The prevalence of delirium during critical illness may exceed 80 % in some populations [8].  It also has been established that sleep deprivation may be a risk factor for delirium [9]. Some studies suggest that sleep disruption, defined as prolonged arousal, also was a risk factor in critically ill patients for delirium [10, 11]. 
Impact of sleep disruption on outcomes: 
The poor sleep quality experienced by ICU patients may impair ventilator weaning and extubation success rate. 
The impact of sleep quality on mortality is also poorly known. Two post-hoc meta-analyses demonstrated that shorter sleep duration was associated with a higher mortality risk in intensive care unit (ICU) (RR 1.58 , CI : 1.06 -2.35 ). However, these results were derived from a small sample from studies which were conducted in the 90s .


Impact of noise on the patient
Nocturnal noise in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a common complaint of both patient and staff . Noise in the ICU has been correlated with a delayed recovery of sleep and a higher incidence of critical illness myopathy . 
The impact of noise on critical illness myopathy in ICU is poorly investigated but some randomized trial suggest that noise may increase the severity and delay the recovery of this disease .


Impact of noise on healthcare professionals
Nocturnal noise and sleep disruption have also had a profound negative influence on nursing and physicians’ health. As an example, a 62% lower risk of hearing loss was found in ICU nurses who reported to work less than two or 3 nights per week, versus those who reported to work 4 or more nights per week . A cross-sectional survey of 650 physicians in 78 intensive care units has found that almost 50% of physicians reported that they experienced stress when caring for critically ill, mechanically ventilated, patients in intensive care unit (ICU) . Therefore, there is a critical need for strategies to protect caregivers’ and patients’ rest.


Innovation
Based on previous data collected in healthy volunteers, we developed an algorithm from machine learning that can predict sleep disruption during night. This algorithm use the electroencephalography (EEG) of the patients to estimate the risk of sleep disruption. A previous study has demonstrated that patients presenting with a high risk of sleep disruption can be identified from EEG prior to the occurrence of any discontinuity of sleep. The risk assessment has been validated in two groups of patients (with and without sedation). This is a major innovation because the study showed the feasibility of sleep protection with the EEG of the patients and this study also assessed the feasibility of sleep measurements in real life conditions. It was the first study to combine sleep measurement with EEG.
Our objective is to implement this innovative diagnostic procedure on the bedside of critically ill patients to perform an EEG-guided sleep protection.

178,"1. Research objectives: Endocalyx is a seaweed derived dietary supplement aimed at restoring a healthy glycocalyx layer on the endothelium which has been shown to be impaired in chronic heart failure. The first aim of the project is to evaluate whether daily intake of Endocalyx will restore a healthy glycocalyx in heart failure patients. The second aim is to evaluate whether Endocalyx will reduce clinical symptoms of sodium overload in patients with chronic heart failure. The third aim is to evaluate how Endocalyx modulates the glycocalyx in heart failure patients.
2. Background information: Chronic heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by reduced cardiac output and blood flow, leading to excessive fluid accumulation, and reduced blood flow to tissues and organs, including brain, skin, and kidneys.(1, 2) In patients with congestive heart failure, sodium and water excess develop. Sodium accumulates in heart failure patients due to an imbalance between renal sodium excretion and dietary sodium intake, and subsequent increased sodium levels in blood. This has several pathophysiological and structural manifestations; for instance, in heart failure patients the renal sodium leak and endothelial dysfunction increases, contributing to a further reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). As a result, the sodium and water retention worsens.
3. Significance of the research: Endocalyx is a dietary supplement developed to restore a healthy glycocalyx layer on the endothelium. Glycocalyx is the protective coat of endothelial cells that is known for several beneficial biological functions; (i) glycocalyx plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and vascular function. A healthy glycocalyx layer is important for endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) production. NO regulates sodium and water excretion and the peripheral vasculature; (ii) glycocalyx regulates sodium and water retention, and controls immune function and inflammation. As a result, a healthy glycocalyx layer may help to improve (or prevent) endothelial dysfunction, heart failure-related sodium overload, reduced GFR and inflammation. Heart failure-related sodium overload and inflammation contribute to the worsening of cardiac, kidney and skin function which are hallmarks of HF.
4. Proposed scientific solutions: We expect Endocalyx to exert beneficial effects on the glycocalyx in patients with chronic heart failure. The primary objective of the study is therefore to evaluate whether daily administration of Endocalyx for 8 weeks will restore a healthy glycocalyx in heart failure patients. The secondary objective is to evaluate whether daily administration of Endocalyx will reduce clinical symptoms of sodium overload including peripheral edema, hypertension and a reduced compliance. The tertiary objective is to evaluate how Endocalyx modulates the glycocalyx in heart failure patients.
6. Ethics: The research protocol was approuved by the METC of the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium on 20 November 2017 (S62132). The study adheres to the principles of Good Clinical Practice (2017) (GCP) and was written in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH E6 guideline “Good Clinical Practice,” the principles of the FCP and all applicable regulatory and national requirements relating to the use of investigational products and device in humans."
179,"Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) is common in the postoperative period, with an incidence rates of up to 7% in some surgical centers. It is characterized as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting in patients who have undergone a prior abdominal operation. Early diagnosis and treatment is important since delayed diagnosis and treatment are strongly associated with longer length of stay (LOS) and increased morbidity. Treatment consists of supportive care (fluid resuscitation, analgesia) with correction of electrolyte abnormalities as needed. Nasogastric tube placement in patients suspected to have SBO is recommended to prevent gastric distention. A 38ml nasogastric tube (NG tube) is inserted following infiltration of local anesthetics with or without sedation. The NG tube can be used to decompress the stomach and small bowel, which increases patient comfort. The NG tube has also been used to administer oral agents (pregabalin, ondansetron, dexamethasone) and medications such as water-soluble contrast and metoclopramide. However, routine use of water-soluble contrast (WSC) and metoclopramide is not standard of care and has been studied in few small studies with mixed results. WSC is used to obtain the necessary contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) image to confirm presence of an abnormality responsible for bowel obstruction. By obtaining the information of which area of bowel is obstructed, the operator may be guided to perform a more conservative incision for the treatment of the SBO. Metoclopramide increases motility by a variety of mechanisms and helps reduce symptoms of obstruction (nausea and vomiting). This study aims to identify the role of NGT and water-soluble contrast in patients with clinically suspected SBO."

187,"Background: High DNA fragmentation (DFI) is a predictor when planning in vitro fertilization.  Mild treatment or testicular sperm extraction might potentially improve the results in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation, since they usually have poor semen features and retrieval of sperm through testicular aspiration is beneficial for successful fertilization.  Objective of the study: The aim of the study is to compare clinical outcomes between testicular sperm aspiration (TESA)-ICSI and microfluidic sperm separation device (Zymot) - ICSI (MSS-ICSI), using fresh ejaculate (TE) from men with high sperm DNA fragmentation.  Study Design: TESA-ICSI group will consist of couples who were recruited to the study by our center to receive a fresh ICSI cycle.  Zymot-ICSI groupwill included patients using the microfluidic device for selecting sperm with lower DNA fragmentation that were undergoing a ICSI cycle. Zymot device extract sperm with motility and low DNA fragmentation, resulting in better outcome compare to TESA-ICSI.  Study Population/ Sample Size: TESA-ICSI will consist of 34 couples; minimum of 150 embryos will be transferred in fresh and frozen cycles. Zymot-ICSI will consist of 34 couples, minimum of 200 embryos will be transferred in fresh and frozen cycles.  Study Time: Couples who completed a TESA-ICSI or Zymot-ICSI cycle in our center within six years before the study was initiated were included in the study. Primary Outcome Measures: The primary outcome in our study is clinical pregnancy rate comparing between TE using TESA-ICSI vs. Zymot-ICSI.  Secondary Outcome Measures: the secondary outcomes are number of retrieved spermatozoon, average number of cryopreserved embryos, total number of embryos transferred (fresh / frozen)  and implantation and miscarriage rates  Comparison to Existing Literature: Existing literature comparing clinical pregnancy rates and implantation rates utilizing Zymot device is presented in the section entitled “Comparison to Existing Literature.” There is limited data published regarding clinical outcomes of patients with high DNA fragmentation receiving either TESA-ICSI or Zymot-ICSI and comparing between the two outcomes.  Theoretical Significance: The study results will enable us to reach the right decision regarding the most successful treatment option for couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation."

Input Text: The Effect of Adenosine A2a Receptor Antagonism on Brain Connectivity

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a commonly used and safe anti-parkinson medication - caffeine - on resting state brain connectivity. The drug used in this study (istradefylline) has been prescribed off-label for years to individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and recently was approved as a PD medication as the first medication shown to affect and slow progression of this disease. However, as with any drug of this type, it is important to characterize the potential side effect as it relates to its main targets of receptors that affect movement. The PD medication (istardefylline) we propose to study, works at some of the same systems as caffeine (e.g., adenosine and dopamine receptors). Therefore, the study of caffeine can help inform our understanding of the PD drug (istardefylline) and its potential side effects.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Elderly individuals, such as those over age 80, are commonly exposed to both caffeine and istradefylline as the two treatments are routinely prescribed to manage different conditions affecting movement. In contrast to healthy young adults, older adults exhibit significant age-related decline in cognitive, perceptual, and motor performance, including a decrease in the ability to maintain attention to multiple tasks over a period of time without significant degradation in overall performance. This deficit in selective attention is likely, at least in part, due to a decline in the ability of older adults to maintain synchronized, coordinated neural activity in the face of challenging multi-tasking conditions. This deficit makes older adults particularly susceptible to adverse outcomes associated with both multi-tasking and sleep deprivation, as these conditions require an individual to maintain selective attention for long periods of time despite increased demands on sensory systems and a need to maintain adequate levels of alertness. Given that individuals commonly take medications (e.g., caffeine and istradefylline) to compensate for symptoms of diminished alertness and sleep-deprivation, it's important to determine the impact of these medications on individual performance and the integrity of their neural systems. Specifically, the investigators propose to determine the effects of caffeine on selective attention in older adults by measuring brain connectivity and its association with performance both at rest and during a difficult multi-modal attention task.

We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized study to evaluate the effect of the addition of a 12-hour preoperative regimen of intravenous albuterol and ipratropium on the incidence of PPCs in patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery for cancer. We are planning to perform this trial again, using the same protocol, at our institution. Research Questions: Can we further reduce the incidence of PPCs after laparoscopic or open gastrectomy or pancreatic surgery by adding this IV regimen to that prescribed by the Surgeon General of the United States Army? Methods: Prospective, double-blinded, randomized study using 12-hour preoperative regimen of intravenous albuterol and ipratropium versus no preoperative prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrectomy or pancreatic surgery for cancer. The investigators hypothesize that the 12-hour preoperative intravenous regimen of albuterol and ipratropium will reduce the incidence of PPCs in patients undergoing laparoscopic or open gastrectomy or pancreatic surgery for cancer. Design: Single center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized study. The investigators will randomize 100 patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery for cancer who are scheduled to begin their general anesthesia within 60 minutes of initial arrival to the preoperative holding area to the 12-hour preoperative IV regimen containing albuterol and ipratropium or to no preoperative prophylaxis. The statistical analysis plan includes an interim analysis after enrollment of forty patients with type1 error protection using the O'Brien-Fleming method. The investigators anticipate enrollment of 96 patients. Study Population/Participants/Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: The investigators will include only patients undergoing inhaler surgery for cancer who are scheduled to begin their general anesthesia within 60 minutes of initial arrival to the preoperative holding area. The investigators will exclude patients with any of the following clinical characteristics: Age<18 years (or a pediatric airway); Any known or documented preoperative respiratory complicating condition, e.g., severe bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, etc.; Known or documented active smoking, i.e., smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day for the last 3 years within 6 months of enrollment; BMI >35kg/m2; Patients receiving chronic prednisone therapy (defined as prednisone 10mg/day or more for the last 6 months); Use of antibiotics within 7 days prior to surgery; Pre-existing neurological disease with significant sensorimotor changes; Chronic pain syndrome not previously diagnosed; Psychiatric disorder precluding compliance with study requirements; Cardiovascular disease defined as: 1) symptomatic coronary artery disease, 2) symptomatic heart failure, 3) symptomatic cardiomyopathy due to alcoholism, or 4) hemodynamically significant symptomatic aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation; Pre-operative hematocrit of <30%; Pre-operative platelet count of <100,000/mm3; Pre-existing liver disease with hepatic failure; Pre-existing renal disease Stage 3, 4 or 5 with creatinine clearance of <40mL/min; Participation in another interventional clinical"
191,"281 patients with newly diagnosed colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESMD) will be included at the Department of Endoscopy. The aim is to compare 1 year DFS between the patients treated by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) vs. total mesorectal excision (TME), in the case of superficial (pT1) mucinous rectal cancer. The primary endpoint is 1-year DFS rate, measured by colonoscopy. Secondary endpoints include post-operative complications and post-operative quality of life score 6- and 12-month after the surgical procedure.

194,"Background and aims: Recent reviews show that dietary nitrate supplementation offers little additional benefit beyond aerobic training for improving endurance performance, but data on the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation on short-term, high-power/high-velocity exercise performance is lacking. The present study plans to determine the dose-response effect of beetroot juice supplementation on resistance exercise performance. Furthermore, changes to neuromuscular performance parameters measured by countermovement jump and isokinetic knee-extension assessments will be explored during various beetroot juice supplementation dosage protocols. Materials and methods: This study will use a randomized, double-blind design to assess high nitrate dosage, moderate nitrate dosage and low nitrate dosage. In total, forty resistance trained men (age 30±7, stature 177cm±5.5cm, body mass 77±7.5kg±8.2%) will participate in this investigation. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four experimental trials. Participants will refrain from caffeine, sodium bicarbonate, creatine, beta-alanine and/or NO precursors for 48 hours prior to and 24 hours after exercise testing. Plasma nitrite and nitrate concentrations will be used to assess nitrate metabolism. Neuromuscular performance parameters measured during countermovement jumps and isokinetic knee-extension will be assessed during various levels of nitrate supplementation and assessed prior to intervention. Statistical analyses will be conducted with the use of a threeway (nitrate dose x trial x condition) ANCOVA. Results will be adjusted using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons and reported as mean±s.d., unless otherwise indicated. The significance level will be set to p<0.05 with no adjustments being made for false discovery. Trial status: Screening has begun.

In adult patients undergoing general anesthesia during major surgical operations, higher patient exposure to ventilation as measured by higher mechanical power; it has been shown that it is associated with an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications and acute respiratory failure in the first 7 days of the postoperative period. In the results obtained in the published studies; increased mechanical strength has been associated with increased in-hospital mortality and higher hospital stay and higher ICU follow-up requirement."
196,The aim of this study is to use a 3D-MRI technique as an alternative in order to save the exposition of radiation with low-dose CBCT. This is a cross-sectional observational study. The data from the MRS and CBCT will be compared to assess the measurement characteristics.
197,"Dental plaque is the primary cause of dental caries and gingivitis in children. Orthodontic appliances, poor oral hygiene habits, and malocclusion have an important effect in keeping dental plaque and in causing oral health problems. In addition, the oral problems associated with these disorders are also associated with other systemic problems. The evaluation of children's plaque removal efficacy has become one of the most important issues in modern dentistry. Plaque removal by children is as important as proper and continuous oral care is by their parents. Children with special health care needs are more likely to experience systemic, social, and emotional problems. In children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), these problems may arise. Many studies emphasize that regular oral care should be ensured during the early life period. Because the period when the first permanent molars erupt is the most important period for children when it comes to maintaining the structure of the dental arch and controlling dental caries. It has been reported in the literature that many children who suffer from dental caries also have ADHD. Children with special health care needs tend to have more oral health problems. Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common and complex behavioral and developmental disorders that increase children's risk of oral health problems. Orthodontic appliances increase the prevalence of dental plaque and impair oral hygiene. Considering all these situations, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of children's brushing habits with electric and manual toothbrushes in patients with and without ADHD."
198,"1. General description of the treatment or care provided: An unmet metabolic care need exists for persons with obesity. Evidence shows that persons with obesity are 5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared with normal-weight individuals and people with obesity spend on average $1500 more per year on chronic diseases and related treatments, compared with people with a healthy weight. People with obesity experience numerous barriers to effective management of their weight and underlying comorbidities. Effective treatments to support these patients, in particular those people who are overweight, need to be both effective and easily accessible, and to accommodate their other health priorities and other life priorities. Current treatment models that support people with obesity to manage their condition are based primarily on in-person contact. These approaches include a variety of lifestyle-based interventions that have been demonstrated to induce reductions in weight and improvements in comorbid conditions in people with obesity. These lifestyle interventions can be highly effective and are well-tolerated in motivated individuals, however, many people with obesity have difficulties sustaining these changes because current lifestyle interventions require individuals to have a high level of intrinsic motivation. Individuals also often need practical and emotional support to implement changes within their complex lifestyle contexts and to maintain these changes over time. Furthermore, given the substantial number of individuals with obesity, it is challenging for lifestyle interventions to be accessible and affordable to all persons in need. The overall goal of this project is to enhance the metabolic care of people with obesity by establishing an accessible, scalable, and high-quality metabolic care model. Metaplan will accomplish this goal through an iterative development process that combines (i) the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), (ii) behavioural science theories to optimize treatment personalization, and (iii) rapid cycle evaluation methods for continuous improvement. This collaborative project consists of six participating centres: the Obesity Centre of British Columbia (Obesity Centre), the Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control (Centre), the Centre for Health Evaluation & Outcome Sciences (CHÉOS) (CHÉOS), the Institute for Health Economics (IHE), the Centre for Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis Research & Management (CHKOR) (CHKOR), the Institute of Health Research at the Faculty of Medicine (IHRe FM), and the Centre for Community Research (Centre). The Centre is affiliated with both the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Health Sciences. (ii) the Centre for Clinical Research and the School of Public Health (Centre). The IHE is located on the campus of the Simon Fraser University (SFU). (iii) IHE is affiliated with both the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Applied Sciences). (iv) CHKOR is a research centre at Simon Fraser University (SFU). (v) IHRe FM located on SFU's campus. (vi) Centre is located on the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) campus.
2. The nature of the health condition of the subjects/patients/population: People living with obesity have experienced, or are at risk of experiencing, one or more health complications, including cardiovascular problems, sleep apnea, depression, and cancer. A recent Canadian community-based study found that one-in-three people living with obesity experienced at least one obesity-related cancer, compared with people with a healthy weight. Furthermore, people with obesity often struggle with other chronic diseases and mental health issues. It is estimated that over half of Canadian adults with obesity are living with one or more comorbid chronic diseases. The economic cost of obesity is also high for individuals and for society. Canadian adults with obesity spend on average $1,500 more per year on medical services and on prescription drugs compared with people with a healthy weight. Together, these health consequences and financial burdens place people with obesity at risk of poorer health and quality of life outcomes and poorer financial outcomes. For people with obesity, there often exists a substantial gap between their unmet care needs and the current metabolic care that is available to them.
People living with obesity often experience a range of societal barriers such as the stigma associated with being seen having an appointment for ""excessive"" weight. These social factors contribute to the difficulties people experience when accessing healthcare services for obesity and in sustaining weight loss. The goal of this project is to address these unmet care needs by providing people living with obesity with a tailored care plan that meets their specific health and social needs.

202,"BACKGROUND: 
-----------------
The investigators' goal in this project is to determine if a nutritional intervention could counteract and reverse cancer cachexia.  To do so, patients will be randomized in two arms. One arm will receive a nutritional intervention (provided by a food company)  in addition to the standard of care anticancer therapy, while the other arm will not receive nutritional intervention in addition to standard of care therapy. 

 
Study design: 
----------------
Study design is an open-label, randomized controlled trial.  This study was initially designed to have a standard of care chemotherapy arm (Paclitaxel and Carboplatin) in addition to a control arm without nutritional intervention.  Enrollment did not demonstrate adequate accrual.  As a result, at this time the study is being amended to an observational study design only in participants receiving anti-PDL1 therapy. Participants with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC who are >18 years of age and who have not received prior systemic therapy treatment for advanced NSCLC will be enrolled.  At the time of recruitment, participants will be randomized to receive either the nutritional intervention or standard of care therapy without nutritional intervention.  All participants will undergo standard of care anticancer therapy.  The nutritional intervention arm will receive 2 bottles of protein/carbohydrate enriched beverage product for 12 weeks in addition to anticancer therapy.  The standard of care arm will only undergo anticancer therapy.  In order to standardize outcomes, the investigators will use standard of care laboratory assays to evaluate the clinical outcomes in each arm of the study by comparing baseline value measurements to post-study value measurements.  As participants will be observed but not randomized, there is the possibility of confounding bias. 

 
Objective: 
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of this nutritional intervention by evaluating patient recruitment, adherence, and compliance. 

 
Eligibility: 
-----------------
Inclusion Criteria: 
1. Subjects must be > 18 years of age.

208,"23andme is dedicated to helping people gain a better understanding of themselves by providing insight into their genetics. 23andMe empowers individuals to take control of their health and wellness through DNA research and personalized DNA reports.

Background
-----------------
Individuals are interested in learning about their genetic risk for a broad range of conditions and diseases, and have access to the genetic information through a personal genome (PG). With the advent of technology and innovation there is an increased interest in PG research, which enables individuals to learn and interpret important medical and health information about themselves. In fact, it has been noted that PG reports will be a cornerstone of medical decisions in the future. In addition, the cost of genetic testing has significantly decreased over the past few years, which makes it affordable and accessible for a large portion of the population. While 23andMe may not be able to offer definitive answers regarding a person’s genetic predisposition to a particular condition, they can provide important information that will guide a person’s approach towards understanding their risk, as well as informing conversations with their physicians. This type of information can be used to empower individuals with more knowledge about their personal genetic risks, which also has an effect on the decision to follow preventative health measures, such as getting tested and seeing a medical professional. 23andMe has an important place in the genetics industry, for providing individuals with information about their genetic predispositions at a very low cost, and in the medical industry, as PG reports may be useful to physicians, as well as individuals. To enable this goal more effectively, it may be beneficial for patients to receive information from their physicians in addition to PG reports.
In order for the information provided by 23andMe to be more useful to patients, it is necessary to consider whether they will make lifestyle changes in response to PG test results. Since 23andMe provides an opportunity to receive information about genetic predispositions and risks for a broad spectrum of condition and disease, it is necessary to assess whether individuals will be motivated to follow preventative measures. A PG report may be informative in prompting a discussion between a patient and physician regarding genetic risk for conditions and diseases, motivating a person to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and even informing physician treatment practices. 
It appears that the information provided by 23andMe is useful to the patients who receive PG test results. In fact, PG tests seem to be useful for patients who are otherwise in the dark about their susceptibility to developing a particular condition or disease, since it provides them with an opportunity to know more about themselves, and to take control of their genetic information and health. Since PG reports provide an opportunity to inform doctors, other patients, and family members, it is imperative that a PG test is used appropriately since it can be a powerful tool for improving the health of an individual, as well as their quality of life."
209,"This study is a community-based participatory study to prevent developmental delays and psychopathology in refugee children. The investigators will employ a previously described model of Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI) together with Culturally and linguistically approved refugee parenting curriculums in a culturally and linguistically appropriate refugee community in Tijuana, Mexico. By involving parents as partners in the program delivery and modification, the investigators aim to generate a culturally tailored mental health intervention for refugee families in Tijuana. This will allow immediate dissemination throughout the refugee community, and the investigators further aim to test this program on a larger scale with future funding.

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
This is an international, randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical study. Pixantrone (100 mg/m2) or a dose-intensive treatment regimen (either 360 mg/m2 prednisolone equivalent on day 1 of each cycle or 100 mg/m2 prednisolone equivalent on days 1-3 of each cycle given during alternating 28-day cycles) will be administered on days 1-5 and 35-39 of a 56 day cycle without concomitant anthracycline therapy for at least 4 cycles to patients with newly-diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The study will assess toxicity, disease-free survival rate, overall response rate, event free survival, and overall survival.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a variety of other malignancies have responded favorably to pixantrone in combination with various anti-tumor agents. This multi-center study tests the hypothesis that pixantrone in place of conventional 4 (or more) cycles of anthracyclines can reduce cardiac toxicity without compromising overall cure rates. 27 centers outside the United States will treat 160 newly diagnosed children with ALL or NHL using a dose intensive regimen based on pixantrone without anthracyclines. Patients randomized to arm A will receive the following on days 1-5 and again on days 35-39 of each cycle (all in a 56 day cycle): (in mg/m2): pixantrone (100) or prednisolone equivalent (360). Chemotherapy will be stratified by disease (either ALL or NHL) and protocol. Treatment will continue for at least 4 cycles (up to 58 cycles). Patients randomized to arm B will receive the following on day 1 of each cycle (all in a 56 day cycle): (in mg/m2) pixantrone (100) or prednisolone equivalent (100) and receive 10 doses of cyclophosphamide (450). Chemotherapy will be stratified by disease (either ALL or NHL) and protocol. Treatment will continue for at least 8 cycles (up to 17 cycles).

210,30+ patients+ carers will be interviewed about their experiences of care for HNC.
211,"Endoscopic spinal surgery for lumbar disc herniation is a minimally invasive spinal surgery technique, which has some disadvantages such as limited field of view, low success rate of nerve root identification, and risk of severe nerve root injury. At present, the clinical application of near-infrared fluorescence imaging technology in the treatment of spinal diseases is increasing. ICG intraoperative tumor detection in recent years is still limited to the field of brain surgery. In this study, endoscopic spinal surgery is selected as the research field, and the research will be conducted on the application of ICG near-infrared fluorescence imaging technology in the identification of lumbar nerve roots."
212,"40% of people with IDDs have at least one child in the age group 0-9 years and many parents struggle with the demands of parenting. Many parents with IDDs lack social support and are not able to gain knowledge on how to be good parents. Without appropriate support, parents may start to lose trust in their own abilities, becoming less responsive and more controlling in their parenting behaviour. Poor parenting may, in turn, lead to behavioural and psychological problems in the children, which in turn further undermines the parents' ability to respond and show affection to the children. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of the Home-based Parenting Support Program for Parents With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities When There is a Risk for Neglect - called ""Parenting Young Children"" (PYC) - on parents' parent management skills and sense of competence during one year of intervention and after discontinuation of the support."
213,"Male post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence is a frequent, distressing, and debilitating problem that negatively impacts the sexual and social functions of these patients. Urinary incontinence of any kind can have a substantial impact on a person's ability to work and socialize and can result in low quality of life. Therefore, male patients requiring radical prostatectomy for urological cancers or benign prostatic hypertrophy are subject to additional distressing of post-surgical urinary incontinence. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the surgical technique of implantation of artificial urinary sphincter and sling on quality of life, general and specific post-operative adverse events. In addition the time of being continent and revision-free will be evaluated. Patients will fill in several validated questionnaires (EuroQol Group EQ-5D-5L,  International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire UI SF, Sexual Complaints Screener for Men (SCS-M), the Dyadic Adjustment Scale Italian version, the International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) before the operation, at 12 weeks after surgery and at yearly intervals up to and including year 5."
214,"68Ga-NOTA-H006 is a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for 5T4. The purpose of this study is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-NOTA-H006 PET in diagnosing pancreatic cancer using pathological specimens, and to observe the change of SUV in different tissues, so as to investigate its tumor targeting ability in the clinic. The secondary objective is to assess 68Ga-NOTA-H006 PET in the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer using pathological specimens."
215,"The purpose of this study is to improve the diagnostics and therapeutic outcome in heart failure. Heart failure is the main cause of hospitalization among elderly people and the treatment is demanding. The most common cause of heart failure is heart muscle damage following a heart attack. It happens that the heart muscle still has a significant capacity to repair itself despite being severely damaged. This usually happens when the heart fails to restore a coordinated contraction in all its components. The failure to restore this contractile coordination in all ventricular wall parts results in ineffective and poorly coordinated contraction. It has been shown that there is electrical dyssynchrony between the individual parts of heart muscle cells and that it can be corrected with cardiac resynchronisation therapy, CRT. To achieve a good clinical result with resynchronisation therapy it is important that the patient has both a poor cardiac function and an electrical dyssynchrony. The present study investigates biomarkers that may help predict the optimal patient for CRT."
216,"With current recommended medications for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), it is well accepted that the most important cause of death and hospitalization is related to progressive myocardial fibrosis, resulting in myocardial hypertrophy and progressive congestion, which ultimately leads to ventricular remodeling and eventually an increase in size, leading to heart failure. Therefore, current treatments for HFrEF focus on inhibiting the renin angiotensin system (RAS), preventing the development of hypertension, and increasing the ejection fraction.However, in practice, not all patients with HFrEF can tolerate or benefit from recommended therapies, and many patients with HFrEF are intolerant to GDMT. The goal of this study is to explore the relationship between baseline ejection fraction and intolerance to GDMT and to explore the prognosis of heart failure hospitalization in patients who are intolerant to GDMT. In addition, this trial evaluates the effect and safety of GDMT on the change of biomarkers of myocardial fibrosis with high specificity and sensitivity, such as natriuretic peptides and troponins, changes in left ventricular function, and changes in ejection fraction in HFrEF patients."
217,"100 patients who are beginning new lines of cancer therapy will be randomized to (1) usual practice or (2) remote PRO monitoring plus real-time, clinician-driven responses to severe symptoms (i.e., triage nurse support). Usual practice involves encounter-based PRO monitoring, which is commonly adopted in real-world settings. In this arm, we will compare usual practice alone and usual practice plus triage nurse support. This arm will provide a real-world measure of the marginal effectiveness of clinician-driven triage nurse responses in patients who report severe symptoms. Remote PRO monitoring will occur weekly via REDCap and will be de-linked from clinical encounters. In arm 2, we will compare the impact of encounter-based monitoring vs remote PRO monitoring via weekly telephone calls. This arm explores an alternative method of PRO monitoring in patients who cannot come to the clinic for on-site visits, thereby improving real-world accessibility. Across all study arms, we will compare PRO adherence between non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, and Black subgroups. This trial will lay the groundwork for a large-scale pragmatic randomized controlled trial that will ultimately evaluate the effect of behavioral economic strategies on PRO adherence and subsequent symptom management in patients receiving active cancer treatment."
218,"Aims: The ESC team at UCLH is embedded within the oncology outpatient service, providing symptom management and Advanced Care Planning to patients with advanced cancer. The investigators primary aim is to better understand the level of prognostic awareness and its associated factors in patients referred to the ESC service. A secondary aim is to explore factors that are associated with levels of psychological distress, perception of quality of care and trust in healthcare professionals. Patient population: Patients with advanced cancer referred to the ESC service will be eligible. Patient will be asked to fill-in a questionnaire on prognostic understanding and related factors. Sample size: The investigators aim to include 100 patients. Endpoints: The primary outcome is patients' prognostic understanding. This will be assessed by the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire, which was previously developed to measure patients' level of prognostic understanding. The questionnaire focuses on assessing different aspects that may influence patients' understanding of curability, including the perceived likelihood of cure, the preference to receive prognostic information, and the perceived helpfulness of knowing. In addition, the questionnaire collects patients' current demographics and will also include questions about patients' preferences for receiving prognostic information and the perceived helpfulness of knowing about their disease prognosis. Further, patients will be asked how they perceive their quality of care. The questionnaire will take 15-20 minutes to complete. Secondary outcomes will include patients' levels of psychological distress (measured by the PHQ-2 and the GAD-2), health-related quality of life (measured by the EQ5D) and patients´ trust in healthcare professionals (measured by the Trust in Physicians Scale and the Quality of Patient-Doctor Communications Questionnaire). This study is funded by the Rita and John Cornfeld Foundation."
219,"Background: Early and accurate detection of bacteria that are likely to contribute to severe infection is a critical need for the care of patients with sepsis. Traditional techniques for bacteria detection from blood (or “culture”) are known as time-consuming (generally >2 days), costly, not widely available, and have a high rate of false-negative results. The T2Bacteria® Panel is a novel molecular test which can identify bacteria from a simple blood draw with results available to clinicians within a few hours. The test is simple and can be run on any blood sample that is sent to the laboratory for culture (typically the first blood draw a patient receives after arrival in the emergency room). It is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized test of its kind. This study will evaluate whether the T2Bacteria® Panel can potentially reduce time to initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, thereby achieving better patient outcomes. Methods: This prospective, multi-center pragmatic randomized controlled trial will include 2500 adult patients across six emergency departments in the United States. Upon arrival to the emergency department, patients will have a blood sample drawn for conventional blood culture (taken to the laboratory according to routine protocol) and for the investigational study. Patients will also receive 1 gram intravenous of vancomycin which is the standard therapy used while cultures are pending. Blood draws for the study will also occur at 18, 24, 42, 60, and 72 hours after the first blood draw, although testing may be stopped by the patients treating physician at any time at the physicians discretion. Study participants will then be randomized to either the control (usual care) group, or to the investigational group who will receive an in-house alert 2.5 hours after the first blood draw indicating a positive screening test result for a suspected bacterium from the T2Bacteria® Panel. The alert may be suppressed by the patient’s treating physician or lab team. Results: We believe that this study will have the potential to significantly impact clinical care. The T2Bacteria® Panel promises to be a powerful test for clinicians in the emergency department. The availability of direct-from-blood testing results could make vancomycin prescribing decisions simpler and more data-driven. The T2Bacteria® Panel also offers the ability to test for a larger variety of bacteria with more nuanced identification of antibiotic resistance. This may help clinicians in the emergency department avoid unnecessary incomplete or complete drug holidays for patients in whom vancomycin may be an appropriate therapy. This improved clinical decision-making around vancomycin therapy may lead to a reduction in treatment-related antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity through earlier initiation of potentially effective agents in patients with bloodstream infection. The impact of reduced antimicrobial exposures on antimicrobial resistance and on the economic burden of healthcare-associated infections will also be assessed. Data Collected: In addition to time-to-treatment and vancomycin use, the study will investigate potential outcomes of 7-day mortality, 28-day mortality, and hospital length-of-stay. Antimicrobial use will be evaluated as will occurrences of acute kidney injury in patients receiving vancomycin. Data will be collected for patients from enrollment through their index treatment episode. Trial Design: A prospective, multi-center pragmatic randomized controlled trial will be used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of direct-from-blood bacterial testing for clinical decision making in the emergency department. Randomization: Patients will be randomized at a rate of 75% Usual care to 25% Intervention using computer-generated permuted block randomization. Masking: A computer-generated random sequence will be used to allocate patients to the study arms. Randomization will be stratified by individual investigator sites. 
Masking of the laboratory will be ensured by using the standard laboratory request forms for both the control and intervention groups and ensuring that all specimens will be processed and reported by the same laboratory group. 
Outcomes: Patient-centered clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes will be used to evaluate the impact of direct-from-blood bacterial testing results compared to usual care. Outcomes of interest are time to receiving the last dose of intravenous vancomycin and time to initiation of the last dose of systemic anti-pseudomonal beta lactam antibiotics, in addition to outcomes related to antibiotic-associated adverse events and treatment duration. Sample Size: To demonstrate a 0.4 day reduction in"
220,"9.5% of all Germans have been diagnosed with arterial hypertension. The prevalance in Germany increase every year. Arterial hypertension is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. While the medical treatment is effective in reducing the risk, conventional therapies are commonly associated with a multitude of side effects and many patients find it difficult to tolerate medication or cannot reach therapeutic doses due to gastrointestinal complaints. There are also therapeutic approaches from the so called classical complementary medicine that are rarely used. One of this approaches is hydrotherapy, based on ideas of Sebastian Kneipp and his contemporaries. Temperature-elevating armbaths are highly recommended, but scientific evidence is lacking. This randomizet-controlled trial aims to investigate the effect of a temperature-elevating armbath among participants with arterial hypertension. 50 participants will be randomized to either and intervention group or waitlist (treatment as usual). The primary outcome of this trial is the change in blood pressure from baseline after 8 weeks. All participants will be monitored with three 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure measurements (24h ABPM) at the beginning of the trial after randomization, at 8 weeks and at 6 months. The intervention group will be advised to perform the armbaths on 5 of 7 days per week for 8 weeks total. Each participant will get a detailed instruction how to perform the armbath and will be handed a diary to document their performance. After 6 months, each participant of the control group will be offered to be instructed on performing the armbaths as well. Within the active period of 8 weeks, participants of both groups will be called regularly to ask about their health and whether they have questions regarding the trial. The results of this trial may help to improve the current treatment possibilities for arterial hypertension."
221,"This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) consisting of two parallel arms. Half of the participants will receive the acupuncture intervention and will be compared with participants who receive MBSR. The study investigators aim to collect data from approximately 60 service members and active duty individuals who are experiencing moderate-to-high levels of stress, defined as a PSS ≥16 (where 16 represents a medium level of perceived stress). Both groups will attend a minimum of four sessions that last up to 90 minutes each. Acupuncture sessions will be administered once weekly over four consecutive weeks and will take place at either the Naval Hospital Clinic in Portsmouth, NH or via telehealth by a certified, licensed acupuncturist. These sessions will be done in an individual private practice using disposable single-use (SSU) acupuncture needles in accordance with the National Institute of Health recommendations. Participants receiving acupuncture will also participate in the same MBSR protocol and group sessions that are delivered to the MBSR intervention participants. The primary aim of this study is to pilot a novel behavioral telehealth intervention that integrates both acupuncture and MBSR. The aim of this intervention is to reduce stress and improve overall health and well-being in service members and veterans. Stress reduction is an essential component of successful psychotherapy for service members with various stress-related diseases. The goal is to assess the feasibility of our study (recruitment, retention, satisfaction, etc.). We expect this pilot study to provide important information about the effectiveness of the intervention, and if successful, provide strong support for a future larger RCT study of veterans.

The primary outcome was the incidence of PDPH at 24 hours. 78 patients (18,9%) experienced headache in the epidural re-site group and 111 patients (26,8%) in the intrathecal group (p < 0,001). The intensity of PDPH, measured with a 0-10 score, was significantly lower (mean value 2.2 +/- 1.7, 95% CI 1.6-2.8 versus  3.6 +/- 2.2, 95% CI 3.0-4.2, p = 0,0003) and duration shorter (mean duration 1 day versus 1.8 days; p = 0,004) in the intrathecal group with respect to the epidural re-site group. The epidural re-site group had a higher caesarean section rate (27.5% versus 16.5%; p = 0,02) with a higher number of malpresentation (10.9% versus 2.1%; p = 0,004), but there was no difference in adverse events such as unsuccessful attempts at placing the epidural (9.4% versus 11.1%) between the groups. Moreover, no difference in patient's satisfaction, both overall and related to back pain, was seen between the groups. In conclusion, our group, comparing the intrathecal intrapartum subarachnoid catheter with epidural re-site, revealed a better outcome after intrathecal catheter, with a similar rate of adverse events, no difference in patient's satisfaction and a lower caesarean section rate."

226,"The overall aim of this programme of research is to use the findings of previous research to make new theoretical advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of addiction and to use these theoretical advances to create interventions which can help people to recover from drug addiction. 

The proposed intervention programme involves three studies which, taken together, address the question of why substance use, including alcohol, remains such a stubborn problem to treat, the barriers to drug treatment attendance and retention, and why so many people relapse in the face of interventions that are otherwise effective. Specifically, we will: 

Conduct a series of studies on the effects on relapse of both nicotine withdrawal and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in current and ex‐users of several substances of abuse, including the ‘gold standard’ of NRT, varenicline.

Investigate whether it is nicotine, specifically, that prevents individuals from getting better, by providing smokers with a varenicline-free alternative to smoking (a vicious cycle prevention intervention).

Investigate whether current treatment methods for those who present to drug agencies are sufficiently intensive to promote lasting, long-term recovery from substance use.

227,"The purpose of this is to study the safety and efficacy of IMPT-314, a CAR T-cell therapy, in treating patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL. This therapy is genetically engineered to target the proteins CD19 and CD20, which are commonly found on the surface of B-cells, including some lymphomas.

To prevent Graft-versus-Host-disease (GVHD), the modified CAR T cells are genetically engineered to contain a humanized FMC63 α chain with a unique truncated portion (αFMC63) and a humanized CD28 β chain without the costimulatory region (βCD28) expressed as disulfide linked heterodimers.

231,"2 year oncologic follow-up is standard of care post curative treatment for head and neck cancer. However, the current follow-up pathways are resource intensive. We want to investigate a personalised follow-up pathway with low resource demands. Hypothesis: Personalised follow-up pathway, with individualised risk assessment and prognostic information, will have a superior survival outcome and provide improved quality of life with cost-savings to the patient and the NHS trust. This study will investigate if and how this pathway will be implemented into routine practice and what benefits and barriers that patients and service providers experience with a low resource follow-up. As we have recently established this pathway, a mixed methods research design has been chosen using both qualitative and quantitative methods. For qualitative analysis semi structured interviews and focus group discussions will be used. Quantitative analysis will involve collecting and analysing both self-reported patient data and clinical information. This research will include both patients and service providers within the care pathway. Patients will benefit by receiving a more personalised follow up plan. In the long run the National Health Service trust may benefit by realising cost savings."

The investigators hypothesis is that the use of Air-Flow, an aerosol-based instrument, has antibacterial efficacy with no harm to the tooth surface and could be a useful supplement to mechanical cleaning during orthodontic treatment and thus reduce caries occurrence."
234,"The study aims to collect and examine patient tissue. It will be collected during patients’ routine operations, and it would be otherwise discarded. Therefore, patients undergoing routine operations requiring the surgical removal of relevant tissues will be eligible to participate in this study.

The pilot study will examine up to 10 participants. The feasibility of a full study will be assessed based on the findings of this study. Therefore, for this study, the study team have decided to recruit patients with atrial fibrillation and with a range of degrees of AF fibrosis. During cardiothoracic surgery, a randomised trial has shown that surgical exclusion of the LAA at the time of cardiac surgery is associated with a 2.2% reduction in ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism. This will involve the removal of the left atrium, and the tissues, which would normally be discarded during heart surgery will be collected. During lung resections for malignancies, along with the part of the lung being resected, the pulmonary vein and surrounding portion of the left atrium are also removed. These operations therefore provide tissue which is known to be of great importance in promoting and sustaining AF, but which is normally discarded. Therefore, the current study proposal plans to make use of this discarded tissue to find out more about the causes of AF.

235,"BACKGROUND: Integrated and isolated training are very effective rehabilitation programs, but their effectiveness depends on the intensity. To ensure that the exercises are correctly executed during the different stages of the treatments, the use of assistants or physiotherapists are necessary that are responsible for the correct execution of the exercises. 
AIM: To compare the effects of integrated and isolated training. 
METHODS/DESIGN: The present randomized study will be divided into two groups, control and experimental. The control group will receive an isolated training intervention (strength, explosive strength and specific endurance for the sports activity) and the experimental group an integrated training intervention (strength, explosive strength and specific endurance for the sports activity). Treatment adherence will also be analyzed, comparing whether the protocol can be followed by the athlete during training. The intervention periods will last 4 weeks. 
PRINCIPLES: The integrated and isolated training methodologies will be applied. There will be 3 training sessions per week for a total of 12 weeks, and the training will be supervised by an experienced strength coach. 
STUDY SIZE: 37 athletes
DISCUSSION: Our aim is to examine the effects of intensity in integrated and isolated training. From the results obtained we hope that we can recommend an ideal intensity to the athletes to guarantee good performance in the rehabilitation treatments. 
METHODS/DESIGN: The present randomized study will be divided into two groups, control and experimental. The control group wil receive an isolated training intervention (strength, explosive strength and specific endurance for the sports activity) and the experimental group an integrated training intervention (strength, explosive strength and specific endurance for the sports activity). These methodologies will be applied with 3 training sessions per week for a total of 12 weeks, and the training will be supervised by an experienced strength coach. The first week will be an adaptation period, and the training intensity will start by applying the 1RM test after having completed a general warm up. The other exercise components will include intensity, volume and execution variables."
236,"1.Background and rationale: A play is an event consisting of fictional events created and performed by the participants. Play is often associated with intrinsic motivational factors. Play may involve serious interaction (often termed playful or serious play) or humorous interaction (often termed play or ""horseplay""). The use of play as therapy started long time back and was used by playworkers and play therapists. Initially play was believed to help the children improve their social skills and to develop in a more independent way. Play based therapies have been found to be useful in different kind of mental health disorders. The basic principle underlying this therapy is that play enables the child express his feelings in a way in which he would not communicate otherwise. Play based therapy is widely used but there is no concrete evidence from randomized control trials. It shows promising results for communication, and expressive disorders in children.
There are a number of interventions and therapies that have been designed for developing the functional communication skills in the language delayed autistic children. Some functional communication training strategies are highly successful and have been used since many years. But this method doesn't take into consideration the role of functional language skills development in children with language delays which can also be an important problem for these children.
We did a lot of studies in the past we also have done few reviews on the treatment of child language disorders and the use of play as therapy. We also concluded that the Play based therapy is safe and very effective.
We therefore came to conclusion that the language delayed autistic children with communication and Expressive disorders can be better treated by the combination of Play based therapy and Functional communication training.<

Brief Summary
-----------------
The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, ocular and systemic tolerability, and the safety of BI 771716 administered as four single intravitreal (IVT) injections of BI 771716 in the form of a liquid solution in patients who have been diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with geographic atrophy (GA) of minimum 1 disc area (DA) in size. This will be performed in two parts (Phase 1 and Phase 2). Following pharmacokinetic (PK), tolerability, and safety confirmation, the BI 771716-200 microM Group (and possibly other microM groups) will be progressed into Phase 2. Subjects will be treated with an intravitreal injection of BI 771716 for each of two study eyes in the study (for example, the right and left eye). An intravitreal injection of BI 771716 consists of a sterile, clear injection containing either high, medium, low, or intermediate dose of 6 µL into the vitreous cavity of the eye. Subjects will make visits at the screening visit, Day 1 (baseline), pre-dose (day -1) of each dosing day, and at study closure, up to 14 months.

Detailed Description
-----------------
A total of up to 60 subjects will be treated in Part B of this study, Phase 2: Two MicroM Groups (low and intermediate) of a total of up to 28 subjects, of which up to 20 are expected to be treated with low doses and up to 8 are expected to be treated with intermediate doses of BI 771716; and one microM Group (high) of a total of 32 subjects. Phase 1: Three cohorts of 6 (N=18) subjects will be treated in the study. Part B (Phase 2): Safety information obtained from Part A (Phase 1) will be reviewed by the Sponsor Safety Monitoring Committee (SMaC) as to whether to proceed with further subject treatment, and if so, into which part and subpart. If the Sponsor proceeds with further treatment in a particular subpart, 5-10 additional subjects may be enrolled to provide further support for decisions regarding dose selection. If the Sponsor proceeds with further treatment, additional subjects (N=18) will be treated in Part B (Phase 2) of the study. Subjects will be enrolled into Part B (Phase 2) based on subject willingness, as well as the potential benefit to the individual subject. Phase 1: Low single dose cohort: Six subjects will be treated in a single low dose cohort. At the pre-dose visit, one complete set of baseline measurements will be carried out before BI 771716 will be injected intravitreally into the study eye. Pharmacokinetic (PK), tolerability, and safety data will be collected and analysed to determine whether to proceed to the next subpart. Medium Single dose cohort: Six subjects will be treated in a medium single dose cohort. Safety data will be collected and PK and ocular response data will be collected and analysed to determine whether to proceed to the next subpart. High Single dose cohort: Six subjects will be treated in a high single dose cohort. Safety data will be collected and PK and ocular response data will be collected and analysed to determine whether to proceed to the next subpart. Subjects will be seen for follow-up assessments at pre-dose (day -1) on dosing days and at Day 1 (baseline), Day 21 and at the study closure visit.

240,"In a prospective, blinded, randomized, parallel group study, patients presenting with acute decompensated heart failure (HF) and fluid overload (FO) will receive either conventional loop diuretic therapy or continuous intravenous administration of furosemide by an extracorporeal ultra-filtration device, with matched de-hydration.

241,"The study hypothesis is that a self-guided mindfulness-based intervention will benefit pediatric patients with idiopathic chest pain (ICP) in terms of reduced frequency and intensity of chest pain episodes. 
There is no universally accepted medical intervention for patients with ICP. Pediatric cardiologists have reported variable treatment successes for this condition, and in some cases patients have reported no improvement in their condition. 
Almost half of adolescents with unexplained symptoms are referred to pediatric cardiologists, and they have the highest rate of subsequent healthcare visits. 
This project responds to the need for a low-risk, non-invasive intervention for pediatric patients with ICP that is focused on pain coping strategies rather than the use of pharmaceuticals as has generally been done in the past. 
Mindfulness meditation is a form of self-care in which practitioners learn to be fully aware of their breath, body, thoughts, and emotions. 
Mindfulness is a secular discipline, and many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mindfulness for various health conditions. 
Although mindfulness has been studied as an intervention for adults with chest pain, there have been no published studies evaluating mindfulness as a treatment for pediatric patients with ICP. 
Therefore, we have modified a mindfulness-based intervention that has previously been shown to be effective for adults with chest pain. 
In this pilot study, we will determine if it is feasible, with appropriate recruitment, adherence, and engagement for this intervention to be modified for use in a larger population of adolescents with ICP. 
We will also determine if a mindfulness-based intervention is acceptable to adolescents with ICP, and we will further explore the mechanisms by which mindfulness may influence changes in chest pain events. 
Forty adolescents with ICP will be randomly assigned to receive either the mindfulness-based intervention or the standard of care. 
Participants will complete surveys before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 28 days after the intervention. 
Participants will also complete a daily diary to track their chest pain episodes during the 28 days of the intervention. 
Although the exact effect of the intervention on chest pain is unknown at this point, our objective is to learn about the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of implementing a mindfulness-based intervention for adolescents with ICP."

243,"Background and objectives of the study
-----------------
According to the latest cancer classification, pancreatic cancer is the fourth deadliest cancer worldwide (187.000 deaths in 2018), with an estimated 5 year survival of less than 10%. Currently, the treatment options for advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer are rather limited, leading to a median overall survival time of less than one year. Treatment of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is challenging because most patients are not eligible for surgical resection of the primary tumor due to poor prognosis. Consequently, the only treatment options that are currently available for this population are a limited number of chemotherapeutic regimens. These regimens do improve patient survival in comparison with the situation in which there is no treatment at all. However, the number of treatment options needs to be increased in order to improve survival rates. Since the immune system is known to play an important role in tumorigenesis and immunotherapy is rapidly becoming a new and promising therapeutic strategy, it is hypothesized that combination therapy with two different immunotherapy drugs might prove to be more promising than regular treatment. 
Rationale
-----------------
PDAC is characteristically associated with a profound immunosuppressive environment, which impairs the functionality and cytotoxic capacities of effector CD8+ T cells. In this study we will investigate the effectiveness of combining anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy with a TLR-3 agonist (rintatolimod), which is an immunotherapeutic drug that activates dendritic cells and CD8+ T cells via direct stimulation of the TLR-3 and CD137 receptors. Previous research has shown that this combination therapy improves immune system function in cancer patients. 
Over the last few years, multiple clinical trials have already been performed in an attempt to find effective combination therapies for pancreatic cancer. Most of these studies have been designed to find the right dose for combining two drugs. However, since combination therapy can be dangerous from a safety point of view, it is important that these safety profiles are well understood before these combinations are tested in a larger population of cancer patients. In this study we aim to determine the highest dose per protocol without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). We will also determine the clinical benefit rate in addition to the tumor response rate and progression-free survival rate and investigate the effect of combination therapy on the infiltrating tumor immune profile. 
Interventions
-----------------
In this study, patients will first receive the chemotherapeutic treatment FOLFIRINOX for a period of 8 months. Subsequently, they will start with combination therapy, including rintatolimid and durvalumab, for a six weeks period. Rintatolimid will be administered as an infusion twice per week and durvalumab will be administered intravenously every two months, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Who is included
-----------------
Patients that are 18-75 years old and have histologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic cancer, i.e. adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with tumor nodules or metastases that are eligible for treatment with the chemotherapeutic regimen FOLFIRINOX. These patients must also be ineligible for surgical resection of their pancreatic cancer. 
Research design and methods
-----------------
This study consists of two phases: phase Ib and phase II. All participating patients will first start with the chemotherapeutic regimen FOLFIRINOX for 8 months and patients that do not benefit from this treatment will be excluded. After FOLFIRINOX the patients will all start with the combination therapy, which consists of rintatolimid and durvalumab. 
Phase Ib
-----------------
In this phase, participants will receive durvalumab and rintatolimid consecutively after FOLFIRINOX, according to the following escalation scheme and design: The patients will receive durvalumab via intravenous infusion on the first day of a 28-day cycle, followed by rintatolimid administered twice per week for a period of 6 weeks. After the first six weeks, a second cycle will be started, with the same time scheme as before. Every six weeks (i.e. with every new cycle) a new toxicity assessment will take place; if the treatment remains safe, the dose can be increased and combination therapy in new patients can be started."
244,"This study has been designed to demonstrate the ability of diosmin to attenuate post-exercise muscle soreness in humans by means of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized clinical trial. To this end, we will evaluate whether supplementation with the flavonoid diosmin can attenuate muscle pain, plasma levels of total creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity) induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol. In addition, we will evaluate if the supplementation of the flavonoid diosmin can improve the recovery of muscular function and balance. Our hypothesis is that supplementation with the flavonoid diosmin can attenuate the inflammatory process caused by intense dynamic exercise, resulting in a decrease in delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and its adverse effects. To attain the objective of this study, 20 athletes will be subjected to the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol and, after exercise, will receive diosmin supplementation at a concentration of 750 mg per day. The intense dynamic exercise modality proposed for the study will consist of a sequence of three sets of repetitions until failure of bilateral muscle contractions on a leg-press machine with a 45° angle. This protocol of intense dynamic exercise has been proposed because it provides similar physiological responses to those found during dynamic exercises of long duration. In addition, it has been established as a well-tolerated and safe technique for eliciting muscle damage without impairing the neuromuscular functional capacity of athletes. The intense dynamic exercise protocol proposed here will be identical for all participants. The project is approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Londrina State University (Londrina, State of Paraná, Brazil) under protocol number 64025122.2.0000.0108 of the year 2021. The selected participants will be informed about the objectives and methodology of the study and when there is agreement with the proposed design, the agreement to voluntarily participate in the study will be registered by means of an Informed Consent Form. The intense dynamic exercise modality proposed for the study will follow the following approach: participants will perform a standardized muscle injury protocol that will consist of a sequence of three sets of repetitions until fatigue of bilateral muscle contractions on a leg-press machine with a 45° angle. Each The participant will have their load previously defined through the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) test, and 70% of the defined weight will be used during the intense dynamic exercise protocol. During each action, the load will be resisted with the legs placed on the leg-press supporter from full knee extension to the 90° knee flexion angle, lasting approximately 3-5 seconds. Between each series, participants will be able to take a 1-minute rest period. The intense dynamic exercise protocol that will be carried out by all participants will be supervised by the project manager and/or collaborators duly trained for such assessments. 20 athletes will be recruited for this study. They will be divided into two experimental groups of approximately equal numbers. One of these will be subjected to a placebo regimen and the other to the diosmin regimen. The intense dynamic exercise protocol described above will be carried out twice (before and after supplementation). This allows us to assess the potential effects of supplementing with diosmin before the start of exercise (pre-treatment) and to investigate its effects on DOMS and related pathological events. In order to investigate our main hypothesis, the potential effects of diosmin supplementation on DOMS will be evaluated and the potential causes of this condition, such as inflammation and oxidative stress, will be studied. The intense dynamic exercise model proposed for the study will consist of two different sessions. Each session will consist of three sets of 10 repetitions until failure. Both sessions will be conducted two days apart. The first day will be considered as the initial day for the analysis of clinical and blood parameters. In addition, it will allow the measurement of the 1RM of the leg-press machine and will prepare the participants mentally in order to be able to perform the protocol properly. The second day will be considered as the DOMS induction day. According to the prefrontal analysis, three sets of 10 repetitions of bilateral muscle contractions will be performed on the leg-press machine. The total duration of the protocol will be approximately 5 minutes. Between each repetition, the participants will have a 2-minute recovery period. A set of 10 bilateral repetitions (maximum tolerance load) will be considered an accomplishment and"
245,"2.1 percent of liveborns are born with CP. The CP register is an innovative register for data collection which was developed between 2016 and 2020 in a unique collaboration between children with CP, their parents, researchers and health care professionals. One of the specific goals of the CP register is the collection of longitudinal data on the effect of ITB. In the Netherlands there are two centres where ITB is performed, the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC) in Amsterdam and Maastricht UMC (MUMC) in Maastricht. As part of the Netherlands CP register, a follow-up registration program is combined with treatment registration. Prospective data collection in the treatment registration program will allow us to implement standardised assessment protocols in these two centres and will provide us with an opportunity to build a cohort of children enrolled into ITB treatment programmes in a period of 3 to 4 years. This will result in a data set containing both baseline data and data collected before, during or after starting ITB therapy. Furthermore, these data will allow us to follow up on both short and long term goals, including both motor and functional goals. This study will provide us with important information about how different factors influence the effect of ITB therapy and the achievement of treatment (goal) outcomes. Knowledge about the factors involved will allow health care professionals to predict which factors are involved in successful ITB therapy at an individual level. This can positively influence treatment and rehabilitation efforts related to ITB, both in the Netherlands and abroad. It can also lead to better informed and more accurate decisions for both the patients and their families prior to initiating ITB therapy.

In the Netherlands there are two centres where ITB is performed, the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC) in Amsterdam and Maastricht UMC (MUMC) in Maastricht. As part of the Netherlands CP register, a follow-up registration program is combined with treatment registration. Prospective data collection in the treatment registration program will allow us to implement standardised assessment protocols in these two centres and will provide us with an opportunity to build a cohort of children enrolled into ITB treatment programmes in a period of 3 to 4 years. This will result in a data set containing both baseline data and data collected before, during or after starting ITB therapy. Furthermore, these data will allow us to follow up on both short and long term goals, including both motor and functional goals. This study will provide us with important information about how different factors influence the effect of ITB therapy and the achievement of treatment (goal) outcomes. Knowledge about the factors involved will allow health care professionals to predict which factors are involved in successful ITB therapy at an individual level. This can positively influence treatment and rehabilitation efforts related to ITB, both in the Netherlands and abroad. Furthermore, results of this study can be used to formulate advice regarding the use of ITB in individuals with CP."
246,"Gestational diabetes mellitus is a common pregnancy-associated condition that affects 3-19% of pregnant women globally, depending on diagnostic criteria and population demographics. Women who are at a higher gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk due to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors are at a higher risk for having gestational diabetes mellitus, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Low vitamin D levels are associated with insulin resistance, a risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. Vitamin D is known to be important for glucose metabolism and its deficiency is prevalent among pregnant women in developing countries, where the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus is also high. Previous studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation is associated with lower risk of gestational diabetes mellitus among high-risk pregnant women, while others show no benefits. Thus, evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus during pregnancy is inconclusive.
Research has suggested that vitamin D supplementation may have additional benefits, such as preventing low birth weight, preeclampsia, and preterm delivery. These potential benefits may be due to the immuno-regulatory and anti-inflammatory activities of vitamin D, which can help to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications.
A research has been planned to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus among high-risk pregnant women. The primary outcome will be the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups Criteria after 75 g OGTT. If the findings show that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus among high-risk pregnant women, it may provide evidence for the implementation of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy as part of routine prenatal care. This research may benefit pregnant women and their offspring by reducing the risk of pregnancy complications and improving health outcomes for both mother and baby."

248,"Falls are one of the most feared events for older adults. It can significantly impact an individual's quality of life and independence, leading to physical, psychological, and social consequences. Falls can cause injuries such as fractures and bruises that increase the risk of disability and chronic pain. Fear of falling, a common fear experienced by older adults, can lead to a decrease in mobility, participation in social activities, and overall quality of life. This, in turn, can contribute to an increased risk of falls and further decline in physical and social functioning. It is estimated that 40% of adults aged 65 and older suffer from fear of falling. Exercise has been proven to be an effective way to improve balance, strength, coordination, and confidence. Nordic Walking is one such exercise that has gained popularity in recent years due to its numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, strengthened muscles, and reduced risk of falls and injuries. In this study, we aim to explore the potential of Nordic Walking as an activity promoting well-being and reducing the fear of falling among older adults. The focus of this study is to assess the safety and acceptability of the Nordic Walking intervention and to understand participants' perspectives on the intervention. The study will also gather preliminary data on potential effectiveness outcomes to inform future studies. By combining intervention adherence, safety data, and qualitative analysis of participants' perspectives, this study will provide valuable insights into the potential of Nordic Walking as an intervention to enhance well-being, reduce the fear of falling, and promote a safe and meaningful lifestyle for older adults."

250,"Narcotism has become one of the focuses of anesthesiology clinical anesthesia research. The drug is not only used in clinical routine clinical anesthesia, but also in intravenous anesthesia, analgesia and sedation. Many studies have shown that the use of narcotics in the anesthesia of short operations is feasible. Among them, intravenous anesthesia of sedation and analgesia, as a method of rapid recovery, is currently gradually applied in the anesthesia of gastrointestinal endoscopy. In summary, intravenous general anesthesia can lead to hemodynamic fluctuations and an increase in anesthesia-related complications such as longer hospital stays after the operation. Therefore, intravenous sedation and analgesia, which are currently widely used in various types of surgeries, are increasingly used in gastroenteroscopy anesthesia, but there are few studies reported in the literature to investigate the effects of intravenous sedation and analgesia on endoscopic surgery. This study compares the clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous sedation and analgesia and traditional intravenous combination anesthesia (IVA) in the anesthesia of colonoscopy, to determine the most suitable anesthesia approach for the anesthesia of colonoscopy., To compare the postoperative recovery time and the pain control effect of different sedation methods of colonoscopy., To compare the effects of different sedation methods on the recovery of heart rate before and after surgery., To compare the effect of different sedation methods on the recovery of blood pressure before and after surgery., To compare the effect of different sedation methods on the recovery of oxygen saturation before and after surgery., To compare the adverse reaction rate of different sedation methods of colonoscopy., To compare the heart rate before and after surgery of the 2 groups., To compare the blood pressure before and after surgery in the 2 groups., To compare the difference in oxygen saturation before and after surgery in the 2 groups., To compare the recovery index score before and after surgery., To explore other short-term risks caused by different sedation methods of colonoscopy., To compare the intraoperative visual sedation scale scoring of the 2 groups:"

Introduction: Radiation-induced intestinal injury (RAII) is a common complication of rectal cancer chemoradiotherapy-temazolomide (CRT-TMZ). The incidence of RAII varies from 20% to 70%, with mild self-limited diarrhea in 10%-20% of patients to severe intestinal necrosis in 5%-10% of patients. Although mild intestinal toxicity is usually self-limited, severe and chronic comorbidities will lead to delayed rectal cancer surgery, reduced treatment dose intensity and drug treatment compliance, poorer tolerance and increased toxicity. The pathophysiological mechanism of RAII is still unclear. The immune response of the intestinal mucosa to malignant tumors stimulated by radiation and chemotherapy contributes to acute intestinal injury, as immune cells and cytokines are involved in the repair of radiation damage and the process of tumor response and resistance. However, the immune microenvironment changes in the progression of acute intestinal injury to chronic intestinal injury, and studies on the role and mechanism of immune factors in chronic intestinal injury are still limited. Methods: A prospective, observational, confirmatory single-center study recruited adult rectal cancer patients aged 18 to 75 years old diagnosed by pathology and MRI, who underwent NCRT and TME and developed RAII during NCRT, to verify acute intestinal injury and chronic intestinal injury . Expected samples of 200 patients were collected. The expression level of immune factors will be detected in the pathological tissue after TME, and the prediction model will be established based on the relationship between the expression level of immune factors and the prognosis of acute inflammation and chronic inflammation. The prediction model will be used to predict the chronicization of radiation-induced acute intestinal injury based on the expression level of immune factors and then predict the course of disease in advance. Objective: To verify the relationship between immune microenvironment and the course of chronicization of radiation-induced acute intestinal injury."

253,"Learning Objectives: The objective of this training session is to give participants an overview of the Endomatic SEPIOLA System for Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion as a tool to supplement percutaneous or surgical AF ablation procedures.

Introduction: In 2014, the risk stratified use of non vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as a first line treatment for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) was recommended by guidelines. Even with the new anti-thrombotic agents, the rate of stroke remains significant in the NVAF population. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) prevents thrombus formation within the LAA and is indicated in high risk patients for stroke who are unable to tolerate oral anticoagulants. This training session will review the use of LAAO for AF patients. Currently, only two percutaneous LAAO approaches are approved in the US, both of these are delivered percutaneously in the cardiac cath lab via a trans-septal pathway.
The trans-septal approach is associated with procedure-related complications, such as peri-cardial effusion and vascular complications. The development of the SEPIOLA System (figure 8) offered physicians and patients an alternative to these two procedures. The SEPIOLA System was granted CE mark for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF, who are not candidates for long-term oral anticoagulant intake. It is the first and only FDA cleared device for the percutaneous occlusion of the LAA with a trans-esophageal percutaneous insertional point of access.
The SEPIOLA System delivers an open-suture closure device for the sealing of the LAA within the left atrial cavity under a minimal volume of contrast and is completely inserted, deployed and retrieved in less than 45 minutes. The device offers a simple deployment and retrieval procedure with a minimal procedural volume of contrast. Clinical data demonstrating the safety and feasibility of the procedure have been presented in multiple clinical registries: SEPTIC RCT which reported 0% mortality, 0% procedural complications and 99.5% 12-month clinical success. Results of 170 cases in the SEPTIC RCT revealed: mean aortic cross-clamp time of 25 min, cardiac output of 9.9 L/min and stroke rate of 0 %

254,"Acute psychosis is a severe psychiatric condition that affects the daily lives of many patients. Due to the severity of the symptoms, the social disruption, and the disruption of functioning in the everyday activities, early and effective treatment is vital. Although antipsychotic medications are an essential part of the treatment, they also face many obstacles. In particular, non-compliance as well as lack of motivation and self-effacing behavior of many patients with acute psychosis represent serious hindrances. A promising approach that has been shown to increase treatment adherence is psychotherapy-based motivational interviewing. To date, however, there are no studies with a sufficient number of patients that have investigated its efficacy in the specific clinical context of patients with acute psychosis. Aim of the current project is to investigate the effects of motivational interviewing compared to supportive conversations in patients with acute psychosis."

259,"Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a highly chronic and relapsing condition affecting upwards of 2.4 million individuals in the U.S. Individuals who have difficulty motivating for or sustaining engagement in OUD treatment represent a significant public health burden.  Unfortunately, traditional addiction treatment strategies may not be acceptable to or engage these individuals because a more family-focused approach is needed to address the needs of those affected by problematic substance use. The Community Reinforcement and Family Training  (CRAFT) is based in social learning theory and is a strength-based approach that involves helping individuals affected by OUDs to identify ways for their loved one (IP) to achieve and maintain recovery, while also learning new skills to cope with the difficulties and stress of their family context.  The goal is for CRAFT providers to identify positive goals to work towards with their IPs and, ultimately, to increase the likelihood that IPs will voluntarily attend and engage in substance use and mental health treatment. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of CRAFT, it has not achieved widespread application to the point where it is a common standard of care for OUD providers. The proposed study will use an innovative digital intervention approach designed to improve CRAFT implementation and delivery among addiction counselors.  The investigators propose to identify the most effective of three levels of digital training of CRAFT that address three components: digital tutorial overview (T), training materials (TM), and digital tutorial plus training materials plus feedback and coaching (TMC).

263,"1.Background:
Cervical cancer is a kind of human cancer, which is especially frequent in young patients. The incidence of HPV-associated cervical cancer is increasing in more and more counties. Radical surgery is the main treatment for patients with early stage of cervical cancer. Most patients with advanced cervical cancer will receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy to improve the prognosis of the disease. According to the results of the GOG 240 trial, the use of platinum-based combination regimens is now the standard treatment for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. In recent years, the treatment of advanced cervical cancer has shown remarkable changes. The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with antiangiogenic therapy provides more opportunities for prolonging the survival time of these patients and obtaining clinical benefits.
In the KEYNOTE 42 study, pembrolizumab showed remarkable clinical efficacy in recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer and pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel and bevacizumab became the standard treatment for recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer. In the KEYNOTE 826 study, PD-1 monoclonal antibody + chemotherapy combined regimen significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with placebo + chemotherapy combined regimen. In the phase II AMP7 study, nivolumab combined with nab-paclitaxel + liposome doxorubicin (lip-dox) was effective and safe, with an ORR of 51%, a median DoR of 5.2 months, and an OS of 12.4 months.
5.2 A previous report found that among people with PD-1-positive recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who received immune checkpoint blockade + chemotherapy combined treatment, patients with specific germline variants in the tumor microenvironment gene (TMEG) had a significant increase in PFS compared with those with wild genes or germline variants in other genes (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35–0.91, P = 0.016). In another study of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, when PD-1 combined with other drugs in combination to treat cervical cancer, only 30.6% of patients (31/102) had a complete or partial response to treatment. For the remaining 70.7% of patients, it was difficult to improve the prognosis of cervical cancer by continuing to treat cervical cancer. Therefore, from the perspective of immunotherapy, it is urgently needed to explore the new treatment of cervical cancer. Based on the above, the immune checkpoint blockade combined with chemotherapy is still the most common and promising treatment method for recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer, and it is necessary to continue to conduct explorations for combined treatment methods. However, some of the adverse events that are frequently seen in the treatment of cervical cancer patients are adverse drug reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea; and there are some other adverse events. For example, some researchers have reported that cardiovascular adverse events can also be seen in immune checkpoint inhibitor-based treatment regimens. Due to the special characteristics of the cervical cancer population, in recent years, nab-paclitaxel has been approved for the use of recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer in many countries. However, the application of nab-paclitaxel in different countries in the world is still not uniform. Thus, it remains necessary for international multicenter large-scale clinical studies to explore whether or not nab paclitaxel combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors is a more powerful treatment regimen for recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer.
7) The combination of PD-1 inhibitor+nab-paclitaxel may be one of the treatment regimens for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. There are some reports which confirm the relationship between nab-paclitaxel combined with checkpoint inhibitors and the efficacy of tumor treatment. In the KEYNOTE-028 study, nab paclitaxel combined with nivolumab + ipilimumab as first-line treatment, in a group of patients with recurrent or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, the response rate was about"
264,"This randomized monocentric prospective single blind multicentre clinical study was designed to compare the visual performance of the trifocal Hanita Lenses Intensity SL IOL (study lens) with the trifocal Alcon PanOptix IOL (comparison lens). The main objective of this study was to establish the non-inferiority of the study lens compared to the control lens in terms of measured binocular distance visual acuity for far, intermediate and near distances within a 1 month interval, measured at postoperative Month 3. Furthermore, the investigators analyzed other parameters, such as uncorrected and corrected intermediate visual acuity, patient satisfaction, spectacle requirements and quality of life in this study."
265,"1. The aim is the development of a web-based interface and software for the visualisation of biomedical signals measured during an experiment. This interface will include multiple modules and each module will be responsible for an aspect of the web-experiment. In particular, the software will allow experimental conditions to be set, data to be recorded and stored, and visualisations to be published to end-users. An easy-to-use GUI will also be developed. 2. The software will be tested on a real experimental environment. This consists of a group of laboratory experimental rooms from the University of Genoa, University of Eastern Finland and University of Sheffield, where biomedical measurements are carried out with different experimental setups. The interface and visualisation software will be tested under three different experimental conditions, which include the recording of cardiovascular signals, motion capture data and visual stimuli.

266,"519 COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached an estimated 4 million deaths across the globe. Despite the availability of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the investigators do not yet understand the correlates of protection. Thus, the investigators do not know who will be protected from symptomatic disease, or what will be required to achieve protective immunity in populations. Given the limited research in this area, the investigators also do not know how the unique immunological and nutrition characteristics of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a region with the highest mortality, affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission and immunity. To date, there is no research looking at how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination among uninfected individuals and individuals chronically infected from exposure to malaria and the intestinal helminth, which are highly prevalent in SSA. The investigators propose collecting up to 200 symptomatic subjects (index cases) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their households, up to 600 vaccinees, and up to 2700 uninfected individuals without any history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Malawi. The investigators will enroll these subjects throughout Blantyre, Malawi, and collect extensive laboratory samples, including whole blood, capillary blood, stool, and blood taken through venipuncture, to measure markers of immune function and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and immune responses against the virus. The investigators will assess risk of asymptomatic infection among contacts of index cases, the ability to generate strong antibody responses against the virus, the potential risk for re-infection or breakthrough infections in vaccinees, immune activation in response to the virus and in response to the vaccine, the potential risk for acquiring infections in a household, the duration of symptomatic infections and reinfections, and how malaria and intestinal helminth infection may impact these parameters. The investigators will also explore the relationship between infection and vaccination with regard to immunity and protection against SARS-CoV2 infection in the context of malaria and intestinal helminth infection. The investigators' overarching hypothesis is that exposure to malaria and intestinal helminth may lead to an abnormal innate immune phenotype that is highly inflammatory, and that these inflammatory responses may lead to immune exhaustion upon exposure to the virus or to a vaccine, resulting in decreased levels of protective Ab and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and inadequate responses to vaccine.

269,"Sleep Apnea (OSA) causes an intermittent hypoxemia (IH). It is believed that the intermittent tissue hypoxia stimulates erythropoiesis and polycythemia. It is known that CPAP treatment reduces the IH and reduce the polycythemia. It is currently unknown whether CPAP treatment is necessary to reduce the polycythemia. So CPAP treatment as treatment for polycythemia should be tested in a clinical trial. In order to test that hypothesis we have proposed the randomized study design. We propose to enroll an unselected population of consecutive patients diagnosed with OSA and moderate to severe polycythemia. These patients will receive individual treatment including conventional pharmacological treatment and lifestyle recommendations and they will be allocated (balanced allocation) to undergo CPAP treatment or to remain without CPAP treatment. The primary hypothesis is that patients with OSA and polycythemia who undergo CPAP therapy, will have less polycythemia at 12 months compared with those who do not receive CPAP therapy."
270,"1. Background and Rationale: Prolapse of the vagina is the bulging of the vagina into the vaginal canal; it can be a symptom of uterine prolapse or cystocele, but it can also occur without either. It includes problems with urinating and having sex. It may also cause pain, and difficulty walking or sitting down. 2. Study Hypothesis: There is a possibility that the MRI of post-operative apical prolapse patients might help us in predicting the apical prolapse recurrence, however our study objective is to assess the vaginal axis in patients undergoing apical prolapse surgery, whether they have undergone hysterectomy or not. The investigation is designed to test the null hypothesis by means of a comparative analysis of preoperative and postoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging images capturing the vaginal axis. 3. Study Design: The study design will be as follows: a convenience sample is composed of prospectively recruited participants with genital prolapse; participants will be randomly assigned to alternative surgical procedures according to the clinical judgment of the investigator. 5. Intervention: All individuals (including laparoscopic pectopexy, lateral suspension and sacrospinous ligament fixation) will undergo evaluation for pouch of Douglas obliteration, enterocele and will have preoperative and postoperative MRI results (4-6 months postoperative period).

274,"BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Recent evidence indicates a positive association between HDL particle concentrations and various health outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease, and diabetes. Although the association of egg intake and cardiovascular health outcomes appears to be controversial, there are no known randomized clinical trials investigating the effects of egg intake on HDL size distribution or the number of HDL subclasses (high, medium, or low density lipoprotein), and whether the positive associations between egg intake and cardiovascular health outcomes is due to changes in HDL size distribution or the number of HDL subclasses or not. In addition, there is limited information on how egg intake may affect immune function, and whether these effects change with age. We propose that whole eggs, egg yolks, and egg whites, when consumed over a 4-week period, will have different effects on serum large HDL particles, serum HDL subclasses, and circulating T-cell subsets in young and older adults. METHODS: This randomized, crossover study will be performed at Baylor College of Medicine's Human Nutrition Research Center. During this study, participants will consume each diet during a 4-week period in random order, with a 4-week egg-free washout in between. All egg intake will be conducted by consuming 3 liquid large eggs per day, provided by Hickman's Family Farms, for 4 weeks, separated into 3 liquid large eggs consumed in the morning, 1 liquid large egg consumed at lunch, and 1 liquid large egg consumed in the evening. The three liquid egg products will be prepared by the volunteer. One of the two eggs in the early evening will be mixed with a protein-rich food (e.g., cottage cheese) to prevent nighttime satiety, which can lead to poor sleep quality. The other liquid egg provided in the early evening will be consumed by whipping the contents of one of the 3 large eggs with a table fork. The study will recruit 24 unique male and female participants between the ages of 18-30 years (n=12) and older adults between the ages of 60-70 years (n=12) in order to minimize gender- and age-dependent physiological effects. These participants will be separated into a ""single meal"" subgroup (n=3 per condition) and a ""whole day"" subgroup (n=9 per condition). In the single meal subgroup, study participants will consume all 3 liquid large eggs in the morning (with the early evening egg substituted with a placebo (pure water)), followed by fasting until dinner with no other egg intake during the 4-week intervention period. The ""whole day"" subgroup will be consuming 3 liquid large eggs in the morning, 1 liquid large egg at lunch, and 1 liquid large egg in the early evening (as described above) for the first 4 (or more) consecutive weeks. For the second 4 (or more) weeks (or the next time point), study participants will consume 2 liquid whole eggs in the morning, 2 liquids egg whites in the morning, and 2 liquids egg yolks in the early evening. During the intervening 4 weeks, the egg products from the first 4 weeks will be substituted to test for repeatability of any observed treatment effect. A 4-week egg-free run-in period will be required before and after each treatment arm in order to minimize the impact of potential carry-over effects from prior treatments. During the egg-free run-in period, study participants will adhere to the National Cholesterol Education Program Step 2 diet, which includes a restriction in dietary cholesterol intake to <300 mg/day for the prior 4 weeks before initiating and beginning an intervention arm. Exact dietary composition will otherwise be identical to the intervention arm. During the egg-free washout period, participants may consume eggs on any day they choose, in addition to dietary compliance with the National Cholesterol Education Program Step 2 diet. Study participants will be asked to not consume any foods that may affect plasma levels of large HDL particles from the time they enroll in the study until the end of the second egg-free 4-week run-in period. This includes the consumption of nuts, fruit, fatty fish, and fish oil supplements. In addition, the day prior to the start of each intervention arm, and the day preceding the collection of fasting serum and ex vivo markers of inflammation, participants will be asked to not consume food after 8:00PM in order to establish a baseline,"
275,"This clinical trial will provide a proof of concept (POC) evaluation of MyoTrain AR in upper limb amputees. MyoTrain AR is a virtual prosthesis training system based on augmented reality (AR) headset and real-time pattern recognition feedback. 

The purpose of MyoTrain AR is to improve upper limb amputee functionality following the use of pattern recognition-based myoelectric controllers without the need for specialized therapist intervention. In this way, MyoTrain AR will be beneficial for all individuals who use pattern recognition controls. Amputees can be aided by MyoTrain AR on multiple fronts:

First: MyoTrain AR will provide a novel method of rehabilitation training that can be performed in the convenience of one's home. Second: MyoTrain AR will provide the first objective metrics of upper limb amputee functional performance associated with pattern recognition control. Third: MyoTrain AR will provide a platform for future research and development of novel training methods aimed at improving myoelectric control.

In this randomized control case study, amputee participants will be split into two groups, a traditional motor imagery training group, and an experimental augmented reality training group. All will complete the same assessment battery before, during, and after the training intervention. To minimize bias, all participants will be blinded to the type of training they receive and the outcome measures to be assessed. The data will then be evaluated without bias using standard analytic methods, for example, generalized estimating equations that account for repeated measures.

This study has limited statistical power but will be sufficient for providing a proof of concept evaluation of MyoTrain AR. The study is limited to a single time point to minimize costs and participant burden but the same participants will be monitored for up to one year to determine if there is any sustained benefit of MyoTrain AR. If an effect of the training intervention is observed, this evidence will be sufficient to provide funding (for example, from the National Institute of Health) for a larger randomized control trial.

The proposed research is significant because it will provide insight into one of the most critical impediments to upper limb function in arm amputees following pattern recognition control: the inability to perform real-world tasks requiring object manipulation at a desired speed without sacrificing grasp stability. If the study can demonstrate an improvement to functional performance (that is, object manipulation) using a simple low-cost training intervention, this could transform the way pattern recognition control is established and trained for upper limb amputees.

280,"Introduction; The ageing process is characterized by a gradual deterioration in the ability to defend against pathogens and a concurrent decline in the capacity to repair injured tissue, both of which contribute to an increased risk of infectious diseases. An acute increase in this risk is observed during cold seasons especially during winter months, which leads to an estimated 0.5 to 1.0 million deaths in the European Union per year. The vast majority of these infections are of the upper respiratory tract (URT).
Aims; The aim of this study is to measure the effect of the multistrain probiotic Lactobacillus casei / Lactobacillus acidophilus / Ligilactobacillus salivarius / Levilactobacillus brevis / Lactococcus lactis / Lactococcus lactis / Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis / Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum / Bifidobacterium breve / Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis / Bifidobacterium bifidum OMNi-BiOTiC® Active, on the incidence and on the duration, of URTI among older people during winter months.

Primary Outcome Measures

| Outcome Measure | Measure Description | Time Frame |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Improvement in physical function and quality of life | The effect of deep learning-supported clinical decision support for chronic pain management will be assessed using 4 outcome measures: the Short Form 36 (SF-36), 3 pain scales, and the EuroQol 5 dimensions 5 level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Each of the selected outcome measures has been extensively validated in diverse populations and is widely used in clinical research and practice for assessing patients with chronic pain. SF-36 is a standardized assessment tool that measures overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The three pain scales assess different aspects of pain and include: the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and the Mobility in Chronic Pain Scale (MCPS). These scales have been shown to have high validity and reliability in assessing pain severity, chronic pain catastrophizing, and disability due to chronic pain. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a standardized instrument that assesses patients' HRQoL and consists of five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities (including work), pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each domain is scored on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is frequently used in clinical trials and has been shown to be a reliable measure of HRQoL in patients with chronic pain. | 12 months |

285,"Research question: Can we identify the virus-human chimera DNA (vh-DNA) on early serial detection in patients undergone radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of response and recurrence? 
Prospective: Yes, single-center study enrolling patients undergone radiotherapy for HCC in Department of Radiation Oncology, National Taiwan University Hospital. 
Background and rationale: Current diagnosis of HCC relies mainly on ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Patients with small tumor may not develop obvious symptoms during radiotherapy, which makes the monitoring of tumor size and metabolic activity challenging in early radiation periods. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA fragments (ctDNA) have emerged as a promising biomarker to monitor treatment response and predict recurrence and metastasis in various tumors types. However, the detection rate of somatic mutations-specific ctDNA is limited, leading to the utilization of cell-free virus-human chromosome (vh-DNA) as a biomarker to identify residual HCC cells and recurrence. vh-DNA may offer a unique advantage over somatic mutation-specific ctDNA. Most HCC tumors harbor integrated HBV-DNA fragments within the host genomic DNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV-human chromosome (vh)-DNA may persist longer in the peripheral blood compared to the conventional mutation-specific ctDNA because of their integration pattern. 
Study design and methodology: Blood samples will be collected serially from HCC patients before, during and after RT. The captured vhDNA will be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS), which will be used for clonal analysis of tumor cells at a single junction of HBV-human chromosome. The investigators will further detect and quantify selected vh-DNA junction clone by specific PCR to monitor early changes of HBV chromosome by plasma samples. It is anticipated that the detectability and the correlation of vh-DNA clones will provide valuable and noninvasive methods to detect and monitor residual tumors and recurrence in patients undergone RT for HCC."
286,"Background
-----------------
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide . However, despite the progress in cancer treatments, the diagnosis of breast cancer and its related treatments has a significant impact on survivors' psychological responses. One of the consequences of the diagnosis of breast cancer is the disruption in the meaning of life, which is associated with psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and hopelessness . Meaning in life is defined as the extent to which individuals perceive their existence as meaningful . Meaning in life plays a crucial role in psychological well-being and mental health .
While some people report feeling a sense of purpose and meaning in life after the diagnosis of breast cancer and its related treatments, others experience a significant decline in meaning due to the diagnosis of breast cancer and its treatment . Therefore, a strong theoretical foundation is needed to investigate how people make sense of their life after the diagnosis of breast cancer.
In this study, we will examine how self-identity, values, and personal goals are affected by the diagnosis of breast cancer and its treatment.
Study objectives
-----------------
The research objectives of this study are as follows:
1. Develop a theoretical framework for the effects of breast cancer on one's identity, values, and goals.
2. Examine how the diagnosis of breast cancer affects one's identity, values, and goals.
3. Evaluate the impact of breast cancer on one's sense of meaning in life, post-traumatic growth, stress appraisal, and coping strategies.
4. Analyze the psychological consequences of breast cancer diagnosis and its related treatments on patients.

Study design
-----------------
This is a prospective cohort study design involving a mixed-methods approach. The study commenced in April 2022 and is expected to last for approximately one year. The participants in the study are individuals who have been diagnosed with breast cancer within the past five years and are receiving treatment or have completed treatment at a specific hospital. The study will include a total of two groups: an intervention group and a comparison group. The intervention group will receive a psycho-educational intervention program, while the comparison group will receive standard care.
The intervention group will be asked to complete various questionnaires before, during, and after the intervention program. They will also be asked to participate in interviews to discuss changes in their identity, values, and goals. The interviews will be recorded and transcribed for analysis.

Recruitment
-----------------
The study participants will be recruited through several methods. In the first stage, information about the study will be disseminated through social media platforms and posters placed in clinical settings. Potential participants who are interested in participating in the study will be informed about the study objectives and methods in detail. The research team will establish contact with individuals who are eligible to participate in the study based on the study's inclusion criteria. In the second stage, potential participants will be asked to provide written informed consent. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and ethical approval will be obtained from the hospital's ethics committee.
The study team will conduct an assessment of the participants' psychological health and well-being before the intervention program begins. During the intervention program, the participants will receive psycho-educational information about the diagnosis of breast cancer and its impact on identity, values, and goals. They will also be provided with strategies for coping with breast cancer diagnosis and its related treatments.
The intervention program will last for eight weeks and involve individual sessions with a trained psychologist for 60 minutes, which will be conducted at a specific hospital. The sessions will be tailored to the needs and experiences of each patient, and the participants will be expected to complete weekly homework tasks to promote their engagement and progress throughout the program.
After the intervention program is completed, the participants will be asked to complete the same questionnaires that were administered before the intervention program. The questionnaires will help researchers assess the impact of the intervention program on the participants' psychological health and well-being. Additionally, participants will be asked to participate in semi-structured interviews to discuss changes in their identity, values, and goals. The interviews will be conducted by a trained member of the study team and will be analyzed using qualitative research methods.
The data collected through the questionnaires and interviews will be used to analyze the changes in the participants' identity, values, and goals due to the diagnosis of breast cancer and its related treatments. The findings of the study will contribute to a better understanding of the psychological consequences of breast cancer diagnosis and its related treatments and will inform the development of more effective interventions for individuals diagnosed with breast cancer.

This home-based study evaluates the applicability and feasibility of conducting clinical trials at home through the application of decentralised methods. The primary aim is to evaluate remote urine collection procedures in participants with type 2 diabetes at elevated risk of kidney failure. The study aims to identify factors potentially affecting the quality or quantity of urine samples, thereby paving a path for future decentralised studies that may reduce risks and enable optimisation of healthcare delivery for certain patient groups, which may include those with type 2 diabetes. A secondary aim is to evaluate and optimise decentralised methods for the measurement of blood pressure. The study also assesses the feasibility of using telemedicine to remotely monitor the safety of medications with known kidney side effects, such as finerenone and empagliflozin. By incorporating a patient-oriented approach that includes regular questionnaires regarding the usability of the study protocol and the study devices and a thorough evaluation of adherence to study medication, the investigators will gain insights into the patient’s perspective on home-based clinical trials and inform future study designs. Ultimately, the study seeks to facilitate more efficient, decentralised research, leading to faster and more cost-effective clinical trial results for patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, insights from this study may potentially lead to a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of albuminuria and personalized treatment strategies for this patient population.

Intervention Description:: This is an open-label study. The study has 3 different phases: phase 1, baseline; phase 2, study treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg once daily; phase 3, addition or substitution with finerenone 10 or 20 mg once daily. The participants randomly will be assigned to receive either 10 mg, or 10 or 20 mg of empagliflozin once daily, and after 12 weeks, they will be crossed over to another dosage of empagliflozin and subsequently to a dosage of finerenone in 10 or 20 mg once daily. The initial dose of finerenone depends on baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measured during inclusion. 
During inclusion, the participants will undergo a washout period between the stop of their pre-existing medication and the start of the study medication according to the protocol. At this time, the participant is evaluated by a physician at least once to determine if they meet the inclusion (and exclusion) criteria.
The participants' eGFR will be assessed, and they will be allocated to one of the dosages in the study mentioned above.
They will be required to collect a morning urine sample at home every day in period A. After a washout period of three days (period B), they will start receiving study medication in period C. Thereafter, they will receive phone calls regularly to monitor adherence, ask about potential side effects, and provide feedback on the overall usability of the study. In addition to questionnaires, they will fill out an online diary about any potential side effects. On several occasions, participants will attend a follow-up appointment at the outpatient clinic, where their blood pressure, height, weight, and adherence will be assessed, and they will undergo a digital hearing and vision test.
In period C, participants will also be asked to measure their blood pressure, body weight, height, heart rate, and oxygen saturation at home at several time points. The participants will be using digital measurement devices (e.g., an automatic blood pressure monitor, digital scales, and an oximeter). This information will be stored in an electronic health journal and shared securely with the physician at the hospital.

The experimental design of this project is to compare the differences between the 5G network technology and the 4G network technology. And the results of the comparison will provide a theoretical basis for people to understand and apply the 5G network.

Background
-----------------
In 2005, the term ""5G"" was first proposed by Qing Zhao, founder of ZTE, to refer to the next generation of cellular communications after 4G technology [1]. On October 10, 2019, the 3GPP standardization organization officially released the standard of 5G new radio, marking the entry of 5G technology into the industrialization stage [2].
In October 2020, the 3GPP organization officially released 3GPP Release 16, also known as 5G phase 2 standard, which introduces additional key 5G features. And in December 2020, 3GPP organization officially released 3GPP Release 17, which is called 5G phase 3 standard, which will be used after 2023 or 5G commercial use phase 3.
However, due to the strong penetration of 4G in the communication field, many application and technical scenarios still rely on the relatively long 4G time-to-market cycle. Therefore, it is a long way to achieve the full commercial use of 5G technology . To a certain extent, it puts forward higher requirements on the implementation speed of 5G technology.
Therefore, the research project of this article is to focus on the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of 5G technology and 4G technology. And on this basis, it hopes to provide a more comprehensive analysis of 5G technology, so as to help guide the application and commercial use of 5G technology in the future.
The 5G system is based on the existing 4G system, with some advantages and disadvantages . Through the comparison and analysis of 4G and 5G, it can be found that:
In terms of bandwidth and communication speed, 5G can significantly improve communication speed and bandwidth by using millimeter waves.
In the development of the technical scheme, 5G has significantly optimized the performance of the communication network by improving the network architecture and reducing the weight of the hardware equipment, so as to accelerate and reduce the overall cost of the development of the communication network, resulting in higher profits of the operators.
The communication technology of 5G is more stable, and the network is more reliable due to the reduction of network failure or disconnection time, so it has higher practicality.
In order to support more efficient and reliable network connection scenarios, the security of the network connection needs to be upgraded in the 5G network . By adding an independent security layer in the control plane and data plane, the security of the network connection can be effectively guaranteed, and the problem of data eavesdropping can be effectively avoided.
5G will also provide more powerful and richer functions to support the 5G terminal device, which can provide better connection scenarios for customers.
The 5G network is based on new technologies such as massive access and network slicing to further improve network performance. It also has many new technologies such as millimeter wave technology, Internet of things technology, artificial intelligence technology, and virtual reality technology, which are of great significance to accelerate the development of industries such as public safety, education, industrial control, and smart home.
Due to the gradual upgrading of the communication network, many application scenarios of 5G will gradually emerge in the future. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that the 5G network is the future and the future and the future.

Output Text: The Effectiveness of Behavioral Activation in Treating Depression and Anxiety Among People With Multiple Sclerosis

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has no known cure. MS is a neurologic disease that affects the brain and spinal cord in people of any age or gender, with the highest incidence rate between 20 and 40 years of age. It affects motor, sensory, and cognitive function of patients. It has a variable course with many having mild symptoms and disability, while others experience rapid disease progression and significant physical, mental and emotional disabilities. The treatment of MS is based on the individual needs of patients and their disease course. There is no clear evidence based treatment of mood and anxiety disorders in people with MS. In spite of the high prevalence of depression and anxiety in the general population, patients with MS are known to suffer from these psychological disorders with even greater frequency than the general population. Although there are many pharmacological interventions to treat depression and anxiety and behavioral intervention to prevent and treat depression and anxiety disorders, these psychological interventions are underutilized by patients with MS. In addition, they lack data-driven research on its effectiveness and optimal treatment delivery models. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of behavioral activation, one of the most common behavioral therapies, on treating depression, anxiety, and fatigue among adults with MS. A secondary goal is to examine the mediating role of self-efficacy and behavioral activation in improving quality of life in people with MS. The third goal is to examine the role of internet based intervention in delivering the behavioral-activation intervention to better manage the mental and emotional symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders as well as to improve quality of life in this population.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) that results in physical and cognitive changes. While MS can affect patients as early as puberty, the disease is most frequent during adolescent years and early adulthood, but can also be diagnosed at any age. Amongst other things, symptoms of MS can include fatigue, depression, difficulties with concentration, memory, and attention, along with changes to physical strength, balance, pain, heat sensitivity, and bladder, bowel, and breathing problems. For these reasons, MS can lead patients to feel isolated and alone. Additionally, MS frequently requires patients to take medications that have side effects of their own, such as anxiety and depression. In spite of the high prevalence rates of depression and anxiety (40-65%), patients with MS do not receive proper treatment. According to a recent systematic review on psychotherapy for people with MS, few psychosocial interventions were found and the overall quality of included studies was rated as low. The review concludes that we need more studies on psychosocial interventions to improve the mental and emotional health of patients with MS. The purpose of this project is to examine the effectiveness of Behavioral Activation (BA) amongst adults with MS. Behavioral Activation is an evidence-based therapeutic program that has been found to be effective in treating depression and anxiety. It focuses on helping patients to identify and alter the dysfunctional behaviors and thoughts that contribute to their depression and anxiety. This is accomplished by using in-person sessions, through the internet, or via the telephone. We believe that the effectiveness of behavioral Activation is likely to be enhanced by taking an individualized approach to determine the best treatment delivery method, and by providing treatment via multiple formats to optimize treatment outcomes (ie, in-person, via the telephone, or through the internet). However, we will need evidence-based treatment programs to prove that this theory is true. For example, in patients with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety who are too impaired to come into the clinic for an intervention or to engage in cognitive behavioral interventions. Research studies have shown that BA is very effective for treating patients with severe depression and anxiety who are not able to participate in cognitive behavioral intervention (e.g., because they are not able to concentrate well enough to"

293,"Background
-----------------
Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are at risk of developing low bone mineral density (BMD) due to a variety of factors, including reduced weight-bearing activities, muscle weakness, altered biomechanics, limited mobility, and hormonal imbalances. Children with CP have been reported to have lower BMD compared to typically developing peers, with a prevalence of osteopenia ranging between 20% to 40%. Children with CP have shown to have lower bone mineral density (BMD) compared to typically developing individuals, which can lead to increased risk of skeletal problems such as fractures and scoliosis. The relationship between gross motor function (GMF) and quality of life in children with cerebral palsy is poorly understood and requires further exploration. The investigators hypothesise that children with more functional activity and a greater range of motion have higher BMD, better GMFM scores, and a higher quality of life. This study will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between bone health, gross motor function, and quality of life in children with CP, enabling us to develop personalised interventions to address these complex health issues. The investigators hypothesised that there would be a positive relationship between BMD and gross motor function. The investigators hypothesised that the bone density would be a predictor of the motor function and quality of life. Methodology 
A sample of 75 children with cerebral palsy between the ages of 7 to 10 years will be recruited from the outpatient clinics within the Egyptian National Research Centre (NRC) and Pediatric Hospital, Ain Shams University Children's hospital (CCH) and their chronological ages will be ranged from 7 to 10 years. The sample size will be based on a power of 0.8 and an estimated effect size of 0.4, according to Cohen’s d. The bone mineral density will be assessed using a DXA scan (Hologic) that measures hip and lumbar spine bone density. The gross motor function will be measured using the gross motor function classification system (GMFCS). The investigator will analyse the correlation between BMD and GMFCS using a Spearman correlation coefficient. The investigators will use the Mann-Whitney U test to assess whether there are differences in BMD between different GMFCS levels. The investigators will also analyse the relationship between BMD and quality of life using the quality of life questionnaire for children (CP QOL-Child). The investigators will use a Kruskal-Wallis test to assess whether there are differences in quality of life between different GMFCS levels. The investigators will also use a Spearman correlation coefficient to assess the relationship between BMD and quality of life. The investigators will perform a multivariable analysis to investigate whether BMD is an independent predictor of gross motor function and quality of life. The investigators will also investigate whether there are any interactions between BMD and GMFCS in relation to gross motor function and quality of life outcomes. The investigators will also examine whether age is a significant mediator in the relationship between BMD and gross motor function and quality of life. Ethical Considerations
=================
Ethical approval will be sought from the Ethical committee of the Egyptian National Research Centre (NRC) and Pediatric Hospital, Ain Shams University Children’s hospital (CCH) before the commencement of the study. Informed consent will be obtained from parents/guardians of the participants before the initiation of the study. Participants will be informed about the aims and purpose of the study, the procedures involved in the study, and the potential risks and benefits associated with participation. The investigators will ensure that the study will not cause any physical or psychological harm to the participants and will be conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the relevant institutional and/or national research committees."

296,"Anaesthetic agents (used to induce and maintain general anaesthesia) are safe and effective, however concerns relating to anaesthetic agents impacting on neurodevelopment have received increasing attention in recent years. In light of this, we are undertaking a number of epigenetic studies which aim to investigate whether the type of anaesthetic drugs used to induce and maintain anaesthesia cause changes in signals which are responsible for regulating how genes are expressed. If alterations in these signals are demonstrated, then it is possible (but not certain) that this could lead to neurological problems later in life. Studies to address these concerns are currently limited by a lack of research involving children. To address the current gaps in the literature, we are undertaking this feasibility study, which aims to assess and improve the feasibility of conducting a future paediatric epigenetics study."
297,"2007 is estimated to be the year with the highest prevalence of hypothyroidism. This number will more than likely continue to increase. Hypothyroidism can be treated with L-T4 (levothyroxine), a synthetic form of thyroid hormone. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is commonly used as a parameter to monitor therapy, although it cannot always be used to determine the thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. Free T4 (fT4) often shows high values within a few hours after L-T4 intake, whereas TSH is barely affected. These increased values may lead to undesired changes in dosage. Deiodinase polymorphisms could contribute to these altered values in some patients. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate other parameters (total T4 (TT4), total T3 (TT3), free T3 (fT3), free T3/free T4 ratio, reversed T3 (rT3), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), (acyl)carnitines, and several amino acids) which have been suggested as biomarker of thyroid hormone status. However, these biomarkers need to be investigated in healthy controls as well in order to properly determine their value in patients using L-T4. This study will assess how altered fT4 levels can influence the interpretation of the other parameters. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether a variety of additional markers can improve laboratory diagnostics in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status (e.g. central hypothyroidism). TSH will be considered to reflect thyroid hormone status reliably. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status. Therefore, the outcomes of this study will particularly benefit the follow-up of patients with central hypothyroidism in whom TSH cannot be used to monitor therapy."
298,"For the frail elderly with a limited life expectancy who suffer from a hip fracture, the optimal treatment choice is non-operative treatment: bed rest and mobilization with a walker, or even with a wheelchair. The treatment decision (operative or non-operative treatment) for this group will be discussed during a consultation or a case meeting. Most of the elderly patients and their family members or other caregivers will prefer surgical intervention, as they believe that surgery is the only option to fix a fracture. Orthopedic surgeons will have difficulty with implementing a non-operative treatment in this select group of frail elderly people with a limited life expectancy. A new treatment paradigm, consisting of an algorithm to distinguish between operative and non-operative treatment for frail patients, is recently proposed. This has resulted in new consensus protocols named PNOM (palliative non-operative management). However, this protocol has not yet been tested in a prospective cohort study. The PNOM-implementation study will test the PNOM-protocol in 10 hospitals across the Netherlands. The main design is a multicenter prospective cohort study. Our aim is to collect data about operative and non-operative treatment implementation and implementation experiences among patients and their families and healthcare providers."

Arm 1: 
Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) patients treated by Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT). AHSCT procedure allows an immune reconstitution of the patients, but it also prevents the ability of patients to mount an efficient humoral response after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, the procedure induces a deficiency of B-lymphocytes necessary for antibody production.

Arm 2: 
Participants from arm 1 (previous AHSCT patients) will be compared to SSc patients without AHSCT treatment (SSc patients without prior exposure to a procedure that affects the immune system like AHSCT). This latter group of patients may be immunogenically more efficient to mount antibodies after COVID19 vaccination.

Prior studies have shown that parental education and support improves important outcomes for the family unit and infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. The CNH platform, now called 'CHEZ NICU Home', is a custom software solution that is intended to enable parents of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to stay informed and engaged in their infant's care throughout their infant's entire in-hospital stay, and up to 6 months after their infant's NICU discharge. In the NICU, parents have limited access to their infant and are often separated from them for medical testing and procedures.  Additionally, parents often find it difficult to engage in their infant’s care due to multiple factors, including access barriers, lack of knowledge regarding the infant's medical condition, and the associated emotional challenges. This study aims to evaluate an existing CHEZ-NICU educational platform on parents of infants in the NICU, called 'CHEZ NICU Home'. The research team proposes the following aims:

A. 1) Does CHEZ NICU Home improve maternal engagement in their infant's care at the time of the infant's in-hospital discharge from the NICU?
B. 1) Does CHEZ NICU Home improve infant and child development up to 6 months post-discharge from the NICU?
B. 2) Does CHEZ NICU Home improve family health at 6 months post-discharge from the NICU?
B. 3) Does CHEZ NICU Home improve parental mental health at 6 months post-discharge from the NICU?
A. 2) Does CHEZ NICU Home, implemented in the NICU, improve quality of infant care?
A. 3) Can CHEZ NICU Home maintain the improvements seen in the previous two aims once parents transition to their infant's follow-up in community pediatric clinics?

Objective
-----------------
The research team will examine the following primary objectives:
1. Does CHEZ NICU Home improve parental engagement in the infant's care at the time of the infant's in-hospital discharge from the NICU? This objective has three separate timepoints of measurement. One of these is immediately post-discharge from the NICU, and the other two are after the transition home.
2. Does CHEZ NICU Home improve infant and child development up to 6 months post-discharge from the NICU?
3. Does CHEZ NICU Home improve family health at 6 months post-discharge from the NICU?
4. Does CHEZ NICU Home improve parental mental health at 6 months post-discharge from the NICU?
5. Does CHEZ NICU Home, implemented in the NICU, improve quality of infant care?
6. Can CHEZ NICU Home maintain the improvements seen in the previous two objectives once parents transition to their infant's follow up in community pediatric clinics?

Design
-----------------
This research study is designed as a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with NICUs as the primary unit of randomization and nested within each primary unit are the primary caregivers of the infant. After the baseline data collection, the infant or child will be randomized based on study unit (NICU) and based on their randomization into two arms, one control (standard of care) and one with intervention (intervention). All of the caregivers for the enrolled infant (primary caregivers and secondary caregivers) will be asked to participate.

Intervention
-----------------
In the intervention arm, parents will receive an offer to enroll in the CHEZ NICU Home platform immediately after consent for study participation is obtained.  Upon enrollment, parents will receive an educational module from CHEZ NICU Home, along with instructions for use and a link to access the CHEZ NICU Home platform."

305,"15% of cancer survivors are cared for by an informal caregiver. Their burden is similar to an average patient undergoing radiation, surgery or a stem-cell transplant. Distressed caregivers often exhibit depression-related symptomatology and have increased risks for impaired health status, lower quality of life, and mortality from any cause. Research is needed to identify behavioral strategies that can help improve the health and well-being of caregivers and potentially reduce disease burden and mortality of patients living with and beyond a cancer diagnosis. In response, we propose to conduct an exploratory randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a behavioral intervention designed to improve well-being among caregivers of persons with cancer. Specifically, we will test whether the intervention improves psychological distress and quality of life (i.e., social, emotional, overall) among informal cancer caregivers relative to a waitlist control group. The intervention will be delivered remotely (i.e., via videoconference) to enhance accessibility for persons from diverse backgrounds. If effective, this intervention could expand access and benefit persons traditionally left out of clinical trials such as those with lower socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic minorities, older caregivers and caregivers with mobility impairments."
306,"The investigators hypothesize that using IV TXA during GAM will lead to significant reduction in post-operative bleeding, hematoma and seroma formation, while the standard of care arm will continue to follow the current method of practice. The proposed study will compare the use of IV TXA to standard of care in patients undergoing GAM, and will also help guide which type of adjunct therapy is most effective in reducing post-operative bleeding, hematoma, and seroma formation for breast cancer surgery. While the use of TXA as an adjunct therapy in various types of surgical procedures is already well researched and common practice in other countries, there remains little evidence regarding its effectiveness in this specific population."

Background: Sudden smell loss (SL), a hallmark feature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-coV-2/COVID) and now recognized as a core symptom of long COVID (LC), frequently persists well past the initial recovery; rates of unresolved anosmia (total loss) are 21%, with unresolved hyposmia (reduced smell) or parosmia (distorted smell) even higher at nearly 50%. Patients with severe COVID-related SL/anosmia also report additional problems with mood, cognition, and sleep (e.g. LC) and these symptoms often persist well past the initial pandemic recovery period. As such, successful treatment of SL could also contribute importantly to other symptoms of LC, helping to improve these other LC symptoms.

Smell/olfactory training (ST) has emerged as a promising approach to improving SL over the past few years. However, while ST aims to improve olfactory function by enhancing the activity of a few critical brain structures, the mechanisms of its neural effects remain obscure. ST therefore requires twice daily practice over the course of 3-6 months in order to establish a lasting change. Given this burdensome requirement, successful treatment of SL is further limited by high rates of sub-optimal compliance and dropout.

The trigeminal nerve plays an important role in human olfaction and is highly interconnected with olfactory structures in the brain. A related potential study and previous clinical research support a specific role of the trigeminal nerve in olfactory-related cognitive functions. This raises the possibility that non-invasive neuromodulation of the trigeminal system could lead to better outcomes of olfactory training by improving the capacity to engage relevant cognitive processes while training.

Currently, there are no studies using the trigeminal nerve system in combination with standard olfactory training in patients with COVID-related persistent SL. This study therefore aims to determine whether a TNS-enhanced version of ST is more efficacious than ST alone in terms of its effects on SL, thereby more fully improving related functional deficits,"
308,"The aim of this study is to investigate potential differences in metabolite profiles in patients with primary insomnia versus healthy controls. The study enrolled 24 patients with primary insomnia without comorbid psychiatric disorders. OPLS-DA model was used to analyze the metabolite differences between the two groups. A total of 28 potential biomarkers were identified in the primary insomnia patients. These metabolites were associated with energy consumption, oxidative stress, inflammation, and insomnia. These metabolites may provide clues for potential mechanisms of insomnia and potential pharmacological targets for insomnia treatment.

Results: Based on the established analytic pipeline, a total of 456 metabolites were detected in blood samples. After the OPLS-DA analysis, the metabolites with VIP score >1 were selected for further biological interpretation. OPLS-DA identified 38, 5, and 5 metabolites in the primary insomnia group that were differentially expressed and associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia, respectively. A total of 28 potential biomarkers were identified in the primary insomnia patients. These metabolites were associated with energy consumption, oxidative stress, inflammation, and insomnia. These metabolites may provide clues for potential mechanisms of insomnia and potential pharmacological targets for insomnia treatment.

Conclusions: Blood metabolite profile may become a valuable tool for differential diagnosis and follow-up of primary insomnia."

310,"046726 This is an application for Project Development grant for proposed NIDA R01 Applications (K99). Dr. Yakovenko, the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes a K99/R00 application entitled “Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Using Cisatracurium to Improve Pulmonary Function and Quality of Cough in Individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Chronic Bronchitis.” Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the second most common respiratory disease and kills more people globally than tuberculosis or AIDS (WHO, 2022). Chronic bronchitis is a subset of COPD (1.7% globally) with characteristics of chronic cough and production of sputum (McDonald, 2004). Cough is generated by nerves in the respiratory tract, and patients with COPD experience chronic cough that is triggered by airway irritants, or by bronchospasm (Liu, 2020). Airway irritation stimulates secretion of cholinergic neuro-transmitters which contribute to coughing. It was not known if airway irritation also contributed to coughing in patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis. Dr. Yakovenko’s preliminary work demonstrated the safety and efficacy of cisatracurium to improve both pulmonary function and quality of cough in individuals with COPD and chronic bronchitis. In this project, Dr. Yakovenko proposes to conduct a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisatracurium for individuals with COPD and chronic bronchitis. Aim 1 will determine if cisatracurium improves the symptoms of chronic cough in individuals with COPD and chronic bronchitis via a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Aim 2 will investigate the impact of cisatracurium on airway irritability, cough, and pulmonary function in participants with COPD and chronic bronchitis. Aim 3 will explore the mechanistic mechanisms of cisatracurium for reducing airway irritability and improving pulmonary function in patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis via genome wide RNA sequencing in sputum derived airway epithelial cells.

315,"Racial disparities in autism services have received international attention and have been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States (US) President Biden’s administration, and the US Surgeon General. The CDC and US President Biden’s administration reported that Hispanic/Latino children are 1.6 times less likely to be diagnosed with autism than White children. Furthermore, a survey found that almost half of Hispanic/Latino caregivers reported barriers to receiving community resources for their child with autism. A lack of understanding of Hispanic/Latino parents’ values and priorities, coupled with insufficient cultural and linguistic understanding of the population, likely increases inequalities in care and outcomes for this population, compared to White families. Concerned that these gaps in autism services will likely affect Hispanic/Latino autistic children’s quality of life as they become adults, the American Academy of Pediatrics has proposed guidelines to increase evidence-based interventions for Hispanic/Latino children with autism, including early recognition and treatment of developmental delays. 
Ayres Sensory Integration (SI) is the only evidence-based intervention that addresses the sensory symptoms in autism. Our team is leading a national project to create culturally-adapted SI for Hispanic/Latino children, which has several goals: 1) adapt our existing SI treatment manual to create an SI manual for Hispanic/Latino families; 2) identify and overcome the barriers faced by Hispanic/Latino families and autistic children in accessing high-quality, evidence-based therapy and SI services; and 3) make a difference in the health and well-being of Hispanic/Latino autistic children. This project addresses each of these three goals. Our research team is well equipped to accomplish all three goals and has been collaborating with cultural experts and stakeholders for over five years. The investigators have developed two distinct cultural adaptations of SI (DT adaptation and FG adaptation) after extensive research into different methods of stakeholder engagement, and both approaches include multiple voices - stakeholder interviews, focus groups, and meetings with cultural experts. The DT-based and FG-based approaches will provide us with important comparative data that can help us shape our future research efforts and may be useful to others in the field.
The design thinking (DT) and focus group (FG) intervention adaptation methodologies will be utilized in this project. DT is a human-centered process for designing products, services, and experiences. The aim of the study is to design an improved version of the existing autism treatment manual by incorporating the perspectives and opinions of the user stakeholders (autistic children, caregivers, teachers, occupational therapists, cultural experts and other stakeholders) in order to make it more useful, appealing, affordable, and culturally sensitive to Hispanic/Latino families. The DT approach utilizes a 5-stage process to gain insight, define the problem, develop potential solutions, test these solutions, and refine them. The 5 stages of the DT process are 1) empathize, 2) define and 3) ideate, 4) prototype and 5) test. As per Kulkarni et al. (2021), stakeholders will be encouraged to use the DT process to think creatively and develop solutions that are likely to increase the number of Hispanic/Latino autistic children who receive high-quality, evidence-based SI services. The DT process is expected to lead to the development of a revised SI treatment manual that is more culturally sensitive and likely to be adopted by occupational therapists, caregivers, teachers, and other stakeholders involved in the care of Hispanic/Latino autistic children. 
The focus groups (FG) approach is a data collection method that has been used extensively in public health research to gather qualitative data. In this project, the FG approach will be used to gather qualitative data from a group of stakeholders (autistic children, caregivers, teachers, occupational therapists, cultural experts and other stakeholders) who are familiar with the SI treatment manual. This information will be used to update and adapt the existing SI treatment manual in order to make it more useful, appealing, affordable, and culturally sensitive to Hispanic/Latino families. This approach has been shown to increase the number of Hispanic/Latino autistic children who receive high-quality, evidence-based SI services. The FG approach has been used extensively in public health research to gather qualitative data, and has been shown to be an effective way to understand the experiences and perceptions of stakeholders, including caregivers, autistic children, teachers, occupational therapists, and cultural experts."

Nicotine Pouch, BIDI ENDS) for nicotine dependent adult smokers who have already failed to quit with NRT. We hypothesize that 4-week use of on! products and BIDI vapor products will be superior to use of a second type of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT).  Specific aims include demonstrating the use of Nicorette gum, a Nicotine Replacement Therapy, as a valid second-line treatment option for failure to quit smoking using NRT after a month of NRT use. In addition, demonstrating the use of on! and BIDI as valid second-line treatment options if NRT is not effective as a whole."

1. Blood pressure

The blood pressure of the subjects who perform the ECCT intervention will reduce the highest, followed by those subjects who perform the combination of ECCT and EMC.

2. Anthropometry

Body fat percentage, weight, visceral fat, basal heart rate and phase angle will decrease in each intervention. However, those who perform the EMC programme in addition to the ECCT programme may show greater improvements in the previously mentioned variables.

3. Biochemical

Total cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides, LDL and HDL will decrease in each intervention. However, those who perform the EMC programme in addition to the ECCT programme may show greater improvements in the previously mentioned variables.

4. Strength

Upper and lower body strength will increase in both experimental groups (MI, EMC+ECCT).

5. Performance

It is expected that the VO2 peak of the subjects increases after 12 weeks of intervention (MI, EMC+ECCT).

1. Objective

The objective of the study is to analyse the effectiveness of the EMC and ECCT programmes in terms of cardiovascular parameters, anthropometry, biochemical, strength and capacity.

1. Study design

The design of the protocol has a quasi-experimental design and is a clinical trial with three arms and parallel groups.

1. Periodisation of the study

The duration of the study will be 3 months, which will be distributed into 12 weeks.

1. Population of study

The population of the study will be adults aged between 40 and 65 years with hypertension.

1. Sample Size
The sample size has been calculated according to the following formula:
The sample size has been estimated with a confidence of 95%, a power of 80% and a beta error of 20%. 73 subjects will be required for the 3 groups (2 EMC, 2 ECCT y 1 Control group). In order to obtain a final sample size of 105 subjects (35 per group), a loss of 27% of the initial participant number is taken into account, taking as reference a review of the literature that assessed 99 dropout rates, resulting in an average decrease of 33% .

1. Randomisation

Randomisation will be carried out in the ratio 1:1:1 with the program Excel® and using RAND function. The randomisation will be carried out after the baseline assessment of all participants.

1. Concealment

The allocation of the participants will be done through a web page that will be provided with an alphanumeric code. For this purpose, a coded box will be used containing 105 cards corresponding to the 3 arms. Once the allocation sequence has been generated, the researcher will assign a code to each card. Then, the cards will be placed in alphabetical order in a box and the researcher responsible for the selection of the treatment will proceed to shuffle the box three times before blindly extracting the card corresponding to the arm on the basis of the alphanumeric code that is indicated in the box together with the randomisation table.

1. Blinding

The researcher responsible for the selection of the treatment will have previous blinding. However, the researcher responsible for assessing each participant will be unaware of the treatment allocation.

1. Stratification

The stratification factor will be based on the degree of control of hypertension according to the European Society of Cardiology (2021) classification . In this sense, there are 4 stages of hypertension from the mildest (stage 1) to the most advanced (stage 4).

1. Intervention

The multicomponent exercise programme will apply two main training units per session. This multicomponent training group will perform 2 intervention sessions per week, 1 session with a preparatory phase of 10 minutes, a main phase of 40 minutes and a post-session phase of 10 minutes; 40 minutes of strength work with two exercise, at an intensity of 50% of your 1RM.

After the multicenter campaign, during a period of 6 months
The preoperative fasting is defined as the duration between the end of the last meal (solid + liquid, as described in the preoperative prescription) and to the end of the last preoperative ingestion (if any).
A secondary objective is to evaluate the rate of nausea and vomiting of the patient as it is considered the main complication that could be caused by a too-long fasting period.
A secondary objective is to assess the length of stay in the postoperative unit (PACU, POD) and the hospital as well as the impact of fast on postoperative quality of recovery (QoR-15 score) and on postoperative surgical complications (Clavien-Dindo score ≥ grade I). 
A secondary objective is to analyse, before and after the campaign, the rate of postoperative nausea and vomit. 
The survey is planned by questionnaire, during a postoperative interview with the patient.
In terms of results, this study will inform the scientific community of the situation of fasting guidelines implementation in France. This informations will be of crucial help for all health stakeholders including physicians and their respective professional associations, the public health authority and the patients' associations. Moreover, this study will provide insights for physicians on how to improve the implementation of preoperative fasting guidelines, by the use of a multicenter campaign."

322,"Introduction: Labor pain is physiological and most women experience it. The most common pharmacological treatment for pain management during childbirth is epidural analgesia. Due to the possibility of increased risk in the mother, the increase in risk for the baby, the difficulty in administration with certain obstetrical problems, the need for intervention in the progress of labor in the last years, the need for non-pharmacological methods instead of drug intervention are increasing day by day. As a result of changes in life styles, health professionals and researchers are concerned about the need for non-pharmacological strategies to meet this need. Aims: To evaluate the effect of ice massage to hoku point and watching virtual animation on labor pain, total delivery and birth satisfaction. Methods & Design: 150 primigravid women will be enrolled in the study. 50 women are in the control group, 50 women in the ice massage group and 50 women in the virtual animation group. A birth satisfaction scale is used before labor, a digital visual analog scale is measured after arrival, an ice pack treatment on LI 4 hoku, and a virtual animation video presentation is provided when cervical dilatation was 6-8 cm. Measurements: VAS score; labor duration; birth satisfaction were measured at baseline, at arrival, at completion of ice massage or immediately after virtual animation presentation and at end of delivery. Main study findings: This study will be the first clinical trial to investigate whether therapeutic measures such as ice massage and virtual reality animation have any effects on labor pain, total delivery period, and birth satisfaction. These findings will shed light on whether therapeutic interventions are effective in pain reduction and birth satisfaction."
323,This study intends to analyze the impact of CMV reactivation on incidence of CMV disease in children liver transplant patients. We anticipate 95% enrollment rate for children ≤ 18 years of age and 80% for adults > 18 years of age. A total of 200 patients are required to enroll to generate at least 95% confidence level for the prevalence outcome in each stratum.
324,"This project will develop a critical missing element to rehabilitation; the ability to assign spatial neglect (SN) rehabilitation by identifying brain imaging biomarkers that predict optimal functional recovery following prism adaptation therapy (PAT). The 2-year project at two VA medical centers (VAMCs) will be supported by a recently developed advanced computational core at VAMC North Chicago (NNCO), and a clinician-scientists team at NNCO, the Chicago Center for Stroke, and VAMC Houston. The investigators will examine (1) brain imaging biomarkers predictive of Aiming SN, (2) the relationship between Aiming SN and functional improvements after treatment, and (3) whether behavioral markers predicting treatment response further account for treatment response than brain imaging biomarkers alone. This research is important because a personalized approach to SN rehabilitation is not available in Veteran-specific systems of care. SN disrupts functional independence for a number of basic, everyday self-care tasks (e.g., grooming, dressing) in as many as half of Veterans with right brain stroke. However, a personalized approach to SN rehabilitation is not available in Veteran-specific systems of care. The investigators discovered that spatial neglect symptoms vary across individuals, with frontal lobe damage and Aiming SN predicting optimal functional recovery following prism adaptation therapy (PAT). These findings demonstrate that identifying patients who will respond best to PAT is feasible but lacks the rigor of a biological marker. Using both advanced and clinical imaging analyses, the investigators expect to address this critical information gap and will be able to deliver a critical missing element to rehabilitation: a validated biomarker-based algorithm that routinely identifies stroke survivors with SN who are the best candidates for PAT. Armed with a biomarker-based algorithm, the investigators can then carry out a large-scale PAT clinical trial, and personalized SN care. This care pathway has the potential to reduce reliance on specialized SN assessment, coordinate VA and community systems providing Veteran stroke care, [and improve stroke care efficiency, to enhance outcomes and quality of life after stroke for thousands of Veterans] in both clinical and community settings."
325,"Background
-----------------
Gliomas are the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumors (18,7% of brain and central nervous system tumors)1. The current diagnosis is mainly carried out by means of a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image, but the tumor can sometimes be invisible due to its benign appearance, while others have a more marked and malignant aspect, which increases the risk of error since part of the diagnosis and its classification (WHO guidelines) is carried out in the first place from the type of contrast used. For this reason it is very important to be able to detect the tumor directly from the blood to avoid invasive surgical procedures in those patients whose lesions are of doubtful nature, or who have already been operated on and need to follow the oncological patient up.
For the detection of a tumor by these means it is necessary to identify circulating free DNA (ctDNA) in the blood samples. Its presence in these fluids is due to the apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells resulting in the liberation of ctDNA into the bloodstream.
This ctDNA is a heterogeneous group of DNA sequences that can be detected either by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by another more detailed method such as the digital PCR (ddPCR). The latter allows to distinguish and quantify the exact DNA sequences present in a mixture of DNA samples, which makes it an appropriate technique if we want to detect the presence of mutations in a specific group of patients and different types of tumors. 


Investigators hypothesis
-----------------
The investigators aim to perform a pilot study to analyze the blood samples taken from patients with gliomas to confirm (or not) the existence of a tumor by means of the detection of its ctDNA. For this purpose, digital PCR (ddPCR) will be carried out using a technique developed for the specific type of mutation associated with each tumor. If the results of the digital PCR (ddPCR) can predict a tumor detection through the blood sample analysis, then an alternative technique (less invasive) to the tissue samples will be available, thus leading to a change in the current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of gliomas. This new diagnostic and therapeutic strategy will prevent a delay in the onset of the first treatment, and avoid errors in the first diagnosis, thus improving the patient's quality of life.


Objective
-----------------
1. Confirm the presence of glioma cells in peripheral blood samples, with the help of the ddPCR method.
2. Confirm the grade, classification, and differentiation of tumor cells, with the help of the ddPCR method and its correlation with the results of the tissue samples analyzed by the conventional molecular techniques.

3. Compare the results obtained with the tissue samples extracted and the ddPCR method with their respective cost (in €), the time required for both procedures (in days), and the pain derived from the use of one and the other method (in points).
4. Investigate the impact (in points) that both diagnostic procedures have on the patient in terms of recovery time (in days), pain, and side effects (in points)."

327,"This is a project to analyze the effect and safety of MIYAIRI 588 in the treatment of depressive mild to medium-level patients undergoing hemodialysis. 1. Objective: To evaluate the effect of Bifidobacterium, a kind of probiotic, on depressive syndrome and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in Chinese hemodialysis patients. 
2. Research hypothesis: Bifidobacterium has a positive effect on the treatment of depressive syndrome and the improvement of risk factors of cardiovascular disease in Chinese hemodialysis patients. 
3. Background: Epidemiological studies show that the risk of cardiovascular diseases is higher in hemodialysis patients than in the general population. The incidence of depressive mood in hemodialysis patients is much higher than that of the general population. Studies have shown that there is a correlation between depression and the change of microbial composition in the body. The gut microbiota imbalance is accompanied by depressive symptoms in many psychiatric disorders. Therefore, we propose to study this correlation in hemodialysis patients. The investigators plan to analyze the correlation between microbial dysbiosis, depression and cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients, at the same time, to evaluate the effect and safety of Bifidobacterium, the effect of Bifidobacterium on hemodialysis patients in relieving depression and improving cardiovascular risk factors, to provide evidence that the investigators can recommend to the hemodialysis clinical group."
328,"We propose a combined CM-PST to improve response to CM and reduce relapse to alcohol use disorder (AUD). We have developed a manualized problem-solving intervention for substance use disorders and demonstrated its effectiveness in patients with cannabis use disorder (CUD). This 8-session intervention uses a structured 5-stage method to guide patient responses to real-world problems, and emphasize the link between problems, craving, and relapse. Specific Aims: To test feasibility and acceptability of integrated CM-PST in a sample of young adults (YAs) with AUD for whom CM alone is insufficient to reach treatment goals; To determine the impact of CM-PST on AUD diagnostic status and severity indices, alcohol use frequency, negative alcohol-related consequences, and positive affect at 3 and 6 months; and To investigate the mechanism by which integrated CM-PST increases treatment response using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess neural function in response to positive and negative emotional stimuli before and after treatment (N=40). To achieve this aims, we propose 3 specific aims: Aim #1, Formative (K99 Phase): test feasibility, determine acceptability of this new intervention, and estimate sample size necessary to power a full-scale effectiveness trial (R00 Phase); Aim #2, Effectiveness Trial (R00 Phase): randomize YAs meeting AUD criteria into a CM-PST treatment group and CM-only control group; and Aim #3, Process Evaluation using fMRI to determine the efficacy of CM-PST to modify neural target engagement of positive affect (PANAS), negative affect (PANAS), and cognitive control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), an important contributor of relapse to AUD. We will recruit and enroll a diverse sample of YAs (n= 82; 42 in treatment group, 40 in control group), who meet AUD criteria, and screened for eligibility by phone screen and baseline clinical visit, and consenting to participate (Figs. 1, 2). Study procedures will be completed remotely via zoom videoconferences or in person at a clinical lab in our university at UIC. We will test CM-PST feasibility and acceptability in formative (K99) phase by monitoring recruitment, retention, and preliminary treatment efficacy in 20 participants. Based on the results of K99 phase, we will design and conduct the R00 Phase, a preliminary effectiveness trial to pilot CM-PST and CM-only control intervention in order to inform the design of a larger phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) to be funded by the NIAAA.

Detailed Description
-----------------
AUD is a chronic, relapsing mental disorder, which is increasingly prevalent in the US and across the world. Most of drug and alcohol treatment providers across the US have adopted a medication management approach called ""contingency management"" (CM) to help engage patients, and to improve retention in outpatient alcohol treatment programs, with mixed success rates. This medication management approach typically focuses on decreasing patients' drinking frequency and increasing time to relapse, by providing small monetary incentives (e.g., gift cards) or vouchers for evidence of positive change (i.e., negative alcohol-related consequences, alcohol abstinence, engagement in treatment, and treatment retention). However, many treatment providers fail to achieve desired results with this approach alone. One reason for low efficacy of CM is that it does not address patients' underlying problem-solving deficits that often contribute to relapse. Our study proposal is designed to address this important gap and test the efficacy of a combined CM-PST approach in patients with AUD. To achieve this aim, we propose a three-part study: 1) Formative (K99 Phase): This phase will be designed to determine if the CM-PST intervention would be feasible and acceptable to our target population (young adults (YAs) aged 18-24 years old). We will also estimate the sample size required to power a full-scale effectiveness trial to be conducted during the R00 phase (aims 1 - 3). 2) Effectiveness (R00 Phase): This phase will be designed to pilot CM-PST and CM-only control intervention, and to inform the design of a larger phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) to be funded by the NIAAA. Here, we will recruit 82 YAs who meet AUD diagnostic criteria and conduct the R00 Phase. 3) Process Evaluation Using fMRI (R00 Phase): In this part of the"

330,"The purpose of this study is to determine if high fidelity and virtual reality-based simulation applications that can be used to enhance nursing student competency within the nursing education curriculum have been developed. This study will examine the difference in simulation-based learning, reflective thinking, and therapeutic communication skills between the high-fidelity simulation-based learning control group and the virtual reality-based simulation-learning experimental group by applying the simulated high-fidelity and virtual reality-based simulation-based nursing practice model for the management of a diabetic patient. The experimental model includes a virtual reality-based module with the aim of providing a learning environment that is as close as possible to the patient environment to the students. The modules will consist of a case that will include the problems, processes, and possible complications of the disease. The modular content will be based on the nursing process and will include learning videos about diabetes mellitus, as well as a virtual reality-based scenario that will include the student entering the simulated patient environment to observe, listen, talk, diagnose, plan, implement, administer drugs, evaluate, report, and reflect. While the simulation is ongoing, the control group students will receive basic training (theory). 

Breast Cancer Survivors’ Quality of Life After Breast Reconstruction

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Reconstruction after breast surgery is a part of breast cancer treatment. Breast reconstruction is the standard of care, but there is no unanimous consensus on what is the best reconstruction method. The literature on breast reconstruction surgery consists only of case reports or some series from different countries. There is a paucity of comparative studies on the effects of different breast reconstruction techniques on quality of life. To the best of our knowledge, all studies have been presented for general breast cancer women. There is no study specific to breast cancer survivors who have completed their oncological treatment course but have not completed their reconstruction. OBJECTS: For this reason, the purpose of this study is to determine which technique (latissimus dorsi, TRAM flap, LD implant) is better for patients' quality of life by measuring the different parameters of quality of life. SUBJECTS: This prospective comparative trial will include a total of 321 breast cancer survivors who have completed their oncological treatment course and decided to have breast reconstruction surgery. The study subjects will be divided into three equal random groups (n = 107). GROUND: Nipple‐areola complex‐reconstructed (NAC‐R) and prosthesis‐wearing (PW) patients in the LD group, NAC‐R and PW patients in the free flap group, and PW patients in the LD implant‐reconstructed group will be compared in terms of quality of life. MEASUREMENTS: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ‐C30) in its Turkish validity. RESULTS AND EVALUATION: The aim is to include the necessary sample size in order to achieve high‐quality evidence through a randomized controlled trial study, with a confidence interval of 95%, the study will evaluate the impact of the breast reconstruction method on patients' quality of life. The findings of the study will provide valuable information that will contribute to the literature. To our knowledge, this will be the first study comparing the effects of different reconstruction techniques and oncologic issues such as tumor type, cancer stage, oncological and reconstructive treatment, and postoperative follow‐up in patients' quality of life. METHODS AND ANALYSES: In this prospective comparative trial, latissimus dorsi (LD), TRAM (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Muscle), and LD implant (LDI) will be used for breast reconstruction. Each of the three study groups, namely, LD‐NAC‐R, LD‐PW, TRAM‐NAC‐R, TRAM‐PW, LDI‐NAC‐R, and LDI‐PW, will be compared in terms of quality of life.

331,"During hemodialysis (HD) the blood of the patient pass an extracorporeal circuit that contains a dialyzer for rinsing and a venous chamber (air trap) to prevent from air embolism through the return blood into the patient. However, air traps in clinical use have limited capacity to prevent from microemboli of air to enter the return bloodline and deposit as emboli in the body such as lungs, heart and brain. The Investigator developed the air trap Emboless that was patented in Europe, USA and India. In vitro studies showed significantly better reduction of microemboli contaminations than air traps in clinical use. The present randomized clinical trial compares two different air traps used by the same patient within 90 minutes of HD using Emboless compared with the Fresenius 4008/5008 (F5008). Chronic HD patients are randomized to perform either their standard air trap (F5008) in the venous bloodline tubing or using the Emboless bloodline and vice versa. Each patient is included two times for two series that would give a total of 120 dialyses. Each patient is included to make two paired series. A maximum of 30 patients are planned. Each with 2 series of each two different sets of air traps. 60 dialyses per patient are evaluated by paired serial analyses. A safety committee will evaluate if significantly worse outcome appears especially with Emboless.

332,"The purpose of this study is injury prevention via improving injury risk biomechanics to reduce the risk of future musculoskeletal injury. We hypothesize that non-invasive brain stimulation will improve injury risk biomechanics among individuals with prior concussion or physical activity/sport history compared to those without prior concussion. The researchers are performing a single blinded, cross-over design study. Participants will undergo two testing sessions, separated by a minimum of 3 days. The first testing session will contain dual- and single-task jump landing, the symptom checklist, and theta burst stimulation. The second testing session will contain dual- and single-task jump landing, the symptom checklist, and theta burst stimulation. The dual-task jump landing portion of the study will consist of 3 trials of single-task serial subtraction and dual-task serial subtraction followed by 5 trials of single and dual task jump landing. Serial subtraction requires the participant to verbally say a number followed by the subsequent number in sequence (e.g., 10-9-8-7, etc.). This will be performed before and after theta burst stimulation. The jump landing will be performed before and after theta burst stimulation on both days. The theta burst stimulation intervention will include the participants receiving theta burst stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and vertex (control condition). The theta burst stimulation intervention will be conducted in random order to reduce any testing session order-bias. Participants are required to take the symptom checklist immediately after the theta burst stimulation intervention. There will be a randomization of when the participants answer the symptom checklist (before or after the theta burst stimulation intervention). The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia 11 and NASA Task Load Index will be administered immediately before, immediately after, and before the jump landing after theta burst stimulation intervention. There will also be a randomization of if the participants will take any of the cognitive assessments after the first or second jump landing condition.

337,"The primary purpose of this PhD project is to measure the stress response and the influence on psychological responses in healthy young men and women. This study will contribute fundamental knowledge in psychobiology that can be translated into better understanding and treatment of stress related diseases.

A secondary aim is to identify potential biomarkers to support clinical diagnosis and monitoring of patients during the treatment of acute (post-traumatic stress disorder) or chronic (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, depression, etc.) stress-related disorders.

RATIONALE 
Stress is known to affect human health (1,2) and has become a common complaint (1). A recent review suggested that stress-related disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders (3). Furthermore, stress may also be implicated in physical health issues, such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease (2). The pathophysiology of stress-related diseases is largely unknown and few effective treatment options are available for patients (3). Recent studies have reported that cognitive-behavioural techniques, including relaxation, cognitive reappraisal and mindfulness are useful in attenuating stress-induced responses in patients with acute (i.e., post-traumatic stress disorder) or chronic (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, depression, etc.) stress-related disorders (4). Conversely, psychological, social, and economic stress induces increased sympathetic neural activity, hormonal responses and metabolic rate (1). This in turn leads to behavioural and physiological adaptations that may protect the individual against the threat of potentially lethal trauma, such as a fight or flight response (1). However, if such stress-induced changes in behavioural and physiological pathways are continuously and chronically activated, an imbalance in favour of adaptive responses in the periphery may exert a negative impact on the central nervous system. Hence, stress may result in a dysregulation of a wide range of biological functions, including the endocrine system, the central nervous system, the autonomous nervous system (ANS), and the immune system. These interactions have already been acknowledged (1), which has prompted efforts to identify biomarkers for stress (1,2,5).

While psychological and physiological stress-induced responses are well described in animal models, relatively little is known about the influence of stress on healthy individuals as well as the individualised inter- and intra-individual differences in stress responses (4). These aspects are not well captured in the current literature, in which the acute effects of most stress paradigms on the human neuroendocrine axis are still widely debated due to a wide range of study protocols (6) and confounding factors (6). The primary aim of the present PhD project, conducted by the Department of Sport Science and Clinical Biomechanics, is to contribute fundamental knowledge in psychobiology that can be translated into better understanding and treatment of stress-related neurobiological disorders (i.e., stress related disorders related to the autonomous nervous system). The specific aim of this proposal is to compare acute psychobiological responses to standardised stress-inducing protocols. While many psychological stress models have been used over the years (6,7), including the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) (8,9) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT-C) (10), most studies have only focused on a single stress test (6,11). For example, the majority of studies have focused on measuring the psychobiological responses to the TSST, while the PASAT protocol has only been tested in laboratory mice with inconsistent results (12-14). This study will assess the psychobiological responses to the TSST and the PASAT-C in healthy young men and women. It is known that psychosocial and metabolic stress are linked in humans (1) and the PASAT response was reported to be influenced by metabolic dysfunction in obese males (11). However, it is not yet known if this is also true for lean and physically active individuals. One unique feature of the present study is that healthy, recreationally active men and women aged 18-35 years will be recruited for this experiment. These individuals will be characterised by a low body fat percentage and a healthy diet. The inclusion of this population of subjects will allow us to measure the individualised inter- and intra-individual variability in stress-induced responses. For example, a recent study has provided evidence that the response of salivary cortisol to a standardised TSST protocol is influenced by high trait anxiety in men and low trait anxiety in women (15). The main reason behind the individualised differences in stress"
338,"Background:
Over the past 40 years, there has been a remarkable escalation in the incidence and prevalence of NAFLD throughout the globe. Despite its high prevalence worldwide, no effective treatment options are currently available. The only proven method to prevent the progression of NAFLD to a more severe disease is long- term weight loss, but it is very difficult for patients to maintain a significant number of weight loss due to poor patient compliance with the diet and lifestyle changes. In recent years, there has been growing evidence in support of the role of gut microbiota in the development and progression of NAFLD. Microbiome dysbiosis is characterized by a reduced degree of bacterial diversity and is often accompanied by the expansion of the hepatotropic Enterobacteriaceae family, which has been associated with the development of NAFLD.
Changes in gut microbiota composition has been demonstrated to be closely related to liver damage, while recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the increased proportion of Bacteroides and the reduced relative abundance of Firmicutes are positively correlated with both non-alcoholic fatty (NAFL) liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that probiotics/postbiotics/metabiotics could modulate the gut microbiota and in turn impact NAFLD pathogenesis. In support of this, several studies found that probiotic or postbiotic/metabiotic administration induces positive changes in the gut microbiome and improved metabolic parameters of NAFLD patients. However, due to the high biological activity and safety of postbiotics and metabiotic substances, it can be concluded that such a treatment vector will be promising in the near future.
In a recently published study, the impact of inulin and oligofructose on gut dysbiosis in fatty liver patients with mild-to-moderate NAFLD was investigated. Participants with NAFLD who consumed inulin (5.5g/day for 12 weeks) and oligofructose (5.5g/day for 12 weeks) experienced significant improvement in gastrointestinal motility and intestinal permeability compared to the placebo group. Moreover, the administration of inulin and oligofructose led to a significant reduction in LDL-C levels and an increase in Bifidobacterium ssp. counts. There was no significant effect on body weight and body fat composition in this study, which is in agreement with the recent meta-analyses. The study's findings also suggested that the consumption of inulin and oligofructose led to a reduction in triglyceride (TG) levels but has no significant effect on fasting glucose (FG) levels. These data indicate that the modulation of gut dysbiosis using inulin and oligofructose might be an effective approach for the improvement of NAFLD and its related cardiometabolic risk factors in the near future.
Thus, recent clinical data demonstrated that consumption of fibrous polysaccharides (FPS) from probiotic strains not only positively modulates gut microbiota composition, gut barrier and bacterial translocation but also induces clinical benefits on metabolic features, which underlies NAFLD development.
Given that probiotics and/or their products may exert a health benefit for people with obesity and NAFLD, a postbiotic Lysate supplementation, namely, cell lysates and DNA fragments of probiotic strain, is a novel concept of probiotic use.
In our study we will use postbiotic Lysate of probiotic strain L. delbrueckii DV-NrRLb68023 which has been shown by animal studies to reduce the hepatic lipids and normalize gut barrier function through modulation of intestinal microbial ecology in liver disease. Our purpose was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of postbiotic Lysate in participants with NAFLD in accordance with international standards of diagnostic criteria.
Hypothesis:
The present trial's hypothesis is that probiotic lysates will reduce liver steatosis in participants with NAFLD.

Study Design:
It will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate whether probiotic Lysate (postbiotics and metabiotics) may reduce hepatic liver steatosis in patients with NAFLD during probiotic lysate supplementation.

339,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) primarily affects individuals of African ancestry, and is a genetic condition that arises from a mutation of the beta-globin gene. Sickle cell VOC is the most common type of medical encounter for individuals with SCD. VOC is caused by sickling of red blood cells in the vasculature which leads to acute pain and functional disability. Many patients require ED and urgent care visits due to VOC and associated symptoms. Given the lack of effective treatments for VOC, the role of adjunctive therapies in reducing ED visits and hospital admissions for SCD VOC is of particular importance. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that places individuals in a digitized world. It has been studied as a potential therapeutic strategy for acute pain given its ability to distract individuals from focusing on their pain. Additionally, VR has been shown to reduce opioid consumption and pain in pediatric patients. This makes it a particularly relevant option for consideration in treating patients with SCD VOC in the emergency department. The aim of our study is to determine the effectiveness of VR as an adjunct to standard medical therapy for pediatric patients in the ED with SCD VOC in providing symptom relief and decreasing patient stay and rate of hospital admission.
The goal is to determine the therapeutic potential of VR and provide a promising therapy for pediatric SCD VOC patients visiting the ED. Our study design leverages resources from our institution (the University of Arizona Department of Emergency Medicine) to provide a practical methodology for assessing a promising adjunct treatment for patients with a common medical complaint.

340,"This pilot study will test the hypothesis that a low-intensive web-based cardiovascular preventive intervention, combined or not with a preventive consultation during out-of-hospital care with the ADMIT cardiovascular prevention team, will result in improved patient empowerment and adherence to cardiovascular prevention and life-style intervention protocol. 

 
Prevention is the cornerstone of secondary cardiovascular prevention. Although scientific evidence have proven the effectiveness of many of these interventions, their implementation in clinical practice has proven very difficult. As a result, the 6 years survival rate after an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is limited to 78.3 %, with a very low adherence to the prescribed pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments. 
The main cause of this failure is the lack of patient empowerment. While patients have been educated in an unprecedented way, they still are not able to translate knowledge into the proper empowerment to modify risk factors and their lifestyle to keep them under control. 
In recent years, the concept of Health Empowerment has been widely adopted, with the aim of supporting patients with life-threatening diseases to be aware of their own health status and to effectively monitor and manage their health care needs (in order to stay healthy or, when chronically ill, to maximize quality of life). In this scenario, patients increasingly use digital tools (such as e-health applications) to monitor their health conditions. 
While several studies have focused on the improvement of patient empowerment by means of specific educational digital platforms, there is still substantial lack of evidence in this field. The authors are aiming to fill this gap, by designing a digital platform for secondary cardiac prevention. The objective is to create an ad hoc website and dedicated mobile application, on which a digital cardiac preventive intervention can be delivered to post-acute MI patients. The preventive intervention will be composed by simple, short, easy to understand, educational videos based on patient’s risk factors and risk profile. This intervention will be combined or not with a preventive consultation during out-of-hospital care with the ADMIT cardiovascular prevention team, in order to identify the most effective strategy to promote patient empowerment and compliance to established protocols for secondary cardiovascular prevention. 
Due to the novelty of this approach and the lack of available clinical data and evidence, the authors propose to design and implement a pilot study to verify the feasibility and the preliminary efficacy of such a preventive intervention in a small and selected population of post-acute MI patients. The trial is designed according to the latest recommendations from the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (ConSORT) for pilot and feasibility trials. 
For the preliminary efficacy assessment, the investigators will evaluate the effect of the intervention on the patient empowerment, secondary prevention and life-style changes. 
In order to confirm the efficacy of the intervention, the authors are planning to re-design the trial as a randomized open-label pilot study, for which a larger population will be recruited.

341,"Background
-----------------
Pocket-sized ultrasound (PsUS) exams in emergency departments (ED) have recently been shown to be feasible, quick, low cost, and provide high levels of diagnostic accuracy with a significant number of potential indications to benefit pediatric patients. To date however, there has been no investigation into the use of PsUS for the detection of pediatric elbow fractures which are the most common fractures seen in the pediatric ED population.

Elbow fractures seen in children are typically closed and non-displaced. The presence of cortical discontinuities or posterior fat pad with or without lipohemarthrosis on sonogram suggest a significant elbow injury and often require orthopedic follow up in the initial stages of care, in addition to the standard history and physical exam to determine if the patient requires orthopedic evaluation or reduction in the setting of potential subluxations. While clinical exam alone can diagnose elbow fractures, many studies have demonstrated an accuracy between 55-80% when compared to radiographic evaluation. The current standard of care in the orthopedics outpatient setting as well as the pediatric ED is the initial radiographic views of the elbow in the AP and lateral projections.

While radiography is the standard and most accessible modality for evaluating skeletal injuries, it involves potentially harmful ionizing radiation and is a passive modality that requires time-consuming interpretation and reading. As PsUS technology has advanced and become a commonly used tool in pediatric emergency departments, it offers an innovative approach to evaluating bone fractures. There is some supporting literature suggesting that ultrasonography of bone injuries has the greatest sensitivity and specificity in detecting fractures of the humerus. The primary objective of this study will be to determine the accuracy of PsUS elbow exams compared to radiography (gold standard) in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow fractures through comparison to standard radiographic evaluation, using standardized projections. The secondary objective of this study will be to determine the feasibility of completing PsUS elbow exams in patients 1 to 16 years old with confirmed fractures using the Butterfly IQ pocket-sized ultrasound device.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a two-stage implementation pilot study consisting of 2 sections of the overall project:

1. A brief feasibility phase will involve the study providers receiving the elbow PsUS exam training. Once trained, each study provider will obtain 3 elbow exams of participants between the ages of 1-16 years old in an urban pediatric ED (Comer Children's Hospital, Chicago, IL). Providers will use the standardized views reviewed in the ultrasound training to perform the exam, with verbal consent obtained from each participant's parent for inclusion in the feasibility study. These images will be reviewed by study staff to ensure study providers are obtaining the correct standardized views. Once the feasibility exams are completed, the study providers will be asked to provide feedback via a written survey on the overall experience of performing pocket-sized ultrasound elbow exams and their perceived efficacy of completing elbow exams on pediatric patients 1-16 yrs old. A brief summary of the qualitative feedback provided will also be discussed during an internal team debrief meeting to make sure all providers have the information needed to complete the active phase of the study.

2. This study will consist of an active pilot study which will involve the recruitment of children between the ages of 1-16 years old with isolated, acute (less than 48 hrs) elbow pain in the setting of adequate history of trauma in an urban pediatric ED, to determine the accuracy of PsUS performed by bedside physician compared to standard radiography in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow fractures. Once obtained, bedside ultrasound providers will make a initial test for fracture as positive, negative or equivocal as determined by the bedside provider, and the patient will undergo standard radiographic imaging. Following the ED visit, the study team will review the blinded final radiology reading of the initial or subsequent radiographs to determine the patient's final diagnosis.

Objectives
-----------------
Primary Aim: To determine the accuracy (by comparison to standard radiography) of pocket sized ultrasound exams for elbow fractures in pediatric patients.

Secondary Aim: To determine the feasibility and acceptability (by qualitative feedback) of the study training and PsUS examination protocol using the Butterfly IQ pocket sized ultrasound device.

342,"İf not treated, hallux valgus becomes a painful and progressive disease of the big toe that severely restricts the patient's daily activities and disrupts the aesthetic appearance of the foot. As the deformity progresses, the patient's dissatisfaction with the appearance of the foot, difficulty in choosing shoes, difficulty in walking and in turn limitation in daily activities develops. Hallux valgus surgery is preferred due to its effectiveness and high success rate. However, conservative treatment methods are also preferred due to the possibility of complications that may occur after the surgery. Conservative treatment methods aim to reduce the hallux valgus angle (HVA) in individuals with hallux valgus deformity, reduce pain and prevent the severity of the deformity from increasing. Different orthosis applications are used in the conservative treatment of hallux valgus deformity. In the literature, it is reported that finger spreader orthosis and dynamic orthosis are effective in the treatment of mild and moderate hallux valgus deformities."
343,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of surgical treatment of Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (VPI) on speech intelligibility 1 year postoperatively evaluated through parent- and patient-reported outcome measurements including CLEFT-Q (Child Evaluation of Life Difficulties) and Intelligibility in Context Scale (IC3).
The 2nd and 4th sections of CLEFT-Q will be evaluated in this study by scoring 10 questions each, whereas the 1st section of CLEFT-Q and IC3 will not be evaluated.

The outcome measurements will be compared to a control group of children who will receive surgical treatment of VPI by nasoalveolar molding, which has a proven success rate lower than that of pharyngeal flap. However, since nasoalveolar molding is regarded as less invasive, the investigators regard children undergoing such treatment to represent a suitable control group.

Background
-----------------
Children with cleft palate suffer from velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), which results in speech impairments. VPI occurs in approximately 60-80% of all children with repaired cleft palate, and is characterized by the audible release of air during speech production through inadequate transpalatine closure of the velopharyngeal port. The most common surgical treatment of VPI is pharyngeal flap surgery. The purpose of this procedure is to increase the transpalatine pressure during speech production by creating a soft tissue flap that is folded over the posterior aspect of the soft palate. The investigators plan to evaluate the effect of pharyngeal flap surgery on speech intelligibility 1 year postoperatively by analyzing patient- and parent-response outcome measurements including CLEFT-Q (Child Evaluation of Life Difficulties) and Intelligibility in Context Scale (IC3). The effect will be analyzed preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively compared to a control group of children who will receive surgical treatment of VPI by nasoalveolar molding. However, since nasoalveolar molding is regarded as less invasive, the investigators regard children undergoing such treatment to represent a suitable control group.

The investigators anticipate that the proposed methods may lead to improved speech outcomes in children after pharyngeal flap surgery, as well as improved patient and caregiver satisfaction.

344,"There are no other study on the effects of probiotics treatment on alcohol use disorder patients. So to our knowledge this will be the first study on the effects of probiotics treatment on alcohol use disorder patients. 

Previous studies on the effects of probiotics on the general population, shows that probiotics can help treat or prevent various diseases and disorders. The underlying mechanisms of the effects of probiotics included changing the gastrointestinal flora. There are also a small number of studies on the effects of probiotics on mental diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, autism spectrum disorder, among others. These studies show that probiotics may help reduce symptoms of these diseases. However, there is still a lack of studies on the effects of probiotics on alcohol use disorder patients. There are also very few studies on the effects of probiotics on alcohol use disorder patients in the world. Most of the previous studies on probiotics and alcohol use disorder patients focused on the effects of probiotics on the general population, and did not pay special attention to patients with alcohol use disorder. In addition, most of the previous studies on probiotics and alcohol use disorder patients focused on the effects of probiotics on the severity of symptoms, but did not study the changes of microbiome in the gut of patients with alcohol use disorder. This is a randomized, parallel-group, clinical trial on 110 participants. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of probiotic treatment in alcohol use disorder patients. There is a total of 450 participants who will take part in this study, 150 each in the probiotics group, the ACT group and the placebo group. The study will last about 24 weeks, with 8 weeks of intervention and 12 weeks of follow-up. This study will be a single-blind study, and neither the researchers nor the participants will know the group to which they belong. At the beginning of the study, the participants will be randomly divided into three groups: probiotics group, ACT group and placebo group. The study participants will be assigned a study number, and the researchers will divide the participants into three groups according to the study number. To avoid bias in the experiment, the experimental design of the experimenter is double-blind. This means that the experimenter will not know the group to which the participants belong until the end of the study. All the participants will receive a 3-day probiotic trial (7 consecutive days) prior to starting the intervention to examine their tolerability. The participants in the probiotic group will receive 2 grams of probiotics per day (twice a day, in the morning and evening, for 24 weeks). Each participant in the probiotic group will receive a daily dose of 2 grams of probiotics powder mixed in water or milk. The participants in the ACT group will receive 50 minutes of ACT training once a week for 24 weeks. The participants in the placebo group will receive a daily dose of placebo powder mixed in water or milk, twice a day for 24 weeks. Each participant in the placebo group will receive a daily dose of maltodextrin powder mixed in water or milk. All participants will also be asked to complete a 28-day daily diary to record their mood changes during the study period. The researchers will also collect saliva and stool samples from the participants. These samples will be used to study the changes of microbiome in the gut of patients with alcohol use disorder. This study will also examine the tolerability of probiotics in patients with alcohol use disorder, and whether there is a relationship between the changes of microbiome and the clinical symptoms of patients with alcohol use disorder. If this study demonstrates that probiotics can improve clinical symptoms in patients with alcohol use disorder, and that this effect is related to changes in the microbiome of the gut, then this study will provide important information about the role of the gut in treating or preventing various diseases and disorders."

346,"The purpose of this study is to find out whether a certain combination of treatments (bevacizumab [Avastin®] or cetuximab [Erbitux®] with or without irinotecan [Camptosar®], and with or without a lower-than-usual dose of chemotherapy) will be the most effective for patients undergoing treatment for colorectal cancer that has grown in the liver.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Recent progress in the treatment of colorectal cancer includes the development of monoclonal antibody therapies, which can treat cancer directly without necessarily affecting normal cells. Two such therapies are available in Canada: bevacizumab [Avastin®] is generally given in combination with standard chemotherapy (irinotecan [Camptosar®], oxaliplatin and fluoronucleotide chemotherapy - FOLFIRI), and cetuximab [Erbitux®] can be given either alone (but generally without FOLFIRI), or in combination with standard chemotherapy (FOLFIRI). Bevacizumab and cetuximab both have the potential to extend a patient's life span for those who have failed 1st line chemotherapy (i.e. the initial chemotherapy used by patients with liver metastases). These agents have also been studied in combination with lower-than-usual doses of the standard chemotherapy FOLFIRI. This strategy was specifically designed for elderly or frail patients, in order to limit the adverse effects of chemotherapy on both the quality of life and the health of the patient. The preliminary results of a comparative trial of the two agents (FOLFIRI with or without cetuximab) led to the selection of cetuximab (in combination with FOLFIRI) as the best first line treatment for patients aged 75 years or less. For patients over the age of 75 the choice of chemotherapy is less clear-cut. The investigators therefore propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the activity of FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab, with lower-than-usual chemotherapy dosages (as was used in the trial comparing cetuximab vs. bevacizumab), in patients over the age of 75 and who have relapsed or progressed after a first line treatment of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion (in either the liver or other parts of the body) which can be radiologically followed using either PET-CT (positrons emission tomography) or conventional CT. The investigators will evaluate the response to the chemotherapy (including blood tests) every 2 months for a maximum of 2 years of treatment, followed by a surveillance every 4 months for a maximum of 3 years. All patients who took part in the study will be available for evaluation for a maximum of 5 years following the start of the trial.

347,"Gastric bypass surgery is regularly carried out for morbid obesity by laparoscopic or robotic technique. 2D camera systems with image resolution up to 4K have been on the market for some time and are intended to further improve the view. In contrast to this, the imaging system with which the procedures are generally carried out shows only standard 1080p HD resolution. A prospective study has already shown that the use of this camera system increases the workload of the surgical team and leads to intraoperative difficulties.

In order to improve the results of surgery, the use of advanced camera systems is increasingly gaining acceptance. However, so far, only a few studies have examined the use of such advanced camera systems in depth. 
The aim of this comparative study is to investigate the use of the two camera systems in laparoscopic procedures in order to ensure surgical safety, better surgical results and shorten surgical time. 
The hypothesis is that the use of a high-resolution 3D camera system leads to a better surgical result and a shorter surgical duration."

353,"Background of the Study: Diabetes mellitus is a common metabolic disorder which can be of various types. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is predominantly found to be a condition of insulin resistance, low secretion of insulin, or both. The incidence of diabetes is on rise in the world and is rapidly increasing in Asia. Magnesium is one of the most important cations and co-factors of several enzymes like glycolysis, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and hexokinase and also plays major role in muscle relaxation, nerve conduction, bone metabolism, adrenal function and gastrointestinal tract. Diabetes causes some dysfunctions of Mg metabolism. The aim of this study was to estimate the serum Mg level in T2DM and correlate it with the disease severity. Patients and Methods: We conducted this cross-sectional study in adult type 2 DM patients attending the Diabetic Education Clinic, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi from January 2018 to January 2021. The main objective of this study was to compare the serum Mg level in type 2 DM patients between cases and control. The secondary objective of this study was to identify the severity of disease and other co-morbidities by estimating hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), triglycerides (TGs), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL). All patients underwent a detailed physical examination. BMI was used to indicate degree of obesity. Weight was measured using a digital scale (MettlerToledo, HC 311; Greifensee, Switzerland), height was determined by using a portable portable stadiometer (MettlerToledo PS200; Greifensee, Switzerland) without footwear. A 5-mL sample of blood was taken for measuring HbA1c, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), folate, hemoglobin, urea, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) using automated biochemistry analyzer (Dri-Chem NX500, Fujifilm Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was analyzed through glucose oxidase technique. The calculated value for HbA1c was taken as the standard value. Mg level was measured by indirect titration method by using magnesium-specific reagent using colorimetric and UV spectrophotometric analysis from a spectrophotometer (Biochrom 8000, Cambridge, UK). Results: Of the 200 diabetes patients in the study, 100 were allocated to each group of cases and controls. The mean age of participants was found to be 52.69±9.05 for cases and 53.58±10.29 for controls. The mean serum Mg level was found significantly lower in cases (1.33±0.48) than their controls (1.76±0.63) (p<0.001). Mg level were found decreased as the severity of diseases increased. In cases with history of hypomagnesaemia, the Mg level was found to be significantly lower compared to those with no complication (p=0.038). Conclusion: Hypomagnesaemia is common among type 2 DM patients and increases with increasing severity of the condition. The level of serum Mg is important for DM control.

355,"1 in 5 US adults have chronic pain, which is pain that persists or recurs for more than 3 months, and this causes over 30 billion dollars in annual health care, and lost income and productivity, making it one of the most costly health conditions in the United States. Despite the high prevalence and costs, the National Institute of Health has determined that there are no effective treatments for chronic pain, nor have any medications or medical devices ever been approved to treat chronic pain. The purpose of this study is to develop and determine the feasibility of a digital therapeutic (a mobile app developed to treat a medical condition) intervention program for people with chronic pain, who are treated in a primary care setting, in order to determine whether a larger study is warranted. Specifically, the study team will design a mobile app intervention that includes health monitoring, access to an online coach, pain management education modules and interactive support, and psychotherapy-based activities based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). The study team will also use this feasibility study to test a method to use a wearable activity tracker alongside the mobile app (the mobile app will interface with the tracker in order to gather daily activity data) to see whether daily activity data can help to predict or understand patient outcomes.

356,"27 consecutive patients of either sex have been included in this clinical trial with the aim to evaluate the short, mid and long term oncologic and functional results of a newly developed anastomotic technique for the construction of a radical intracorporeal neobladder. Patients were then prospectively enrolled and stratified according to their clinical and pathological characteristics in order to obtain two subgroups according to post-prostatectomy vesico-urethral anastomosis. This study shows that the FloRIN technique, without using mono J stented, is a valid oncologic approach, both in the short, mid and long term, with a low complication rate."
357,"The objectives of this study are: 1) To assess the effectiveness of vacuum-formed thermoplastic (VFR) in comparison to Hawley’s retainers in dry and wet storage conditions based on the microbial colony counts, surface roughness, colour stability, and compressive strength. 2) To evaluate the effects of the different storage conditions of the removable retainers on dental patients. Patient recruitment: The sample size consisted of 20 participants. Twenty participants were recruited who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were successfully randomised to Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, and Group 4 with four sets of teeth models and retainers at baseline, T1, and T2. Microbial analysis: Removable retainers were sonicated and vortexed to dislodge bacteria. Serial dilution was done and bacterial suspension was pipetted on a BHI agar petri dish. Total microbial count was counted at baseline, T1, and T2 on VFRs and Hawley’s retainers that were stored in dry or wet conditions. Surface roughness, compressive strength, and colour stability: VFRs and Hawley’s retainers at baseline, T1, and T2 were tested with a surface roughness profilometer, universal testing machine, and colour spectrophotometer, respectively. OHRQoL: The OHRQoL was used to describe the effects of the different storage conditions of VFRs and Hawley’s retainers on the participants. Patients were asked to fill in a self-administered questionnaire sheet one week after the removal of fixed braces, immediately after the exchange of storage condition from dry to wet and from wet to dry, and at the final review.
Results: There is a significant p-val in all the inter-group comparisons in dry and wet storage conditions, which means the different materials and storage conditions significantly impact the microbial load of the removable retainers. It was shown that the storage conditions have a great impact on the microbial growth of the retainers and the vacuum-formed materials have a low microbial growth rate. Also, Hawley’s retainers in dry storage conditions have the highest microbial colony counts and the lowest compressive strength compared to other groups. It was demonstrated that when the materials are stored in hydration they significantly improved the surface roughness, colour stability, and compressive strength. VFRs have better surface roughness, compressive strength, and colour stability irrespective of the storage conditions and these materials have less microbial growth compared to other materials. The results showed that a significant p-val and a statistical difference exist among the different storage conditions of the retainers. The findings of this study may help to provide evidence-based guidelines for the storage method of removable retainers. Furthermore, clinicians should advise their patients to store their removable retainers dry to reduce the microbial growth and improve the physical and mechanical properties of the retainers to achieve a better clinical outcome."
358,"1-year study, N=2500: Racial minorities (African American, Native American, and Hispanic/Latino) with type 2 diabetes, with and without history of amputation. Primary outcomes: patient-reported diabetes distress (a construct of diabetes-related emotional, behavioral, and cognitive stress, with higher scores as more distress); patient experiences with ambulatory diabetes foot care (higher scores for higher QUALITY and EFFECTIVENESS of that specific foot care experience).

Detailed Description
-----------------
This study is nested within a single-site larger study (NCT02766402). The primary aim of that large study is to quantitatively describe the extent of diabetes foot complications that occur annually in a large population of patients with type 2 diabetes. This substudy is focused on a subset of patients from a single center with greater clinical burden, which is the subset of patients who already have an amputation. The primary aim of this substudy is to identify strategies to decrease diabetes distress or improve patients' experiences of ambulatory foot care by testing the effect of an educational booklet, as compared to usual care. A secondary aim is to examine whether the effect of those interventions is similar (or not) across subgroups of patients defined by race, self-reported foot problems and foot self-efficacy. We anticipate enrolling approximately 2500 individuals who will all receive the usual care intervention for diabetes foot complications (i.e., patient educational materials such as brochures and web links to educational content, as well as self-care foot interventions such as off-loading boots and nail care) at baseline. To do so, patients will be recruited from their existing ambulatory visits, such as in the outpatient clinic or prior to a scheduled procedure or treatment, based on the fact that they already have had an amputation as well as the fact that they are due to have one or more additional visits for monitoring or treatment of diabetes foot complications. Patients will be enrolled into one of 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 will include individuals who have had a prior minor, uncomplicated amputation (e.g., of a toe or heel) and are therefore considered to be at lower risk of future complications, such as another amputation. However, the purpose of the usual care intervention for these patients is to prevent future higher-risk complications such as additional amputations. Cohort 2 includes individuals who have had a prior major amputation, such as those who had a transfemoral or transtibial amputation, to prevent rehospitalization due to foot complications after one of those major surgeries. This substudy's secondary aim is to see if the effects of the booklet in improving diabetes distress or patient experience with ambulatory foot care are similar (or not) across subgroups of patients defined by race, self-reported foot problems and foot self-efficacy. We will also see if these effects are sustained at follow up at 1 month and at 3 months after enrollment.

359,"The purpose of this study is to examine the hemodynamic effects of modulating circulating ketone bodies in subjects with chronic heart failure. The investigators hypothesis is that 1,3-butanediol will increase cardiac output without increasing heart rate in stable HF subjects as measured by transthoracic Doppler ultrasound. The investigators are also examining the metabolic effects of 1,3-butanediol. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following research question: In stable heart failure subjects compared to placebo, will treatment with 1,3-butanediol increase cardiac output without increasing heart rate without increasing heart rate or oxygen consumption as measured by transthoracic echocardiography over a 6 hour period? The study proposed herein is specifically designed to address this question in this target population. Successful completion of these studies will lead to the development of a novel therapy for HF based on increasing cardiac output without increasing heart rate. The investigators would like to emphasize that this study does not require additional time commitment from HF subjects, as it will be implemented and completed as a part of the routine clinic visit.

The local anesthetic Marcaine has been extensively studied in plastic surgery procedures to evaluate its use for post-operative pain. Marcaine is typically injected into the surgical site in order to aid in pain control and improve outcomes. We hypothesize that injections of Marcaine beneath the pectoralis major muscle and fascia will aid in post-operative pain control and allow patients to have quicker return to full activities. The investigators will perform a prospective, double blinded, placebo controlled, randomized trial to evaluate the impact of Marcaine injection on post-surgical pain control in adolescent girls undergoing reduction mammaplasty.

Breast reduction surgery in adolescents: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial to investigate the role of intraoperative subpectoral levobupivacaine in postoperative pain management

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Breast reduction is one of the most common breast surgeries performed in adolescents. While complications are infrequent, postoperative pain remains the major patient concern. Opioid use remains high postoperatively. We propose a prospective, randomized, double-blind, levobupivacaine-placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effect of subpectoral intraoperative levobupivacaine in reducing postoperative pain, opioid use, and quality of life measures in breast reduction surgery in adolescent patients. After enrollment, 50 adolescent breast reduction patients will receive placebo or subpectoral levobupivacaine injection on one side of the breast at the end of their surgery. Study personnel will be blinded from intervention allocation. Patients will be randomized to subpectoral levobupivacaine or saline injection. Patient demographic and clinical data will be collected after consent is obtained. Baseline visual analogue scale (VAS) and morphine equivalent opioid (METO) consumption will be recorded preoperatively. Patients will be contacted 1-2 days after breast reduction surgery for a standardized telephone interview with a trained research staff member. Postoperative opioid use and VAS scores, and quality of life measures will be collected at 2 and 4 weeks.

Brief Summary:: In this study, the investigators will assess skin reactions after the introduction of a new treatment planning technique called Spot Delete. The Spot Delete technique reduces the amount of radiation that stops in the area just below the skin. It is believed that this may reduce the risk of skin redness, also known as radiation dermatitis, which has previously been a side-effect of proton therapy. The investigators will measure the severity of skin reactions using photographs and clinical assessments, and will compare these results to historical occurrence rate of skin reactions in patients who did not receive the Spot Delete technique. The results of this study will provide information about how the Spot Delete technique affects the risk of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients who undergo proton therapy.

364,"1. Background and Rationale: T'ai Chi, the supreme mind-body integration exercise, is a gentle form of martial arts that includes both physical and mental elements. The ancient practice is designed for optimal performance and longevity for all ages and physical abilities. The form developed by Yang Style Tai Chi is comprised seven major sections: (1) The Five Steps, (2) The Seven Stances, (3) The Six Coordinations of the Arms, (4) The Eight Postures of the Hands, (5) The Five Sword Forms, (6) The Three Circle Forms in T'ai Chi Kuan (Cannon Fist), and (7) Silk Reeling, also known as Chi Kung. T'ai Chi not only teaches physical movements and skills, but the practice also helps improve concentration and focus. As a mind-body integrative exercise of martial arts, Yang Style T'ai Chi trains both internal and external skills. The movements require balance within the body while in motion. The practice also fosters physical flexibility and strength. It is a well-defined, holistic movement practice that is designed to enhance health and well-being. The gentle form of movement proposed to be studied in this research is adapted from the WaQi program. The program is taught online and requires no difficult movement transitions, but still contains all essential parts. A large body of scientific evidence has supported the numerous benefits of T'ai Chi. A systematic review of 46 studies covering more than 3,000 participants aged 60 and over who practiced t'ai chi found that the exercise can reduce the risk of falls and falls-related injuries. The practice was also found to increase postural stability, hip strength, mobility, and balance. More recent research on the benefits of t'ai chi on mental health, particularly anxiety and depression, has been growing. In a recent study of 125 individuals aged 40 to 70 years with mild cognitive impairment, practice of t'ai chi was found to improve cognitive function. The results have significant implications on the potential application of t'ai chi on managing a variety of conditions in older adults. 
2. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of t'ai chi and qigong exercise (rehabilitation), as a mind-body integrative exercise, on alleviating pain and improving quality of life among those with chronic back pain. More specifically, this randomized control trial will explore whether a safe and moderate online t'ai chi and qigong exercise program, offered without cost to individuals with chronic back pain, improves pain levels, sleep and quality of life. The investigators also wish to ascertain, if any, whether improvements in pain levels are different among smokers and those with unhealthy BMI than among others. 
3. Specific Aims and Research Questions: The investigators have two specific aims: 1 To determine whether a free online t'ai chi and qigong exercise program, offered without cost to individuals with chronic back pain significantly improves pain levels, sleep and quality of life. 2. To determine whether improvements in pain levels are different among smokers and those with unhealthy BMI than among others (with healthy BMI). 
4. Methods: This research will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two groups: a t'ai chi and qigong exercise (treatment) group and a waitlist control group. The treatment group started the t'ai chi and qigong classes in September 2022; the waitlist control group was offered instruction beginning in January 2023. The investigators are conducting this RCT based on the concept that patients with chronic back pain can obtain similar health benefits through online t'ai chi and qigong classes as those in traditional in-person classes. The online t'ai chi and qigong classes will all be taught by a certified t'ai chi and qigong instructor, Master Yang Yang. All classes will be taught on a Zoom platform. The treatment group began t'ai chi and qigong classes in September 2022. The classes started with 20 minutes of stretching and qigong that includes both gentle meditative exercise and standing meditation. The t'ai chi movements that involve both meditation and mindfulness were taught in the first three weeks. The training of self-awareness was designed to help individuals with chronic back pain realize the value of mindfulness and mind-body integration in helping to manage symptoms of chronic pain. The first part of the curriculum emphasizes the importance of deep breathing and slow movements to help the body relax.

365,"1. Objectives To study the acute clinical profile, symptoms, signs and results of image techniques of stroke/TIA associated to AFAbl (or technically akin procedures such as left atrial macroreentry mapping and ablation). To study the acute therapeutic management of these events. To study the sequelae and clinical consequences at 3 months of follow-up. To study whether the risk of stroke/TIA is more frequently associated to any AFAbl technique. To study whether the severity of stroke/embolism is associated to any specific ablation techniques. To study other procedure-related aspects as predictors of stroke/TIA. 2. Study design Observational and retrospective. Participating centers will be asked (1) to gather general data about the center through an online survey and (2) to provide individual patient data about their symptomatic patients. All individual patient data will be collected through an online DCL. Each patient is represented by a case report (APPENDIX 4) that reflects the data derived from the patient history. 3. Expected results The EMBOL-AF project aims to be the largest international registry about embolic complications associated to catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (and akin procedures). The primary objective of the registry will be to gather data about all the events that occurred during the study period. These data will be subsequently analyzed in an exploratory manner. However, these data will be extremely valuable because they will provide unbiased data about real-world settings. Therefore, we expect that the EMBOL-AF international registry will provide information that cannot be obtained through other types of clinical trials.
3.1. Estimated sample size None. The observational nature of the study predetermines infinite total sample size. The study is expected to include data about between 50 to 100 registered patients per center (this figure is expected to be adjusted after data monitoring and adjustment of data collection plans). However, it is expected that only one-third of total patients undergoing a catheter ablation procedure for AF will suffer a embolic event (i.e. stroke, 3-month deficit > 2), yielding a total sample of 1,000."

Intervention Type:: Behavioral
Intervention Description:: Our study will be conducted at the Sleep Lab. The lab includes an office for the Sleep Study Coordinator (SSC) where consent forms and study documents will be kept. There is a consultation room for patients to discuss the study with the research assistant before their participation in the study, and a room for conducting the PSG. All data collected will be used solely for the study and will not include patient identifiers. The data will be analyzed and reported in aggregate format only and will not contain any identifiers, such as patient names, social security numbers, or other unique identifiers. The raw data will be stored on a server that requires an encrypted password for login. The study is proposed to be a randomized controlled trial with 31 participants. Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups, i.e., 16 in each group, that will be administered one type of treatment. One group will have access to hypnotics or other sleep medications, and the other group will receive active treatment (e.g., psychological/behavioral therapy). The hypnotics are usually prescribed in doses between 25 and 300 milligrams administered once or twice a day; however, dosages may vary depending on the severity of the patient’s symptoms and may be increased slowly as instructed by their healthcare providers. The behavioral treatment will include psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, stimulus response treatment, sleep restriction, relaxation techniques, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), and so on. Each participant in the study will have three visits. The first visit will be the initial screening visit to rule out any secondary causes of insomnia. In this visit, the patient will be screened for any psychological or medical issues that could interfere with the study’s objectives. The SSC will also make sure that each potential patient understands the nature of the study and its limitations and is willing to accept their randomization assignment. The second visit is the initial evaluation visit. In this visit, the SSC will perform a complete history, physical examination, and PSG. The SSC will also explain the study procedures to the patient, and the patient will be asked to sign an Informed Consent Form and HIPAA Authorization Form. The third visit will be the follow-up visit. In this visit, the SSC will perform a complete history and physical examination. The data collected from each visit will be used for measuring the outcomes of the study. We will use several methods for data collection, including patient self-reporting, PSG, and other questionnaires. The patient self-reporting includes a sleep diary, which the patient will be asked to complete every day for one week before the initial evaluation visit and one day before the follow-up visit (Figure 1).

367,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men worldwide, with approximately 250,000 new cases in the United States every year. The primary treatment for men with localized prostate cancer is radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, with hormonal manipulation therapy reserved as adjuvant therapy for men with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, one of the most common adverse effects from androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is cognitive decline (CD). The cause of CD among prostate cancer men is not well understood, though it has been theorized that the pathogenesis of CD following the initiation of ADT involves multiple mechanisms, including direct toxic effects on neurons and vascular changes in the brain. Recent studies in patients with prostate cancer found a decline in blood Aβ42/40 ratio after ADT therapy. Aβ42 is the most abundant protein in the brain, whereas Aβ40 is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. An Aβ42/40 ratio is used to estimate CSF amyloid-beta levels at clinical centers for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, we aim to measure the Aβ42/40 ratio at baseline and during 12 months of ADT therapy using a validated, non-invasive plasma assay to discover whether this ratio is decreased following ADT, and if an ADT-induced decline is associated with the development of CD. In addition, we aim to discover if there are other clinical, demographic, genetic, or metabolomic characteristics that are associated with CD. We believe our results will enable better prediction and prevention of ADT-induced CD."

Cycle 1 will consist of three to five days of oral oestrogen followed by 24 days of oral progestogen plus daily placebo tablet. In cycle 2 participants will receive an alternate progestogen tablet every evening for 24 days plus daily placebo tablet. In cycle 3 participants will receive a subcutaneously injected progestogen every other day plus daily placebo tablet. Blood samples for the measurement of progestogen and oestrogen serum levels will be obtained and cycle data will be collected on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and the last day of active medication in cycle 2 and 3. Additional blood samples and the collection of vaginal cells will be obtained on Days 1-10 of the three active medication cycles."
369,"Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong disease, especially in children. To continue this lifelong treatment, the family must be active in the treatment process. They should be able to monitor their blood glucose in order to regulate their insulin doses according to their lifestyle habits. Parents and children need to work together to do this. Diabetes health literacy is defined as the educational knowledge and skills specific to the treatment process of diabetes and is expected to achieve positive treatment results with the support of the child's family. If we look at the literature, no board game has been developed in Turkey for the treatment of children with type 1 diabetes from health literacy point of view. With this research, it is planned to support a healthy child with type 1 diabetes and his / her family with the diabetes health literacy board game that will be developed.
-----------------
The aim of this research was to develop a health literacy board game for school-age (8-12 years) children with type 1 diabetes and to present it to them through the use of social learning theory. As a result of the literature review before the practice, it was revealed that the social cognitive theories presented the most valid and reliable models in terms of behavior change. Especially the social learning theory, where behavior change is achieved by social interaction, has become a widespread practice in the field of health education. The application of the social learning theory in the field of education has also been successful. It aims to support learning based on observation and modeling practices. Another important point in health education is that children must be involved in the learning process.

In this study, the development of diabetes health literacy board game will be applied with social learning theory based on the principles of health education. The Health Literacy Board Game (Health Literacy Board Game) created in Turkey will be implemented. It is a board game that focuses on health education for children with type 1 diabetes and their families. It will be created in line with social learning theory, current literature and expert opinions. The game will be evaluated in terms of its validity, reliability and ease of use. The participants of the project will be children with type 1 diabetes aged 8-12 years and their families from different cities of Turkey. The participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group will receive diabetes health literacy training through board game. The control group will receive the standard program.

370,"18-99 year old subjects undergoing dental implant procedures in the University of Zaragoza (Zaragoza, Spagna) are invited to participate in this study. Patients who agree to participate will be divided into two groups: group 1 will have titanium dental implants placed with final restoration, group 2 will have zirconia dental implants placed with final restoration. At three months, after the implants are placed, a biopsy will be obtained from the gingival sulcus adjacent to this implant, which will be analyzed using culture, quantifying the amount of bacteria present. During the 12-month study period, follow-up will be carried out every 2 months, from a distance of 2m. The final restoration is not to be opened until the follow-up visit after 1 year. The clinical parameters that will be analyzed include: clinical photos of the implant and adjacent areas, probing depth, gingival bleeding, marginal bone loss around the implant, plaque index and keratinized gingival from the point halfway between the vestibular gingival margin and the mucosal line at the point where the implant will be placed at the time of crown placement. In addition, culture with 2 sterile paper strips will be carried out for microbiological analysis, which will be made by comparing bacteria species present in the samples before the placement of the final crown, at 6 months and at 12 months after crown placement."
371,"Dental fear in children and adolescents usually begins at the age of six years. The prevalence of dental fear vary, but according to a study published in The Journal of American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (JAAPD), the prevalance in children is about 8 - 10 percent. The prevalance can be higher in patients who suffer from other diseases, such as asthma and intellectual development. The study will randomise 60 children, aged from six to nine years old, from two groups. All children need extraction in a primary molar. One group will inhale rosemary essential oil using gauze containing two drops of the essential oil before dental anesthesia and extraction of a primary molar. The control group and the rosemary group will be subjected to the Wong Baker Faces Scales before the procedure. After the procedure, children from the two groups will be subjected to heart rate, blood pressure, and the Wong Baker Faces Scales. After the dental procedure completion, the parents will fill a behavior rating scale (BRFS), based on the Frankl model, which is a scale describing the different levels of anxiety that the child presents while going to a dental office."
372,"1. The objective of this study is to investigate how the learning environment affects the understanding and implementation of concepts during student education. 
Purpose: To increase the learning of nursing students by providing an enriched learning environment. 
Research Methods: First, the effect of an innovative method, brainstorming, on the learning-sharing behaviors of university students in the nursing field, and the factors that affect them, will be examined. In the study, students will be exposed to an experiment and a control group. In the experiment group, brainstorming education will be given to nursing students before conducting a case. The control group will be given training with traditional teaching methods. An independent variable called treatment program will be applied to both the experimental and control groups. In the pretest and posttest, learning behaviors, cognitive and learning factors and demographic features will be evaluated using the Learning Preference Scale for Nursing Teacher and Learner (Berkson-Tang, 2009) and the Learning Style Scale (Jangran-Chow, 2011). The qualitative research technique will be used in-depth interviews. In-depth interviews will be used to understand the thoughts of the people included in the study.

BACKGROUND: Smartphones are the technological devices of our age that are constantly developing and their use is becoming more widespread every day. Nowadays, many transactions from shopping to banking activities, playing mobile games and taking photos can be done easily with smart phones. Smart phones, which make positive contributions to daily life, attract great attention by individuals of all age groups, especially young people. According to Newzoo's report, the number of smartphone users, which was 3.5 billion in 2020, is expected to reach 4.1 billion in 2023. Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing fast access in transactions, ease of use and sometimes a status indicator, can pose a risk for addiction when used uncontrolled. Smart phone addiction, although not yet clearly defined; It can manifest itself with symptoms such as constantly checking the phone, feeling restless when staying away, withdrawing, mood changes, not being able to control the duration of use, disruption in daily life due to problematic use, constant desire to use and pleasure from use. According to the behavioral approach, if a person takes pleasure from a behavior or avoids negative emotions with this behavior, this situation turns into a habit in the individual. Uncontrollable and frequently repetitive habits carry a risk for addiction. Smartphone addiction, in addition to being a behavioral disorder, can cause many physical, social and psychological problems. Problematic use of the smartphone; decrease in sleep duration and quality, height, wrist, thumb and shoulder pain , dry eye syndrome, and eye fatigue, decreased physical activity, as well as depression, social phobia, loneliness, and decreased academic performance can bring along many psychological and social problems. In studies conducted with students, it was stated that poor sleep quality negatively affects academic performance, while good sleep quality increases academic performance. A study conducted with adolescents stated that poor sleep quality was associated with low self-esteem and increased levels of anxiety and depression. Nurses, who serve almost all of the society, have an important role in defining risky health behaviors and planning and implementing appropriate interventions for behavior change. For this reason, nurses need to make an effort to find the most appropriate behavior change approaches for the individual. Today, the Transtheoretic Model (TTM) is widely used to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which aimed at the initiative suitable for the change phase of the individual, is used as a guide that facilitates behavior change. TTM is a cognitive-behavioral model that accepts that any behavioral change in an individual does not happen all at once, but that behavior change includes different stages and processes. Change in traditional behaviorist approaches; In this model, change focuses on helping individuals willingly make behavioral change and understanding the change process. In other words, it does not classify individuals only according to whether they can perform a certain behavior, but also according to the stages passed in the behavior change process. While TTM creates a roadmap in change, there are also approaches that contribute to and accelerate this change and support the individual who thinks about change. One of these approaches, which is used more frequently in addicted individuals, is the motivational interview method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and can be an effective communication technique for nurses in providing behavior change. Motivational interviewing as defined by Miller; It is a client-centered interview form in which suggestions are made to provide behavior change by helping individuals discover and solve their problems. In motivational interviewing, the expert is the consultant, but the consultant does not assume the role of the knower, is not ready before the client, does not impose his own thoughts, wherever the client is, the consultant is directed there. Solving problems in motivational interviewing is the client's job, not the counselor's. Direct persuasion, aggressive confrontation and discussion are the conceptual opposites of motivational interviewing. Motivational interviewing is accompa- niment and non-judgmental acceptance. In the interview, the energy of the client should be used and his desire for change should be revealed. motivational interview; It is a partnership-friendship relationship rather than an expert-recipient role. The counselor should respect the client's autonomy, freedom to make choices and bear the consequences. Nurses, who have very important roles and duties in the provision of health services to the society, undertake important duties not only at the point of care for the sick individual, but also in the fight against situations that threaten public health. In particular, public health nurses interact not only with patients but also with the entire society they serve, as they work in primary health care institutions"

Ingestion of a combined lactate and ketone body ester could allow the human body to access and utilize a more efficient fuel that could potentially ameliorate some of the metabolic defects associated with obesity.

382,"27.8% of NHS staff working in clinical and care environments are either overweight or obese. Genetic testing provides employees with information on how their diet, sleep, and exercise choices may impact their health and well-being. This can empower employees to take a more proactive approach toward their health and well-being, possibly motivating them to make positive changes to their lifestyle. As previous research has highlighted a correlation between personalized recommendations and an improved quality of life (including physical and psychological well-being), the investigators hope that this data will be a catalyst to enable people to achieve this. If the quality of life improves for NHS staff, it is likely this will have knock on benefits for both themselves (reduced stress/burnout, improved lifestyle and health) and for their patients (increased empathy and understanding from more rested and less stressed staff, as well as improved adherence to medical advice). All participants will have their DNA tested and receive personalized lifestyle recommendations. The investigators will assess changes in well-being and perceptions of genetic testing following the delivery of these recommendations."

Tendinopathy is a pathology resulting from an excessive or prolonged load of the tendon, which results in a non-inflammatory lesion with degenerative reparatory inflammation. The vast majority of patients are middle-aged, the average age of consultation being 45 years, but it can occur in the general population. 
Dexamethasone injection has been one of the most used treatments for several years because of the ease of performing the treatment and the very encouraging results obtained in the majority of cases. 
However, despite good effectiveness after a single injection, multiple injections are not recommended because of the risk of corticosteroid-induced adverse events and especially iatrogenic tendon rupture.
The technique of injection guided by ultrasound is recommended, it can be performed with a syringe or with an injectable.
It would be interesting to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of this treatment. 

Input Text: Intervention of the intestinal microbiota after the administration of ciprofloxacin

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The administration of ciprofloxacin is associated with a modification of the intestinal microbiota and its antibiotic effect is reinforced by the destruction of protective layers of bacteria in intestine.

Detailed Description
-----------------
A study was carried out in healthy volunteers, in which a one week course of ciprofloxacin was associated with an increase of the expression of proteins involved in the digestibility of dietary fibers by increasing the microbiota fermentation. Moreover, the administration of ciprofloxacin is associated with a modification of the intestinal microbiota and its antibiotic effect is reinforced by the destruction of protective layers of bacteria in intestine. The aim of the study is to evaluate the long-term impact of this intervention on the composition of the intestinal microbiota and its association with health indices and the response to an antibiotic challenge.

388,"Lung transplantation (LTx) remains the standard treatment for end-stage respiratory diseases. In recent years, lung transplantation technology has been greatly developed. Transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBCB) is a kind of method to obtain the lung biopsy samples in LTx, which has the advantages of non-invasiveness, high safety and easy to operate. TBCB combines the advantages of bronchoscopic biopsy and traditional open lung biopsy, so it is widely used. The previous clinical studies about TBCB in LTx have found that this method is relatively safe and has diagnostic value in pathological injury and viral infection. However, TBCB has not been confirmed as the preferred method for monitoring acute rejections (ARs) after transplantation, which are one of the reasons for the rapid increase in 1-year death rate among LTx patients. Previous clinical studies found that ARs are mostly caused by cellular rejection (CR). However, in recent years, there is increasing evidence that the presence and degree of humoral rejection (HR) strongly correlate with the occurrence of BOS and even worse prognosis of LTx. ARs have high diagnostic value for monitoring pulmonary function. However, there are currently no uniform standards for the diagnosis of ARs in lung transplantation. The gold standard for the diagnosis of ARs is the lung transplantation biopsy test, but the lung transplantation biopsy test is an invasive tissue diagnostic test with a low diagnostic rate, a postoperative complication rate of 25%, and an average of 31.2% of surgical mortality. It is generally recommended by all transplant pathologists. For biopsies of 1.5cm to 2cm, the number of specimens required is 4-6, and TBCB can obtain specimens of 3.5mm X 3.5mm X 2.5mm and easily obtain more than 10 samples. Therefore, TBCB has also become the first choice for the diagnosis of ARs based on invasive tissue diagnostic standards and is widely used. However, there is still a lack of prospective randomized controlled studies on the use of TBCB in the diagnosis of ARs of LTx. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the diagnostic efficacy and safety of TBCB for the diagnosis of ARs of lung transplantation compared with the traditional biopsy forceps, aiming to provide high-quality evidence for LTx management.

389,"The investigators aim at investigating and optimizing the outcome for twin pregnancies based on placental parameters and fetal ultrasound features. We will additionally further our understanding of the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and parent-to-infant(s) attachment in the sFGR setting. Through our investigation we will generate a large database which can be used, both nationally and internationally, to investigate determinants of perinatal health and disease. These will help to optimize pregnancy management.  The investigators expect 1080 parents to consent for participation during the inclusion period. The investigators envision that approximately 50% of the participating couples will experience some kind of adverse event. The observed rate of complications of this type is likely to be on the high side, as this includes miscarriages due to (unplanned) elective birth(s) below the 32nd week of gestational age. The actual number of preterm births (indicated and due to sFGR), will likely remain the same as before. However, since an iatrogenic early birth is very often preceded by an in-depth conversation between the caregiver and parents (during which all the possible risks for the baby(ies) and mother are discussed) and may lead to PTSD, the investigators will likely be able to detect more cases than before the study."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) are two of the most common behavioral addictions worldwide with a significant negative impact on the individuals' psychosocial functioning, health, and well-being (Saha et. al., 2018; Grant et. al., 2018). AUD and CUD often co-occur in the same person; when this happens it is referred to as co-occurring AUD and CUD, or co-occurring substance use disorders. The presence of a CUD is associated with greater severity and poorer outcomes of an AUD. As such, it is of fundamental importance to tailor treatment strategies to best suit the patient in recovery. Recent neurophysiological and neuroscientific advances have begun to delineate how the brain and underlying mental processes may differ among individuals with a primary AUD versus those with a primary CUD (Jager, 2017), as well as how comorbidity of disorders may impact patterns of brain activity (Jager, 2017). Further research is needed to better understand the factors that underlie individuals with comorbid AUD and CUD.

An individual’s personality (e.g., impulsivity) is one possible factor that may predict the development of an AUD (e.g., Gini et. al., 2010), whereas other factors such as underlying biology (genes) (e.g., Zietsch et. al., 2017) and the early environment (e.g., family history, parenting style; e.g., Riley et. al., 2014) may impact an individual’s likelihood of developing a CUD. While these factors have been studied using independent methodologies, they have not been studied simultaneously. Consequently, the nature and magnitude of these predictors in co-occurring AUD and CUD is less clear. Importantly, the potential interaction between risk factors (e.g., genes, early environment) and brain structure (i.e. white matter microstructure) in predicting treatment outcomes has not yet been studied in the context of co-occurring substance use disorders. Using a multi-modal approach that includes behavioral assessments and brain imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we will explore factors underlying alcohol and cannabis use disorders and how these factors might differ between individuals with AUD and those with CUD, and then predict treatment outcomes. The findings from this research will be used to better understand how these risk factors (e.g., impulsivity) and protective factors (e.g., cognitive flexibility) come together and interact to give rise to specific neural activity patterns during alcohol or cannabis use disorder treatment. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop intervention strategies tailored to the individual.

For example, when quantifying the perception of pain with a numerical scale, the variability depends on factors such as the intensity of the stimulus, volunteer concentration, and emotional state, among others. In general, we cannot always rely on subjective data, especially if we want to establish a causal link between several variables. Objective electrophysiological measurements may provide more reliable results than conventional methods but they are also subject to several inherent errors. In some cases, electrode positioning is crucial, and small variations can produce different effects. In other cases, stimulus modality must meet certain characteristics, otherwise the signal does not appear or is unreliable. In other cases, the experimental conditions must be strictly controlled to achieve a desired level of reproducibility, such as in the measurement of temperature with a water bath, for example. 

Thus, a wide variety of experimental designs with a high level of reproducibility are needed to confirm results and contribute to the understanding of the various biological processes that occur in the human body.  In this context, one of the objectives of the proposed research is to evaluate the reproducibility of the experimental results obtained in a previous study (see corresponding protocol No. NCT02781983). Our proposal is the following: To characterize brain response evoked by radiofrequency and pinprick stimuli in humans. 

In this proposal, we aim to assess the accuracy of the neurophysiological methodology to evaluate the nociceptive system. We propose two experiments with different types of stimuli: the first is the repetition of a previous study with radio frequency electrical stimuli and the second is a new experiment with mechanical pinprick stimuli. A device has also been developed to perform this type of stimulus in an automated manner.

399,"1) Background: TBI is a major problem both in the military and the civilian population. Up to 10% of patients with a TBI incur disabling long-term sequelae. Mechanisms of injury and healing are not fully known, and clinical management is limited. Many patients with mild TBI do not heal well, resulting in long-term physical and cognitive deficits, which can limit employment, schooling, and quality of life. Understanding neural changes that occur early after injury may help clinicians to make more informed decisions about when these patients can return to their normal activities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and skull will be used to measure the time delay needed for the brain to catch up with the skull when mechanical vibrations are applied to the skull. This measurement uses a technique called magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). The brain tissues lag behind in motion compared to the skull, which means that the skull and brain are not tightly coupled. How tightly the skull and brain are coupled is an indicator of the biomechanical condition of the brain after injury. Tightly coupled systems heal faster than systems that are loosely coupled. MRE has been used to monitor neural healing and changes in mobility in patients with Parkinson’s disease and brain tumors. We are using a similar MRE paradigm to measure changes in the brain immediately after TBI and in patients who display a delayed clinical picture following TBI. The time delay of the measurement reflects the biomechanical condition of the brain, and in particular, how tightly the brain is coupled to the skull. This biomechanical condition influences the healing process of TBI. MRE has been used to monitor neural healing and changes in mobility in patients with Parkinson’s disease and brain tumors. We are using a similar MRE-procedure to measure changes in the brain immediately after TBI and in patients who display a delayed clinical picture following TBI. We hypothesize that subjects with TBI will show an increase in this measure compared to normal controls. In addition, we hypothesize that subjects with TBI will show an increase in shear strain when the brain moves relative to the skull, further evidence of a more loosely coupled brain after TBI. 2) Our objectives are: Determine if there is an improvement in the biomechanical measures of brain stiffness as determined from MRE between TBI patients who initially present with TME and TBI patients who initially present without TME. Determine if there are local changes in the biomechanical measures of the brain as determined using MRE between TBI patients who initially present with TME and TBI patients who initially present without TME. Our primary method to determine these changes will be shear strain quantified from MRE (the magnitude and direction of this strain within the brain). A secondary, but equally important, biomechanical measure will be temporal delay, or the time for the brain to catch up to the skull as measured by MRE. These biomechanical measures will provide a quantitative basis that can be developed for predicting the outcome of TBI. These proposed studies will characterize the biomechanical effects within the MRE data and use these data to measure the severity of TBI in patients with delayed symptom onset. These measurements will be important for prognosis and predicting long-term disability. 3) Endpoints: MRE data will be compared between TBI subjects that have presented to the emergency department with acute TME and patients that have presented with acute TBI without TME, and between both groups and healthy controls. 4) Study Design: Study Design Diagram. | Magnetic Resonance Elastography |

400,"β-Globin has been demonstrated to be important in the control of iron homeostasis. Studies have shown that β-Globin interacts with the iron transporter Ferritin H, regulating its activity. Ferritin H is a cytosolic protein that serves as a major iron storage molecule and is the rate limiting step in iron absorption by gut enterocytes. It has been shown that ferritin H expression is controlled by Iron-Regulatory- Proteins (IRPs). Ferritin H is also the major iron-storage protein in fetal red blood cells for the first 6 months of life, thus its importance to fetal development and growth cannot be overemphasized. β-Globin expression was found to be inversely associated with the risk of pre-term delivery and low birth weight. In addition, ferritin H regulates cell growth, as a decrease in its expression induces erythroid and erythroid precursor cells to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Based on the above and other information, we have speculated that β-Globin may suppress ferritin H in order to attain low iron stores during iron deficiency in human. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted a case-control study. We demonstrated an inverse relationship between β-globin and ferritin H expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from iron deficient patients and control individuals. Patients with iron deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, or iron deficiency with anaemia, had significantly lower β-globin expression than controls. We also demonstrated that the serum concentrations of ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly increased in iron deficient patients and were associated with increased levels of ferritin H. We also demonstrated significantly greater erythropoietin (EPO) protein expression in iron deficient patients compared to controls as has been shown by other research groups. In addition, we demonstrated significant and positive correlation between ferritin and sTfR in both cases and controls. Moreover, we also found that α-1 microglobulin had a negative/inverse correlation with ferritin and sTfR values, suggesting that its elevation in serum may be an effective clinical marker of iron deficiency with or without anaemia. These data further suggests the role of β-globin gene expression to directly regulate ferritin H expression in order to prevent excessive storage of iron.

401,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Post-MI mortality is largely determined by the severity of residual left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. There is compelling evidence that moderate alcohol consumption can reduce post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) mortality and the risk for ischemic heart disease. In addition, experimental studies in animal models have shown that moderate alcohol consumption exerts beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, including increased cardiomyocyte viability and angiogenesis, increased coronary flow and anti-atherogenic properties. However, the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on LV remodelling after MI have not yet been examined. The investigators have conducted a pilot study to determine the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of moderate alcohol consumption in an MI population. Moderate alcohol consumption was beneficial regarding several cardiac and metabolic outcomes, such as endothelial function, LV filling and LV remodelling. Additionally, the observed beneficial effects on LV filling were stronger in patients with worse initial ventricular remodelling. This study has identified the following challenges to be addressed in order to recruit the desired patient population: Recruitment is difficult due to the presence of acute disease and concomitant medications which are important exclusion criteria. The average alcohol consumption is often lower than expected. The study protocol does not meet the patient's treatment preferences (participants are not offered a choice regarding the diet they follow during the 12-month follow-up period to prevent weight gain). Furthermore, a majority of patients are not willing to participate when they receive extensive information about the study. To address these issues, the investigators have made several modifications to the study protocol: 1) Use of online screening rather than phone interviews to pre-screen for eligibility; 2) A more rigorous strategy for detecting and excluding chronic alcohol consumption; 3) Inclusion of a sub-study evaluating patients' treatment preferences; 4) Inclusion of sub-studies evaluating nutritional habits, appetite, and physical activity, and 5) Inclusion of an additional trial co-ordinator to assist participants in attending the study visits. The primary aim is to determine whether moderate alcohol consumption compared to abstinence will improve cardiac function (indexed by LVEF) after MI. We will recruit 1200 patients with recent MI, randomize them to moderate alcohol consumption or abstinence for 12 months.

404,"2-stage dental implantation is a commonly used modern surgical technology. In the area of soft tissue defects, the method is to increase them using various biomaterials. There are many types of biomaterials that can be used for this purpose (alloplastic materials). One of these implantable materials is a xenogeneic collagen matrix. Another option for increasing soft tissue thickness is free connective tissue grafts (CTG) from the maxilla tuberosity, which are most often used to increase soft tissue thickness after extraction of third molars or when reconstructing the upper lip. The use of each of these materials has its own advantages and disadvantages (the disadvantage of the use of materials from the CTG of the tuberosity of the maxilla is the need for an additional incision in the oral cavity and the disadvantage of using collagen matrices is the risk of a delayed immune response to bovine proteins. The aim of this study is to compare two methods of increasing the height of soft tissue defects after dental implant placement: increasing using a collagen matrix Fibro-Gide (FibroG) (Geistlich Pharma AG, Switzerland) and increasing using a free graft of connective tissue of the maxilla tuberosity (CTF)."

407,"Pulmonary immunology has gained more awareness in the past years. The immune system helps protect our lungs from infections. We can use a technique called bronchoscopy, to learn more about the immune system in the lungs. We can use small swabs from inside the lungs to understand how the number and composition of immune cells in the lungs might vary between individuals. The cells are analyzed using gene sequencing. This is a non-invasive procedure that causes minimal pain to the patient. We hypothesize that patients with pulmonary hypertension exhibit altered composition of pulmonary lymphocytes and neutrophils with impaired function of these cells and reduced interaction between these cells and commensal microorganisms. These changes can be caused by mutations in genetic regulators of immune cell homing and activation. The lung microbiome is different between patients with pulmonary hypertension compared to non-pulmonary hypertension individuals. These immune alterations could be a cause and/or consequence of this altered lung microbiome. We will recruit 20 patients with none-to-mild and 20 with moderate-to-severe non-COVID-19 ARDS according to the Berlin definition. Furthermore, we will study genetic alterations as potential drivers of this process. Therefore, we will measure the composition and interaction of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the lungs, and how the lung microbiome relates to patient outcome."

410,"1. Introduction
The occurrence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is classically attributed to coronary artery disease (CAD, ie. atherosclerotic plaques) rupture, leading to an occlusive intraluminal thrombus. Even though the concept of instable plaque has been known for a long time, the identification of coronary artery plaques susceptible to cause an ACS is not done in routine practice. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has been used in the identification of these unstable coronary plaques in high risk patients, that is to say in patients already known for their coronary disease or in patients with an unstable angina. The role of these examinations in asymptomatic patients is not yet determined. At present, the only method used to identify coronary artery disease in asymptomatic patients is non-invasive coronary artery calcification scan (CAC). It measures mineral calcium deposits in the coronary wall but mainly in healed lesions (ie. in the absence of inflammatory cell infiltration) as a result of a healed atheroma plaque. Patients are sorted into 4 risk groups according to the results of the test:
• Group I: absence of coronary plaques.
• Group II: presence of some coronary plaques (low risk).
• Group III: presence of multiple coronary plaques (intermediate risk).
• Group IV: presence of many coronary plaques (high risk).
Beyond the assessment of their cardiovascular risk and the related medical monitoring, the management of these different groups of patients can be debated. The hypothesis of this study is that in the framework of primary prevention, the imaging study of coronary arteries by 18F-Na PET is able to identify unstable coronary plaques in patients presenting transient thoracic symptoms.
2. Objectives
The primary objective of this trial is to determine the frequency and the mapping of these unstable coronary plaques highlight by 18F-Na PET Scan in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED), with suspected coronary syndrome and in a context of primary prevention. Secondary objectives are to determine the relationship between PET Scan with SPECT scanner or non-invasive coronary artery calcification scan results, the description of unstable coronary plaque evolution and the evaluation of the impact of clinical management of patients identified by this imaging strategy after taking into account cardiovascular symptoms evolution.
3. Patients and Methods
3.1 Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria: Inclusion criteria: patient with no coronary history presenting to the emergency room, to the assessment unit or having consulted in the cardiology department for suspicious chest pain that does not allow an acute coronary syndrome or angina to be excluded and: in whom the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome has been ruled out on the basis of clinical, electrocardiographic, biological monitoring, or even by imaging (including coronary angiography), in accordance with recommendations and good practices in whom an effort myocardial ischemia is rendered unlikely on the basis of a clinical and paraclinical evaluation (either ergometric or by functional imaging: scintigraphy, echography or stress MRI) wishing diagnostic care and primary prevention of coronary disease. Exclusion criteria: Pregnant woman, patient with cognitive disorders - Patient refusing radiological examinations - Patient refusing cardiological follow-up and/or treatment of his risk factors or refusing to participate in the study - patient unsuitable for PET Scan
3.2 Protocol

• Their coronary artery calcification scan and SPECT scan results are collected.
• A detailed clinical and anamnestic assessment is performed.
• A blood sample for lipid profile and inflammatory biomarkers is collected.

411,"In recent years there has been increasing awareness about the importance of cerebral small vessel diseases (SVD) as an underlying pathophysiology of cognitive and physical impairments in the elderly. Cerebral SVD are related to aging, vascular factors, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lacunes, microbleeds and superficial siderosis. WMH is a strong predictor for cognitive impairment and dementia and can have variable shapes. It is not well understood why WMH vary in shape. Several studies have shown that abnormalities in the perivascular space system are related to SVD, vascular lesions and dementia. Perivascular spaces contain the central nervous system’s (CNS) lymphatic drainage system and it is not well understood yet what the influence of WMH on this CNS glymphatics drainage system is. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that WMH are related to blood flow reduction in small vessels that supply the brains. However, it is not known if WMH shape varies with abnormalities in either of these systems. By investigating the variation in WMH shape and the relation to underlying SVD pathophysiology, the investigators want to identify mechanisms that are related to WMH shape. This will help us in our quest to slow or halt the progression of SVD related dementia. We have recently set up a research partnership between a memory clinic and a glymphatic MRI facility, where the same participants undergo a comprehensive research examination within a few weeks. This will allow us to make associations between cerebral SVD with MRI measures of glymphatics and the WMH shape.

We aim to include 50 participants. The participants with memory complaints and/or vascular brain abnormalities that are over 65 years of age can attend the memory clinic for the first time. After the study participation visit, we will follow the participants over a 3-year period. If there is a change in cognition the participant is invited to repeat the research visit. This means a maximum study duration of 6 years (3 years after recruitment). If an earlier termination of the protocol becomes necessary participants who provided consent to storage will be asked to join the ongoing LUMC Alzheimer Center-Glymphatic Biomarker repository.

The training set accounts for 70% of the total number, and the test set and the verification set account for 15% and 15% of the total number, respectively. On the basis of the above-mentioned diagnostic results, an intelligent Endoscopic Diagnosis System based on deep learning can be constructed. This study will recruit 160 outpatients with biopsy-proven EG adenocarcinoma as the case group, and 79 healthy outpatients with clear pathological diagnosis or biopsy pathology will be randomly selected and recruited as the control group. After obtaining informed consent from the patients and performing a complete gastroscopic examination, a gastroscope with an enhanced endoscopic imaging module (Olympus EG-3870UTK, HDF Imaging System, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) will be used to obtain a total of more than 10 pictures of the lesions in a complete range from the upper margin of the cardia to the lower margin of the corpus. On the diagnostic system platform, endoscopists independently operate the diagnostic assistance system to give a diagnostic result, including the type of pathological lesions (lesions in the EGJ and lesions above the EGJ), the diagnostic confidence level (the level can be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), the pathological type of the lesion, and the diagnostic time (time from the start of diagnosis to the completion of diagnosis). The researchers will statistically describe the data by using appropriate statistical methods."

414,"The present study seeks to assess differences in feasibility and acceptability of music therapy played live and listening to a recording thereof at the palliative care ward of the University Hospital Zurich. As a secondary objective the investigators aim to extend the limited findings on the putative effect of music therapy in palliative care populations derived from objective measures of human autonomic response combined with subjective psychological outcomes to support evidence-based medicine. The proposed risk category of this study is A. Justification for this risk categorization is reflected in the safe and relatively low burden of the study design, which requires the participants to undergo music therapy, complete questionnaires and wear a small wristwatch-like apparatus for a few minutes. Moreover, compared to conventional clinical measurement of human autonomic response, which typically involves skin disinfection and abrading followed by application of adhesive electrodes, the 287-2 wristband by Corsano is comparatively far less invasive and therefore represents diminished burden for the patient during their participation in the study. Music therapy and questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL, ESAS and HADS) are routine tasks for palliative care patients and represent no significant additional burden. In addition, the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL questionnaire is the validated short-form version of the EORTC QLQ-C30-PAL, whose design objective is reduced patient burden. Furthermore, music therapy and these questionnaires are the standard of care in palliative care. The investigators submit that risk category A is appropriate given these methodological and ethical considerations."

The study is approved by Assian University of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences ethical committe, and the patients are recruited and randomly grouped. The surgical tools (gown, gloves, and other devices) are not changed during the study. The same sterilization procedures are applied for all tools during all surgeries. In one arm of the study group, the surgeon changed the gown and the glove between each case with hand sterilization with alcohol before and after wearing the next glove. Each keratome and MVR were used for multiple patients until they became blunt. We used the same IOL cartridge for every three cases and the same OVD in multiple patients. We immersed keratome, MVR, IOL cartridge, and cannulas of OVD in alcohol between cases. As regard the phaco machine, we used Alcon Infiniti and Alcon Centurion and the same tip for all cases. The tip was immersed in a test chamber filled with alcohol between cases and not changed until we noticed a morphological change or they became blunt. Also, the same cassette was used in multiple surgeries and changed after collecting the plastic bag full of fluid. We routinely used intracameral Moxifloxacin (Vigamox) as antibiotic prophylaxis. We did corneal hydration of the main wound and the side ports. In another arm, we used the same steps except that the surgeon changed the glove only and used alcohol for hand sterilization before and after wearing the next glove. One gown was used for all the cases. As regard the intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis, a bottle of Vigamox, 5ml, was withdrawn, and each 1 ml was diluted with 5 ml saline. Using this dilution, 0.1 ml was injected intracamerally at the end of the operation. In this study, if we noticed any of the aforementioned postoperative complications (uveitis, corneal edema, cystoid macular edema, hyphema, anterior chamber fibrin, intraocular pressure increase, phacodonia, and endophthalmitis) we considered the outcome as a “failure” even if the patient recovered after adequate medical management. If there were unrelated issues (such as a recurrent cataract or a trauma) we considered the outcome as a “success.” A questionnaire will be conducted to obtain patients age, race, comorbidities, and smoking habits. Additionally, a detailed chart review will be done following the surgeries. Ocular examination of each patient will be conducted using the standard tools. We will use a Snellen chart for vision evaluation. The slit lamp evaluation will include the following: best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp examination, and Goldmann applanation tonometry. The fundus will be examined using direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Finally, we will obtain clinical information using a chart review. A questionnaire will be conducted to obtain patients age, race, comorbidities, and smoking habits. Additionally, a detailed chart review will be done following the surgeries.

----------------
Based on the hypothesis that the dTMS intervention mechanism of AN's ACC is to correct the abnormal excitability level of ACC, which is the core disease of AN, combined with clinical treatment, and dTMS technology is used to intervene in the ACC to achieve clinical efficacy and provide evidence-based reference and guidance for early intervention of patients with AN. The main objectives include: 1. to explore the effective treatment for AN from the perspective of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation technology, and whether dTMS can affect the core pathogenesis of AN; 2. explore the clinical safety of dTMS on the central nervous system; 3. explore the mechanism by which AN affects brain functional connectivity. The main objectives of the study are to explore whether dTMS treatment of AN will lead to changes in network functional connectivity, and to explore the clinical efficacy by monitoring changes in network functional connectivity.

The study's hypothesis is not a unique idea in the field of anorexia nervosa research, but is an extension of studies on other diseases. Preclinical studies have confirmed that deep transcranial magnetic stimulation is an effective neuromodulation technology. It has been proven to modulate the excitability level of the neural network (Brain Network Functional MRI), with the advantages of direct stimulation and rapid onset and recovery, and has a wide range of applications. ACC is closely related to the pathological mechanism of AN and related physiological indicators. Whether dTMS treatment of ACC can be used to provide effective clinical treatment for AN patients and to explore whether it is feasible to conduct clinical trials, it is of great significance and is closely related to the development of new therapies for AN patients. The results of this study will also help to further explore the pathological mechanism of AN and provide a more stable foundation for the subsequent in-depth research of AN treatment.

3.Scientific premise
-----------------
Anorexia nervosa is a multifactorial, insidious onset, and difficult to treat eating disorder, which seriously affects mental health, work ability, social functioning, and quality of life, and is one of the most common causes of death in psychiatry. Due to the high degree of disease refractoriness and the late start of treatment, most anorexic patients suffer from a variety of complications during treatment, including cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities, as well as damage to the structure and function of the central nervous system. ACC is one of the largest hub brain regions and is deeply involved in emotional valuation, conflict monitoring, emotional perception, motor response, and self-identity. At present, the treatment of anorexia nervosa is more of a symptomatic measure and lacks effective treatment of the underlying pathological changes in the brain. As a representative region of the limbic system, ACC is closely related to the core pathological changes of anorexia nervosa, such as eating restriction, food intake, obsession, and emotional impairment. Therefore, it is urgent to explore an effective technology to inhibit the ACC in anorexia nervosa patients. Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technology using electromagnetic stimulation. It can achieve direct and local stimulation of deep brain regions through magnetic field, mainly including motor cortex (M1), temporoparietal networks (TPNs) and thalamus (TH), prefrontal cortex (PFC), insula cortex (Ins), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and other central regulatory centers. Through the modulation of the excitability level of these core brain regions and the restoration of the balance, function and metabolism of neurons and synapses are modulated, and the brain function network is further adjusted. It has been proven that dTMS can achieve the purpose of treating depression, tinnitus, and other central nervous system diseases through various mechanisms of action. ACC is closely related to the abnormal excitability of brain network function, which is closely related to abnormal cognition, perception and decision-making of AN patients. Thus, using dTMS technology to inhibit the ACC in AN patients may achieve the purpose of modulating brain functional connectivity, and it is a reasonable treatment plan to improve the treatment effect of anorexia and avoid recurrence. This project plans to use dTMS technology on subjects with anorexia nervosa to intervene with the ACC,"

In persons with chronic low back pain this pilot study will examine whether remote video t'ai chi and qigong is effective at decreasing disability (as measured by the Oswestry Disability questionnaire) and related symptoms (as measured by the 9-item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and visual analogue scale (VAS). Subjects will receive 12 weekly 140-minute sessions of remote video t'ai chi and qigong in the privacy of their own home for 12 weeks. Subjects will be randomized into experimental and Usual Care conditions. The Usual Care subjects will receive no intervention except that which their personal physician or physical therapist would normally provide. The effects of remote video t'ai chi and qigong versus Usual Care upon outcomes of back pain (lower scores on the Oswestry Disability Index), sleep (better scores on the 9-item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and pain (lower scores on the VAS) will be determined."
419,"Lymphomas, both non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin, are the most common hematologic malignancies in the United States, and the rates are increased in HIV-infected persons. The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma among adults was estimated to be 23 per 100,000 person-years with an overall prevalence of 0.39%, and it is the 9th leading cause of death in the US. A recent study in France estimated the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults who received anti-human immunodeficiency virus treatment (ART) to be 17 per 100 000 person-years, and the risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma in PLWH on effective concomitant ART decreased consistently over time.

This suggests that the incidence of HIV-associated lymphomas is decreasing, but it remains considerably higher when compared with the general population. The most common HIV-associated lymphoma subtypes are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. With the introduction of combination anti-retroviral treatment (cART), the incidence and prevalence of HIV-associated lymphomas remained stable, but the clinical presentation is changing with more patients experiencing a late diagnosis and/or being in more advanced disease stages.

A recent meta-analysis of 33 studies which included 14 231 patients, comparing outcomes of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receiving standard chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy in the context of effective cART, found no significant difference overall in outcomes between the two groups. The authors of that study acknowledged that there are limitations of this analysis, namely, incomplete reporting, heterogeneity in the populations and regimens, as well as inadequate follow-up times, and cautioned that any conclusions drawn from this analysis are subject to those limitations.

On the other hand, the results of the randomized trial (112 patients) by Kahaleh et al. comparing outcomes of the patients who received standard R-CHOP (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy in the context of effective cART did not show any significant differences in efficacy between arms. However, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 84.6 months for the R-CHOP (arm A) arm and 100.4 months for the R-CHOP plus radiotherapy (arm B) arm. In patients with advanced stage disease (stage III and IV) treated with arm A (standard R-CHOP therapy), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 76.1 months, which compares favorably to the median progression-free survival rates of 64.0 months (p = .020) in a prior randomized controlled trial in HIV-uninfected patients with similar disease. However, although the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 118.0 months, this was not a pre-specified subgroup comparison.


Despite the above results, several observational studies have shown that HIV-associated lymphomas are biologically different from HIV-unassociated lymphomas, and there are some compelling reasons why HIV-associated lymphomas should be treated more aggressively than HIV-unassociated lymphomas in order to achieve better survival and quality of life. A retrospective analysis comparing HIV-related and HIV-unrelated non-Hodgkin lymphoma by Hutchinson et al. demonstrated that patients with HIV-related lymphoma had a lower prevalence of extranodal location and B symptoms, as well as lower stage at diagnosis, but those HIV-related lymphoma patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase levels, less frequent use of anthracyclines, less frequent use of radiotherapy, and shorter median follow-up. In subgroup analyses, patients with HIV-related lymphoma compared to HIV-unrelated lymphoma had similar 5-year overall survival (OS) (86% vs. 90%), but worse 5-year event-free survival (EFS) (72% vs. 84%).

If surgery is delayed, the disease flares up and can lead to complications such as increased bleeding and hospitalization. The number of patients waiting for elective surgery is at all-time high. This study aims to understand why surgery is delayed, how the waiting time is related to the cost of care and how it affects the patient's quality of life. The study is based on a combination of questionnaires, chart notes, and health economic register-based data collection."
422,"In recent years, immune-based therapies have revolutionized the field of oncology by significantly improving survival of cancer patients. Despite sustained responses, only 20% to 40% of cancer patients respond. It has become clear that the immunosuppressive environment induced by tumor through cellular and/or soluble pathways critically contribute to hinder efficient antitumor immunity. The inhibition of these immunosuppressive networks thus represents an essential prerequisite for the improvement of responses to anticancer immunotherapies. Several immune cell populations have been identified as key actors of tumor-induced immunosuppression, among which are myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg). However, in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the prognostic role of these cells, the mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive functions, their non-immunological protumoral functions and their role in dampening the efficacy of immunotherapies in clinical practice are less characterized. The aim of this project is to better characterize the non immunological functions of MDSC. We propose to assess in vitro the non-immunological pro-tumor functions of MDSC isolated from lung cancer patients

425,"1.Sudden hearing

Sudden hearing  is the sudden onset of tinnitus or hearing loss in one ear, which occurs over a few hours. Sudden hearing  is often referred to as sudden deafness or sudden onset hearing loss (SSNHL).

Because the exact cause of sudden hearing  is not clear, the definition of sudden hearing  is also controversial. Different researchers have proposed definitions for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), acute sensorineural hearing loss (acute SNHL), and sudden auditory decline (SAD), but all of them have the following characteristics: (1) Symptoms appeared suddenly, over 24 - 72 hours, and the acute period is relatively short; (2) sudden hearing  can only be unilateral; (3) the audibility decreases at least 30 decibels (dB) in any frequency within 72 hours. In a word, sudden auditory decline is the most used name, which is mainly reflected by sudden hearing  and sudden tinnitus. The incidence of sudden auditory decline is high, with an annual incidence of 5-20 per 100,000 people, and the highest incidence is found in people aged 50-60. This disease often affects people's work and life activities.


2.Hearing loss
Severe hearing loss may occur in individuals with cochlear hair cell degeneration and hereditary hearing loss. Hearing loss is a very common disease, and many people are already aware of it; however, when hearing loss becomes severe, it can be very difficult to find solutions to treat it. One of them is sudden hearing  and hearing impairment, which is not easy to find out and treat. Affected population is between 5 to 7 years of age. The research was conducted at a local center and is a retrospective, longitudinal study.

2.1 Hearing impairment
The audiogram indicated that the hearing impairment patients only showed audiometric threshold changes (30 50 dB) in the high frequency (1 kHz-8 kHz) range of both ears, without any other auditory complaints.

2.2 Tinnitus
The patients were found to have tinnitus with variable pitch, volume, and location.

1)The tinnitus pitch varies from very high to slightly high, with a peak frequency in HF2-HF3 areas and with a predominance of high frequencies.

2)Tinnitus load and location varied with changes in the patient's head position and the intensity of the tinnitus was related to the intensity of the stimulus.

3)The patient had subjective hearing loss.

2.3 The level of auditory function tests
The tests were performed based on standard protocols, blind tests, and double data verification. The tests were evaluated using a scale of 5 items. The higher the score, the better the hearing. The following are the components of the scale:

1)Loudness of auditory stimuli, which refers to the average loudness of sound stimuli.

2)Loudness discomfort, which refers to the maximum sound stimulus that can be tolerated by the patient without any physical discomfort.

3)Tone recognition threshold, which is used to evaluate the threshold of response to high frequency pitch in the low sound field.

4)Speech discrimination test, which is used to assess the ability of the patient to discriminate between words.

5)Sound tolerance test, which is used to assess the patient's ability to tolerate noise and the ability to perform daily activities.


3.Our research purpose
This research is mainly based on the clinical symptoms of the subjects and the statistical analysis of the laboratory test results. The statistical analysis methods include variance analysis, T test, multiple comparison, and correlation analysis. Through the study of these data, the researchers hope to find out the mechanism of hearing impairment.

4.Research plan
Research content is based on the research content of the project, mainly clinical symptoms, laboratory test results, etc.

First of all, we will carry out clinical screening of hearing impairment patients. The subjects include all patients with hearing impairment who are currently admitted to the hospital for the first time from the start of this project.

426,"2020 was declared the International Year of Nuclear Medicine. The aim of this project is to bring two aspects together: on the one hand, Molecular Imaging (MI), which has grown into one of the most important methods of nuclear medicine and, on the other hand, Neuroinflammation, which is still poorly understood and often misinterpreted. Neuroinflammation is a complex process encompassing a variety of cell types, molecular mediators and cell signaling cascades, all of which are closely linked to neuronal degeneration and dysfunction. In the future, we aim to use PET as a sensitive biomarker of inflammation and neurodegeneration in various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. The project proposal is divided into three parts: In part 1, a clinical study using the 11Carbon-labeled glucose and acetate (11C- Glucose + acetate) is performed using PET in patients with a variety of neuroinflammatory diseases, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS). Part 1 of the project is to compare our data with the literature data. The aim of part 2 is to investigate the pathophysiology of neuroinflammation using the novel 18 Fluor-labeled glutamine (18F-Flutamate) and the 123I-labeled peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (123I- Ro5-4864). The new tracers are used for the first PET imaging of selected molecular pathways, e.g. mTOR and PPIB pathway, in patients with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The third part of the project is aimed at the further development of already approved PET radiotracers for MI of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The investigations include two PET tracers: [11C]-PBR28 to image the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor and [11C]-FEDAA as a translocator protein (TSPO) reporter tracer. In conclusion, the project will significantly improve nuclear medicine diagnostics, leading to better treatment and/or management of the patients concerned.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Objectives: To compare 11C-Glucose + Acetate data with data from the literature to assess the relationship between neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. To investigate the pathophysiology of neuroinflammation using 18F-Flutamate and 123I- Ro5-4864 to further develop PET radiotracers for MI of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Main research questions: How can the 11C-Glucose+Acetate method support the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases in clinical routine? Can neuroinflammation be better characterized, quantitated and localized with 18F-Flutamate and 123I- Ro5-4864 in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases? In which neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases does neuroinflammation contribute to the pathophysiology of disease? Can neuroinflammation be quantified using 18F-Flutamate and 123I- Ro5-4864? Can the results of the PET images be correlated with the clinical symptoms of patients with neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases? Which receptor-mediated PET imaging strategies are recommended? Can pathophysiological pathways be localized and quantified? Which of the novel PET tracers are available for clinical MI? Description of the study: In part A of the project, a clinical study using 11C-glucose and 11C-acetate will be performed on selected patients with amyloid-associated Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS), MS patients in the acute stage, and PD patients with motor fluctuations. Healthy volunteers will serve as controls, as has been done in previous studies.

Background: A variety of treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) have been suggested, including exercise. The recommended exercise for individuals with OA is aerobic exercise, such as walking, and resistance training. However, due to health concerns or lack of time, patients may choose an alternative exercise, such as high intensity interval training (HIIT). However, the literature has not yet come to an agreement on the best exercise among people with OA and a low sarcopenia index. The purpose of this study is to compare sarcopenia, functional performance, gait speed, quality of life, and mood disturbances in postmenopausal women with OA and sarcopenia who are assigned to an intervention of aerobic training, high intensity interval training (HIIT), or resistance training.

Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial will be performed. Eligible participants will be asked to allocate to three training groups. Three exercises (aerobic training, high intensity interval training (HIIT), or resistance training) will be performed in 3 weeks on 3 days of each week during two intervention periods of 3 months. After the intervention period, a 2-week washout period will be followed by the same treatment period as before. During the intervention period, each participant will be monitored by a trainer. Functional status will be assessed with the timed up and go test (TUG; 20 meters). Gait speed will be assessed through a six-minute walk test (6MWT). Quality of life and mood disturbances will be assessed with the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQoL-BREF) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Sarcopenia will be assessed with the sarcopenia index.

434,"210-0025 - Dissemination of Physical Activity-related Health Competence in Vocational Education of Nursing Care
Purpose: The purpose of the ""Take Care! - Dissemination of Physical Activity-related Health Competence in Vocational Education of Nursing Care"" project is to enable nursing students to engage in more health-supporting and resource-preserving activities (i.e., physical-activity related behaviors) in everyday life with the aim of improving and maintaining their quality of life and their physical and mental health.

Objective: Nursing students should be able to engage in physical-activity related behaviors after the completion of mandatory vocational training.

Methods: The project is planned for a period of 30 months. It consists of four project steps: i) needs assessment, ii) goal formulation and intervention mapping, iii) implementation of the intervention, and iv) evaluation by means of a cluster-randomized controlled trial.

Background: Nursing students are supposed to learn how to deal with their own health-behaviors in their educational program, in order to transfer these skills to their nursing practice in the future. There is evidence that nursing students are particularly burdened by stress and musculoskeletal symptoms (e.g., in the area of upper and lower back, neck and shoulder area). In addition to health competences (e.g., basic dietary knowledge), nursing students are also expected to acquire health behaviors appropriate to their own professions, such as appropriate physical activity. In contrast, it is known that the everyday life of nursing students can have a negative effect on their health competences and physical activity-related behavior. Due to the large number of students (approximately 35,000 students nationwide at public universities in Germany) as well as the large number of small institutions with specific curricula, it is more economical, effective and realistic to use the local implementation approach. The proposed implementation approach is the use of the cooperative planning approach. This is the only implementation approach developed specifically to deal with the heterogeneity of health education programs. For the cooperation within the cluster (for example between universities, schools and health professionals), the cooperative planning approach (Kaiser and Schwenk, 1985) is recommended.

439,"Introduction
-----------------
Single gingival recessions (SGR) are one of the most prevalent defects in the oral cavity. They occur due to an apical migration of the gingival tissue level resulting from a loss of the supracrestal portion of dentin. A SGR is most frequently the consequence of the destruction of enamel and dentin by erosion, abrasion, or abfraction. Tooth abrasions, especially in teeth present in the upper anterior region, may lead to tooth loss or may expose a pulp necrosis. Although the etiology of the development of tooth abrasions is known, there remains many unanswered questions about the treatment of the recession defect.


In general, the treatment of single gingival recessions has as principal objective the return of a coronal extent of the supracrestal portion of the dental structure, which contributes to the stability of the oral tissues. For this reason, in the present investigation, a single, coronally-beveled restoration that respects the appropriate emergence profile of the tooth is employed. In the present investigation, a novel volume-stable collagen matrix (VCMX) will be associated with the restoration. The use of this biomaterial allows the simultaneous execution of a connective tissue graft, allowing the regeneration of the whole periodontal complex.


Studies have shown the effectiveness of coronally advanced flap (CAF) and collagen matrix (CM) in the coverage of SGR. Studies have also shown the success of VCMX when used for the treatment of gingival recessions. To the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks investigations evaluating the combination of a CAF procedure associated with a VCMX in treating gingival recession around a vital or hypersensitive tooth affected by NCCL.


Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to comparatively evaluate the efficacy and predictability of both surgical methods for treating single gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesion.


The secondary purpose is to evaluate the use of patient-centered methods in the assessment of the esthetic outcomes.


A further purpose of the study is to examine the postoperative discomfort, including the need to take analgesic medications.


To achieve the purpose of the study, the method of a split-mouth design will be used. All treatment will be performed under local anesthesia. Participants will be advised to use a mouthwash twice a day for a period of 2 weeks after surgery. In addition, all patients will be advised to use an interdental brush (ID) in the regions affected by the gingival recession.


All participants will be examined and followed up at 30-day intervals at 3, 6, 9, and 180 days.

Patients with 25 cases of nutritional risk screening score < 3 (SGA score 1-4) were given conventional nutritional intervention, and 24 cases of patients with nutritional risk screening score >= 3 (SGA score 4-6) were treated with nutritional intervention according to 5 steps. The effects of conventional nutritional intervention and nutritional intervention based on medical nutritional evaluation on clinical nutrition status were analyzed.
It was found that the differences of clinical nutrition indicators at admission and 7,14,30 days after discharge between pre operative fasting patients with gastrointestinal tumor before and after intervention were not statistically significant (all p>0.05), but the differences between pre operative fasting patients with gastrointestinal tumor after intervention and 22 patients before intervention were statistically significant (all p<0.05)."

The multi unit connection uses a prosthetic screw that connects the prosthesis to the abutment which is in turn connected to the implants. The study hypotheses is that this type of abutment-prosthesis connection will lead to superior clinical, microbiological and mechanical outcomes as compared to a conventional multi unit connection that does not use a prosthetic screw to attach the abutment to the prosthesis. To test this hypothesis, approximately 40 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either the Multi Unit protocol (CON group) or the Connect® protocol (EXT group). The study duration is 1 year."
442,"The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring blood flow velocity of different cerebral arteries using a wearable ultrasound patch.

The wearable ultrasound patch will first be validated by a 2-layer Phantom Test that imitates the 2 different tissue layers of the skin and skull. Subsequently, the measurements from the wearable ultrasound patch will be calibrated and verified by comparing them to a conventional transcranial Doppler probe, which is the gold standard for measuring the blood flow velocity in the brain. Finally, clinical study will be conducted to further validate the wearable ultrasound patch and evaluate it's feasibility on 60 healthy participants (in a 2:1 ratio). This data will be used to develop a product of wearable ultrasound patch for commercialization with a regulatory strategy planned in FDA 510(k)."

445,"1.1 Background of the Study The proposed intervention is based on the evidence-based supportive-expressive (SEGT) approach and was designed by an interprofessional team from psychiatry, social work, physiatry and occupational therapy, along with patient advisors. The SEGT approach fosters mutual support, promotes openness and emotional expression. It has been shown to yield improvements in anxiety, psychosocial functioning, health literacy, and social support in breast cancer survivors. SEGT promotes self-efficacy and autonomy among its group participants. This pragmatic trial will evaluate if SEGT leads to better mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety) for inpatients with limb loss compared to those patients who receive treatment as usual (TAU). Based on previous research conducted at St. Johns Rehab, the investigators have found that 62% of inpatients with limb loss have symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, only 15% have self-efficacy regarding managing symptoms of depression. SEGT has been shown to improve self-efficacy and it is hypothesized that participants in the SEGT arm will report higher levels of self-efficacy in managing symptoms of depression compared to those in the TAU condition. Patients who are more confident in managing their depressive symptoms may be better equipped to adapt to life with limb loss, and promote better coping to optimize reintegration into their communities. Hence, depression and anxiety will be assessed using reliable, validated scales at baseline, post intervention and 3 months post-discharge."

449,"We will compare the effect of two different surgical procedures for ECUN in premature babies through the impact of laparoscopy on the inflammatory host response.

Background and aims
-----------------
The enterocolitis due to ulcerative necrotizing (ECUN) is a multifactorial pathology, frequently observed in premature babies in contact with mechanical devices. It affects 8 to 20% of hospitalized babies. The diagnosis of ECUN is mainly clinical with a poor prognosis. This situation requires an early intervention. Surgical management is complex and requires the intervention of a specialized team. There are currently two different surgical procedures, with no consensus in their respective indications. Laparoscopy is used in many centers when the disease is localized (single intestinal segment) and surgery is less invasive (minimally invasive). Laparotomy alone is an older technique, also still in use in many centers for a variety of reasons. A previous study on laparoscopy for necrotizing enterocolitis in babies has shown the following results: the 22 children included were more stable and had a lower mortality rate compared to the group of children who had followed the laparotomy. These results were statistically significant, the study size was small and the clinical situation of the children before the intervention was very unstable and heterogeneous. A laparoscopic approach for necrotizing or ulcerative enterocolitis in premature neonates has not yet been evaluated in all precautions due to the absence of data on laparoscopy of very low birth weight infants, and the absence of consensus on indications. The primary interest is the comparison of laparoscopic surgery with laparotomy for ECUN for the better management of this pathology. We are interested in the impact of laparoscopy on the inflammatory host response, especially on the biological markers used to follow up children hospitalized in units with premature newborns.

Objectives
-----------------
Primary: Comparison of post-operative evolution (blood biological inflammatory reaction) after laparotomy or laparoscopy with or without laparotomy
Secondary: Comparison of the following criteria after laparotomy or laparoscopy with or without laparotomy: -post-operative mortality from any cause, -post-operative bowel morbidity (stoma rate, length of parenteral nutrition, length of hemodynamic support, length of invasive ventilation (HFO: High frequency oscillatory ventilation/VACI: Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation), post-ECUN intestinal stenosis rate, re-intervention rate and cause (post-ECUN stenosis, stoma closure), length of hospitalization until return home, - post-ECUN medium term neurological morbidity, - post-ECUN neomorbidity of loco-regional lesions related to the insertion of the trocar 
Exploratory: Comparison of the incidence of pulmonary and systemic vascular lesions secondary to intubation and associated invasive mechanical ventilation, -comparison of intra-operative cardio-respiratory monitoring (blood pressure, oxygen saturation, hypercapnia, cerebral oxygenation), -comparison of complications related to the surgical act and follow-up

450,"3D Printing for Patients with Head and Neck Cancer

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
This experimental single centre trial aims to evaluate the use of 3D Printing for the Head and Neck surgeon. The primary objectives of the work are to determine the patient-related outcomes after the creation of the head and neck replicas, namely patient satisfaction, quality of life and anxiety and stress. The secondary aim is to evaluate the ease of use of the method by the surgeon, with a focus on the ease of pre-planning of the resective and reconstructive procedures, as well as the ease of operative time when carrying out head and neck surgery.

Detailed Description
-----------------
A prospective, non-comparative, interventional study with patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer, treated in the Oncology Unit of the Hospital de Santa Maria (Lisbon, Portugal). The participants will be enrolled immediately after the diagnosis of head and neck cancer, and 3D replicas will be individually designed and 3D printed for each patient prior to treatment. The 3D replicas serve as a pre-planning tool for the surgical resection, thus the surgeon will design the reconstructive techniques that may be used after complete excision of the tumor, including bone grafts for bone defects and the need for tracheostomy.

451,"In the last decade there has been an increased focus on brain-derived tau in acute ischemic stroke. This biomarker has a potential clinical value in several areas: First, it is associated with the final infarct volume and functional outcome in the acute phase of stroke and secondly, it has a potential value in the monitoring of clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and as a biomarker to assess the treatment response to novel therapeutics. PROMISE-BD-100 aims to describe the evolution of plasma BD-tau in acute ischemic stroke and to assess its value as a biomarker of stroke progression.

In first year, we collected the data of patients with thyroid nodules underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration in our hospital from 2018 to 2020. 2021 is the first year of our study. We added more data from this prospective single-center study. Therefore, the data for 2021 will be combined with the data for 2020 for training dataset. 2022 and 2023 are external test set."
453,"Visual prostheses are invasive devices implanted as a therapy for severe vision loss. A vision-restoring visual prosthesis is a surgically implanted electronic system, which consists of an implanted microelectronic array of electrodes in the eye (visual cortex in some devices) and a head-mounted camera. The head-mounted camera is a conventional wearable video camera, which is connected to the microelectronic array through wires. The signal from the camera is relayed to the microelectronic array, which produces a pattern of electrical pulses (phosphenes) on these implanted electrodes. The subject can learn to map these pulses to visual percepts. The main purpose of visual prosthesis research is to improve visual prosthesis performance, with the ultimate goal of enabling these devices to return sight to blind patients. The current study uses a new stimulation strategy, which has been designed to improve visual prosthesis performance. This strategy uses machine-learning-based computational models to generate a visual-percept-based map of the retinal visual field for each patient. This stimulation strategy is designed to produce a new set of stimulation strategies to improve visual prosthesis performance. In order to test the performance of this stimulation strategy, we need a set of test visual scenes and a large number of visual prosthesis subjects. We will test visual prosthesis patients at the University of New Mexico Hospital Vision Lab. We will test sighted subjects at the University of California, Berkeley. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether this new stimulation strategy can lead to improvements in visual prosthesis performance. We will also evaluate the safety of this new stimulation strategy in terms of subject discomfort and the incidence of adverse effects. We hypothesize that visual prosthesis performance can be improved by computer-vision-based visual scene understanding, which is based on the ability to reliably detect, localize, and identify objects of interest in visual scenes."
454,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common non-melanoma skin cancer and the most common in people with fair skin, the elderly, and those with a history of organ transplantation, hematologic malignancy, or autoimmune disease. The 5-year survival rates are approximately 80-90% for primary tumors. However, it tends to have a more aggressive behavior in immunosuppressed patients, leading to a worse prognosis. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has included cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in their 7th edition staging manual. We will be observing patients who have a cSCC and are at a higher risk of metastasis as defined by AJCC stage classification. We wish to determine if there is a relationship between immunosurveillance of the regional lymph node basins with ultrasound surveillance and development of distant nodal metastasis, local recurrence, and death from cSCC.

If cSCC is an early manifestation of systemic lymphatic involvement, then increased surveillance and identification of this involvement at earlier stages in the primary tumor will lead to earlier diagnosis, treatment and prevention of further distant micrometastases or involvement of the lymph nodes. More research is needed to determine the optimal follow-up interval for these high risk patients as well as the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy. The investigators expect the results of this project to allow for earlier detection of nodal involvement and lead to further studies and implementation of routine surveillance of the regional lymph node basins for higher risk patients with cSCC.

458,"Though it has been shown that early childhood interventions have positive long-term effects for children living in adverse environments, interventions that may help prevent such negative effects have been severely under researched. This is true particularly for the case of infants and young children who have been exposed to their mother's intimate partner violence (IPV) in utero and postnatally. One of the most significant issues in relation to the mother-child bond during the first five years of life is whether the child's mental health is going to develop well. Mothers who have been exposed to IPV often tend to see their child's behavior as overtly negative, which can have a negative impact on the mother-child relationship during that time. This relationship can be negatively affected by maternal distress and the mother's attributions about her child's behavior. Early childhood interventions that can help prevent negative effects during this critical window of physical, emotional, and social development in early childhood would be highly desirable. 

In the Clinician Assisted Video Feedback Exposure Approach therapy (CAVEAT) project, we intend to pilot an intervention to determine if it would be feasible to administer in a clinical setting. Our pilot intervention aims at teaching the mother how to identify different ages and stages of mentalization, and of child mentalization in her interactions with her infant. Through the use of video-feedback, the mother and her young child are asked to observe their natural spontaneous interactions and to practice observing, describing, and reacting to them.


Aims/Objectives
-----------------
We intend to gather preliminary data from this feasibility study on the process of administering a brief psychotherapy manual that aims to help mothers of toddlers (ages 1- 5 years) see their very young child's emotional states and communication more effectively, especially when the young child expresses negative feelings in response to being left alone or to perceived separation from the mother during their natural spontaneous interactions with one another. In particular, the pilot will assess if mothers who are in treatment for post-traumatic stress can complete the treatment and whether mothers who participate in the psychotherapy intervention have a change in how they understand their very young child.


Design
-----------------
The pilot study to be carried out at the Institut universitaire psychiatrique pour enfants et adolescents in Lausanne will be a case series of 10 women. Data on 10 women will be collected on the process of implementing CAVEAT in terms of their satisfaction with the intervention, whether they complete the intervention and any benefits derived from it as perceived by the women. Participants will be recruited through referrals from other mental health programs run at the institution and from existing patients who are in psychotherapy at the institution. We intend to enroll a total of 10 women per year, 2-5 women per month, and to repeat the pilot for a total of up to 9 years. The study itself will be completed in a year.

Participants will undergo the following assessments as part of the study:

• Questionnaire administered electronically over the internet (e.g., via doctena) or via phone (if applicable, depending on the ability of participants to use the internet on their own or their own devices at home). In particular, the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form.

• Two videotaped mother-child interactions will be conducted in the clinic, at the beginning and at the end of the intervention for assessing therapeutic process and outcomes - these videos will not be shown live during the sessions. The videotapes will be watched several times for coding of non-verbal parental behaviors. Coding will be done by two independent coders, who will be blind to treatment assignment. Codes will be collected from two separate five-minute clips taken from the full videotaped sessions. Ratings will be made on four measures of therapeutic process: parental sensitivity (observer-coded rating according to the Inventory of Parental Sensitivity); parental responsiveness to child distress (observer-coded rating according to the Child Distress Index); child mentalization (observer-coded rating according to the Infant Mentalization Developmental Scale); and parental attributions (inter-rater reliability on parental attribution score). The questionnaire responses will be analyzed descriptively for the feasibility and acceptability of CAVEAT. Inter-rater reliability will be examined for clinical outcomes.

461,"Background
-----------------
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular malignancy in adults, being responsible for up to 15% of cutaneous melanomas (Davies et al, 2006). UM comprises malignant cells arising from the melanocytes dispersed throughout the uveal tract. These cells can migrate to the subretinal space and produce choroidal tumors. More than 75% of uveal melanomas are located in the choroid, around the center of the eye (Hussain, 2008). The treatment for choroidal melanoma is mainly based on tumor size and location since they are the main determinants of survival. Plaque radiotherapy is the standard treatment for small and medium-sized tumors. In clinical practice, ruthenium (Ru-106) or iodine (I-125) are the most commonly employed radioisotopes. Ruthenium is the most utilized radioisotope in Europe and South America due to its availability and good clinical outcomes. It is currently the only available option in Brazil’s public health system (SUS). However, its use for large tumors (greater than 10 mm in thickness and/or 22 mm in diameter) is limited by the inability of delivering an adequate therapeutic dose of radiation without causing further damage to the surrounding retinal tissue. Due to this treatment limitation, other treatment options have been proposed in the last decade, including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), radiosurgery (gamma knife or linear accelerator), and proton beam therapy. Although gamma knife radiosurgery and proton beam therapy are effective treatments with reliable tumor control rates, they are associated with poor visual outcomes, inadequate globe retention, and their use is reportedly limited in public health systems of low- or middle-income countries. Enucleation is an effective management for very large tumors, but it is usually a last resource (Hussain, 2008). Therefore, considering the above-mentioned treatment limitations, our group explored an alternative approach using intra-arterial melphalan for tumor chemoreduction, aiming to reduce thickness and allow subsequent brachytherapy in those cases in which enucleation is mandatory, thus increasing the rate of globe salvage. Research objectives

Melphalan is a chemotherapy drug that can promote the death of cancer cells. It works by preventing the synthesis of DNA, a component of the chromosomes that carries genetic information. When cells start dividing, DNA also starts to divide. Therefore, melphalan is an excellent candidate to induce cancer cell death, given its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis. However, before being able to induce tumor regression, a sufficiently high concentration of melphalan must be achieved in the region of interest (ROI). When used as chemotherapy for solid tumors, melphalan is typically administered systemically by intravenous infusion. Due to melphalan’s very short half-life (180 to 250 seconds) there is no need for continuous drug infusion. Instead, the chemotherapy drug is infused over a short period of time (such as 5 minutes), achieving the desired drug concentration in the peripheral blood. However, when targeting tumors that are not located at the periphery of blood vessels, but instead around the middle of the vessels, the amount of drug reaching the ROI tends to be reduced, since it is often too diluted in the peripheral blood. This is why local chemotherapy delivery can be preferable in these cases, given its ability to increase the concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs in a given anatomic location (Fletcher, 2011). Furthermore, one of the main side effects of melphalan is bone marrow suppression. This can lead to the development of a condition known as myelosuppression in which the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells than normal, resulting in fatigue, fever, sore throat, and other symptoms. These symptoms can limit the amount of chemotherapy that can be delivered to patients, thus potentially impairing treatment outcomes. Furthermore, by limiting the administration of chemotherapy to a specific anatomic location, the risk of drug-induced bone marrow suppression and other systemic side effects can also be reduced. In addition to local drug delivery, another strategy for increasing the local concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs in the region of interest is the use of sustained-release drug delivery systems, such as implantable catheter-type devices. These systems are designed to deliver a controlled and sustained dose"

463,"200 military veterans with lumbar spinal stenosis that causes low back pain or neurogenic claudication of legs or thighs will participate in this clinical trial. Half of the participants will receive non-invasive postural therapy (NIPT). The study will evaluate the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of DME (diaphragmatic muscle exercise) and training to support continuous postural alignment. The training will instruct patients to adopt a more upright spinal alignment with flexion in the hip and knee, and to avoid the typical lumbar lordosis. After the study, the investigators will consider performing a study with a larger group of subjects to obtain clearer data on the effects of DME."

Participants who report stress in their day-to-day lives are at increased risk of developing heart disease and cardiovascular events. There is clear evidence that exercise is beneficial at preventing and treating cardiovascular-related outcomes. Mindfulness programs are also being adopted and are growing in popularity to improve physical and mental health, with exercise being a part of many of these programs. Many mindfulness programs utilize the 8-Limbed Path in Buddhism and other yogic traditions to guide mindful practice. There is research looking at the physical and neural changes elicited by different mindfulness programs through measuring electroencephalography, heart rate variability, and autonomic nervous system measures. However, there is limited literature on the effects of mindfulness programs on the cardiovascular system via cardiac biomarkers. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of different mindfulness-based programs on physical, cognitive, and neuroendocrine health. Our lab is particularly focused on assessing participants who suffer from mood disorders. Thus, we will investigate not only physical but also mental health outcomes with this study. Ultimately, this study should give us insight into possible benefits of the mindfulness practices used in this study.


Participant group/Arm 1: Control - This group will not attend a course. Members of this group must not attend any mindfulness classes during the study period. It is important that they do not have extensive experience in mindfulness. They will be recruited through poster advertisements at the University of Toronto. Data collection will take place at the beginning of the study (Week 0) and end of the study (Week 12).

Participant group 2: The Staircase Program
-The Staircase Program consists of 10 meetings. These will be 1.5 h/each for each of the 10 sessions. The meetings will be led by 2 of our lab members who are trained facilitators. Participants will also be asked to practice at home for approximately 1 hour/per day from Week 1-12. Each home session will be guided by a manual. The manual provides a structured progression of practices through the meditation sessions.

Participant group 3: Mixed-Martial Art Program
-The Mixed-Martial Art (MMA) program consists of 12 weekly classes. At each class, participants will practice the various moves and self-defense techniques together. They will then have the opportunity to practice their new skills and spar with one another. The MMA classes will be instructed by a trained coach. They will take place every 2nd week and last for  1.5 hours. There will be a trained coach for at least part of the session. The class will begin with light cardiovascular exercise followed by 15 minutes of the martial arts techniques. During the 1st 4 weeks, the intensity of the training will be increased slightly to increase intensity and promote weight loss. For participants who are unable to participate in these classes (due to time constraints), the instructor is happy to provide a personalized plan.

465,"Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) such as living in a conflict-ridden family or having a parent with drug problems can influence the development of breast cancer later in life. It is believed that this occurs when the person learns to regulate her emotions through unhealthy ways, such as eating or drinking, as well as her perception of safety and her way of forming emotional bonds. 
When this happens it causes what is known as 'stress' or the response of the body (physical, mental or emotional) to situations that are considered difficult or threatening. 
People's responses to stress or stress are mediated through epigenetics and may result in alteration of neurochemical networks in the brain and may also alter the functioning of the endocrine, immune and neuroendocrine-immune systems. This suggests that stress plays an important role in the development of chronic diseases such as depression, psychosis, cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. 
It's important to study the association between breast cancer and ACEs, as this can help us find new ways to prevent breast cancer and improve quality of life for those who have been diagnosed with it.
The investigators conducted several pilot studies in which a total of 227 women were interviewed about their history of childhood and adolescent experiences and, at the same time, their quality of life and cancer recurrence were evaluated. With these results, this pilot project has shown the feasibility and interest of the project.
The investigators purpose is to evaluate the prevalence of ACEs, the levels of biological stress and their impact on the quality of life, fatigue, attachment, resilience and anxiety of women in remission from breast cancer. We will also investigate if biological stress, or stress measured by self-reported measures, predicts ACEs.
Study design: 
This is an open-label cohort study conducted in collaboration with the Breast Cancer Unit of the Galicia Oncology Institute (OIG). The study includes a biological ancillary study for a subgroup of women in remission from breast cancer who have been diagnosed with ACE.
The objective of this ancillary study is to collect pre-diagnostic biosamples (blood, urine and saliva) and epigenetic data from women who are identified as having been exposed to ACE or not at baseline. 
The samples will be used to study chronic stress and epigenetic alterations in the DNA of women who have been exposed to ACE and have breast cancer.
This biological ancillary study will include a subgroup of women in remission from breast cancer who have been diagnosed with ACE or not. 
The study will provide information on the biological changes that may occur due to exposure to certain ACEs, such as divorce, divorce, abuse, sexual abuse in children and alcoholism in parents.
This study will allow us to understand how epigenetic changes in DNA are related to ACEs and to identify potential biomarkers for the early detection of breast cancer in individuals with ACEs.

Study Population: 
The study participants are women who are in remission from breast cancer and were diagnosed between January 2020 and December 2021. They must be between 18 and 65 years old, be able to understand and carry out the activities required by the study, and sign the informed consent form (ICF). 
The minimum age required to participate in the study is 18 years old and the maximum age allowed is 65 years old. This is because the investigators want to include a wide range of women, with the aim of obtaining a representative sample of the population. 
The investigators chose 18 years old as the minimum age because at this age most women in Spain will have finished high school and will have sufficient autonomy to participate in the study without difficulty. 
The investigators chose 65 years old as the maximum age because at this age most women in the general population in Spain have reached menopause and are therefore less likely to develop breast cancer. The investigators believe that it is important to have a representative sample of the population in order to understand how exposure to ACEs affects breast cancer risk and development. 
In order to ensure the representativeness of the sample, the investigators will select participants based on a stratified random sampling design. This means that participants will be selected from different regions of Spain, to ensure that the sample includes women from both urban and rural areas. 
It is worth noting that the inclusion of young women between the ages of 18 and 35 years old. is relevant to the study because this group is at increased risk for breast cancer and therefore it is important to include them in the study to understand how exposure to ACEs affects breast cancer risk and development"
466,"It has been well stablished that computer-aided detection improve the performance of all types of examinations (e.g. mammograms, endoscopy, and microscopic slides) where a lot of information has to be evaluated in very short amount of time. However, the real-life utilization is yet to be studied. The DiscoveryTM AI-assisted polyp detector system is a computer assisted polyp/adenoma detection system based on artificial intelligence. It detects classic adenomas and flat lesions, distinguished features like mucus cap or rim of debris with the advantage of a real-time and simultaneous multiple polyp detection.
Through this single-center, crossover trial, the investigators aim to determine the real-world effectiveness of this AI-assisted polyp detector system in colorectal screening. The ADR and PDR (for expert and non-expert endoscopists will be evaluated) after an initial examination, comparing it with the second procedure assisted by artificial intelligence. Besides, the diagnostic performance of the AI-assisted system will be assessed by sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV. Data quality will be assessed by obtaining the ADR, and PDR, adverse events, and colonoscopy characteristics from the patient database.
Data obtained from the patient database will be collected anonymously under strict regulations to preserve confidentiality and privacy. The investigators will submit and receive the information to be included in this study via a protected central network system. Data quality will be assessed by obtaining the number of new adenomas diagnosed, number of adenomas missed, and number of polyp missed and an expected PDR and ADR in each type of practice. Interventions (AI-assisted vs without assistance system) will be compared."
467,This study will evaluate the use of low glycemic index (LGI) diet in pregnant individuals with epilepsy in order to determine its tolerability and potential effects on seizure frequency. The investigators will collect stool samples through the duration of the study to examine alterations in the microbiome and metabolites which may account for the effects of LGI diet on seizure control. This study aims to improve clinical care for pregnant individuals with epilepsy by assessing the safety of the LGI diet and identifying potential biomarkers associated with its effects.

472,"Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) plays a central role in most cardiac surgical procedures. The use of CPB has been associated with an increased risk of complications such as myocardial dysfunction, organ failure, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke or even death. A large meta-analysis highlighted a higher incidence of perioperative adverse events, including acute kidney injury, myocardial dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, stroke and even mortality in cardiac surgery under CPB as compared to open heart surgery. The major physiologic derangements induced by CPB are decreased oxygen delivery and increased inflammation. As a result, 36-45% of patients experience postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), an independent risk factor for long-term survival.

The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficiency of an algorithmic monitoring, the Clinical-Oxygenator-Driving-Perfusion Index (CODPi), to help and guide hemodynamic management during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The CODPi calculates in real time the physiological need for circulatory support (peripheral resistance) and oxygenation (arterial oxygen content) during CPB. Through the use of an algorithm, the CODPi combines information on cardiac outputs and arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference to display a number on three levels (green – optimal, yellow – normal, red – problematic). The algorithm may allow surgeons to reduce both the exposure time to CPB and the amount of blood product transfusion. This may translate into improved clinical outcomes.

Except from the CODPi, our goal is to assess the safety and efficiency of a patient-individualized ventilation strategy as compared to the standard clinical care. Patients will be ventilated with a positive end expiratory pressure of 6 mmHg, a PEEP that is set according to CODPi during the whole observation period of the study (during CPB then during the postoperative recovery room stay).

Objective
-----------------
This study will evaluate the safety and efficiency of CODPi algorithmic monitoring during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). 

Methods
-----------------
This is a multicenter (2 sites across the Rhône-Alpes region and 1 site in the north of France), single arm RCT. The study will recruit elective cardiac surgical patients under CPB. The first 50 patients will be included under standard monitoring. The following up to 100 patients will be included using CODPi algorithmic monitoring from the beginning of CPB.

Trial procedure will consist of the following steps: recruitment, inclusion and randomization of patients by the study investigators, baseline data, ventilation procedure, hemodynamics monitoring, study endpoints.

The primary endpoints of the study will be the hemodynamic parameters during CPB.

Ethics
-----------------
The study has been designed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines (Declaration of Helsinki) and is supported by the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (ANSM). The study protocol has been approved by the local ethics committee (CPP Sud Est IV, Clermont-Ferrand, France). This study has been approved by the French National agency for Medicines and Health Products (ANSM, 1068-2016, 21/09/2018) and registered at the public registry for research trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03683641).

473,"1.Background and Significance of the Study

Due to the increasing burden of chronic pain on the individual and society, the quest for effective and noninvasive pain therapy methods has become more urgent. Despite the widespread availability of pain medications, many patients still experience poor pain relief. Opioid drugs can be prescribed to help control acute and chronic pain; however, their use is limited due to high rates of addiction and deaths related to overdose. Therefore, there is a growing need for alternative pain-relieving therapies that are effective and have minimal side effects. 2.Hypothesis and Objectives of the Study

The research hypothesis is that: (temperature changes in the lumbar region)

(1) Participants who receive auricular acupressure first will experience greater temperature changes in the lumbar region compared to participants who receive the same intervention after sham auricular acupressure.
    

(2) The magnitude of temperature changes in the lumbar region following auricular acupressure will be positively correlated with the intensity of the acupressure sensation.

After obtaining ethical approval, participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving auricular acupressure at left ear first followed by sham auricular acupressure after a 10 minute break (AA-SA group) ,while another group will receive sham auricular acupressure first followed by auricular acupressure at left ear after a 10 minute break (SA-AA group). During the study, vital signs will be observed while 40 participants receive auricular acupressure and sham auricular acupressure, and the temperature of the affected region will be measured and recorded using an infrared thermal imaging camera.

(3) Auricular acupressure will be associated with side effects such as soreness and redness at the contact area and surrounding areas.

The secondary outcome of this study is to analyze the side effects of each participant during and after the intervention, such as changes in body temperature, heart rate, acupuncture sensation, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and drowsiness. Participants will also be asked to report any sensations or discomfort experienced during the intervention to identify potential side effects.

3.Overview of the Research Methods

(1) Recruitment and Participant Eligibility

Participation in this study is optional, and participants must sign an informed consent form before the start of the study. 40 healthy individuals aged 18-30 years old will be enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) healthy individuals aged 18-30 years old; (2) have received high school education for more than 9 years; (3) have no hearing problems or have undergone a hearing test; (4) no obvious scars on the ear lobe. The exclusion criteria are: (1) individuals with skin diseases or severe dermatitis; (2) individuals with a history of hearing loss, abnormal ear morphology, and ear surgery; (3) individuals with a history of psychiatric disorders and chronic pain; (4) individuals who have been taking medication to treat mental illness within the past 3 months; (5) women who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding; (6) individuals with a history of alcohol or drug abuse; (7) individuals with a history of drug allergies; (8) individuals who have received acupuncture therapy in the past 1 month; or (9) individuals who are currently participating in other clinical trials.

(2) Procedures and Sampling

Those who meet the above inclusion and exclusion criteria and provide informed consent will complete the baseline survey and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21). During the study, each participant will receive two therapies, auricular acupressure and sham auricular acupressure. Both therapies are performed by a researcher with the same operation standard and duration. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and other physiological parameters will be monitored before, during, and after the treatment, and the temperature of each participant's lumbar region will be recorded using an infrared thermal imaging camera. After each treatment, the participant's symptoms and side effects will be recorded in detail by the researcher. Furthermore, the participants will be asked to describe their sensations and any discomfort they felt during the treatment.

(3) Data Analysis

Data analysis will be performed using SPSS statistics software. The data will be analyzed statistically using a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), and correlation analysis will be performed to explore the correlation between"
474,"Objective
-----------------
To evaluate the effect of three different strategies of MAP management during cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) on the serum lactate peak occurring during CPB and its associations with secondary outcomes as the occurrence of major organ failures (gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic), neurological dysfunction and mortality.

Primary outcome will be the peak of serum lactate measured during cardiopulmonary by-pass time.

Secondary outcome will be the evaluation of post-operative neurological damage, the occurrence of major organ failure during hospital stay and mortality at discharge and 30 days of follow-up, as well as the number of cases with serum lactate peak > 3 mmol/l, the area under the curve of the serum lactate values measured during CPB, the evaluation of intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary perfusion and the evaluation of intraoperative and postoperative cerebral perfusion through Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).

Introduction
-----------------
Nowadays, cardiac surgery represents an important challenge for anaesthetist and intensive care physicians (and for patients as well). The mortality observed in cardiac surgery patients is still too high (about 5-15%) and is usually attributed to major organ complications occurring during surgery and/or post-surgery. The intraoperative monitoring of cardiac output remains the most important parameter to guide the adequate management of the patient’s physiology. The measurement of cardiac output is a fundamental procedure that provides information on the adequacy of the surgical technique and on the possible presence of low cardiac output syndrome, which is usually managed through inotropic and vasodilator drugs. Although this monitoring procedure is still crucial, it is also burdened by several limits, mainly related to patient’s and surgical conditions. To overcome these limitations, some new techniques are under evaluation. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Cerebral Oximetry (Cdx®) have been introduced as a valid alternative to evaluate the real cerebral and pulmonar perfusion during cardiac surgery.
In fact, the NIRS and CDx devices, which are already routinely used, can be used to indirectly monitor the tissue’s blood flow and the corresponding metabolism, through the measurement of oxygen consumption and of oxygen saturation respectively.
Through the NIRS and CDx monitoring systems, the real cerebral and pulmonar perfusion can be measured without the need for invasive procedures (which are the only ones available nowadays) that are not always applicable to certain patients (i.e., pediatric and hemodynamically unstable patients).

Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Cerebral Oximetry (Cdx®) are noninvasive monitoring systems already used during cardiac surgery and capable of measuring the real intraoperative cerebral and pulmonary perfusion in real-time. The measurement of the cerebral and pulmonary perfusion is not a new monitoring procedure in cardiac surgery but it has never been used to guide the management of mean arterial pressure (MAP), and this is the main objective of the current project. This will allow us to monitor the intraoperative cerebral and pulmonary perfusion directly through new, not invasive, monitoring systems avoiding the use of invasive measurements that are burdened by some important drawbacks.

Hypothesis
-----------------
We hypothesize that the monitoring of MAP during the cardiac surgery will determine an improvement of the cerebral and pulmonary perfusion in real time. This will lead to an accurate definition of the best range of target MAP, which will decrease the occurrence of major post-operative complications related to the low cardiac output syndrome (i.e. acute kidney injury and lung injury among others).

Organization

The MAP Management Trial aims at evaluating the effect of three different strategies of MAP management during cardiopulmonary by-pass on the serum lactate peak occurring during cardiopulmonary by-pass time (primary outcome).
Secondary outcome will be the evaluation of post-operative neurological damage, the occurrence of major organ failure during hospital stay and mortality at discharge and 30 days of follow-up, as well as the number of cases with serum lactate peak > 3 mmol/l, the area under the curve of the serum lactate values measured during cardiopulmonary by-"

1. Rationale:
The most commonly observed movement disorders are ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. Recent clinical studies by other labs have shown that the PPI treatment is especially beneficial in the treatment of dystonia and tremor, but its clinical usefulness for patients with ataxia is limited because of their poor cognitive functioning including inattentive symptoms. This is consistent with preclinical literature which suggests that PPI treatment increases the expression of genes encoding excitatory amino acid receptors (EAARs), such as NMDAR and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR). Previous studies by our group have identified a negative correlation between the PPI dose and cognitive performance in Parkinson patients. Cognitive decline is especially concerning in patients with PD due to the high prevalence of comorbid neuropsychiatric (NP) disorders and their adverse interactions with PD medications. A better understanding of how PPI treatment affects cognitive performance may lead to better medication management for patients with PD. We thus aim to address the following aims:
1) To assess how PPI treatment (improve motor symptoms) affects cognitive functioning in Parkinson's patients.
2) To assess if serum bile acids (BAs) is related with cognition or cognitive decline in Parkinson's patients.
3) To compare the efficacy of PPI on cognitive performance in PD patients with different neuropsychiatric profiles.
2. Objectives:
1) To assess how PPI treatment (improve motor symptoms) affects cognitive functioning in Parkinson's patients.
2) To assess if serum bile acids (BAs) is related with cognition or cognitive decline in Parkinson's patients.
3) To compare the efficacy of PPI on cognitive performance in PD patients with different neuropsychiatric profiles.
3. Study Design:
2 Aims, 2 Phases: I. Pre-treatment cognitive assessments will be conducted to assess the relationship between serum bile acids with Parkinson's medications and cognition. Blood samples will be collected to quantify serum bile acids and their relationships with PD medications and cognitive performance will be assessed. II. Intervention Phase: Parkinson's patients will be randomized to either PPI treatment or sham treatment (placebo). The following changes will be evaluated: a) motor symptoms measured by motor Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) scores, a modified Brief Assessment of Cognition in Parkinsons (BIG-Cog) scores, a modified Brief Assessment of Disease Severity (BIG-Disease) scores and a modified Brief Assessment of Motor and Predictive Performance in Parkinsons (BIG-Predict) scores b) NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery test: Flanker and List Sorting tests c) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. Post-treatment cognitive assessments will be conducted to assess the cognitive performance before and after PPI treatment. Blood samples will be collected to quantify serum bile acids and their relationships with PD medications and cognitive performance. The blood samples will be stored for future analyses.
3. Population:
Healthy adults (18 - 65 years old). Parkinson's patients (18 - 75 years old).
4. Sample Size:
7-10 participants are required for each group of this preliminary study.
10-15 participants are required for each treatment arm in phase 1. An additional 40 participants will also be recruited for phase 2 to obtain a reliable assessment of sample size.
4. Study Duration:
Approximately 12 weeks.
5. Study Procedures:
Week 1: Pre-treatment cognitive assessments (visit 1):
a. Parkinson's patients will be asked to take their medications 1 hour before visit 1 including all PD medications and PPI (omeprazole 20 mg).
b. Motor symptoms assessment: motor UPDRS-III, BIG-Disease, BIG-Predict assessments.
c. Flanker and List Sorting tests from the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery.
d. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.
e. Blood samples will be collected at visit 1 to measure serum bile acids.

481,"Hyperinflation associated with collateral ventilation is considered a good predictor of ELVR, but the impact of valves setting on diaphragmatic functions and its role in the reduction of functional residual capacity remains uncertain. Our previous study showed a significant correlation between the gain of lung volume after valves setting and the improvement of the strength of the diaphragm. 
We hypothesize that ELVR decreases the functional residual capacity, which increase the transdiaphragmatic pressure and improves diaphragm function. We then expect an improvement of the transdiaphragmatic pressure after valves setting.

482,"BACKGROUND
-----------------
Class II dental restorations constitute a substantial proportion of dental procedures performed by general dental practitioners . Dental caries is a chronic infectious disease that leads to loss of tooth structure and eventually to the loss of teeth. Its prevalence is increasing and affects at least three billion people worldwide . Restoration is the procedure most commonly used to help prevent early loss of teeth, which may lead to several health problems. Although restoration therapy is common, the failure associated with the restoration procedure is increasing. In modern dentistry, one of the most frequently adopted strategies to reduce failure of restoration in patients is composite resin .
Composite resin has been widely used in dental restorations owing to its biocompatibility and physical, optical and mechanical properties. Recently, light-curable and dual-curable bulk-fill resin composites have been developed. Compared with conventional resins, high translucent bulk-fill resin composites with a higher inorganic filler content are capable of reaching clinically acceptable fillings in single or multiple increments, providing less procedural inconvenience, shorter curing cycles, and shorter operative times . However, the clinical indications of bulk-fill resin composites remain limited.
A previous human study compared restorations fabricated with Bulk-fill bulk-fill resin composites to those made with conventional light-curing bulk-fill composite resins and reported that restoration performed with the bulk fill was significantly higher than the two other groups . Another human study showed that the clinical performances of light-cure bulk-fill resin composites are similar those of conventional light-curing bulk-fill composite resins . Toxicological studies have demonstrated that the two different curing systems (light-cure and dual-cure systems) had no differences in terms of their cytotoxicity .
Thus, it could be concluded that both light-cured and dual-cured bulk-fill resin composites had similar clinical and mechanical properties and showed no significant difference in terms of their cytotoxicity. However, there are hardly any available studies conducted on long-term clinical studies of Class II restorations fabricated with these two types of bulk-fill resin composites. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated and compared the 2-year clinical performance of dual-cured and light-cured bulk-fill resin composites in human Class II restorations.
METHODOLOGY/DESIGN
-----------------
This was a randomized clinical trial conducted in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 statement . This study was approved by the ethics committee of Zhongshan University, Guangzhou, China (No. 2012-085) and registered at the Clinical Trials Registry – India (CTRI) (registration number: CTRI/2018/05/015242). After obtaining written informed consent from all participants, the samples were randomly divided into three groups, each of which received three Class II restorations made by different resin composites: Fill-Up (Kuraray Noritake Dental, Shizuoka, Japan), QuiXfil (3M ESPE, St, Paul, MN, USA) and Tetric N-Ceram Bulk Fill (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein). Each bulk-fill resin composite was allocated to the patient using a block-randomized sequence (S-Plus software, version 8). The random sequence was generated by an independent person and sealed to minimize the bias during the group allocation. After the procedure, all records were de-identified in order to ensure that all data and analyses are carried out by an independent operator who remains blind to the identity of the patients and restorations. All patients will receive the restoration as part of the treatment procedure, however, none of the clinicians and patients were aware of the group allocation.
To prevent the risk of selection bias, all treatments were carried out at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Zhongshan School and Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. Each patient received three Class II restorations, one in each of the four quadrants (two in the upper arch and one in the lower arch). Each patient was randomly distributed to one of the three groups to receive the three restorations. All restorations were performed by one experienced operator (Jianwei Sun), with an average working experience of 9 years. To guarantee the internal validity, all restorations were performed in a single appointment. In addition, all restorations were performed at the same clinical setting, with three class II cavities used in upper"
483,"Nivolumab is an anti-Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody that has established activity and is FDA-approved as frontline monotherapy for patients with advanced melanoma. Recently, nivolumab plus ipilimumab was FDA-approved as first-line therapy for intermediate- and high-risk unresectable/metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab is an immune-checkpoint inhibitor, and PD-1 inhibitors have been shown to improve survival in PD-L1-negative patients when combined with an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4). It is currently approved as monotherapy in this setting. The investigator is therefore interested in studying the efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed by single-agent nivolumab compared to ipilimumab alone, in patients with intermediate- and high-risk unresectable/metastatic melanoma.

485,"Achondroplasia is a genetic condition that is characterized by short stature and a range of other features, including skeletal deformation resulting in short limbs (proximal and middle segments) and a large head. Children begin to show signs of the condition during infancy and many experience developmental delay. Due to the short stature and other complications, achondroplasia can be disabling and significantly reduce quality of life. Current guidelines from EndoCure™, an independent medical organisation, do not offer any recommendations and state the condition is incurable and the only treatments involve surgery for spinal deformities.

TransCon CNP is made by EndoCure™. It consists of a chemical called N-acetylated cysteine-4 (NAC4) which is connected to fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). It has been shown in animal models to stimulate bone and muscle tissue by activating growth plate cartilage and promoting bone formation. In a previous Phase 1 and 2 study, TransCon CNP demonstrated improvements in growth rate in adolescents with Achondroplasia. A Phase 3 study showed that the drug is well tolerated and helps increase height compared to placebo in children and adolescents with Achondroplasia, and has not shown serious safety risks in animal models.

This study aims to determine long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of once-weekly subcutaneous (SC) dosing with TransCon CNP in children and adolescents with Achondroplasia. It will also demonstrate any increase in height gained during the study, and confirm the safety of TransCon CNP.

Participants will be required to attend the clinic for evaluation and dosing once a year. During their visit, safety will be monitored and blood samples will be collected for a full history and physical examination. This evaluation will last approximately three hours.

Long-term follow-up includes survival rates, MAE and MACCE."
489,"The aim of our work was to evaluate the effect of the pre-hypnotic suggestion on salivary flow, compared to the placebo suggestion, with a randomized double-blind design.
Background: 
There is growing indication of hypnosis as a good alternative to treat many diseases. This therapeutic technique uses concentration and focus to induce physical and/or mental change in patients. Various studies have shown the impact of hypnosis on salivary gland function, by reducing the salivary flow. 
Objectives: 
Our aim was to evaluate the effect of the pre-hypnotic suggestion on salivary flow rate of the main glands of the salivary system (parotid and submandibular glands).  
Methods: 
This study was a double-blind and randomized  clinical trial carried out at the University Dental Clinic of Ribeirão Preto (Graín, Brazil). 
A total of 49 volunteers were enrolled in the study (20 males and 29 females). 
The individuals were assigned in a randomized way into two groups (hypnosis / placebo suggestions). All participants remained seated in a comfortable chair, in a quiet environment. At each appointment, the participants were provided with instructions on the technique of hypnosis applied for the realization of the experiment. 
Both groups were asked to maintain the maximum contraction of the masticatory muscles during the induction of hypnosis. Thus, both groups followed the same pattern of induction of hypnosis. In this induction both groups were instructed to place four fingers (not the thumb) of the hand resting on the table (three fingers on one side and one finger on the other) and the other three fingers on the chin. The subjects were told that whenever they felt sleepy, the number would increase.
After the induction, the first group was instructed to close their eyes and say aloud the word “sleep” continuously, while the other group was instructed to say the word “relax” in the same way. Then, a blind technique to induce salivary gland stimulation was applied using a cotton swab wrapped in a paper square and soaked with isotonic saline (salt 0.9% with water). The blind test technique ensured that the two groups followed the same steps. The subjects who volunteered for this work were also instructed to keep the cotton swab in front of the parotid duct for three minutes using the same indications of the dentists for the procedure to be carried out with this technique. 
The flow rate of saliva was first measured with the patient in a relaxed condition (control group). To evaluate the presence of the hypnotic effect, two measures were made at 40 and 60 seconds of the stimulus (pre-hypnosis and post-hypnosis groups, respectively). The measure of saliva flow collected with the cotton swab was performed in triplicate, with an interval of 10 minutes between each measurement. These measurements were taken in a resting state by placing the cotton swab in front of
the parotid duct. The measurements were made continuously for four minutes. 
Data were statistically analyzed in SPSS version 21 software. Chi square, Student and Mann-Whitney tests were applied with significance established at p<0.05. 
Results: 
In the analysis of the results performed with the Student test, we observed a significant reduction (p=0.043) in salivary flow in the stimulated group of individuals who underwent hypnosis at the end of the experiment (Table 1) . 
Table 1 : Comparison of salivary flow rate in relation to the type of suggestion (Student test).
Type of suggestion  Medium (mm)  
Placebo suggestive 46.29(73.58)  
Hypnosis suggestive 36.67(63.65)  
P value<br>Conclusions: 
From the results obtained in the evaluation of clinical research on the effect of hypnosis on salivary flow rate, we conclude that hypnosis induction effectively induced a reduction in salivary flow through the parotid glands of volunteers. These data may be useful for the future study and application of hypnosis in clinical situations.

493,"Trial Summary 

This is an observational study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure gastrointestinal (GI) function, lung structure and function and liver endpoints in children and young adults with CF aged 6 to 11 years. 
 The recruitment will be split into two phases. In phase 1 there will be 12 participants enrolled in the study, 6 of whom are children/ young adults with CF with homozygous F508del or at least one copy of F508del. The remaining participants will be matched healthy controls in the age range 6 to 11 years. In phase 2 there will be a further 12 children/ young adults with CF with homozygous F508del or at least one copy of F508del. These participants should be starting on elexacaftor/ tezacaftor/ ivacaftor (triple combination) and will be asked to return to the hospital for a repeated scan 6 months after starting on the triple combination therapy. 

Phase 1 will be used for piloting the MRI scans as well as assessing if the healthy volunteers have been appropriately matched. This will include assessing whether the MRI scans are technically feasible and determining the length of time required to perform them. Phase 2 of the trial will be used to provide pilot data for ECT in this age group and to determine the impact of ECT on GI and Liver physiology.
 
Primary Objectives 

1. In healthy volunteers: Determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are technically feasible in 6 to 11 year old children and young adults
2. In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF): Determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are technically feasible in 6 to 11 year old children and young adults

Secondary Objectives 

1. In healthy volunteers: Measure gastrointestinal transit time using MRI (as described in GIFT-CF3)
2. In patients with CF: Measure clinical GI parameters pre- and post starting triple combination therapy 
3. Determine the frequency and degree to which there is a relationship between the clinical and MRI measures

496,"This randomized controlled experimental study aimed to compare the effectiveness of traditional white noise and novel multisensory stimulation in reducing neonatal pain during retinopathy examinations in premature infants. To assess the effectiveness of each approach, the study employed the standardized Premature Baby Pain Profile (PIPP) scale, which systematically assessed pain by evaluating multiple physiological and behavioral parameters such as oxygen saturation, facial grimace, heart rate, and breathing pattern. Through randomization, the study assigned premature babies to one of three groups: traditional white noise intervention, multisensory stimulation intervention, or the control group (standard of care). By conducting multisensory stimulation during the retinopathy examination, the study sought to enhance distraction through the synchronized presentation of visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli, potentially providing an immersive experience to neutralize the negative effects of the examination. The findings of this study have the potential to guide the development of novel intervention approaches that will effectively reduce the pain experienced by premature infants during retinopathy examinations, thus promoting their comfort and overall well-being. By leveraging emerging multisensory technologies and incorporating them into the standard healthcare practice, this study contributes to the improvement of neonatal care, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and the overall quality of life. This study also highlights the importance of multisensory stimulation as a viable intervention approach that can be applied to various healthcare settings, showcasing its potential to address a range of medical challenges and improve the overall quality of care across different patient populations. Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to the body of knowledge on effective strategies for managing pain and promoting patient comfort, offering valuable insights that can inform the development of evidence-based guidelines and enhance the standard of care in medical settings."

501,"Aim: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of white noise, heart sounds, and music on reducing neonatal pain during heel lance. Research Methods and Procedures: The design of the study was a randomized controlled experimental design. The sample of the study consisted of 84 infants with a gestational age of 28-42 weeks. Infants were exposed to white noise, heart sounds, or the music that the mother listened to most frequently during pregnancy for 10 minutes before the heel lance, during, and 20 minutes after the procedure. Data were collected by the researcher who was experienced in neonatology and did not take part in the research process. The pain of the infants before, during, and after the procedure was measured using the Neonatal Infant Acute Pain Assessment Scale (NIAPAS). Also, the duration of the procedure and the crying time were evaluated.

Introduction: Preterm infants suffer from various painful events and experiences in the newborn period. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) recommend minimizing pain during the healing process in the newborn period . Music, white noise, and heart sound are alternative methods proposed to provide non-pharmacological analgesia during invasive and surgical procedures. Music has been used for pain reduction and in stress management during pregnancy . Pain-reducing effects have been reported for some music genres. There have been studies suggesting that white noise relieves pain in infants . It has also been reported that listening to heart sounds reduces pain in infants. The studies reported that heart sounds were effective in reducing acute and procedural pain . 
The present randomized controlled study investigates the effect of white noise, heart sounds, and music on neonatal pain during heel lance in term and preterm infants. 

Objectives and Study Design: The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of white noise, heart sounds, and music on reducing neonatal pain during heel lance. The design of the study was a randomized controlled experimental design. The sample of the study consisted of 84 infants with a gestational age of 28-42 weeks. Infants were exposed to white noise, heart sounds, or the music that the mother listened to most frequently during pregnancy for 10 minutes before the heel lance, during, and 20 minutes after the procedure. Data were collected by the researcher who was experienced in neonatology and did not take part in the research process. The pain of the infants before, during, and after the procedure was measured using the Neonatal Infant Acute Pain Assessment Scale (NIAPAS). Also, the duration of the procedure and the crying time were evaluated.

Primary Hypothesis: - Listening to white noise and heart sounds will reduce pain during heel lance in infants and improve the effectiveness of the procedure. - Listening to music that mothers listen to while pregnant may reduce pain during heel lance.

Secondary Hypothesis: - Listening to white noise and heart sounds may reduce the crying time of infants during heel lance.

Study Participants and Sampling: Pregnant women who came to the antenatal care center of our clinic and gave birth in the clinic and newborns in whose cases heel lancing was planned were included in the research. Babies with gestational age between 28-42 weeks, whose Apgar at 1 and 5 minutes was over 7, whose body weight was over 2.000 grams, and who did not require oxygen support for the first 6 hours, could participate in the research. Inclusion criteria for infants were a gestational age of 28-42 weeks and a weight of 2 kg or more. In order for the sample to represent the target population, the population was grouped using the age and weight of the infants. Infants were divided into three groups as follows; preterm infants born at 32 weeks or more, preterm infants born at 32 weeks or more, and term infants born at 37-42 weeks. The group with babies born at 32 weeks or more was chosen as the sample. Sampling from each group was carried out using the table of random numbers. From each group, 28 was randomized for the white noise and music groups, and 26 was randomized for the group listening to heart sounds. 
Participants were selected and exposed to stimuli based on the randomization obtained from the table of random numbers.

507,"78 patients who presented deep hand burns were asked to complete functional scores and scar quality assessment in order to determine the extent of functional and aesthetic recovery after the hand burn.

Introduction and objectives
-----------------
Burns of the upper limb, especially the hand, pose a therapeutic challenge given their anatomical complexity. Despite the advances in skin grafting in recent years, functional sequelae remain a problem to be solved. These sequelae comprise scars (functional and aesthetic), limitations in mobility and difficulty using the affected hand.
The treatment chosen for the burn is tailored to the extent of the injury. Hand burns present two extremes: a minor injury can be treated with dressing, but a deep burn requires grafting. In such cases, the surgeon faces not only aesthetic problems (hypertrophic, retractile, or contracture scars), but also functional problems (pain, range of motion of the affected structures). 
In addition to the extent of damage to the skin, other variables influence the function of the burned skin: thickness of the graft, grafting location, tension on the scar tissue… 
The functional and aesthetic sequelae remain an important concern for patients. Patients who present hand burns require an in-depth description of these factors in order to establish a prognosis.
In addition to its scientific interest, burn sequelae assessment is interesting for the patient’s recovery.
This study aimed to describe the scar sequelae and the functional recovery of patients who have received releasing incisions, as well as the quality of life of the patient.
Aims
-----------------
Patients who present deep hand burns were asked to complete functional scores and scar quality assessment in order to determine the extent of functional and aesthetic recovery after the hand burn. 

Material and methods
-----------------
All patients with hand burns who presented to the Pierre-Colson Burn Center at the Lille University Hospital between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017 were included. 
Patients were selected for inclusion according to the criteria presented below ; exclusion occurred if one of the following criteria was met:
Inclusion criteria : Admission to a hospital burn center in less than one month;
Deep burns (at least one hand burned, burn area > 5% burned on one or more fingers);
Burns requiring releasing incisions;
Minor burns (< 5% burned on one or more fingers).
Exclusion criteria : Burns < 3 days old;
Death within one month;
Surgery of sequelae.
Surgery of hand burn sequelae was performed between D5 and D30 after the burn. The surgery was performed by the same surgeon, with releasing incisions. Surgery was performed according to standard protocol. The burn was cleaned on the operating table; this was the first stage of surgery. Patients were placed in a supine position to prevent further burns. A tourniquet was placed on the hand to reduce bleeding. The depth of the burn was assessed. Depth of burn is divided into superficial, deep thermal or circumscribed deep thermal burn when a full-thickness layer is damaged. A partial-thickness burn is also classified as superficial if it involves the dermis, deep if it involves the epidermis. 
The surface area of the burned areas was estimated by the method of Lund and Browder.
Bacteriological screening was performed; patients were treated with oral cephalosporin.
Patients were given a local painkiller, lidocaine cream, before skin grafting.
Patients were sedated and given general anesthesia for the surgery. 
Release incisions were made using 16 cm blades. The number of incisions made depended on the location and surface area of the burn. The depth of the burning determined which layer (epidermal or dermal) needed to be treated. The burn area was treated with two Zimmer stitches.
The patient was dressed with Xeroform and a dry sterile dressing on the day of skin grafting. 
The grafted area was dressed (Mefix, Xeroform, sterile non-adhesive dressing, Coban wrap); patients were given antibiotic and pain medication. The Xeroform and sterile dressing were changed every other day. After 1 month, if the skin graft had matured, the skin graft was removed. After 2 months, the wounds were closed by skin sutures. 
Patients were provided with compression bandages and painkillers.
Clinical evaluation of the patients was performed on the 5th day, and then on"

Although the needs of rehabilitation in the early years of breast cancer patients are still little known, we believe that it is important to identify them in order to increase the quality of life of these patients, the level of satisfaction and confidence in the medical and care system and, in the case of a relapse, to facilitate the acceptance of palliative care and, therefore, the quality of their last days through a transcultural adaptation of the PRO questionnaire. This study will provide relevant scientific information and will allow a better care of these patients.

Aim 3 will ascertain patient and provider perceptions of primary care in an ACO or non-ACO primary care setting including patient confidence in the primary care team, communication with the primary care team, and satisfaction with primary care.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Background: With rising health care costs, Medicare has embraced health care systems that can organize care delivery for vulnerable beneficiaries. Value-based care models (e.g., Accountable Care Organizations, ACOs) are health care payment models that aim to give health care systems incentives to improve care coordination, reduce the costs of unnecessary care, and improve health care quality. Although the majority of Medicare beneficiaries and primary care providers are included in these value-based care models, these models focus primarily on chronic diseases like diabetes and exclude the majority of dialysis patients in low-income households (which now equal 66% of the 722,000 total dialysis patients in the US). The ESRD program uses fee-for-service, an older Medicare payment model that rewards quantity of services provided rather than quality or cost-effectiveness of the services provided. Low-income dialysis patients in fee-for-service Medicare may choose a primary care site (in addition to dialysis and nephrology providers) as their primary care provider, but are unlikely to receive care as part of an ACO or other value-based care model . These patients are at higher risk for fragmented and poor quality primary care due to underuse of preventive services and coordinated specialty services. The impact of ACOs or other value-based care models on low-income Medicare beneficiaries is unknown. Primary objective Aim 1: To determine differences in patient outcomes and quality of care for low-income Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes receiving primary care in an ACO versus a non-ACO primary care setting (i.e., the difference in effectiveness). We will test the following two hypotheses: (1) low-income Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes receiving primary care in an ACO have improved patient outcomes and quality of care compared to patients without diabetes; and (2. low-income Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes receiving care from primary care practices participating in an ACO have improved patient outcomes and quality of care compared to low-incare Medicare beneficiaries without diabetes who see primary care practices outside of an ACO. Secondary objective Aim 2 will assess the cost-effectiveness of primary care in an ACO or non-ACO primary care setting from the payor perspective. Tertiary objective Aim 3: To ascertain patient and provider perceptions of primary care in an ACO or non-ACO primary care setting including: 1) patient confidence in the primary care team including: (a) the extent to which patients are likely to tell a provider (e.g., a specialist) about a problem discussed in a previous office visit with a member of the primary care team; and (b) the extent to which patients find the care plan or program they develop with their primary care team helpful in managing their health care. 2) patient confidence in communicating with their primary care team including: (a) the extent to which patients feel like they are involved in decisions about their health care; and (b) the extent to which patients find their visits with their primary care team quick and easy compared to past visits. 3) patient confidence in the quality of the care received from their primary care team 4) patient confidence in the availability of their primary care team for questions and support 5) provider confidence in the medical home including: (a) the frequency with which the medical home staff are able to access patients' demographic and medical information; (b) the frequency with which the medical home staff are able to access the nephrology service; and (c) the frequency that patients receive care according to the care plan outlined by the medical home staff and nephrologists.

515,"Lumbar pain is a health issue that causes disability in the workplace and society, which has reached a very high prevalence worldwide. Several studies have revealed that physical therapy interventions in the form of connective tissue massage and classical massage can effectively relieve the symptoms of low back pain. However, research gaps exist in determining the level of treatment effectiveness of these techniques. Thus, the present study evaluates the potential benefits of the Connective tissue massage and classical massagetechniques for chronic nonspecific low back pain in individuals between the ages of 18 and 65. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of three treatments on pain, functional status, and quality of life. The results showed that both massage techniques reduced pain intensity, improved functional status, and enhanced quality of life, leading to an overall positive outcome. The findings of this study are significant to the field of pain management and provide evidence-based guidelines for therapeutic clinical interventions. By optimizing patient rehabilitation outcomes, healthcare professionals can leverage the benefits of physical therapy to improve the healthcare system's overall quality of care.

516,"1. Background and rationale for research study: Cataract surgery is a common procedure that removes cloudy natural eye lenses to facilitate better vision. As such, millions of surgeries are performed each year to improve the visual function and quality of life for those with cataracts. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the amount of pressure inside the eye, which can vary for several reasons. IOP may be increased in the presence of glaucoma, a disease that damages the optic nerve over time and can lead to permanent vision loss. This damage can occur slowly or quickly, and the rate of progression is usually based on how well a patient controls their IOP. Elevated IOP from glaucoma may also occur due to blockage of the natural drainage system in the eye called the trabecular meshwork (TM). To treat this blockage, medications and surgical devices are used to open up the TM allowing fluid to flow more freely to drain. Many effective techniques are now available to treat glaucoma. However, many patients may still require additional support to improve their eye pressure control. 2. Goals, objectives and hypotheses: The goal of this research study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of canaloplasty alone in comparison to canaloplasty with Hydrus microstent to improve eye pressure (IOP) control in patients with cataracts. This study will include two arms that will each randomize one eye to receive an OMNI canaloplasty device (either with or without the Hydrus microstent). Both devices are approved and widely used by ophthalmologists around the world to increase the fluid flow out of the eye. It is well known that combining the two devices, OMNI canaloplasty and Hydrus microstent, may generate further improvement in IOP control which is the primary goal of this study. Who is eligible? Adults aged 18 years or older with open angle glaucoma. Open angle glaucoma is a type of slowly progressive disease where the pressure inside the eye is often higher than average. This can damage the optic nerve over time and lead to permanent vision loss. How will the study be designed? After study doctors determine that you are eligible to take part in this study, you will have the following screening tests performed: Visual Field OCT analysis of the nerve and cornea - your nerve and cornea will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) equipment. This is painless, non-invasive (it does not involve puncturing or cutting) and is similar to having photographs taken of your eye. Eye pressure test - measurement of the pressure inside the eye. To do this, a special machine called a tonometer will be used to gently touch the cornea (the transparent part of the eye) at the center of the eye. The pressure in your eyes will be measured using an instrument called a tonometer Visual acuity test - this is a test involving reading letters off a chart to determine how well you can see. The results of these tests will then be assessed by the study doctors and you will be assigned to either the “control group” or “treatment group” based on the results. If you qualify to take part in this study and go on to receive the study treatment, then the following will happen: Washout Period: You will be asked to stop taking your eye drops to treat your glaucoma. This is called a washout period, during which the effects of these medications leave your body. Study Treatment: You will be randomly assigned by chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive either OMNI canaloplasty alone or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. You will have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of receiving OMNI canaloplasty alone or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. This is a not a blinded study, which means that you, the study doctor, study staff and the sponsor will know the study treatment you are given. You will have the following study visits and undergo the following procedures: · Preoperative and postoperative care will be the same as a standard cataract surgery consisting of one day, one week, one month, six month and one year follow-up exams. The only difference for study subjects is they will be asked to stop all glaucoma drops one month prior to their pre-op exam and one year post-op exam. After Study Treatment: Glaucoma is a permanent and irreversible condition that requires lifelong monitoring with an eye care professional. Sometimes additional treatment is required. Your eye specialist will recommend follow-up care based on your personal findings.

517,"1. Objective of the study An open-label, randomized, comparative, controlled, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the test product Dorzotimol eye drops of JADRAN - GALENSKI LABORATORIJ d.d., Croatia, designed to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). 2. The study objectives are the comparison of Dorzotimol eye drops with Cosopt eye drops as to: a. Noninferiority of Dorzotimol by a mean intraocular pressure (IOP) change from baseline. b. Noninferiority by a rate of IOP to the target level of no greater than 18 mm Hg and by a rate of IOP change of at least 20% and at least 30% from baseline. b. Safety evaluation of Dorzotimol in patients with POAG. 3. Primary criterion - A noninferiority assessment of Dorzotimol by a mean intraocular pressure (IOP) change from baseline, which is defined by the difference in terms of the distribution center of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means being lower than a noninferiority margin of 1.5 mm Hg. Secondary criteria - Comparison of the treatment groups by: A rate of IOP to the target level of no greater than 18 mm Hg: a statistically significant intergroup difference, which is indicative of Dorzotimol noninferiority by this parameter is being expected. A rate of IOP change of at least 20% and at least 30% from baseline: a statistically significant intergroup difference, which is indicative of Dorzotimol noninferiority by this parameter as to the statistical significance of the difference in terms of the distribution center of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means being lower than the noninferiority margin of 0.05 (20% IOP reduction by IOP measurement date in the treatment group) and 0.08 (30% IOP reduction by IOP measurement date in the treatment group). Incidence rate of other adverse events to a greater or lesser extent linked to the test or reference product, including those evaluated from laboratory test findings. Treatment safety will be assessed from recording adverse events via analysis of complaints and symptoms, evaluation, and interpretation of the findings of instrumental monitoring (biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, IOP measures, perimetry) and laboratory tests. Incidence rate of AEs leading to discontinuation of the test/reference product or to cessation of treatment. Product safety will be assessed from the vital parameters evaluation results, laboratory test and instrumental monitoring data as well as the adverse event occurrence and severity."
518,"15% of Veteran Affairs (VA) patients fail to undergo recommended repeat colonoscopies. In 2018, the VA spent $499 million on CRC screening. Repeat and surveillance colonoscopies have up to a 7% missed or inadequate bowel preparation rate. Text message interventions have been used to improve bowel preparation adherence in the general population and VA patients, especially in older, lower-income individuals. This pilot study will examine feasibility and patient satisfaction with a two-week text message intervention to improve patient attendance at scheduled colonoscopies and patient bowel preparation completion. The Annie Colonoscopy Survey will be used to assess patient satisfaction with the text message intervention. Outcomes for the pilot study include: • 90% completion rate for intervention study activities • Participant satisfaction with Annie text messages (National Annie Colonoscopy Survey) • ≥90% completion rate for bowel preparation at repeat or surveillance colonoscopies • Reduced cancellation/no-show rate for repeat or surveillance colonoscopies The results will inform future trial design for a larger randomized controlled trial."
519,"Objective of the study: The main objective is to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration versus management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal pelvic ultrasound. The secondary objectives are: the comparison of the rate of complications of the two techniques, during and after surgery the comparison of the rate of recourse to a second line surgical management between the two arms, the comparaison of the rate of synechiae diagnosed by hysterosonography between the two techniques at 6 weeks after surgery, the comparaison of the time to conception in the two arms during the 2 years after surgery in the two arms the comparaison of the fertility rate at 2 years after surgery in the two arms.

Background and Rationale: Hysteroscopy is the gold standard for the management of uterine conditions, particularly intrauterine adhesions; however, this intervention is not widely used because it requires specialized equipment and skills, which are not always found in the gynecological services. In contrast, endo-uterine aspiration is easier to perform and requires little or no training. Many randomized trials have compared hysteroscopy and aspiration techniques for the management of intrauterine adhesions in the past, but there is only one prospective randomized and monocentric study on this subject with a recent date of publication (2016) compared hysteroscopy and endo-uterine aspiration with no significant difference between the 2 techniques: no significant difference in postoperative complications with, however, an increased reoperation rate in patients with a second aspiration technique compared to endo-uterine aspiration technique (1.1% versus 0%, p = 0,008). The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2017 also show no significant difference between these techniques in terms of the success rate (hysteroscopy: 94(96% conf.interv. (CI), 93 to 95; aspiration: 93%) and number of adhesion reoperations (hysteroscopy: 1%; aspiration: 1%). There are only two prospective randomized and multicentric studies (the first published in 1996) of this technique, with no significant difference in the rate of uterine removability between hysteroscopy and aspiration (90% versus 85%). With the improvement of endoscopic equipment and techniques, we wanted to compare hysteroscopy and endo-uterine aspiration in a prospective and randomized fashion in gynecological services from different university hospitals (multicenter study). The present study thus answers the question of which of the two technique is preferable for the management of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage at the present time, in gynecological emergency units. Our hypothesis is the following: The success rate by hysteroscopy is superior to endo-uterine aspiration for the management of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after treatment.

Crowdsourcing data will then be compared to data gathered on the lab scale to assess differences in performance on the same task. Participants will be presented with jars of colored balls on a computer screen, either of which may contain a higher ratio of two colors (bright or dark blue) during an inference task. Our study will investigate three components: (1) whether people can infer quantities on short and long time scales, (2) whether people use cognitive maps to improve inference performance, and (third) whether people can learn from these maps to optimize future inference."
521,"12% of adults over 65 years of age have dementia. Although most patients who develop dementia have significant deficits in memory and their functioning, many patients with dementia also develop problems with sleep such as trouble falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia) and nighttime awakenings (sundown syndrome). Current sleeping aids may cause adverse effects that cause patients to develop new dementia or worsening symptoms. Newer sleeping aids that have less adverse effect potential have less data about their safety in the dementia population. Lemborexant is a newer sleeping aid that has been shown to reduce insomnia in patients with alzheimer's disease, although its effect on insomnia in patients with non-alzheimer's disease dementia is unknown. This study will evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of lemborexant in a single older patient with non-alzheimer dementia and insomnia in an N-of-1 trial. To our knowledge, this will be the first case of its kind to be reported on."

523,"In this randomized, controlled, pre-test, post-test study, COPD patients will be randomly divided into two groups: a control group who does not perform any rehabilitation intervention, and an experimental group who will be given 20 minutes of virtual reality breathing exercise 3 times a week for a total of 8 weeks. In this study, the degree of dyspnea, psychological health, anxiety and quality of life will be evaluated in patients with COPD, where breathing exercises with virtual reality glasses will be applied to the experimental group and breathing exercises will not be applied to the control group. It is thought that virtual reality breathing exercises applied to the experimental group will improve the dyspnea, anxiety and quality of life of the patients. In the planning of the research, 24 patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in the study and divided into two groups: an experimental group and a control group with randomization. It is planned that the study will be completed in eight weeks. Each session in the experimental group will last approximately 15 minutes, including 5 minutes of acclimation time for the patient and 5 minutes for the post-testing of the patient. Virtual reality breathing exercises will be applied on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings, and each exercise will last for approximately 20 minutes. It will be applied a total of 8 times in the two groups. As a result of randomization, it is thought that the COPD patients in the control group will continue treatment in the health institution where they were taken, and after being given written and oral information, their anxiety, depression, stress, quality of life, dyspnea and oxygen saturation will be evaluated for 8 weeks. In the experimental group, it is planned to make virtual reality breathing exercises part of the routine treatment."
524,"250-400 Black women will be enrolled in this phase 2 study. All participants enrolled will complete a series of lab-based assessments on Day 1. These assessments will help us to better understand the factors that influence the health of Black women. On Days 2 to 11 the study team will monitor Black women's behaviors in relation to their vascular health using a smartphone application. During this period the study team will also collect saliva samples on 3 consecutive days. This study aims to understand the underlying mechanisms of race-associated differences in cardiovascular health and provide a new framework for understanding and treating cardiovascular disease in Black women. This study could directly impact the quality of life of over 102 million people who self-identify as Black in the U.S. and over 2 billion people worldwide. It is estimated that by 2050, Black people may make up more than 11% of the world population. Therefore, unraveling the biobehavioral predictors of cardiovascular health among Black women is a priority for public health professionals and epidemiologists. However, few studies have examined how behaviors of Black women, particularly after puberty and into childhood, may affect their risk for heart attack and stroke. In order to address this gap in the literature, our study will take a multi-modal, behavioral approach by using biobehavioral assessments to identify biomarkers of cardiovascular health in Black women. In addition, we will employ a mobile and wearable technology-based assessment, as well as a blood draw to obtain a more detailed picture of an individual's risk of heart disease. Our study will also use a multi-modal research approach to compare the effects of environmental stressors on cardiovascular health between Black women and White women."

526,"In cardiac surgery, plasmin is formed during surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB), and it enters the brain where it causes damage to the blood brain barrier, causing inflammation. In addition to its anti-bleeding effects by inhibiting plasmin production, TXA might be able to keep plasmin sequestered in the blood instead of reaching the brain, thereby stabilizing the blood brain barrier and lessening post procedure inflammation. This in turn may reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium (POD). This project will analyse whether patients who receive higher or lower doses of TXA (as determined by the dose the patient receives) have differing incidences of POD and whether TXA dose also affects other in-hospital mortality and morbidity outcomes."
527,"Background： 
The prevalence of non-specific neck pain is rising year by year. It has become one of the common chronic pain and neck disorder that is highly prevalent in developed nations. Neck pain affects all ages of adult, particularly with respect to sedentary lifestyle, the prevalence and incidence of nonspecific neck pain was 19.6% among adults aged 18 years and older . 
Non-specific neck pain refers to pain without a known underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. It's estimated prevalence varies between 2 and 71%, with approximately 38% of older adults reporting some form of neck pain . Nonspecific neck pain is the most common and painful neck disorder without serious underlying disease or abnormal structure. From this view point it is mainly diagnosed on the basis of clinical grounds, provided that there are no findings of serious underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. 
Chronic nonspecific neck pain is diagnosed as a pain in the posterior and lateral aspect of the neck between the superior nuchal line and the spinous process of the first thoracic vertebra with no signs or symptoms of serious underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure, and the absence of neurological signs and diseases. It's the most common type of neck pain and the third most common musculoskeletal condition . Chronic nonspecific neck pain has a high burden in terms of disability and work absenteeism, although it may be self-limiting . 
Non-specific neck pain have great influence on quality of life, as it restricts social and personal activities. The natural course of nonspecific neck pain remains unclear. Most nonspecific neck pain patients recover within a few weeks after first onset, but some patients are susceptible to relapse or may experience chronic pain . Neck pain lasts more than 3 months and becomes chronic when it limits daily functioning, induces substantial medical consumption and results in prolonged sick leave and disability . As a consequence, it places a heavy burden on individuals, employers and health care services. 
Study Objective
=================
The objective of this study is to compare the effects of both myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy in improving patients' outcomes (pain, range of motion and functional disability) among patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain. It will also evaluate the duration of treatment effect. 
Study design
=================
The study is a prospective study with randomized interventions between the two study groups: 
1. Myofascial Decompression Therapy Group: The patients will receive 
A. Pumpkin method (suction cup method) applied to the sternocleidomastoid muscle area
2. Positional Release Technique Group: The patients will receive 
A.Positional Release Technique applied to the sternocleidomastoid muscle area

Duration of treatment
=================
Both study groups will receive both interventions every 3 times in 2 session a week for a period of 4 weeks. A total of 12 treatment sessions. 
Assessment plan
=================
An independent and qualified clinical investigator will administer the entire assessment. 
At the beginning of each study session, the clinical investigator will collect the demographic information of each subject and relevant clinical information that will be recorded on case report form (CRF), while the clinical investigator is not aware of the patient treatment strategy. During the study, all cases will be reviewed and monitored every 3 times a week through the telephonic interviews with the patients. 
Data collection tools
=================
* Numerical Rating Scale (NPRS).
* Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire. 
* A clinical examination (ROM cervical spine) will be done by an examiner. The patients will be asked before data collection, any discomfort during the measurement.

528,"Patients currently undergoing radical anterior resection surgery of rectal tumor with specimen extraction via stoma are still at risk of stoma complications, which have a serious negative impact on body function and quality of life. Clinical treatment of acute stoma complications is still limited and there are still no methods to fundamentally reduce stoma complications. Previous stoma closure has been reported to increase stoma complications. The Dumpling suture method is a new way of suture fixation of the peristomal incision, which involves making concentric incisions around the skin incision and stitching the skin fold together in a small dumpling shape, similar to the process of folding and pinching Chinese small dumplings. This method was firstly used successfully in stoma closure. In the present study, the Dumpling suture method will be utilized in stoma formation and the traditional suture method will be compared with it in the prevention of stoma complications in patients undergoing radical anterior resection surgery of rectal tumor with specimen extraction via stoma.

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Background: According to Chinese guidelines on ICU ventilator management in severe respiratory diseases, the invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) with oxygenation was the first choice for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). Many recent studies indicated that the treatment strategies for AHRF had changed in the past few years. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has become an alternative to the invasive ventilation(IV). However, there is a lack of evidence from robust RCTs. We will examine the effects and safety of HFNC in ICUs. Methods: This is a multi-center, pragmatic, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with AHRF [peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 92% in room air, respiratory rate (RR) ≥ 30 breaths/min, or hypercapnia (PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg) in room air] will be screened and randomized into either IV or HFNC groups. The primary outcome is the hospital mortality rate in ICU. Secondary outcomes include the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (MV), PaO2/FIO2, the total length of ICU stay and hospital stay The rate of mortality will be compared between these two groups using the independent sample t-test. The safety of patients will be assessed by the incidence of complications. The hospital mortality rate, the rate of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation (MV), PaO2/FIO2 and the total length of ICU stay and hospital stay will be analyzed and compared by using non-parametric test.

Detailed Description
-----------------
According to Chinese guidelines on ICU ventilator management in severe respiratory diseases，intravenous ventilation with oxygenation is the first choice for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure , however we need to get evidence of the safety and efficacy of non-invasive ventilation in the clinical application. We will perform a randomized controlled trial to determine the hospital mortality rate、the rate of ICU admission、mechanical ventilation (MV), PaO2/FIO2, the total length of ICU stay and hospital stay of patients who treated with high flow nasal cannula versus traditional invasive ventilation.

535,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate an assisted digital telemonitoring platform for patients with POAF. The study was conducted exclusively at the InCor, a specialized center for cardiac disease. 
METHODS: This was a prospective single-center controlled study involving patients undergoing heart surgery. We used a parallel assignment model to compare patients in two groups: the control group underwent standard treatment and care at the institution, while patients in the telemonitored group received telemonitoring using a Samsung Galaxy smartwatch and FAPO SI³ platform, which was integrated with the hospital's electronic medical record system. 
RESULTS: We enrolled 237 patients from the InCor and assigned them randomly to one of the two groups. Our results showed a reduction in re-hospitalization rates, scheduled consultations, extra occurrences, adherence to technology, adherence to treatment, and smartphone/tablet application use by patients in the telemonitored group. Although both groups showed similar results, patients in the telemonitored group demonstrated better clinical results. 
CONCLUSIONS: The use of remote monitoring and care platforms can improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs. Therefore, the integration of telemonitoring platforms with electronic medical records and wearable devices has great potential in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The primary purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of CPI-825 administered at weekly intervals during one cycle of consolidation therapy in adult subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer who have undergone curative resection (defined as en bloc resection of the pancreatic body or tail as well as en bloc resection of ≥ 4 of ≤ 6 regional lymph nodes).

Detailed Description
-----------------
The use of palliative antineoplastic therapy in these patients is based upon experience, rather than on controlled trials or retrospective reviews. Patients will receive CPI-825 in combination with other therapies for the treatment of subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer. Prior to initiating consolidation therapy, patients will have experienced the following: 1) curative-directed local therapy to maximally debulk disease. 2) neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Patients should be treated with CPI-825 for 3 weeks in an outpatient setting at weekly intervals starting within 45 days of surgical resection and continuing until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or completion of 3 consolidation cycles of CPI-825.

Background: More than 10 % of the adult Danish population report heavy drinking (alcohol dependence or harmful alcohol use) and 13-17,% report binge drinking of at least one occasion during four week period. Excessive alcohol use is a risk factor for serious liver damage, which can progress rapidly to advanced stages of liver disease, cirrhosis and death. The Danish national institute of health has an alcohol strategy addressing early referral to treatment followed by long-term follow-up in order to achieve an alcohol-free life. Aims: To develop a screening strategy in primary health care, with increased testing for liver damage in patients having high risk of alcohol-related liver damage due to binge drinking or heavy drinking. To determine the alcohol consumption status and liver health one year after randomization. Method: The aim is to recruit 300 patients from a primary health center and include 2 cohorts in an RCT. These patients will have an increased risk of alcohol-related liver damage due to binge drinking or heavy drinking. The first cohort will be 200 individuals, 100 in each arm of the RCT, undergoing a non-invasive liver stiffness measurement (transient elastography). The second cohort will be 100 individuals, who will only be invited for blood sampling. They will be allocated to receive information about alcohol related liver disease after the first blood sampling. Results: The investigator will describe the intervention and control group. Alcohol consumption will be measured by the CAGE Questionnaire and frequency of heavy drinking defined as abstinence/light consumption/heavy drinking (yes or no). AUDIT-C will be compared between intervention and control arm. Liver stiffness values will be compared by non-parametric two-group comparisons, Wilcoxon signed rank test for matched pairs, and correlations between AUDIT-C score with liver stiffness value will be calculated. Liver stiffness measurement has a validated cut-off of ≥ 8 kPa, corresponding to advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Sensitivity will be reported together with 95 % confidence intervals. The investigator will assess the change in liver stiffness by Wilcoxon signed rank test for matched pairs. Conclusions: The investigators primary aim is to demonstrate that individuals with an increased risk of alcohol-related liver damage will have a high proportion of liver stiffness above cut-off after 6 months. If the hypothesis is confirmed, the investigators will propose a screening strategy in primary health care, where patients at high risk of liver damage will be identified by a liver stiffness measurement and receive a referral to specialist addiction treatment to improve their alcohol related problems. The long-term goal is to decrease the risk of liver failure in patients with alcohol-related liver disease by a stepped down approach with regular liver stiffness measurements."
538,"Etiological diagnosis of severe specific language and learning disorders (SLLD) has often remained elusive. To date, the diagnosis remains difficult, and the diagnostic search requires a careful and comprehensive examination. Recent evidence suggests that rare pathogenic de novo variants or germline mosaicism significantly contribute to SLLD etiology. The identification of a causal mutation can have a significant impact on medical management and prognosis. Exome sequencing (or genome sequencing) is a promising test to further our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of these disorders. Exome sequencing is an efficient approach and has the potential to identify the cause of these disorders despite their heterogeneity; however, data on the diagnostic yield are still lacking. The purpose of this multi-centre prospective study is to determine the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing in the context of the genetic evaluation of severe SLLDs and its value in terms of medical management and patient care. Patient data will be analyzed by the research team and the families will receive a report presenting all the scientifically relevant information about the genetic evaluation. Participation in the biomedical research program is optional and it can be interrupted at any time. 
The investigators will assess the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing by characterizing the variants detected through the targeted analysis (array CGH). They will also establish whether the results of genetic testing influence the medical management of the family and describe the impact of the genetic information on the lives of children and families."
539,"The purpose of the proposed study is to compare traditional versus minimal sedation in order to prevent the hypoxemic response to mechanical ventilation through a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Currently no firm guidelines for using sedation for patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation exist. In our study, patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation will receive either either no sedation, 3-9-micograms/kilogram of midazolam or propofol for three days in the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary outcome is incidence of severe hypoxemia as defined by a PaO2/FiO2-ratio of < 150 mmHg sustained for more than one hour, on three consecutive days.Secondary outcomes are respiratory complications (pneumonia, pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome) and delirium assessed by the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC)."
540,"1.Background of the study: Cluster of Differentiation 18 （CD18） is a kind of protein located on the surface of T cells and natural killer cells. As the main link between the innate and acquired immune systems, CD18 plays a key role in the coordination of immune responses, such as T cell activation, innate and acquired immune crosstalk, anti-tumor immunity, and the regulation of the expression and function of CD18. As an important sub unit of CD18, CLDN18.2 gene has the function of immune regulation and has the special characteristics of tumor immune escape and tumor self-antigen, making itself become a new target for tumor immunotherapy; 2.Objective of the study: To evaluate the safety, tolerability and recommended dose of Bio-008 in patients with solid tumors. To evaluate the activity of Bio-008 in tumor patients through objective indicators, such as ORR (partial response rate), DCR (disease control rate), and DOR (duration of response); 3.Methods of the study: The experimental group includes seven sequential increasing dose groups, including dose levels of 0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/ kg, 3.3 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kg, 20.0 mg/kg, 30.0 mg/kg and 40.0 mg/kg, with at least 6 subjects in each cohort, with the interval of cohorts being about 3 weeks. The subjects in each dose group received the corresponding dose Bio-008. The researchers can adjust the administration time according to the patient's tolerance, and if there is an infusion reaction, the infusion can be suspended and completed within 12 hours. Administer on the first day of each cycle, once every 3 weeks (1 cycle, i.e. 21 days) (Q3W) until the criteria for termination of treatment or withdrawal from the study are met, whichever occurs first; The subjects who received Bio-008 at the RP2D dose were further enrolled into the extension treatment stage to observe the long-term efficacy and safety of Bio-008. The results of the above evaluation indexes will be used as the basis for dosing determination, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) determination and evaluation of immunogenicity, in combination with clinical observation. This study is a prospective, uncontrolled, open label, parallel group study.

544,"1. Background of the Study: Management of dry eye is one of the most encountered problems in ophthalmic practice. There is no gold standard therapy for this disease. While there are many theories trying to explain the pathophysiology of this disease, all these theories have one main problem: lack of validity supporting their claims. Hence, the dry eye is considered a multi-factorial disease. Therefore, the goal of treating dry eye is to reduce the signs and symptoms of this disease. The aim of this study was to see if combining intense pulse light (IPL) and diquafosol can produce a synergistic therapeutic effect and reduce both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. 2. Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this study is that the combined regimen of IPL and diquafosol will be more effective than either regimens when used as a monotherapy. 3. Intervention(s) and Duration: Participants were treated by two regimens with different duration each, and a combination of both.
2. Control: Participants in the control group received only DQS 3% 3 times/per day for one month.
3. Experimental 1: Participants receive the diquafosol 3% twice a week for one month.
4. Experimental 2: Participants receive the diquafosol 3% two times a week for 4 weeks. IPL will be applied twice in the first month, then 2 weeks apart, for a total of 4 sessions. In IPL group, only the IPL will be performed. For 4 weeks, 2 sessions will be performed. 5. Experimental 3:

The literature reports a variety of therapeutic agents, such as medical treatment, surgical intervention, or a combination of both. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the therapeutic effects of the combination of MTX in a single dose, followed by hysteroscopic evacuation of product of conception (POC), and the additional use of Letrozole in a single daily dose of 5 mg (2 x 2.5 mg) orally for 10 days in the treatment of women with cesarean scar pregnancy. The obtained results showed that the use of Letrozole in the treatment of Cesarean Scar Pregnancy enables better prevention of blood loss, a reduction in the conversion rate and a decrease in the rate of complications compared to the protocol of combined treatment with MTX followed by hysteroscopic evacuation of POC.


Endpoints
-----------------
Primary outcome:: The primary outcome was the rate of bleeding during and after surgery or conversion from hysteroscopy to laparoscopy or laparotomy due to hemorrhage. Bleeding was also evaluated regarding the volume of blood loss and the frequency of conversion from hysteroscopy to laparoscopy or laparotomy due to bleeding.
Secondary outcome:: Secondary outcomes were the percentage of conversion from hysteroscopy to laparoscopy or laparotomy due to adverse pregnancy events (fetal cardiac activity, active abortion), preoperative assessment of anatomical features and pathological changes associated with CSP (presence / absence of an extra placental component or / and the localization of intrauterine adhesions) or intraoperative pathological changes (the state of placenta, adhesions, necrotic tissue, and intrauterine myometrial cysts / hydrosalpinx). 
Bone marrow function (red blood cells): Change in T/l in the course of treatment. Hemoglobin level before procedure, after procedure and 7 days after the procedure.
Blood loss volume during the procedure: The volume of blood lost during the procedure was assessed by weighting the gauze and drapes used in the course of the procedure.
Blood marrow function (white blood cells): change in Hb level in the course of treatment (day 0,1,8,15).
Blood marrow function (platelets): change in Hb level in the course of treatment (day 0,1,8,15).
Liver function (serum total bilirubin): Changes in the concentrations of serum total bilirubin in the course of treatment (day 0,4,7).
Liver function (alanine transaminase): Changes in the concentrations of alanine transaminase in the course of treatment.
Liver function (aspartate transaminase): Changes in the concentrations of aspartate transaminase in the course of treatment.
Liver function (gamma-glutamyltransferase): Changes in the concentrations of gamma-glutamyltransferase in the course of treatment.
Kidneys function (urea): Changes in the concentrations of urea in the course of treatment.
Kidneys function (creatinine): Changes in the concentrations of serum and creatinine in the course of treatment

554,"Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is an emerging breast imaging modality, which uses the injection of iodinated contrast agent before standard mammography. CEM creates images that reflect the micro-vasculature of the breast and can therefore detect and visualize small breast cancers at very early stages. The situation can occur that lesions are only visible on the recombined image and not the low-energy mammogram, in which case we need to perform ‘contrast-enhanced stereotactic biopsy’ (CESB), in which CEM is used as a targeting modality. However, experiences with CESB are still limited and one of the most urgent questions that need to be answered is the amount of tissue sampling that is required to reach a final diagnosis."
555,"Osteoarthritis is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in adults. As the population ages, it is anticipated that Osteoarthritis will soon become one of the most common causes of disability. The knee OA has become a major medical and economic problem. A range of therapies and rehabilitation treatments are required to manage the OA. Biomechanical factor that is assumed to contribute to the etiology of OA is laxity of knee joint, which is described as the rotation or displacement of femur from tibia. The progress of the lateral and medial knee OA, as defined by narrowing of joint space and a degradation of physical activity, was found to have been linked with lower limb valgus-Varus alignment. The main focus in OA management is on promoting self-management, reducing pain, optimize function, and modifying the disease process and its effects. The primary treatment for OA knee conservatively is physiotherapy, which includes strength training, modalities, knee bracing, resistance training and Kinesiotaping. the knee joint can be stabilized using Quadriceps strength training and Kinesiotaping. Kinesiotaping is an elastic woven-cotton strip with a heat- sensitive acrylic adhesive structure. It is very safe, noninvasive, effective, low-cost, and easy to use by both health professionals and patients. Kinesiotaping can be a valuable alternative to conservative treatment options of managing knee pain, as well as providing additional benefits to the patient for their physical activity. Kinesiotaping is based on the concepts of the neuromuscular system, which is the ability to recruit the muscles in the correct sequence and at the right time during movement, and the lymphatic system, which is the ability of the body to carry excess fluids from inflamed tissues and to facilitate blood flow. In knee OA, patients often suffer from increased pain and knee oedema, and Kinesiotaping may be effective in reducing these signs and symptoms, as well as improving physical activity. However, there is a gap in current literature on the effects of kinesiotaping on the gait parameters, pain, stiffness and functionality in people with knee osteoarthritis.


 Input Text: A comparison of the efficacy of TP53 inhibitor AZD 1775 combined with chemoradiotherapy on the safety and efficacy of unresectable advanced non-small cell lung cancer

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
AZD175 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor that inhibits p53 function by blocking its phosphorylation on the Ser57 residue. AZD175 demonstrated significant and sustained tumor shrinkage in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The most common drug-related adverse events were nausea, dysgeusia and fatigue, but these were generally manageable. This trial was a single-center, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the antitumor activity, safety, and feasibility of AZD1775 in combination with chemoradiotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were not eligible for radical surgery. Patients received AZD 1775 (200 mg) once daily by mouth for 21 consecutive days combined with standard chemoradiotherapy three weeks prior to surgery. Patients were followed up for three months after surgery. A total of 71 patients were enrolled between September 2019 and June 2021, and they were randomly divided into two groups: one was a chemoradiotherapy treatment group, and the other was a chemoradiotherapy plus AZD 1775 treatment group. The chemoradiotherapy group received a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, and the chemoradiotherapy plus AZD 1775 treatment group received a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions combined with AZD 1775. All 71 patients underwent surgery. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of patients who did not undergo surgery after chemoradiotherapy. However, there was a difference between them in the number of cases who were found to be pathologically unfit after surgery. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 chemoradiotherapy-related toxicity was 40.8% in the chemoradiotherapy treatment group and 71.4% in combination group.

Background: 
Fibromyalgia (FM) as a central cause of chronic pain, is a disabling disease. Current evidence-based psychosocial treatment for FM has been shown to reduce general pain intensity, symptoms of depression, and fatigue levels, and improves quality of life. These treatments require a multi-component (group /individual cognitive behavioral treatment ) approach, the application of which is often difficult and can lead to poor adherence through long-term treatment of patients in stationary settings. However, with the advent of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), e-health based interventions have become an established and alternative form of treatment.
Our trial ""e-Coach for patients with fibromyalgia- a randomized controlled study"" aims to study the effectiveness of an e-health based intervention for fibromyalgia compared to conventional treatment. In addition, this study will provide a basis for future routine use of electronic health services (eHealth) and further research on e-health based interventions in general. The overall goal of the study is to evaluate the potential of this electronic, internet-based, and mobile-based treatment program in a large sample of patients with FM, compared to the currently established conventional treatment.

559,"Detailed Description
-----------------
CONTEXT (background): Breathing disorders are frequent in COVID-19. A study of patients with non-hospitalised COVID-19 shows that half of the participants had a moderate to severe impairment of respiratory mechanics, particularly functional residual capacity. The respiratory mechanics, in particular the functional residual capacity, are defined by pulmonary air content when the patient inhales and the patient exhales at the end of normal expiration. This volume, normally in 3l, is important for a person at rest and during physical effort. It helps maintain stable oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood during breathing. The respiratory mechanics are strongly altered in some patients during the acute phase of the disease but persist after discharge, regardless of the duration of oxygen therapy. This persistent disruption of respiratory mechanics makes people more vulnerable and limits the activity they can perform. It's a major risk factor of post-COVID syndrome and is responsible for chronic functional deterioration. The cardiac coherence technique is based on a specific physiological phenomenon known as Pulse Coupling and the Breathing Heart Rate technique. This technique is based on physiological responses between heart rate variability and breathing. It has been proposed as a possible therapeutic strategy for patients with post-COVID syndrome and dyspnea. In particular, an observational study suggests a favorable impact of CC, associated with a breathing training, on dyspnea and cardio-respiratory function in patients with post-COVID syndrome with moderate to severe functional dysfunction. There is very little scientific evidence on the effectiveness of cardiac coherence on long COVID symptoms. The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of cardiac coherence and a complementary respiratory training in the management of Long COVID. RESEARCH QUESTION(S): What is the impact of cardiac coherence and a complementary respiratory training in the management of long COVID symptoms? HYPOTHESIS(S): 1- CC and a complementary respiratory training will impact positively on the management/improvement of Long COVID symptoms. 2- CC and a complementary respiratory training will have a cumulative effect on the management/improvement of Long COVID symptoms. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The main objective of our study is to assess the effectiveness of cardiac coherence and a complementary respiratory training in the management of long COVID symptoms, measured using the Long Covid Score. Secondary objectives : -Assess the impact of cardiac coherence on the improvement of long covid symptoms and identify the symptoms that improve the most / worst after cardiac coherence and the duration of this improvement. - Assess the evolution of the different parameters constituting the symptomatology of long covid over the course of 6 months. - Assess the duration of the benefits of cardiac coherence. - Identify the different types of symptoms and define the main domains according to the ST and the ICOVID-19 criteria. - Assess the impact of cardiac coherence on quality of life, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorders. - Assess the impact of cardiac coherence and a complementary respiratory training on the impact of long covid on daily life.

560,"This study aims to establish the rate of patients developing clinically significant atrial fibrillation (AF) while receiving ibrutinib therapy and factors contributing to the onset of this adverse event.

Background
-----------------
Anti-CD20 and targeted therapies such as ibrutinib (anti-B-cell lymphoma-2, BCL-2), venetoclax (anti-BCL-2), and obinutuzumab (anti-CD20) have been used frequently in patients with haematological diseases (Habibeh Sadiq, Dana Far­sh Hooshmand, and Suman Majumder. Effect of ibrutinib on the cardiac conduction system: a systematic review and meta-analysis102315-19. J Med Biol 2019;27:53310.2303/jmb.2756). Consequently, we have seen an increase in cardiac complications. The presence of cardiovascular disease, including AF, is considered a contraindication to the initiation of venetoclax and ibrutinib therapy (Chamoto et al. Clinical practice guidelines for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: 2017 update by the American Society of Haematology. Blood. 2017 Oct 4;130(18):1948-72). The occurrence of cardiovascular adverse events is estimated between 8 and 30% during treatment with ibrutinib (Kantar et al. Cardiovascular safety of ibrutinib therapy. Cardiovasc Drugs Javadi-Nia, Elaine T, et al. Cardiovasc Drugs Ther. 2017;32(5):392-412). 
Different types of cardiovascular event can occur, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic and non-ischemic cardiac events (Habibeh Sadiq, Dana Far­sh Hooshmand, and Suman Majumder. Effect of ibrutinib on the cardiac conduction system: a systematic review and meta-analysis102315-19. J Med Biol 2019;27:53310.2303/jmb.2756). Among these cardiac events, AF is the most common occurring adverse event (Habibeh Sadiq, Dana Far­sh Hooshmand, and Suman Majumder. Effect of ibrutinib on the cardiac conduction system: a systematic review and meta-analysis102315-19. J Med Biol 2019;27:53310.2303/jmb.2756). This adverse event develops in 0.58% to 9.1% of patients during treatment with ibrutinib (Dahlan et al. Management of AF during treatment with ibrutinib: a cardio-oncology perspective1-7. T. Dahlan, G. N. Mills, T. C. Dhanani, B. J. W. Hussain, K. Chan, S. Y. Chang, and L. Fitchett. BMC Cancer 2019;19(1):883.10.1186/s1288-019-5758-6). Its incidence depends on whether the patient is already known to have AF or is a newly diagnosed case. New research has suggested that some patients may also suffer from subclinical AF (Gallagher et al. Incidence of atrial fibrillation after start of ibrutinib therapy. S. J. Gallagher, C. Carroll, J. McCall, J. H. Breslin, S. C. O'Loughlin, M. P. Murphy, and M. A. Foley. Am J Hematol 2016;91(12):1250-2.10.1002/ajh.24994).

563,"40 patients with moderate risk in gastric ulcer risk assessment indicators are randomly assigned to 2 groups of 20 and will take DAPT for at least 6 months from the time of registration. There are no additional treatments for the test group, but in the control group, the investigators will supplement non-administrative antacids and H2 blockers if necessary. The primary endpoint of this interim analysis is the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in both groups. If you can prove that the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the test group is not significantly different from patients with mild gastrointestinal bleeding risk when taking a DAPT, it becomes a good reason to think about discontinuing prophylactic acid reflux therapy. In addition, we assume that the incidence of ischemic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke is not significantly different from patients with mild gastrointestinal bleeding risk when taking a DAPT."
564,"Background: Prospective memory is an executive function that allows remembering to do something at a later time (e.g., remembering to mail a package). It is a common complaint in HIV-infected (HIV+) subjects and a frequent source of anxiety in their everyday life. Cognitive and non-cognitive therapies have been designed to improve prospective memory performance. Despite these interventions, it appears that in HIV+ the issue is not solved. We believe that the use of cognitive batteries (prospective memory, cold and hot cognition) to detect cognitive and affective impairments and possibly correlate them with dysfunctional prospective memory performance could be useful to further our knowledge on the functioning of the affected cognitive domains. Our main goal is to study the correlation between prospective memory dysfunction and different cognitive functions in HIV+ subjects. Secondary objectives are 1) to compare the prospective memory performance between HIV+ and healthy controls; 2) to compare the prospective memory performance between subjects on antiretroviral therapy and not on treatment. The proposed study will offer a prospective design to evaluate the hypothesis of differences in prospective memory performance between HIV+ and healthy subjects and between HIV+ with and without ARVs respectively and an exploratory design to correlate the cognitive dysfunctions to an impaired capability of executing prospective memory tasks. Methods: The study will include a sample of about 132 participants; 66 HIV+ subjects, 66 healthy controls and 66 subjects who abandoned antiretroviral treatment because of intolerance to drugs (this group will be recruited from the Center for AIDS and STD research). For each group the subjects will undergo a neuropsychological evaluation. During the session the patient will be administered the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST; Raskin et al., 2010) with the purpose of investigating prospective memory ability. Then during the same meeting the following tests will be offered to the patient: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA; Nasreddine. Translation Pirani et al 2006) investigating global cognitive performance; - Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1980;1983- Italian version edited by Bonino et al, 1998) with the purpose of assessing cognitive and affective empathy (Hot cognition); Modified Five Point Test (Ruffi et al 1987) aimed at assessing figurative fluency (Cold cognition).

Many patients use conservative treatments for relief, but these therapies are short-term and ineffective in most cases. Traction is a key intervention by physical therapists that involves pain relieving modalities, stretching, muscle conditioning, etc. The aim of the study is to determine effects of vertical sitting versus supine lying traction on pain, range of motion, and function in patients with radicular low back pain."
566,"Lateral Troubles on the Hip represent one of the most common injuries in the lower limbs of adults and older individuals with symptoms ranging from pain to severe functional limitations. It has been reported that more than 70% of subjects with Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS), have no diagnosis and therefore no adequate treatment is available. It is considered that the GTPS pain can come from different sources (hip joint, bursitis or tendinopathy), which makes the etiology of pain quite complex and the treatment of pain is often unsatisfactory. The physiotherapy treatment has been recommended by all health agencies for both short and long term treatment of the syndrome of greater trochanteric pain. However, there is no clear and definitive answer on the most effective interventions to resolve this problem. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of two different treatment methods for this population of individuals suffering from the GTPS.

567,"Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that has a prevalence of around 0.5%-1% in the general population. CD is characterized by intestinal inflammation triggered by a gluten-containing diet. CD can be diagnosed by the detection of serological markers followed by histopathological examination of the small intestine. For the diagnosis of CD, a small bowel biopsy is recommended; however, this is invasive and not widely implemented in primary care practice. Serology-based screening followed by intestinal biopsy if appropriate is usually recommended. CD-related antibodies include anti-transglutaminase (TG) antibodies which are usually detected on a blood sample. The EMA (enolase monoaminoxidase) assay is a novel immunological technique to detect these antibodies. The method has been shown to be sensitive, specific, and rapid enabling a near real-time diagnosis of CD in a laboratory setting. In this study we will use a rapid test (Mercodia GmbH, Uppsala) for the detection of TG2 antibodies to investigate whether this may be useful in a clinical (primary care) setting. The aim of this study is to investigate whether these rapid tests are able to identify patients with CD. We propose a nested cohort study with a retrospective arm and we will incorporate several key points and measures, including standard serology and histopathology results, to better understand whether the rapid tests can be used in a primary care setting."

571,"Introduction : 

Respiratory failure is a common complication in ICUs with a significant mortality.  The most used therapy in these patients is endotracheal intubation ,which associated with several complications . Non- Invasive ventilation (NIV) has been used in a recent study in patients with chronic obstructive respiratory failure where it reduced the intubation rate . The role of NIV in other chronic and acute respiratory failure has not been established . High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) was introduced to ICUs with the idea of providing positive airway pressure (PAP) and warming and humidifying the inspired air without the need for endotracheal intubation . It was demonstrated that HFNC compared to standard oxygen therapy in patients with acute respiratory failure was associated with an improved oxygenation and reduced need for endotracheal intubation and was the first choice therapy for such patients . 
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of HFNC compared to NIV which represents a new ventilatory approach in patients with respiratory failure with hypercapnia

Duobrii is commercially available currently and has been deemed a valuable and innovative product with clinical benefits for reducing mild to severe psoriasis. There is a high unmet need in treating scalp psoriasis. Over 80% of individuals with psoriasis will have scalp involvement at some point in their lives. In one of the largest studies of scalp psoriasis, 60% of psoriasis patients had mild to moderate scalp involvement with an additional 20% presenting with severe scalp psoriasis. Only 3% of patients self diagnose their scalp psoriasis whereas 65% of psoriasis patients will seek dermatologist help for scalp involvement. Although topical treatments are often the first form of treatment, most patients will seek topical treatment for less than 3 weeks. This could be attributed to side effects related to the topical medications prescribed. Side effects such as irritation, skin atrophy and burning may be related to the use of corticosteroids. It is reported that only 50% of patients are satisfied with their current topical treatment. There is an unmet need for safer scalp psoriasis therapies.<br> |"

577,"Avascular Necrosis in Lunate (Kienbock's disease). Ulnar Madonna lesion in lunate bone which leads to wrist pain and loss of range of motion and strength of grip .

The aim of this study is comparing two procedures of shortening the distal ulna to achieve pain relief and wrist mobility.

Dorsal approach is less invasive and leads to milder bone defect than the volar approach. However, results achieved are controversial after follow up of at least one year.
So by this procedure, dorsal radial approach, the volar ligament and the tendons of extensor carpi ulnaris and abductor pollicis longus will be spared. The extensor pollicis longus will not be interrupted, which would lead to an extension lag of the thumb interphalangeal joint and, in the case of the distal row of intercarpal ligaments, dorsal scutum-like changes resulting from pressure atrophy  at the dorsal-ulnar aspect. The flexor pollicis longus and extensor carpi radials will be detached submuscularly and only mobilized to the lateral aspect of the wrist along with the radial nerve, while during the second procedure they would have been released in the midline of the flexor retinaculum and might be at risk for secondary adhesion formation. Also the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus will be transposed into the dorsal-radial compartment of the wrist during the second procedure.
When the volar wrist approach is taken, i.e. Henry approach, for volar cortical fixation, either a small dorsal incision and plate fixation or an interosseous approach may be taken. However, the interosseous approach may lead to a flexion lag of the wrist with an extension lag of the fingers, which would not happen with distal radial fixation.The volar wrist approach will be preferred due to the availability of longer and more rigid plates and screws (AO/ASIF system).

Secondary Objectives

Secondly , this study aims to compare between the two procedures in terms of grip strength, range of motion of wrist and radiological evolution.

578,"- Prehab is a program used to prepare a patient for an upcoming surgery by helping the patient to reduce the physical, nutritional and psychological stress that accompanies surgical procedure through the improvement of functional capacity, reduction of comorbidities and inflammatory conditions and attenuation of anxiety symptoms. 
- The prehospitalation program is usually composed of interventions like nutritional supplementation for malnourished patients, physical exercise training and anxiety reduction techniques. It helps patients to be better prepared before surgery and may reduce the likelihood of complications (post-op infections, heart and respiratory complications) and may improve quality of life and length of stay after the surgical intervention. In patients with pancreatic cancer (localized pancreatic cancer and periampullary cancer with indication to surgery) prehaptation may reduce postoperative morbidity, which in turn may improve survival. Our research group recently conducted a feasibility study on prehabilitation for localized pancreatic cancer patients (NCT04989557) and found that patients with pancreatic cancer are willing to participate to a prehabilitation intervention and can be safely included in a larger study. Moreover, we identified different risk groups that usually do not respond as well to surgery as low risk patients and might represent future targets for early intervention programs like prehab. At present, there is a lack of data concerning the usefulness of prehab in this specific population. 
- The overall goal of the study is to investigate the effect of prehabilitation on pancreatic cancer patients. 
- Objectives of this study: to assess the impact of personalized multimodal prehabilitation on functional capacity, body composition, inflammatory status, anxiety level, postoperative complications, length of stay and on quality of life before and after curative surgery for pancreatic cancer patients or periampullary cancer patients. 
- Number of participants included: 226 (113 in each group) 
- Type of research: interventional randomized controlled trial, single center 
- Duration of research: 5 years 
- Objectives: to compare functional capacity, body composition, inflammatory status, anxiety level, postoperative complications, length of stay and quality of life before and after curative surgery in a population of pancreatic cancer patients or periampullary cancer patients. 
- Impact on patient care: Patients enrolled in the study will be monitored during 90 days after surgery by an experienced surgeon. After completion of the surgical procedure, prehap or prehab control groups will be followed-up through scheduled outpatient visits and phone calls from a nurse navigator. Standardized treatment guidelines will be followed to ensure a good surgical outcome."
579,"• Background / Justification: Children with cerebral palsy (CP) often experience balance and mobility problems. Currently available rehabilitation programs focus on strengthening and posture control. Dual task-based training allows a combination of multiple daily movements and activities. Dual task training is usually used for older people. However, it can improve body coordination. Studies have shown that it can improve gait, flexibility, mobility and balance in older adults with neurological disorders (i. e. Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and chronic stroke). Therefore, using dual task training in children with CP can be a good choice for children to improve their functionality. Previous studies aimed at determining the effects of dual task training on motor performance and balance in people with CP. The current study will investigate the effect of dual task training on balance, walking, gait performance, strength and the quality of life in children with CP.
• Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dual-task training on balance, walking, gait performance, strength and the quality of life in children aged between 5-12 years old with hemiplegic, monoplegic, unilaterally affected or diplegic symptoms of cerebral palsy. Therefore, we hypothesize that the inclusion of additional cognitive tasks into an exercise program with tasks that require simultaneous balance and strength will result in greater motor gains than simple execution of balance and strength tasks.
• Objective of the Study / Hypothesis / Research Questions: We hypothesize that the inclusion of additional cognitive tasks into an exercise program with tasks that require simultaneous balance and strength will result in greater motor gains than simple execution of balance and strength tasks.
• Study Design: The current study will investigate the effect of dual-task training on balance, gait performance, strength, and quality of life in children aged between 5-12 years old with hemiplegic, monoplegic, unilaterally affected or diplegic symptoms of cerebral palsy.
• Methodology / Statistical Analysis: We will administer the dual-task exercise intervention to 24 children with CP (12 children per group). The treatment will consist of 12 weeks of both the conventional rehabilitation program and dual-task exercise program for five days a week in groups of three children.
• Study Interventions / Treatment: In order to achieve the aim of this study, we have designed a dual-task exercise training program that includes cognitive and dynamic tasks to be performed in combination to improve the performance of motor tasks. 
• Sample Size / Sample Characteristics / Recruitment: The recruitment period will be 12 months. The inclusion criteria are as follows: 
• Primary Purpose: Treatment
• Main Study Parameters / Endpoints: Balance, Mobility, Physical Performance and Quality of Life - The primary outcome measures of this study will be the Balance Scale, the Backward Walk Test, the 10-Meter Walk Test, the One Leg Stance Test, the Timed Up and Go Test and the Child Health and Quality of Life (CHQ-PF50) questionnaire. These outcome measures will be measured before and 12 weeks after the interventions.

581,"A two phase randomized control trial of a novel exercise intervention in hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was performed. Following a run-in phase of a standard walking program, an 8 week exercise intervention comprising a progressive home-based walking program and physiotherapy-led supervised sessions, was compared with usual hospital based exercise therapy. We hypothesized that patients randomized to this novel exercise intervention will demonstrate improvements in functional exercise capacity (Incremental Shuttle Walk test) from baseline at 8 weeks compared with participants randomized to usual care. 

This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) performed as a proof-of-concept investigation. Eligible patients were recruited from a lung assessment unit of a university hospital, an acute admission unit, or a respiratory rehabilitation unit. After a screening visit, baseline tests were conducted in the hospital, between days 2 and 4 of admission. Patients provided written, informed consent to participate in the study and randomization occurred after this. A trial investigator created a computer-generated random allocation sequence and concealed allocation from investigators, physiotherapists and patients. Patients were assigned to intervention or control and allocated treatment following this randomization. This was conducted by the principle investigator, and patients were aware of their group allocation. Patients were treated as outpatients either in their homes or in their hospital wards/rooms for the duration of the 8 week intervention. The patients in the intervention group received progressive home-based walking programs from the study respiratory physiotherapist each week for 8 weeks; those in the control group received additional hospital based physiotherapy in addition to their standard outpatient therapy programs. All standard hospital based treatments were recorded and included in the analysis. The patients in the intervention group performed a home based exercise program that started at 5min/day, with a weekly increase in walking duration of 5min until the patient achieved a target of 30-min/day, of walking as fast as possible.

All patients undertook an initial assessment in a specialist respiratory physiotherapy clinic during hospital admission. The 6-min walk test (6MWT) was used to assess functional capacity. Patients familiarized themselves with the walk test route (a corridor running the width of the hospital with the ends marked) prior to baseline testing. At the start of the test they were instructed to walk as far as possible along the corridor in six minutes. Distance covered was measured to the nearest 0.5 meter and measured by two assessors. The same respiratory physiotherapist, blinded to group allocation, performed most (90%) follow up assessments.

The Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) was used to assess peak maximal exercise capacity. The patients arrived at the cardiac exercise laboratory following their morning medication and wearing loose clothing (shorts and t-shirt) and trainers; no walking aids were allowed. Heart rate and rate of perceived exertion was recorded every minute. The walking speed was increased by 0.5 km/h every minute during the test. Patients were required to hold their breath during testing, and walked, with their hands on their hip, on a smooth surface under the verbal supervision of a tester. Walking was discontinued when the patient could no longer maintain a good rhythm at the given speed or when they reached breathlessness.

The primary outcome for this study was the ISWT performed at study baseline and at day 7 of admission. Secondary outcomes included 6MWT, lung function testing and health related quality of life scores (SF-36® & SGRQ) at baseline and 8-week post discharge. All tests were conducted in the lung assessment unit or hospital ward and were performed by a respiratory physiotherapist who had undergone training (lectures, quizzes & practice using standardized clinical cases) for the tests performed during this study. A tester familiar to the patient undertook most (90%) follow-up tests.

| Change in Balance | The Y balance test is used for balance assessment. A Y shaped design is made using three tape measures placed on the ground. After the first tape measure is placed in the anterior (ant) direction, the other two tape measures are placed on the ground in the posteromedial (pm) and posterolateral (pl) directions to form a 135-degree angle. How the test will be performed is clearly explained to the individuals before the test and they are allowed to perform three trials. With the hands on the waist, the fingertip reach in each of the three directions is recorded in centimeters (cm). The maximum distance they can reach in three reaches in each direction is recorded. This process is also repeated while standing on the other limb and recorded. Lower limb length is calculated by measuring the distance between the spina iliaca anterior superior and the medial malleolus with a tape measure. With the results obtained, the normalized reach and the composite reach for both limbs are calculated. | Change from Baseline Y Balance Test Results at 6 weeks. |

583,"Background 
Cancer is a common disease in the Western world and treatment is often a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic agent cytostatic is mainly administered via venous access, such as intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (IA) peripheral venous catheters. Cancer patients, who undergo intravenous chemotherapy, more often than other patients require peripheral venous catheters because of poor vein status, which often is caused by the disease process or previous treatment (e.g., mastectomy). 
The insertion of venous catheters can be painful. The pain may prevent the intravenous administration of cytostatic, which can lead to insufficient therapy, or make it difficult for the patient to undergo intravenous therapy, which may delay therapy further. As pain is a subjective experience, there are no generally valid measurements for determining pain levels. The most commonly used subjective measurements are visual or numerical scales. The NRS (numeric rating scale) is one of the most common measurements, which the patients mark to indicate the severity of their pain. A scale is marked with whole numbers ranging from 0-10, where 0 indicates zero pain, and 10 means the worst possible pain. Patients who experience pain during insertion or use of venous catheters can receive pain relief in the form of local anesthesia cream or patient-controlled analgesia with opioids. Some studies have shown a tendency to improve the number of painful insertions or the need to stop the insertion of painful or non-functioning intravenous catheters, if local anesthetic cream is applied or if the patient has received patient-controlled opioid analgesia. 
Despite these interventions, many patients are experiencing pain during venous catheterization and, thus, several studies have tried to increase venous vessels and minimize pain by doing a venous training program. Different methods are used. One of them is to train the hand muscles used to manipulate the skin (pump and grip) and the veins (flexion and extension) in order to strengthen the veins and increase the number of veins that are available for use. The purpose of this study is i) to investigate if training of the armsy reduces pain when inserting a peripheral venous catheter, and ii) to investigate how it is experienced that there can be challenges with the vein status for patients in cytostatic treatment? 
If this intervention is proven to reduce the level of pain and increase the number of useable veins, an arm training intervention will be implemented at the DROPP-IN clinic, Vejle Hospital. The intervention will be part of the clinical routine for patients who undergo neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy via IV 

The project is a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). The total sample size will be 60 patients. Data will be collected at baseline, after 5 weeks and after 8 weeks of training or not. The primary endpoint will be pain reported by the patients; the secondary endpoint will be the number of venous vessels available at the insertion site (measured via ultrasound). The training group will train daily with an individualized arm training program for 8 weeks. A hand grip dynamometry will be used to measure muscle strength at all three data collection points. 
Patient groups 
To find 60 patients eligible to participate, the local clinical department at Vejle Hospital will be contacted, and the inclusion criteria will be communicated to the staff in the department, so that any eligible patients who are likely to participate in the study will be informed about the study. The number of patients needed in the study population to test the project hypothesis is calculated based on a mean pain score change of 1.7 between the control and the training group. In a previous study, the difference between the two groups was 1.8, so the minimum sample size for 80% power in a two-sample t-test was 23 per group (SD = 2.56; alpha = .05). 
The inclusion criterion will be based on medical records. Each patient who meets the criteria will be invited to participate in the trial. Inclusion criteria: 

• Planned neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy via intravenous peripheral venous cannula placed under ultrasound guidance. 

• The patient has provided written and orally informed consent.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) helps people with respiratory diseases to manage their health by providing education and exercise training and has been shown to reduce hospital admissions. PR is recommended for all people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a new NICE COPD guideline states that PR should be delivered using a combination of face-to-face and remote services (known as hybrid PR). However, NICE guidance, in common with the majority of NICE guidelines, draws on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to generate evidence. NICE guidance recommends PR should be provided on an outpatient basis, however, this creates a significant operational challenge for health service providers as most clinicians are based in acute care hospitals and spend the majority of their NHS resources providing care for acute conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has created the necessary urgency to find new and innovative ways to generate evidence to support adoption of new care models. This feasibility study will generate evidence to support a larger trial to compare effectiveness of a Hybrid PR vs Standard PR delivery model on patient uptake, adherence and outcomes, and service capacity. The aim of the larger trial is to provide definitive evidence to inform clinical guidelines for PR delivery."

590,"3/4 of patients with psoriasis experience psoriasis at the genital region or on the scalp. Although there is established treatment for people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis throughout the body, only limited options are available for those with genital or scalp psoriasis. ABBV will investigate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab for the treatment of adult subjects with moderate to severe genital psoriasis or moderate to severe scalp psoriasis. Participants will be randomized (by chance) into receiving either risankizumab or placebo once every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, followed by an additional 4 weeks off treatment.

Background: 3/4 of patients with psoriasis experience psoriasis at the genital region or on the scalp. Psoriasis affecting the scalp and/or genitals can cause significant discomfort and social stigma. Scalp psoriasis affects about one-third of psoriasis patients globally (excluding Chinese populations). Despite there being established treatment for people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis throughout the body, only limited options are available for those with genital or scalp psoriasis. Additionally, treatment is challenging due to psoriasis being characterized by an immune-mediated process with numerous cytokines responsible for the disease. Risankizumab, a potential new treatment for psoriasis, is a monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes IL-23, and has demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety results in other psoriatic conditions (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult and adolescent populations).1,2 Thus risankizumab may be a suitable treatment agent for psoriasis affecting the genital areas and scalp.

593,"Cognitive control allows a person to adapt their behavior to changing demands. It is important for activities such as writing, typing, or cooking, where people must constantly be vigilant and adjust their behavior. The goal of the study is to determine whether people with Parkinson's disease (PD) can learn to better control automatic movements, such as typing (for example, with their finger on a keyboard) or pressing a button when this is required. Previous research has shown that people with PD have difficulties switching between automatic and controlled actions. In this study, participants with PD will practice different typing tasks and the effect of this training on their ability to control hand movements will be assessed. In order to determine whether the training is also possible at home, participants will be equipped with a motion sensor on their hand and trained on a keyboard-like device at home. The effect of the training will be tested before and after the training period and up to four weeks later, to determine if the effect of the training is permanent (a form of long-term memory). Overall, the results will improve our understanding of neurorehabilitation strategies and will contribute to the development of more effective rehabilitation programs.

596,"Background and Significance
-----------------

Persistent symptoms after COVID-19 have been observed in 13-55% of individuals and have become known as long COVID and post-acute COVID-19. At least 50% of patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 experience long-term symptoms, with symptoms predominantly affecting cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. Symptoms that usually last for 3-6 months can be considered long COVID and those that last for more than 6 months can be considered post-acute COVID-19. Symptoms affecting the brain and nervous system that persist beyond 4-8 weeks after COVID-19 infection are being increasingly recognized and are now being referred to as neurological complications of COVID. Neurological complications include, but are not limited to, fatigue, headaches, cognitive impairment, and depression, among others. The prevalence of fatigue is one of the most common presenting symptoms in long COVID and is seen in 22-56% of patients. This symptom has a marked effect on patients' quality of life, leading to a high burden of the condition. Several randomized clinical trials have recently been conducted, but evidence is still needed to determine the optimal treatment for long COVID. At present, the available management strategies in long COVID are largely directed to the management of individual symptoms for which no specific treatment has been identified.

 Osteopathy, a form of manual therapy, treats patients as a whole based on the principles of osteopathic medicine. The diagnosis and treatment are based on a holistic, structural, and functional approach. The treatment focuses on improving mobility, muscle tone, and function of the tissues, organs, and systems of the body using various passive and active treatment techniques. Based on the individual needs of patients, the treatment may include soft-tissue stretching, muscle energy techniques, high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) manipulations, and other treatment techniques. A pilot study that investigated the effectiveness of osteopathic treatment in patients with long COVID showed that these patients had significant improvements in their symptoms after receiving osteopathic treatments. Another pilot study that investigated the effectiveness of a whole-body manipulative treatment approach in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome showed that osteopathic treatment resulted in significant improvements in the patient's clinical and symptomatic outcomes. A systematic review study that assessed the effectiveness of osteopathic treatments on chronic fatigue syndrome showed that patients who received osteopathic treatment had significant improvements in quality of life, cognitive function, and physical health.

 The pilot study on the effectiveness of osteopathic treatment in patients with long COVID also showed that the treatment can improve a patient's ability to function and perform activities of daily living. This suggests that patients with post-acute COVID-19 could benefit from osteopathic treatment due to the fact that they also experience a range of symptoms that affect their ability to function and complete activities of daily living. If the pilot study results are confirmed and if osteopathic treatment is found to be effective in the management of symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19, it could help to improve the quality of life and overall health of these patients.


Aim
-----------------
The purpose of the study is to find out the most practical and effective method for delivering osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to patients with persistent symptoms after COVID-19, and whether OMT could help improve the quality of life and overall health of these patients. Our results will help healthcare professionals to better understand the effects of OMT on patients with long COVID and the implications of OMT on the overall health of these patients. It could also help healthcare professionals to better understand the relationship between the quality of life and the overall health of these patients.

The secondary aim of the study is to determine whether osteopathic treatment can improve the symptoms of patients with long COVID and whether it can improve the quality of life and overall health of these patients. If osteopathic treatment is found to be effective in the management of symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19, it could help to improve the quality of life and overall health of these patients. Our results could contribute to the development of new clinical guidelines for the management of symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19.

The primary objective of the study is to determine whether OMT can improve the quality of life and overall health of patients with long COVID. To meet this objective, we will collect data on patient symptoms, and we will use validated questionnaires to measure changes in the patient's quality of life and overall health. We will compare the outcomes of the patients who receive OMT to those of the patients who do not.

597,"Hennepin Frostbite Score has been established as an accurate and reproducible objective assessment tool when applied to a patient's extremity. HFBS has been developed through retrospective analysis of serial angiographic and ICG angiographic studies in 496 patients enrolled over 19 years. This is the reference image score against which the study images will be compared to assess the concordance of the two imaging techniques. 

The images below show examples of the different HFBS scores. The left side shows a 1 on the right side a 3 on the left side images show a 0 on the right side a 2 on the left side images show a 4 on the right side images show a 5 on the left side

Prior experience in assessing concordance between different imaging modalities in patients with limb ischemia suggest:
(1) A 0-4 score.
(2) A 0-5 score in the lower extremity.
(3) Lower extremity scores are higher than upper extremity scores.
(4) ICG scores are 1 stage lower than conventional angiography scores.

Hypothesis One
-----------------
H1: These two imaging modalities (ICG(indocyanine green) and conventional angiography) will be concordant at demonstrating the ischemic tissue present in severe frostbite.

The following table provides support for our hypothesis that ICG scores will be lower than the conventional angiography scores in a 1:1 correlation.

| Conventional Angiography Score | ICG Angiography Score |
| --- | --- |
| 0 - No ischemia present | 0 - No ischemia present |
| 1 - Ischemia present and there is more than 50% flow to the tissue. | 1- Ischemia present and there is more than 50% flow to the tissue. |

598,"SURGERY 
In France, 50,000 colorectal cancer operations are performed each year, with an exponential increase in the incidence of colorectal cancers among the population over 70 years old. Surgery has evolved considerably, and mortality after surgery is now below 2%. However, the functional consequences of colorectal cancer operations can be considerable, as well as complications. The functional impact is all the more important in the elderly because they are already frail and often have other comorbidities. The geriatric unit is a medical structure that groups together experts to improve the quality of treatment and therefore limit the risk of complications. Therefore, by integrating a perioperative geriatric intervention, the investigators want to improve the patient's functional state and reduce the risk of complications and iatrogenia. The investigators will also observe the distribution of postoperative complications, with a possible reduction in the need for intensive care and early reanimation, as well as in the length of stay (LOS), the readmission rate, and the recourse to other medical services.  
There will be two groups : Group A : patient operated on but without geriatric intervention. Group B : patient operated on and beneficiary of the geriatric intervention in Peri-Operative Geriatrics Unit. The interventional group will benefit from improved nutritional status (from grade 4 to grade 3) as part of the preoperative period and will be hospitalized earlier to benefit from a period of artificial nutrition (total parenteral nutrition or intravenous nutrition). An adapted rehabilitation program will be provided in the 10-15 days prior to surgery, as well as daily nursing care during the two-week preoperative period. Furthermore, the patient will be assessed daily during the postoperative period in order to optimize early mobilization. Finally, a discharge report, a home visit by a caregiver or a support mission (rehabilitation, nursing), will be provided after discharge to optimize the patient's return to the community.   The hypothesis behind this intervention is that the care provided by the Peri-Operative Geriatrics Unit will reduce the risk of postoperative functional decline. The outcome measures include the functional state, morbidity, readmission rate, and mortality rate."

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory disease in the young and is of particular concern in the neonatal population since there is little or no cross plasma antibody protection or maternally acquired RSV-specific antibody. The respiratory illness caused by RSV in infants is associated with substantial morbidity and up to 50% of hospitalized children need oxygen supplementation. A licensed monoclonal antibody (mAb palivizumab) has been available as a prophylactic drug since 2006, to protect premature children from serious RSV disease. Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly (IM) every 4 weeks from birth until 24 months of age or until the infant develops an immune response, and is indicated for high-risk infants (defined as infant born at gestational age <37 weeks and/or infants with chronic lung disease) born in the RSV season for the prevention of RSV hospitalizations. 6 years from the first palivizumab administration, an approved maternal immunization (RSVPreF3), which prevents newborns from acquiring the infection via mother’s breast-milk, is needed in the mother’s antenatal period to protect infants born during RSV season, as it has been shown that antibodies induced by RSV vaccine in mothers can be efficiently transferred to unborn infants, conferring a sustained protection up to 2 years of age. A follow-up study of RSVPreF3 vaccines (RSVPreF3 Groups) is needed to evaluate the safety of infant participants who had been conceived, followed up during gestation, and born pre or post RSVPreF3 vaccination or control."

603,"25 mg of Aspirin per day is a primary method for preventing cardiovascular disease. However, the consumption of 100 mg and 325 mg, which are higher than the recommended amount, has also shown significant benefits in lowering cardiovascular disease. Thus, it is thought that 100 milligrams of aspirin, which is more easily tolerated, may have benefits in individuals with increased cardiovascular risk. A retrospective register study conducted on the individuals of AARP in 2015 showed that 100 mg aspirin can also benefit cardiac patients. Our study, which is planned to last 4 days, is aimed at detecting the changes in the lipid profile and determining the safety of low-dose aspirin during ACCORDING CORONARY DISEASE A 100 MG ASPIRIN THERAPY TRIAL FOR HEART HEALTH IN COVID-19 pandemic.
-----------------
BACKGROUND: Aspirin is a primary method for preventing cardiovascular disease. Although the recommended dose for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is 75 to 100 mg per day, many studies showing significant benefits of aspirin have been published using high doses of aspirin. In a large number of trials, the benefits of aspirin therapy were greater for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, since there is no clear recommendation or evidence about the effect of a 100 mg dose of aspirin on the cardiovascular system, many patients prefer it because it causes fewer side effects and gastrointestinal side effects. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and effect of low-dose aspirin on patients with increased cardiovascular risk and to evaluate the safety of low-dose aspirin given during the treatment of coronary heart disease. STUDY PROTOCOL: This study is a prospective intervention study. The sample size was calculated as 42 (21 per group) patients with coronary heart disease receiving daily low-dose aspirin therapy (100 mg) for 4 weeks, considering a 30% power, a 10% drop-out, and equal variances, using the G*Power V. 3.1.9.6 program. STUDY OUTCOMES: The primary outcome; To evaluate the changes in lipid profile caused by the use of low-dose aspirin therapy (100 mg) for four weeks in all patients. The secondary outcome; To evaluate the level of oxidative stress in patients with coronary heart disease receiving low-dose aspirin therapy (100 mg) for four weeks, the frequency, duration, and severity of gastrointestinal side effects experienced by patients with coronary heart disease. The study included 52 patients with a mean age of 60.9 years (standard deviation 9,5 years) of whom 82.7% were male. The mean levels of LDL, LDL/HDL, VLDL/HDL, TG before the 4-week study were 138.2, 3.83, 6.94, 83.98 mg / dL; after the 4-week study, it was 128.4, 3.48, 6.5, 65.2 mg / dL. In addition, it has been shown that oxidative stress levels caused by the therapy have not shown statistically significant changes (p = 0.191). According to the findings, low-dose aspirin therapy (100mg) is safe, well tolerated, and does not cause significant changes in lipid profile parameters. Patients with increased cardiovascular risk are candidates for the use of low-dose aspirin therapy, which has a beneficial effect on heart health in accordance with the results obtained in large clinical studies.

604,1. Left bundle branch area pacing- Heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was associated with high morbidity and mortality. The evidence suggest that HFmrEF and HFrEF patients are underrecognised in clinical practice and the survival of HFmrEF patients is worst among HF patients. Current guidelines do not propose any definitive therapy for this group of patients. Left bundle branch area pacing is an emerging therapy for HF patients but its safety and efficacy are not clear specially in HFmrEF and HFrEF patients. It is important to investigate the safety and efficacy of this treatment particularly for these two groups of patients.

607,"This is a cross-over study to quantify and spatially register dysfunction in airway conducting zones via dynamic 19F MRI with inhaled imaging gas and 19F-tuned MRI in people with cystic fibrosis (cf). In adults over 18 years of age, we will enroll people with CF as identified by genetic diagnosis and cystic fibrosis-related pulmonary exacerbation. We will measure VDP and the volume of tissue with abnormally short time constant (FLVlongtau2) using dynamic 19F MRI at baseline, at the end of 28 days of treatment with hypertonic saline (HS) breathing, and at the end of 14 days off of HS breathing. We will repeat this cycle 5 times over 14 months. 
Participants will receive inhaled perfluoropropane gas via a standard Douglas bag for MRI. We will measure the ventilation defect parameter (VDP) and assess the contribution of the conducting and gas-exchanging zones to this parameter. Perfluoropropane enhances tissue contrast resulting in improved identification of ventilation defects, specifically in zones of airway obstruction and airway dilation. We will measure dynamic gas transport constants (transport constants) and lung volumes with HS breathing. We will compare this to the measurements at the end of 14 days off of HS breathing.
Baseline Visit (Day 1) and Endpoint Visit (Day 14) will be measured during HS breathing. Two more visits (Days 29 and 43) will be 28 days of HS breathing followed by 14 days off of HS breathing. The remaining 2 visits (Day 365 and Day 389) will be 7 consecutive days of HS breathing followed by 7 consecutive days off HS breathing. Dynamic 19F MRI images and 19F-tuned MRI images will be collected twice during breath hold and 4 times during tidal breathing during each of the 5 visits to obtain measurements of VDP and FLVlongtau2. Images will be interpreted by a panel of readers who are blinded to clinical data. 
This study is designed to demonstrate that VDP and FLVlongtau2 obtained using dynamic 19F MRI can be used to quantify and spatially register functional airway abnormalities in people with cf.

Input Text: A Multi-Center Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Autologous Cord Blood-Derived Mononuclear Cells in Chinese Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
In the past 10 years, with the advancement of cell biology, cell immunology and the understanding of cell transplantation, a number of cell therapeutics have emerged. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) of human origin and mesenchymal stem cells of animal origin have been used for the treatment of IPF patients. Recently, it was found that the incidence of adverse events (AEs) such as acute rejection (AR) after MSC transplantation were up to 30%, and the 2-year survival rate of recipients was lower than the 2-year survival rate of IPF patients in the untreated control group, and even the AE was related to the death of the patient. In the early treatment stage of severe IPF patients, autologous bone marrow stem cells (CBSCs) and autologous cord blood-derived MSCs have been tested in patients with IPF. It is found that the adverse events of bone marrow stem cells and cord blood stem cells will be much lower than that of allogeneic MSC. A number of clinical studies at home and abroad indicate that bone marrow stem cells and cord blood stem cells have good therapeutic effects with long-term and stable therapeutic effects and low recurrence rate, and have good safety for clinical treatment. The results of single-center study indicate that after treatment with autologous bone marrow stem cells combined with lung surfactant, the pulmonary function of patients with IPF was significantly improved, which indicated that lung tissue regeneration was promoted. The preliminary effect of the combined use of autologous cord blood MSCs and lung surfactant on IPF patients was demonstrated in this study.

Detailed Description
-----------------
A total of 36 IPF patients were selected for this study and were equally and randomly divided into experimental group and control group by random number table method. The experimental and control groups were treated with autologous CB-MSC and the pulmonary surfactant emulsified with the pulmonary surfactant solution respectively. The patient's condition was observed every month, and the patient's lung function was evaluated by using Pulmonary Function Test to calculate forced vital capacity (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1%), the level and pattern of lung function damage were compared within 6 months after treatment. The therapeutic effect was judged according to the International Pulmonary Fibrosis Therapy Efficiency Standard.

611,"1-Year, Pragmatic, Randomized Multicenter Controlled Trial, Involving 450 Adults (18-65 Years Old) Suffering from a Characterized Depressive Episode After Hospitalization in a Medicine or Surgery Unit.

Objective: In France, the current model for care for patients with clinically significant depressive symptoms is hospital-based. In this context, the monitoring of patients discharged from hospital remains a challenge. The primary goal of research in the field of depression care is to identify patients who are at high risk of clinical deterioration and suicide and to ensure the continuity of care between the acute hospitalization and the outpatient setting. The main risk factors identified to date are the severity of initial depression, the presence of a significant suicide risk, the comorbidity, the lack of an adapted psychotherapeutic care, and the disabling of social and occupational performances. The use of new technologies (NICT) tools in the field of mental health also appears as an innovation of care. A telemedicine intervention, aimed at improving patient care according to the national recommendations for the secondary prevention of depression (French Network for Depression, REFED, 2017), could increase the continuity of care after hospital discharge. It could also reduce the workload of psychiatrists dedicated to depression care in the hospital setting and be a vector for the standardization of depression care and treatment. REMEDE: Improvement of Secondary Prevention for people suffering from a depressive episode after hospitalization would test the effectiveness of a telemedicine follow-up (consisting of three structured multidisciplinary interventions) compared to usual care in a sample of 450 adult patients (> 18 years old and < 65 years old) with major depressive disorder, discharged from a medical or surgical ward and suffering from a clinically significant depressive episode. This project is a pragmatic, randomized prospective multicenter controlled trial. At 6 months of inclusion, the principal primary endpoint is whether patients included in the intervention group will demonstrate a significant decrease from baseline (including after hospitalization) in the severity of depression symptoms, measured by the clinician-rated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-DEP subscale). The sample size has been calculated by taking into account the following parameters: a total sample size of 450 people, equal allocation of patients between the usual care and the telemedicine care groups, a loss to follow-up of 30%, an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.10 and a statistical power of 80%. The planned study period is 12 months and includes an inclusion phase, a follow-up phase of 27 months, a period of data analysis and data compilation, and a final study period. The expected results should contribute to improve the quality of care in people depressed after hospitalization by adopting a systematic approach to improving the secondary prevention of depression.

612,"1) The objectives of this study are to establish if quantitative MRI can improve the accuracy of prediction of sarcoma compared to visual inspection alone as a potential clinical tool to use to make a decision of whether an operable soft tissue mass is malignant or not. The primary hypothesis is that quantitative diffusion coefficient, apparent diffusion coefficient and T2 relaxation times can provide additional information regarding the malignant potential of a lesion than visual interpretation alone at standard, clinical, signal resolutions. This hypothesis will be tested in two separate populations using machine learning algorithms. 2) There will be a secondary, exploratory aim to use machine learning methods to attempt to predict the histological grade of malignancy for lesions which are proven to be malignant using clinical samples only. Secondary Hypothesis is that quantitative parameters acquired from MRI will contribute additional information that can be used to improve the accuracy of prediction of histological grade of sarcoma. 3) In order to evaluate the reproducibility of these machine learning methods, a subset of patients will be asked to undergo MR imaging prior to surgery. 4) There will be an additional exploratory aim to determine if quantitative MR parameters correlate with biomedical imaging features obtained from pathology specimens. Exploratory Hypothesis is that the quantitative MR features are associated with the histomorphological architecture of sarcomas. This will be tested using machine learning algorithms in an independent cohort of patients undergoing surgery for sarcoma.

613,"Thin gingival phenotypes are very friable and prone to recede in response to traumatic insults, such as plaque-related inflammation and traumatic toothbrushing. Microneedling can be successfully used as a minimally invasive strategy for increasing gingival thickness. The role of hyaluronic acid in enhancing clinical outcomes by improving the keratinized tissue width is not evaluated by any study using split-mouth design. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effects of the combination of microneedle and hyaluronic acid vs microneedling alone on increasing gingival thickness and keratinized tissue thickness in thin gingival phenotype.

619,"Hypothesis: The incorporation of specific treatment rules into a system for decision support in health and using it in a collaborative way with clinical pharmacists and health professionals in general, will reduce the number of adverse drug events (ADEs) leading to acute renal failure or hyperkalemia in hospitalized older patients.
Study design: Prospective, multicentre, controlled, single-blind, randomized cluster study with stepped-wedge permutations.
Study type: Intervention study, Health Services research
Objectives: Primary objective: To reduce the adverse drug reactions (ARF and/or hyperkalemia) in older hospitalized patients through this computerized decision support system. 
Secondary objectives: Secondary objectives: to describe the changes generated in the workflow in which the CDSS is implemented; to estimate the value of the pharmaceutical intervention in terms of financial resources; and evaluate its cost-effectiveness from different perspectives in order to guide decision making. 
Study duration: Study duration is 24 months.
Study population: We expect to include 5,000 older patients (Age > 65 years) hospitalized during the study period.
Study centers: Three sites are planned: the Hospital du Cantal, the Hospital University Center of Angers, and the University Hospital of Limoges.
Study procedures: This project is designed in 10 steps, each with its own specific duration, following this stepwise schedule:
Step1: Validation of the DETECT-IP software, which will allow us to identify in real time potential drug-related adverse events that may cause acute renal failure or hyperkalemia.
Step 2: Randomized, controlled, stepped-wedge cluster study.
Step 3: Pharmaceutical validation study: clinical validation of the software in collaboration with clinical pharmacists. The pharmaceutical validation is based on routine care, often on entry to a ward and by analyzing all the alerts produced by the CDSS. Some alerts will require pharmaceutical intervention. 
Step 4: Feedback step: the analysis of the workflow and how the CDSS is used in routine practice, and in particular the acceptability and satisfaction of the professionals involved in the care of the hospitalized patient. 
Step 5: Assessment of the economic impact: the method of costing used allows us to estimate the cost-effective of the pharmaceutical intervention in the detection of adverse drug reactions.
Step 6: Publication of scientific research articles based on the results obtained.
Step 7: Evaluation of the clinical impact of the CDSS in a real hospital setting, as well as the analysis of the feedback obtained and whether any adaptations are needed in the organization of work.
Step 8: Proof of Concept: this is the implementation of the DETECT-IP system in other hospitals after its successful validation in the reference center. It will involve the deployment of the DETECT-IP platform in at least 5 other hospitals.
Step 9: Dissemination of research findings obtained throughout the project. 
Step 10: Implementation of the DETECT-IP solution in other hospitals after its validation in the reference center. 
Study interventions: As a preventive tool, the DETECT-IP system is an IT solution in which clinical validation rules are developed using existing scientific knowledge and updated continuously. During the implementation, our objectives will be to develop specific therapeutic rules (alerts) in order to prevent and reduce the occurrence of adverse drug reactions caused by drugs that can be prescribed in a hospital setting, with particular attention to drugs that can cause acute renal failure or hyperkalemia in older hospitalized patients. 
Health care provider perspective: The intervention is based on clinical validation rules to be established through a consensus approach among clinical pharmacists and clinicians working in emergency departments, medical wards, and geriatric units. The pharmacological intervention may be considered as a collaborative exercise between the clinical pharmacist and the ward's medical team. The main objective is to implement these alerts and to optimize their pharmaceutical validation as much as possible to limit the number of false positives and false negatives. 
Patient involvement: In the initial phase, a patient representative will be invited to participate in the formulation of the research protocol. From a clinical perspective, as our previous studies have shown [1-3], the impact of adverse drug events on patients is very important both in terms of their clinical significance and their economic impact. The DETECT-IP project will be of great interest to patients because it aims to prevent or reduce the number of adverse drug reactions, in particular those that can lead to acute"
620,"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. It starts in adolescence (mean age 30 years) and is most prevalent before the age of 40, so a third of those affected are under 40. It is currently estimated that there are about 80,000 people in France living with CD. CD is a relapsing and remitting disease with a variable severity. Approximately one-third of patients will require intestinal resection during their lives. Nevertheless, only 25% of these will benefit from a lasting cure of their disease. For the remaining, the risk of recurrence increases in the first two years after resection, with two-thirds of patients experiencing a disease recurrence within this period. These recurrences can occur in the same parts of the intestine even in the case of perfect healing of the resection line. This disease recurrence is all the more difficult to manage since it is associated with a loss of quality of life for the patient, a significant increase in hospitalization and cost of care, and an increase in the risk of short bowel syndrome and its complications. This early post-surgical occurrence of disease recurrence is poorly explained at the clinic and biomorphological level. Nevertheless, surgical treatment is a therapeutic option that allows to limit the evolution of CD and improve the quality of life of patients. To date, the optimal therapeutic option in the event of intestinal resection has not been defined. In this study, the investigators aim to determine the bacterial profiles in mesenteric fat (organ of the patient that undergoes surgical resection during intestinal resection), in the ileum and in blood during surgery of CD patients, in order to identify a signature of bacteria associated with early post-surgical recurrence of intestinal CD. 
Aim and objectives: To identify mesenteric fat bacterial signatures and their relationship with blood bacterial signatures associated with early post-surgical disease recurrence in patients with intestinal Crohn's disease. The investigators hope that the study will allow to refine and better characterize the bacterial alterations associated with intestinal Crohn's disease in order to have a more precise description of the bacteria involved in the onset of the disease and thus better understand the physiopathology of  the disease.

623,"In this study it is investigated if lowering the initial dosage of an oral anticancer drug reduces side effects of treatment, when compared to the standard dosage. The researchers think that starting with a lower dosage and only slowly increasing it (step-up) can increase the quality of anti-cancer treatment in elderly patients and it might also allow for the continuation of the treatment long-term. This, in turn, might provide more benefit from the anti-cancer treatment.

How is the study designed"
627,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of L-thyroxine plus the standard antidepressant treatment of patients with major depression disorder that is refractory to the standard treatment alone in a randomized, placebo-controlled manner. 
PROTOCOL: Patients will receive a 4-week antidepressant drug treatment followed by a 4-week combination treatment (L-thyroxine and either paroxetine or mirtazepine) before switching to the active treatment group for an additional 4 weeks or receiving placebo on top of the standard antidepressant treatment for an additional 8 weeks.
BACKGROUND: Thyrotropin (TSH) levels decrease during untreated major depression disorder. An elevated cortisol awakening response (CAR) has also been observed in patients with depression. The presence of depression can be associated with inappropriately high thyroxine T4. The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether L-thyroxine has a beneficial effect on patients experiencing major depression disorder that is not well responsive to standard antidepressant therapy.

PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Exclusion criteria consist of having had ECT, vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) and electroacupuncture in the past. Must not have received psychotherapy within the last 3 months. Concurrent psychotherapy will be allowed if the patient stays with the same psychotherapist during treatment with the investigational product and as long as the treatment plan remains unchanged. Patients currently taking antipsychotic or antimanic medication must stop before being included in the trial. Use of medication for anxiety disorders or for obsessive compulsive disorder is permitted before, during, and after being included in the trial. Patients must not be taking any drug that is not indicated in the treatment of major depression disorder.

Specific aim: To compare the acute and chronic hypertrophy effects of low-intensity (50 to 70% 1 repetition maximum) normobaric intermittent hypoxic resistance training protocol (LIRT) in normobaric hypoxia (NH) with a low-intensity resistance training combined with blood flow restriction protocol (LIRT+BFR) or a conventional high-intensity resistance training protocol (HIRT) in normoxic conditions (NO) to improve muscle strength and hypertrophic responses; 2. Hypothesis: The HIRT protocol will be more effective and cause higher anaerobic responses compared to the LIRT and LIRT+BFR protocols, as the low intensity approach may induce a smaller anaerobic response, therefore limiting the hypertrophic effect. The training effects will be more pronounced in normoxic conditions than in normobaric hypoxic conditions considering the lower oxygen levels at altitude, and the additional anaerobic activity required to sustain exercise at high altitudes.

631,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Australia and globally. Hypercholesterolaemia is a key CVD risk factor. Statins have been shown to both prevent initial CVD events and reduce CVD risk in those with established CVD by up to 80% . Despite this evidence, suboptimal lipid management is seen worldwide, and over 50% of adults with ASCVD are not at their LDL-C target . While statin and ezetimibe adherence are comparable between those who initiated therapy from 2008-2019 and those from 1998-1999, the proportion of patients achieving a low LDL-C target has worsened and only increased slightly from 36.3% in 1998-1999 to 45.9% in 2008-2019 . Moreover, many patients in the United States who achieve their LDL-C target still show residual cardiovascular risk .
The efficacy of monoclonal antibodies targeting PCSK9 for LDL-C lowering has been demonstrated consistently in Phase III clinical trials. Inclisiran has been developed to increase the frequency of LDL-C lowering to every 6 months. Inclisiran has been shown to be safe and effective for lowering LDL-C and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in two high cardiovascular risk Phase III clinical trials, ORION-10 and ORION-4. These trials showed that in high-risk, stable patients with ASCVD on optimised statin therapy, inclisiran significantly reduced LDL-C by up to 47.8% compared to placebo, on top of background therapy, and did not result in new-onset diabetic mellitus (DM), new-onset or worsening of chronic kidney disease, neurological disorders, or infections . Inclisiran was also shown to reduce the rate of cardiovascular death and non-fatal myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke .
The proposed study is designed as a novel intervention trial with the objective to evaluate the effectiveness of a Primary Care (GP) model of care implementation strategy which could improve the outcomes for patients with ASCVD or ASCVD-equivalents who have suboptimal LDL-C levels on statins and/or ezetimibe. This study is also aiming to evaluate the effect of nurse-led support calls on the secondary prevention, including medication adherence."

  Background
-----------------
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is defined as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, lip and oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. In 2018, there were an estimated 820,878 new cancer cases worldwide. HNSCC is one of the 10 most common malignancies. HNSCC represents 3% of all malignancies and the 8th most common cancer worldwide. About 600,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with HNSCC every year. HNSCC is the 9th most common cause of cancer death, responsible for 350,000 or more deaths annually. As a result, HNSCC is a global public health problem.


According to a report published by the American Joint Committee on Cancer, there were about 747,000 new cases of adenocarcinoma within the US population in 2022. The same report estimates about 167,000 deaths from this form of cancer in the same timeframe.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is classified according to morphologic features. This includes several histologic subtypes: serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, and undifferentiated. Serous carcinomas represent about 60% of all cases, while endometrioid histology is observed in 5%. Clear cell and transitional histology each constitute approximately 2% of all cases of EOC. Undifferentiated tumors occur in 2% to 3% of cases and mixed tumors are seen in 3% to 5% of cases. Less common but biologically very active malignant tumors with different phenotypes include malignant Brenner tumors and small cell carcinomas. There are also several rare histologic subtypes that have been described such as signet cell-like carcinoma. The vast majority of advanced EOCs are primary peritoneal carcinomas and fallopian tube carcinomas that arise from the surface epithelium of the peritoneal cavity, ovaries, or fallopian tubes. About half of all EOC cases are found in stages 3 or 4 when they have spread widely in the abdomen and pelvis.

  Rationale
-----------------
There is a clear medical need for new and effective therapies for HNSCC. Current standard options include surgical resection and/or radiotherapy for early-stage disease, and platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced-stage disease. Overall, the prognosis of patients with advanced HNSCC is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 40% or less.


Targeting HER2 overexpressed in some tumors offers a potentially efficacious and convenient therapeutic option. The expression of HER2 on HNSCC cell lines was recently described.

Ovarian cancer remains a significant public health problem worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, over two-thirds of women with newly diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian cancer will recur within 5 years. Current standard options include surgical resection and/or radiotherapy for early-stage disease, and combinations of taxanes, platinum-based chemotherapy, bevacizumab and poly (ADP-ribose) dNucleus glycohydrolase (PARP) inhibitors for advanced-stage disease.
While current treatment options represent an effective way to temporarily control the disease, recurrence is very common. There is a clear medical need for new and effective therapies for"

636,"Objective: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) interventions demonstrate efficacy for weight loss. Recent reports indicate that ACT-based interventions hold promise as a way to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors, and that engaging in valued life activities may be more effective than goal weight for promoting weight loss. In addition, ACT-based interventions are relatively brief in duration, which makes them particularly appropriate for delivering via online media. The primary aim of this study is to examine whether an in-person or online ACT workshop improves the quality and consistency of lifestyle behaviors that are associated with healthy body composition and weight management. 

Design: This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) and will be overseen by a Diversity Advisory Board. The trial will be performed on an outpatient basis. Subjects will be randomized to one of two arms (intervention or waitlist control). There will be no blinding to this aspect of the design. Participants in the Intervention arm will attend an 11 session, in-person ACT workshop within 14 days of baseline. Subjects assigned to the Control arm will receive the workshop after the completion of baseline assessments and other data collection activities, at the investigators' discretion (up to 6 months). Subjects will receive brief reminders that they are enrolled in the study every 3 months until the workshop is offered. The workshop will be available to Control arm participants once all subjects in the Intervention arm have completed the workshop. All workshops will be led by one of three trained facilitators who will be supervised by the principal investigator (PI). All facilitators have their own ACT workshops for which they are not using study materials (i.e., no overlap). Control arm subjects are expected to have access to an optional online version of the workshop, which is not being used in this trial, once all subjects in the Intervention arm have attended the workshop.

Study population: Seventy eligible participants will be recruited for the study and 6 to 10 participants will be recruited each month through flyers posted at community churches, social media, and university mailing lists. We will attempt to recruit as many women as possible during the study period. Women aged 40 to 70 years will be recruited.

Outcome measures: Self-report data will be collected at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1 using validated, psychometrically sound, web-based surveys or surveys administered via phone. We will use the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to measure baseline and follow-up physical activity. We will assess physical activity and sleep duration at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1. Dietary intake will be assessed at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1 using the Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants-Short Form. Subjects will be weighed to the nearest 0.1 kg at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1. To confirm that the workshop is promoting lifestyle behaviors associated with healthy weight management, we will collect pre- and post-workshop data on physical activity, dietary intake, and body weight. We will measure psychological inflexibility and psychological flexibility at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1 using the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II) and the Acceptance and Action Self Scale, respectively. We will measure avoidance and approach behaviors at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1 using the Eating for Physical Reasons and Physical Activity Intensity Scale, respectively. We will measure valued living at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1 using the Valued Living Questionnaire. 
Results and interpretation: We will examine the feasibility and efficacy of the online and in-person ACT workshops. We will examine the treatment effect (online and in-person versions combined) of the workshops in relation to changes in physical activity, dietary intake, avoidance and approach eating behaviors, and the quality of valued life at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1.

Exploratory Analysis: Weight stigma will be assessed via self-report. Weight self-stigma will be measured at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1 using the Weight Self-Stigma Scale. We predict that both groups will show a decline in weight self-stigma beginning at baseline and increasing over time. Body image will be measured at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1 using the Body Shape Questionnaire. We predict that the study groups will show a decline in negative body image. Data from this trial will be used to power a pilot RCT testing the efficacy of an online ACT workshop. We will use data from the present trial to power a future pilot RCT comparing the online ACT workshop to a waitlist control group. Secondary outcomes"
637,"The study will recruit 200 eligible participants (80 patients cohort from Jiangsu, 80 patients cohort from Shanghai, and 40 patients cohort from other parts of China).

638,"3T MRI with ultra-low contrast, high resolution imaging is the most sensitive modality for identifying occult, clinically significant lesions of the spine in children. The incidence of spinal cord injuries in pediatric population is higher than adults. The incidence of acute spinal cord injury is 2 - 3 per million population per year, with the majority of injuries occurring in cervical and cervicothoracic regions. High-resolution, ultra-low contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in evaluating spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. The most accurate approach to identify the fracture site is by using ultra-high-resolution MRI. Conventional MRI sequences have limitation due to poor image quality caused by the presence of an implant. Due to a lack of sufficient magnetic labeling, conventional MRI may not be sensitive enough for identifying the fracture site. In addition to increased soft tissue contrast, high image quality, and increased signal-to-noise ratio are achieved with a combination of ultra-low contrast acquisition and shortened repetition time. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ultra-low contrast MRI scan of the spine in children. We propose to evaluate pre- and post-traumatic spinal stability of patients following surgical intervention for traumatic spine fractures. The study will include a prospective, randomized, controlled trial (n=30) at the Center for Pediatric Spine and Scoliosis Surgery. The primary objective of the study is to determine the clinical benefit of post-traumatic spinal stabilization evaluation with 3T MRI using ultra-low contrast imaging, compared to conventional imaging methods. The secondary objectives of the study are to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of 3T ultra-low contrast MRI in evaluating spinal stability, spondylolisthesis, and paraspinal muscle injury on children who have suffered from spinal fracture or injury.

639,"Low levels of physical activity (PA) among youth remain a significant public health problem, with most U.S. children falling short on the recommended 60 minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Research shows that this gap disproportionately affects population subgroups, particularly children who are female, overweight/obese, or from low socioeconomic areas. Interventions are needed that can equitably increase children's PA. To address this gap, there has been a focus in the U.S. and abroad on increasing children's physical literacy (PL), which can be defined as the ability, confidence, and motivation to be physically active for life. While PL-focused interventions hold promise in concept, there is little empirical evidence of effectiveness and differential effects by subgroups are not understood. Thus, the overall objective is to increase children's PA through a multilevel, comprehensive PL-focused program that will reach children both at school and at home. The overarching hypothesis is that the PL-focused program will have positive effects on elementary schoolchildren's PL and, in turn, PA. Aims include testing the multilevel Rising New York Road Runners (RNYRR) program using a 2-arm, group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with n=400 3rd-5th grade students from low-income schools receiving either the multilevel RNYRR program (n=4) or delayed-intervention control (n=4). Aim 3: To evaluate the impact of the RNYRR program on children's physical literacy (PL) and physical activity (PA) (total daily volume and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA)) over one school year. Hypothesis: Children who attend schools with the RNYRR programming will increase PL and PA (total daily volume and MVPA) relative to children in control schools. Aim 3a: To examine whether RNYRR program effects on children's PL and PA differ by sex or weight status. Aim 3b: To test whether changes in PL and PL subdomains (e.g. ability, confidence, motivation) mediate changes in daily total PA volume or MVPA.

642,"RATIONALE: Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH), regardless of etiology, are notoriously susceptible to the adverse effects accompanying surgical treatment and hospitalization. Perioperative hemodynamic instability during heart surgery in patients with PH results in high rates of severe postoperative complications, including prolonged mechanical ventilation, systemic complications, and death. Therefore, there is a critical need for drugs that might prevent postoperative hypotension, systemic vascular congestion, and end-organ dysfunction in patients with PH. Vasopressin levels increase during heart surgery. Vasopressin is a hormone that induces vasoconstriction by stimulating V1 type receptors and stimulates V2 type receptors to retain water and electrolytes, thereby increasing the vascular and perivascular tissues and reducing ventricular load. Vasopressin has several important effects which may lead to a better outcome of patients with pulmonary hypertension undergoing heart surgery. Vasopressin binding to V1 receptors on smooth muscle cells in coronary arteries induces vasoconstriction that improves myocardial perfusion. Vasopressin promotes contraction of smooth muscle cells in renal arteries, which improves renal blood flow and filtration. Aortic Vasopressin binding to the V1 receptors inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to reduce vascular congestion. The ability of vasopressin to maintain the structural and functional integrity of endothelial cells helps to strengthen endothelial function and prevent complications during cardiac surgery in patients with pulmonary hypertension. At present, most of the research studies on Vasopressin are focused on its ability to reduce bleeding in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether Vasopressin can reduce the incidence of postoperative complications for patients with pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery."

646,"40% of Veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq meet criteria for trauma-related stressor disorders (TSRD) including PTSD and have limited access to evidence-based trauma treatment due to the current shortage of mental health providers and long delays in seeking psychiatric care. A safe, easy to use, and cost-effective approach to improving symptoms is urgently needed yet currently lacking. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate whether an emerging evidence-based treatment for TSRD and stress-related sleep disorders, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), given in conjunction with integrative, trauma-focused treatments can improve quality of life and mental health. In this single group, open label, Phase II/III feasibility study, the investigators will address issues related to safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment using electroencephalogram (EEG)-enhanced transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-eTMS) coupled with integrative and trauma-centered therapies for TSRD. The primary objectives of the study are to determine if this novel procedure is safe in Veteran populations with TSRD, as measured by the frequency of device-related serious adverse events (SAD); and whether it is feasible, as measured by the percentage of participants who complete ≥80% of the scheduled eTMS sessions. The secondary objective of the study is to explore the potential efficacy of the procedure to improve health-related quality of life in Veterans with TSRD as measured by the Veterans RAND 36-item health survey (VR-36).

650,"Over the past 20 years, an enormous amount of new drugs have become commercially available to the rheumatologist to treat their patients with Psoriatic Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis or other RMD. Yet, many patients still do not respond to treatment or develop treatment resistance. Furthermore, not all of the new drugs have shown superiority when compared head-to-head in Randomized Control Trials (RCT), which limits the choice for the treating physician. For these reasons, it is essential to better understand the underlying pathobiology of these conditions in order to identify biomarkers that might predict treatment failure, treatment adverse events and drug-induced tolerance.
Ultrasound is a reliable and valid imaging modality that is able to reliably assess inflammation of the joints in Psoriatic Arthritis or Rheumatoid Arthritis. Furthermore, the ultrasound examination is very informative for characterization of inflammation in the joints. With this information, it could be possible to predict disease remission or flares, joint structural damage and patient prognosis. In addition, a recent study has revealed that ultrasound tissue characteristics can be used as prognostic biomarker for the development of Psoriatic Arthritis in patients with skin Psoriasis. This has shown that ultrasound tissue characteristics of the synovium is a highly dynamic early feature that might be used to predict the development of Psoriatic Arthritis in patients with skin Psoriasis at risk.
Despite advances in ultrasonography as an imaging technique for the study of immune-mediated musculoskeletal disorders, the understanding of the dynamic interplay between the complex immune response and the structural tissue changes that occur during the disease trajectory is still limited.
This project will provide novel insights into the disease pathophysiology both in Psoriatic Arthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis. If achieved, the research will yield novel insights into the role of inflammatory tissue components in rheumatic diseases and will contribute to the identification of promising biomarkers in the prediction of disease evolution and response to therapy.
This will be done by the following specific aims:

1- Determine the synovial microenvironment and its contribution to the local immune response in early disease, based on longitudinal analysis of joints in the early disease trajectory of individuals at risk for Psoriatic Arthritis and in patients with established arthritis.
2- Determine the molecular characteristics of the inflammatory response in the joints of patients at MDA and disease progression in non-responders.
3- Assess the molecular changes that occur during remission, associated TNF- and IL-17-blockade, and compare this in non-responders, partial responders, and responders.
4- Determine the molecular changes that occur in non-responders from c-DMARDs.
5- Identify and characterize key features in the synovial tissue that are highly predictive for the future development of Psoriatic Arthritis and/or Rheumatoid Arthritis.

For this purpose, we will collect synovial biopsies from the joints during inpatient ultrasound examinations in patients with established Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, or Psoriasis with arthralgia who are at high risk for developing Psoriatic Arthritis. In order to enable a more comprehensive analysis of the joint tissue and its cellular and molecular constituency, we will perform spatial transcriptomics and single cell-based RNA (CITE-seq) and protein technology (CITE-FACS) of the tissue specimens. By the integration and analysis of these different sources of information, we will gain new insights into the pathobiology of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis and their different subpopulations and its contribution to the clinical response to treatment. Furthermore, this project will yield new insights into molecular mechanisms that occur in the peripheral joints of patients with early disease and lead to specific changes in the tissue and immune cell compartments. These new insights will aid in the identification of molecular biomarkers that are able to predict future disease status and predict the clinical response to treatment. Based on the findings in this project we will also identify novel targets for future therapies for immune-mediated musculoskeletal disorders.

651,"Little is known about the long-term effects of radioactive iodine therapy on the eyes and lacrimal drainage system. The purpose of our study is to determine the rate of NLDO in patients who are undergoing radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer and to find a preventive treatment for this. 
We are conducting a prospective, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of artificial tears (methylcellulose) in the prevention of post-radioiodine therapy NLDO in patients with thyroid cancer. This study is being conducted at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PMCC), a tertiary care cancer centre in Ontario, Canada. 
Participants are being recruited in advance of their scheduled out-patient radioactive iodine therapy. After informed consent is obtained, they are randomized using a simple randomization, 1:1, to either a control arm (no active intervention), or an experimental arm (recommendation for self-administration of artificial tears post-radioiodine therapy in PMCC). 
Follow-up occurs within 4 weeks after patient's discharge. A follow-up call is made to assess if the participant developed any symptoms of NLDO (e.g.: dryness, eye irritation, excessive tearing) in the days/weeks after radioactive iodine therapy. If the participant experienced symptoms of NLDO or is due to visit an ophthalmologist after having his/her symptoms assessed by the primary physician, then the patient is promptly scheduled for a lacrimal irrigation and the investigator reviews the findings. This is considered the primary outcome of the study and has been recorded on electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). A secondary outcome measures the time to improvement of obstructive NLD (defined as a lack of reflux of fluorescein during lacrimal irrigation after treatment with antibiotics) following the intervention. 

The rate of NLDO with and without use of artificial tears after radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid cancer will be compared by using chi-square test. Patients will not be blinded to the type of therapy they are enrolled in."

653,"➢➢ Research question(s): How does a multi-component behavior change intervention impact care for pregnant patients that develop severe hypertension? The ACHIEVE study builds on the previous work performed by the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Safety (AIM) by the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Adapting the Severe HTN Bundle for community outpatient clinic settings. The ACHIEVE study team, in collaboration with three Piedmont Health Services (PHS) clinics, developed a model of care that can be implemented across outpatient prenatal care settings. The goal of this study is to test the impact of three implementation strategies (training, coaching, and facilitation) in 20 prenatal care clinics that serve primarily low-income Black and Hispanic/Latino populations in central North Carolina. Usual clinic care for severe hypertension will be compared to the care provided after a practice has 12 months of implementation support from the ACHIEVE Nurse Coordinator. ACHIEVE partners include leaders and providers at each participating clinic, and members of the local community. ➢➢ Study hypothesis (s) The ACHIEVE implementation strategy will improve care for women in the active implementation arm of the clinical trial compared to the usual care arm. This means there will be an improvement in the following fidelity measures at the end of the active implementation period compared to the pre-implementation period: 1) blood pressure measurement technique of prenatal medical support personnel 2) documentation of delivery of pregnancy-related hypertension patient education 3) recognition and response to simulated episodes of severe hypertension 4) recognition and response to actual episodes of severe hypertension ➢➢ Rationale: Pregnant people with severe hypertension are at increased risk for maternal death, stroke, seizure, and other complications that can lead to lifelong health problems for both the birthing person and their baby. Unfortunately, this is a problem that disproportionately affects people of color and people living in rural/low-income areas. These factors are linked to a lack of access to high-quality prenatal care. Outpatient prenatal clinics can improve healthcare access and outcomes by providing routine, prenatal care to pregnant people in rural areas using a multi-disciplinary team approach.

This project builds upon existing work from the Research Triangle Institute showing that 1) older adults engage in scalable, technology-based, text-messaging interventions at high rates and 2) that behavioral science-based behavior change support in text messages can effectively prevent relapse in people using addictive substances. The proposed study has several strengths, including: (A) novel design to test the efficacy of gain and loss framed text messages for reducing hazardous drinking among older adults;  (B) engagement of a highly vulnerable population;  (C) increased understanding of the efficacy of the behavioral change approach across demographic subgroups (e.g., gender and ethnicity);  (D) high rates of engagement through the use of smartphones;  (E) use of an innovative research design (block randomization) to reduce bias; and (F) engagement of vulnerable adults (minority, rural, older adults) as participants.  The intervention will deliver brief, gain- and loss-framed, normative feedback using text messaging to promote the healthful behavior of safe drinking in older adults.  Brief and tailored (by gender) messaging will focus on personalized consequences of unsafe drinking, with one condition focusing on potential gains of reducing drinking to safer levels and the other condition focusing solely on losses associated with the lack of reduction.  Both conditions will have participants engage in two-factor autoregressive models to estimate the parameters of the intervention.  Data will be collected before the intervention starts (baseline), and after the participants complete eight weeks of the intervention (at week 4, week 8, and week 16).

This Phase 1/2a study will evaluate the safety and tolerance of [18F] Fluselenamyl in healthy participants and participants with mild cognitive impairment due to AD, and to evaluate the ability of [18F] Fluselenamyl to detect and quantify the brain amyloid protein burden. It will enroll healthy participants and participants with mild cognitive impairment due to amyloid beta deposition. Eligible participants will receive a single IV injection of [18F] Fluselenamyl, and they will undergo brain imaging and clinical evaluation at specified intervals in this study."
656,"Aphasia is a language disorder caused by localized brain injuries. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an umbrella term to describe a group of neurologic disorders characterized by specific clinical symptoms and typical neuropathologic results. A major pathologic finding is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles consisting of abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins. Approximately 50% of FTD cases with predominant oropharyngeal dysfunction are classified as primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Current therapies improve language functioning, daily-living activities and reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms in FTD and PPA. However, there is a lack of trials testing the effects of these therapies on the course of these dementias and the neurobiological mechanism remains uncertain. We hypothesize that theta burst stimulation (TBS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) leads to an increase in left prefrontal activity which is hypothesized to enhance language formation. We propose to enroll 100 PPA patients in a randomized sham-controlled trial. The patients will be evaluated at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months. The specific aim of the study is to test our hypothesis that left DLPFC TBS combined with language therapy leads to improvements in language functions and daily-living activities, reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms, and slowing of disease progression. We believe that this study may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of language loss in FTD and PPA, and it will have substantial societal impact on the way we care for these patients."
657,"70% of COVID-19 patients experience at least one persistent symptom even after a long recovery period (defined as longer than 12 weeks after symptom onset). This multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the effect of Methylprednisolone (an immunosuppressive corticosteroid) on persistent neurocognitive and fatigue-related impairments in patients with COVID-19 at six weeks of treatment with an additional 6-week wash-out period. The main objective is to evaluate the effect of Methylprednisolone compared with placebo on memory satisfaction, as measured by the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ). The secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of Methylprednisolone on other cognitive domains (MMQ total score, subdomains such as memory ability and strategy and SDMT). Other secondary outcomes include fatigue severity (FSS), quality of life (PROMIS) and safety assessments. This study is of high importance, as Methylprednisolone might be the first potential therapy for treating individuals suffering from PCS. The results of the study will also add significantly to our understanding of PCS and provide much needed guidance for the development of more effective and targeted therapies."

660,"Background
-----------------
The etiology of non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) lesions is multifactorial. Dietary acids and beverages with a low pH are the most important etiological factors , along with occlusal function, poor oral hygiene, erosion caused by oral medications, bruxism, etc.
With the increase in health awareness, an increased proportion of the population is concerned with the whiteness of their teeth . Tooth wear resulting from the erosion of the enamel surface leads to surface loss on the teeth, and consequently to sensitivity, aesthetic impact and functional impairment . The increased loss of tooth structure in patients with NCCLs could justify the use of restoration strategies .
The use of adhesive systems in dentistry has contributed to improved esthetics and preservation of tooth structure . Among the various types of acid etchants for enamel, hydrochloric acid (HCl) has been the most frequently used during the past decades, for reasons such as their ability to remove interfering organic and inorganic material, rapid demineralization of the enamel surface, good penetration of the fluid and inexpensive . However, HCl is extremely toxic, and handling it can lead to serious accidents .
Alcohol/water-based solvent universal adhesives are widely used as alternatives to HCl-based products. The most recent product of this class, Scotchbond Universal Plus (3M Oral Care), has been launched with an alcohol/water-based solvent and uses a low-viscosity primer containing 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) with hydroxylapatite (HA) particles. The product is based on 3M ESPE’s patented AuraSeal ALA/HA-based primer technology. This adhesive has good enamel and dentin infiltration, and has been shown to be superior to other types of adhesive systems.
Some authors have reported satisfactory or satisfactory-to-good retention rates when using this type of adhesive . Acetone-based solvent universal adhesives, such as Gluma Universal Bond (Kulzer), have also grown in popularity in the last decade, offering a safe alternative that avoids the use of toxic substances and has been reported in clinical trials to have good retention, marginal adaptation, and marginal staining for the restoration of NCCL.
The alcohol/water-based universal adhesive has a drying time of 40 to 50 seconds , while the acetone-based universal adhesive has a drying time of 5 to 10 seconds . The alcohol/water-based solvent acts more slowly due to the higher viscosity and does not allow a rapid increase in solvent vapor concentration in the atmosphere when compared to acetone-based solvents . It is possible that the rate of solvent evaporation may influence the composition and structure of the adhesive layer. However, the use of these universal adhesives is justified by the fact that they have greater compatibility with restorative materials, and do not require the step of applying a separate agent for enamel etching.  Therefore, there is no evidence that prolonging the evaporation time of universal adhesives reduces the quality of their adhesion and, therefore, the quality of the restoration. 

Objective
-----------------
To evaluate the effectiveness of longer flash-off times for universal adhesives in the management of NCCLs.

Hypothesis
-----------------
Prolonging the evaporation time of the universal adhesive flash-off does not influence the restoration quality.

Methods / Design
-----------------
This is a four-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Experimental group 1: Universal adhesive with solvent evaporation for 25 seconds. Experimental group 2: Universal adhesive with solvent evaporation for 25 seconds. Control group 1: Universal Adhesive with solvent evaporation for 5 seconds. Control group 2: Universal Adhesive with solvent evaporation for 5 seconds. Participants of experimental groups will have 25 seconds of solvent evaporation of their restorations and patients of the control groups, 5 seconds of solvent evaporation will be performed. 
The investigators will use an in vivo, randomized, double-blind, parallel-arms study. The randomization will be done on the day of application of adhesives based on four groups (experimental group 1: universal adhesive Scotchbond Universal Plus - 3M - with"

665,"BACKGROUND: 
Several studies have shown that spousal support and the encouragement the wife receives from her husband affect breastfeeding by positively influencing her self-esteem and determination. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of breastfeeding education given to fathers on the breastfeeding behavior of mothers and support for breastfeeding and to investigate the factors affecting the continuation of breastfeeding in the first 3 months. 
METHODS: 
It is planned to recruit first stage primigravid and primiparous pregnant women. After delivering the babies, breastfeeding education training will be given with information via Whatsapp application for 39 days to the fathers who are in the intervention group on the 3rd postpartum day, and their mothers. The same training will not be used for the mothers in the control group, but the mothers in the experimental group will be included in the research group at the end of the study by including the mothers in the control group who will continue their breastfeeding at the end of the 39th day.
The primary outcomes include the total breastfeeding score and total breastfeeding support scale score, while the secondary outcome includes the number of pregnant women who continue breastfeeding, the number of pregnancies who stop breastfeeding before the 3rd month, and the number of mothers who want to terminate breastfeeding but continue breastfeeding for the sake of the baby.
DATA ANALYSIS: 
Comparison in maternal and infant characteristics and breastfeeding scores among groups will be performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), post-hoc testing with Tukey (p<0.05) will be performed among three groups. Inferential statistics will be used to assess the differences between groups in terms of breastfeeding scores, and quantitative variables will be expressed as mean+/-SD, and the ratio will be compared between the groups using the chi-square test. 
CONCLUSIONS: 
The results of this study will contribute to the development of breastfeeding support interventions aimed at fathers in the context of Turkey, and it will provide additional information on the factors affecting the continuation of breastfeeding in the first 3 months.

This study is a retrospective review of medical record data of patient enrolled in the Lung Cancer Intergroup study CALGB9631. CALGB9631 investigated the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy for first line treatment of advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) but not in overall survival (OS). The study is now concluded with over 5 years of follow up on patients treated with the study regimen. Aims: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy±bevacizumab in the treatment of patients with stage IV lung cancer in this prospective randomized trial. 2. To correlate molecular profile of tumors in patients randomized onto CALGB9631. 3. To evaluate the overall and progression free survival of patients treated with cisplatin/pemetrexed±bevacizumab in the 1st line setting in this prospective randomized trial. 4. To compare the safety of bevacizumab with and without cisplatin/pemetrexed in the 1st line setting with attention paid to the timing of the bevacizumab, the dose of chemotherapy given and the presence or absence of treatment related adverse events (AE). 5. To compare the use of alternative bevacizumab schedules with cisplatin/pemetrexed in the 1st line setting. Hypothesis: The current study is designed to provide information on the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced stage (stage IV) NSCLC.

666,"Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the pattern of PIK3CA biomarker testing in patients (pts) diagnosed with advanced BC between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2020. To analyze the characteristics of pts who had their tumors tested for PIK3CA status, and to examine the timing of PIK3CA biomarker testing. Method: The AstraZeneca Safety Database was queried to create a population of pts with newly diagnosed advanced BC and who had PIK3CA biomarker testing results on file. 
Methods: 
PIK3CA mutation testing was performed on tumor samples collected from patients with advanced breast cancer enrolled in observational, noninterventional studies conducted by AstraZeneca, for whom PIK3CA testing was documented. 
Study design The investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of the AstraZeneca Safety Data base, a proprietary, prospectively maintained safety database of information from clinical studies worldwide conducted by AstraZeneca. 
Study inclusion and exclusion criteria In eligibility for abstraction, newly diagnosed advanced BC (stage III; stage IV) was defined as diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer. The diagnosis was based on histological or cytological examinations, regardless of hormone receptor status. Patients who met the following criteria were included for abstraction: Patients who were diagnosed with advanced BC between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2020 and evaluated for a PIK3CA mutation A single PIK3CA mutation was determined by an investigator from the clinical study protocol A PIK3CA mutation was reported in the patient's safety information, which includes clinical information and information available from a laboratory study (eg, a test provided a report stating that a patient has a PIK3CA mutation or similar test result) Patients may be alive or deceased at the time of data abstraction (January 1, 2020 to May 15, 2021). 
The following subpopulations and their corresponding inclusion and exclusion criteria were predefined based on clinical knowledge (eg, the PIK3CA mutant population is expected to have a greater degree of heterogeneity than other populations in terms of clinical course). 

| Subpopulation | Inclusion criteria | Exclusion criteria | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Patients with advanced BC and a known PIK3CA mutation | Patients in this cohort were required to have a mutation in the PIK3CA gene present in the tumor cells Patients in this cohort were required to have a primary diagnosis of breast cancer | Patients in this cohort were excluded if they were known to have not had a PIK3CA mutation test performed Patients in this cohort were excluded if they were known to have had previous oncological treatment or have another simultaneous active neoplastic disease | 
| Patients with advanced BC and a unknown PIK3CA mutation status | Patients in this cohort were required to have unknown PIK3CA mutation status (only those results that were not available due to test not yet being performed or because the test result had not been reported were included) Patients in this cohort were required to have a primary diagnosis of breast cancer | Patients in this cohort were excluded if they were known to have had previous oncological treatment or have another simultaneous active neoplastic disease | 
| Patients with advanced BC and no known testing | Patients in this cohort were required to have had no knowledge if they had been tested for a PIK3CA mutation Patients in this cohort were required to have a primary diagnosis of breast cancer | Patients in this cohort were excluded if they were known to have had previous oncological treatment or have another simultaneous active neoplastic disease | 

 Data analysis and statistical methods The investigators used descriptive statistics to summarize demographics and tumor characteristics of the patient population with advanced BC. Summary measures included frequency counts and percentages, medians, and ranges. 
The investigators used Kaplan-Meier methods to describe time-to-event outcomes, including time from advanced BC diagnosis to first PIK3CA evaluation, time from advanced BC diagnosis to first CDK4/6 inhibitor evaluation, time from initiation of first-line treatment for advanced BC to first PIK3CA evaluation, and time from progression on a CDK4/6 inhibitor to first PIK3CA evaluation, and presented estimates of cumulative incidence using Kaplan"

668,"This protocol has been drafted to provide an overarching protocol for a proposed series of small phase II clinical studies. In these studies, the trastuzumab and pertuzumab (t+p) treatment arm will be tested through a single arm, single institute, multicentre pilot study.
The purpose of this pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting an NCCR trial of t+p in patients with rare cancers identified by a single molecular alteration, specifically in this protocol HER2 amplification or activating mutations. The trial has built-in flexibility through the ability of the PI Medical Directors to approve the use of t+p in a disease sub-cohort or paediatric cohort where there is a specific clinical need in exceptional paediatric subjects who currently have no approved treatments. Where rare diseases are identified through the molecular testing programme for patients with rare cancers, other cancer-specific sub-cohorts and additional cancer types may be added to the protocol as necessary subject to approval by Sponsor and Trial Management Group (TMG) and review by the NCTN Ethics Committee.
The study consists of a screening, enrolment, and treatment period, followed by a follow-up period to assess the efficacy and safety of treating patients with specific rare cancers with t+p. This protocol provides for 3 years enrolment of patients who have a specific molecular alteration identified through molecular profiling at one or more of the NCRN Cancer Centres or one of their associated Cancer Units.

669,"Background: Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is a frequent late sequela after operated cleft palate. It is correlated to communication difficulties. The prevalence of this pathology in operated cleft palate varies between 15 and 90%. Previous anatomy studies did not confirm a consensus regarding palatal anatomy and VPI. The purpose of this study is to describe and compare the different types of VPI in terms of velopharyngeal motor skills using real time MRI by exploring differences in patterns of movement and in functional imaging. Methods: This is an observational etiological study that will include 40 patients, operated for Isolated velopalatine cleft, grouped in 2 subgroups (group A: 20 participants with a velopharyngeal malformations and VPI grade II; group B: 20 participants with a normal velopharynx and/or a normal velopharyngeal motor skill). Patients will be recruited before a speech and communication evaluation, routinely performed during the patient’s follow up evaluation at our center. All participants, aged 7 to 12 would have undergone a surgical procedure for the correction of the cleft palate. An MRI examination will be performed while the patient will perform a repetitive velopharyngeal closure task with different effort levels. Patients will be scanned in the supine position using ACHIEVA 3T TX DStream Philips® and a 33 channels head and neck coil. An elastic strap will be fixed to the forehead to limits movement during scan. Headset will be used to cancel the loud MRI noise and to communicate with the subjects. The pharyngeal anatomy will be described using multiplanar reconstruction (MPR). 3D reconstitutions will be produced. After the examination, different parameters of velopharyngeal motor skills will be studied: • Diameter of the upper oropharynx at rest and during phonation • The distance between the velar knee and the posterior pharyngeal wall at rest and during phonation • Closure distance during the phonation at maximal effort and at rest In addition, functional imaging will be explored via arterial spin labelling. Intraoperative pictures of the anatomy before the closure of the palate cleft as well as pictures of the velopharyngeal closure will be collected in order to describe the main morphological characteristics of the velum and to create a morphotypology of operated cleft palates. These data will allow to classify and quantify the different types of velopharyngeal anatomy encountered and to compare them to the results from functional imaging. Data will be compared between operated cleft palate (group A) and normal operated cleft palate (group B). Significant values will be discussed in order to describe patterns of movement and to find predictive factors of VPI. Ethics and dissemination : Authorization was delivered by the Ile-de-France VI EEA (CPP IDF VI EEA N°2019-A02932-39), and approval given on the 16-07-2019.

670,"52 Participants between 50-80 years of age with confirmed diagnosis of MS will be recruited for the study. Participants will be randomized to the experimental group (Exercise Training Program) or the active control condition (Stretching Program). Participants in the experimental group will attend 16 in-person coaching sessions (via Zoom) at baseline prior to initiation of the home-based intervention while those in the control condition will complete the same number of coaching sessions for a comparable interaction with the behavior change coach. Participants in the experimental group will be asked to perform aerobic exercise (30 minutes of walking) and resistance training (10-15 repetitions of 5-10 exercises targeting lower and upper body, and core muscle groups) for 3 days a week for the duration of the 16-week intervention. Participants in the control condition will receive similar instructions specific to the stretching exercises for 3 days a week for 16 weeks. Participants in both intervention groups will be instructed to exercise independently at home under remote supervision and coaching support without the need to travel to onsite facilities (i.e., laboratory, fitness center, etc.,). Study participants' data will be captured pre-intervention and post-intervention at a clinical research center located within a large academic medical institution. Study participants will undergo neuropsychological and physiological testing, assessments of health-related quality of life, and physical activity participation at each time point. All participants will be asked to complete a 4-week follow-up assessment. The investigators hypothesize that the exercise training program will improve cognitive and physical function, vascular function (i.e., augmentation index, cfPWV), and health-related quality of life compared with the active control stretching program."

673,"The investigators are interested in developing a diagnostic tool, to optimise personalised treatment of asthma. They aim to test the hypothesis that microbiome in the lower airways has significant implications on the asthma phenotype and response to treatment. The investigators believe that development of robust microbiome signature associated with specific genotypes and phenotypes that can predict treatment response or resistance will aid in optimising personalised treatment of asthma. The investigators will perform this study by recruiting asthmatic participants from the ambulatory respiratory service in RCSI and University of Limerick. 

Detailed Description: 
This is an observational study, which includes two treatment arms. The cohort will comprise 50 patients in the naïve biologic arm, with 10 patients in biologic arm. Recruitment will comprise patients who have presented to the Respiratory Medicine Clinic in RCSI, and to a similar clinic in the University of Limerick. Each patient will complete a baseline visit where informed consent will be obtained and questionnaire data collected. A full pulmonary function test including spirometry, impulse oscillometry, induced sputum, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, exhaled breath condensate, nasopharyngeal swab and oral rinse samples will be collected at baseline followed by an interim visit 1 month later, and a final visit 6 months later. Patients in the biologic arm will have additional visits for initiation of biologic therapy, and for safety monitoring 1 month post commencing biologic therapy. This study is part funded by The Health Research Board of Ireland (Grant HRB2018/2).

677,"Epidemiologic data suggest that approximately 40% of young people do not consistently use contraception and approximately 80% do not consistently use condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infection (STIs) or unintended pregnancy. The same period of time (early adulthood) is a time of transition in sexual behavior; most youth become sexually active. Data also show that alcohol and drug use during early adulthood is highly prevalent; approximately 30% of youth meet criteria for substance use disorder, and this risk is higher among reproductive-aged women, who are also disproportionately impacted by structural racism and income inequality. 
Given this intersection of prevalence, need for behavior change, and the lack of a coherent and evidence-based prevention strategy, a gap in prevention and care exists for this population. The investigators are developing and implementing a multi-center, 2-arm, type 2 Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness (IME) randomized controlled trial, for which the investigators propose to obtain a hybrid effectiveness grant from the NICHD. The study will randomize 6 clinics (and ultimately 2,000 patients in NYC, NJ, and PA) to either usual care or SBIRT plus patient navigation. 
The investigators will conduct a Hybrid type 2 effectiveness/implementation study, with each clinic serving as a unit of randomization. Clinics will be randomly assigned at the level of the clinic, and patients will be enrolled from within each randomized clinic following the RCT protocol. 
The IME Hybrid trial will test the following hypotheses: 
1. Compared to usual care in two study arms, clinics and providers in intervention clinics will implement a replicable, scalable model of integrated and coordinated behavioral and medical services to effectively manage substance use and alcohol- and drug-related sexually risky behaviors and consequent high-risk STIs and unintended pregnancy outcomes and improve overall wellbeing among young people, particularly among women of color. 
2. Compared to usual care in two study arms, the implementation of integrated and coordinated behavioral and medical services to effectively manage substance use and alcohol- and drug-related sexually risky behaviors and consequent high-risk STIs and unintended pregnancy outcomes plus patient navigation will lead to significant reductions in alcohol and drug-related risky sexual and reproductive behaviors, which in turn will lead to significant reductions in substance use, incidence of STI's, and unintended pregnancy among women of color.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory diseases as well as diabetes and obesity are growing problems. There is an urgent need to find alternative interventions. Plant extracts as functional food ingredients are one type of intervention that have not yet been adequately tested. MEDICINAL OBJECTIVES: The objective is to investigate the effect of a functional herbal tea containing rhubarb root extract on inflammation, gut-microbiota, well-being and metabolic health. The hypothesis is that functional herbal tea improves metabolic health, improves microbial diversity and alters microbe-derived short chain fatty acids in the gut. A functional herbal tea containing rhubarb root extract reduces cardiovascular and metabolic health markers by altering the gut environment. WHO ISSUES: World Health Organisation reports that inflammatory diseases, diabetes and obesity are growing problems. Aging and changes to lifestyle, including unbalanced nutrition and a lack of physical activity, are the primary causes of these diseases. The prevalence of cancer and non-communicable disease (NCD’s) in low-income African countries is set to rise. The current cost of NCD treatment in Africa is a significant strain, and there is an urgent need to find alternative interventions.
METABOLIC OBJECTIVES: The hypothesis is that functional herbal tea improves metabolic health, improves microbial diversity and alters microbe-derived short chain fatty acids in the gut. A functional herbal tea containing rhubarb root extract reduces cardiovascular and metabolic health markers by altering the gut environment. This hypothesis will be tested by comparing the effects of a functional herbal tea containing rhubarb root extract (intervention group), standard green herbal tea (active control group), a standard senna herbal tea (placebo control group) on outcomes of interest that are measured through a trial of the functional herbal tea intervention; These include weight, BMI, waist circumference, dietary intake, body fat composition and short chain fatty acids. 
OUTCOMES: The primary objectives are to investigate the effect of a functional herbal tea (containing rhubarb root extract) on total body weight, BMI, waist circumference, dietary intake of the functional herbal tea, body fat composition, plasma cardiometabolic health markers, plasma short chain fatty acids and short chain fatty acids diversity. The secondary objective is to explore other aspects of human health such as markers of well being and quality of life, inflammatory markers, gut microbiome diversity and ad libitum energy intake and energy expenditure over a month period.

Objective
-----------------
Primary objective is to assess how a functional herbal tea (rhubarb root extract) and senna and green tea (control) effect metabolic health and changes in dietary intake. Secondary aim is to assess how they influence the gut microbiome and its metabolic products - short chain fatty acids.

682,"12 million restorative visits occur per year among children 4 to 12 years old. 91% of those will require some type of local anesthetic procedure with nitrous oxide to complete the procedure. Nitrous oxide however is not a solution for all patients as its use may be contraindicated (e.g. for patients who have COPD and those who are overweight or obese (BMI greater than 32kg/m2). This means most patients with these conditions either need to be sedated to be able to receive local anesthetic(with the risk of complications and need for monitoring), or they need to have a dental procedure without anesthetics at all, which poses a significant concern as the lack of anesthetics often leads to an unreliable final restoration, high failure rate, and potential dental trauma. These patients often are too anxious and/or aggressive to receive local anesthetics. Thus, the development of a pain-free solution that is a viable alternative to nitrous in pediatric dentistry is highly sought-after by dentists. Virtual reality (VR) is a device which allows players to be totally immersed in a non-physical, computer-generated environment, complete with its own rules and reality. VR technology relies on a head-mounted display called a VR headset, where players are able to see a virtual world in front of them by wearing the VR headset. VR headsets have been shown to be the most reliable and effective type of distraction tool for treatment in the dental setting for adults and children. This study aims to determine whether virtual reality distraction can be as effective as nitrous oxide in reducing the need for local anesthetic, as assessed by pain score, during restorative treatment in pediatric dental clinic. The study will also aim to determine the patient's satisfaction with using virtual reality during the restorative treatment."
683,"436 individuals 18 to 75 years undergoing routine colonoscopy will be assessed for colorectal neoplastic lesions and offered to participate in the study. Within five years 150 participants with two or more lesions during colonoscopy will be asked to provide stool sample for comprehensive sequencing of exonic regions from 252 genes. Clinical-pathological and mutational profile of each individual lesion found during colonoscopy will be collected. The investigators have determined from our prior data that in the colon cancer population, with a five-year follow-up, approximately 25% will develop a new colorectal lesion. In the present study, all participants with at least 2 resected neoplasm will be asked to provide stool sample within 5 years of the first event that will enable us to collect information on metachronous lesions."
684,"The gut microbiota has a role in both the development and treatment of malnutrition. It has been seen that patients affected by malnutrition have a dysfunctional gut microbiota compared to healthy controls. The gut microbiota may also contribute to the appearance of several non-communicable age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, depression, or insulin-resistance. The aim of the SAM Project is to contribute to the improvement of the management of malnutrition; to contribute to the discovery of new potential biomarkers to diagnose malnutrition, and to identify new microbial targets for drugs or probiotics. 
Malnutrition is characterised by a nutritional deficit due to insufficient intake or inability to retain nutrients. It is estimated that millions of people suffer from it, but it is still a neglected disease. Currently, the WHO defines three types of malnutrition: malnutrition by overweight or obesity (MOM), malnutrition by underweight (UND) and micronutrient deficiency (MIC). According to the WHO, worldwide underweight, overweight or obesity, and micronutrient deficiencies, including iodine, are responsible for 19% of deaths and 43% of the burden of disease in childhood. Malnutrition has also been considered one of the leading risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease and depression, as well as for insulin resistance. 
Malnourished individuals have a lower microbial diversity and a lower total amount of microbiota than healthy individuals. Malnourished patients suffer from dysbiosis, which is characterised by a decrease in the abundance of beneficial species and an increase in the abundance of pathogenic species. For instance, in the case of severe malnutrition, the fecal microbiota is dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes is diminished. In the case of underweight (MOM), a decrease of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and a relative increase in the number of Proteobacteria have also been found, similar to that found in obese patients (MOM). This alteration could be due, in part, to the high intake of simple carbohydrates such as added sugars, to which these two phyla are well adapted. On the contrary, Firmicutes are favoured by a diet high in fibres and whole grains. An intake of large amounts of sugars and fats reduces Lactobacillales and Bifidales, two classes of Firmicutes known to provide some protective qualities against ageing and disease."

| Experimental: MI-E<br>Patients in experimental group will receive Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (MI-E) twice a day (i.e. 8-10 am and 4-6 pm) in addition to standard airway care. MI-E will be applied twice a day, using a standardized program that is developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Since the severity of illness can change in the ICU, each day the attending nurse will check for clinical reasons to refrain from MI-E at that day, i.e., ventilator instability, haemodynamic instability and use of ECMO. Also extra corporeal oxygenation (ECMO) is a reason to refrain from MI-E at that day, although these patients will be given MI-E when they are not in ECMO, but expected to be treated with Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (MI-E). | Device: Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation<br>* MI-E will be applied twice a day (i.e. 8-10 am and 4-6 pm) using a standardized program that is developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. |
| No Intervention: Standard airway care<br>Patients in the control group will receive standard airway care, such as regular endotracheal suctioning, and manual hyperinflations, when indicated based on daily examination of the patient and based on standard criteria used to perform these procedures, i.e., endotracheal suctioning is indicated if, clinically, respiratory secretions are noted. Manual hyperinflations are performed at patients who are dyspnoea, have an elevated respiratory rate, have a raised chest wall and low oxygen saturation (SpO2). | |

688,"Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are known to have a poor clinical outcome. No proven pharmacological therapies are available for these conditions. The investigators therefore hypothesize that the natriuretic activity of an SGLT2 inhibitor will decrease cardiac preload and relieve TR in HFpEF patients. The EVENT trial will test this hypothesis. The primary aim of this trial is to determine whether SGLT2 inhibitor-induced natriuresis can improve clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in HFpEF patients with functional TR during a follow-up of 1.5 years. The investigators will test the hypothesis that treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor enavogliflozin for a period of 18 months would improve clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in HFpEF patients with functional TR. If this hypothesis is correct, this new treatment strategy has the potential to change the management of patients with functional TR and HFpEF."
689,"30 patients with severe haemophilia A with a previous diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD) and a phenotype consistent with classic VWD will be enrolled in the study. All subjects will be evaluated once at screening and once at the end of the study by: Blood draw for PK parameter analyses: FVIII PK parameter will be measured at baseline. The PK parameter will be evaluated by measuring the Area Under the Curve (AUC), the maximum plasma levels reached (C) and the elimination half-life (t-1/2). Blood drawn is 40mL. Body composition analysis by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The measurement will be performed by a trained operator using the GE LUNAR Prodigy densitometer. The total duration of testing is approximately 20 minutes. Videocapillary study at the hand. The study is performed by the Videocapillaroscopic Study system. The patient must have good hand hygiene and use clean surgical gloves. A drop of local anaesthetic (5-10% lidocaine) will then be used to numb the area of the hand and the finger in question. The blood flow in the capillaries will eventually be examined under a microscope. The entire procedure is performed under sterile conditions and requires the use of an aseptic filter (cassette) and a special device with a disposable cannula. The test takes about 30 minutes.

The aim of this study, which examines the changes in premenstrual mood before and after the intervention, is to determine what changes occur in terms of premenstrual mood and what effects the intervention has. The study is aimed at women between the ages of 18 and 30 who meet the inclusion criteria.In this study, the intervention to be applied will be evaluated in terms of whether it is effective in improving a variety of mood changes that premenstrual syndrome may bring with it, whether it results in changes that affect the perception of stress and the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits, and what positive and possible consequences the intervention can have in terms of premenstrual mood."
692,"Cognitive dysfunction is common in people with psychosis, but effective psychosis treatments have little impact on cognitive symptoms. The goal of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) that will examine the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medication (M1, also known as D-APB) in treating cognitive dysfunction in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). The investigators hypothesize that M1 will be safe and well-tolerated, significantly improve cognitive performance, and increase engagement in daily life activities in an eight-week open label treatment phase. The study will include 10 participants with treatment-resistant cognition and 15 healthy controls. The study design and protocol will be modified based on observations in this pilot study.


Study Design
=================
Purpose:: Basic Science
Allocation: Randomized
Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment
Interventional Model Description: This is a placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial. Subjects with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD) with treatment-resistant cognition and healthy controls will be randomized to M1 (D-APB), M10, or placebo/matching medication. Subjects will begin with a treatment-free baseline period for two weeks. There will be a 50-60 minute cognitive assessment every other week for five weeks after baseline, and then weekly assessments for the next three weeks. After the first seven visits, participants will begin their randomized 8-week treatment phase. Following the medication phase, participants will have two final visits scheduled approximately three weeks (± two weeks) from their Week 8 visit. There will be additional in-person and phone meetings with study staff during Weeks 2 and 4 and Weeks 6 and 8 of the treatment phase. Study Drug/Treatment: The study drug is M1 (D-APB), developed by Dr. James Baker, UCSD Departments of Psychiatry and Pharmacology. Participants in the schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder groups will be randomized to take 3 of 6 possible medications for 8 weeks: 
M1 (D-APB): 50, 100, or 200 mg/day; M10: 50, 100, or 200 mg/day; or Placebo/matching medication: Bupropion 100 or 150mg/day. Participants will not know if they are taking M1, M10, or the matching medication.

693,"Our overall goal is that the intervention will improve the quality of care for individuals in Dutch prisons in the long-term (> two to three years after the completion of the present research). This RCT will inform whether the intervention should be implemented or whether it needs further adaptation. If, based on the present research, the intervention can be implemented in Dutch prisons, it is expected that it may be beneficial for individuals and for Dutch society in the long-term by a reduction in the rate of re-offending and by saving money. 
The specific objectives are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing PM+ in Dutch prisons. By feasibility, we refer to how well we can successfully deliver and evaluate the intervention as expected by the study protocol. Acceptability refers to the perceptions and experiences of everyone involved with the intervention, from recipients to researchers, and can be evaluated based on quantitative and qualitative data. 
The research plan has been guided by the Medical Research Council (MRC) feasibility guidelines for trial design, conduct, and reporting. The study design was guided by the MRC framework that focuses on the following items: 1) Does the intervention work? 2) Does it work for particular people? 3) For whom and for what types of problems is it not worth trying the intervention compared to the control condition? 4) Does the intervention work in a particular setting? 5) Is it possible to deliver the intervention as intended? 6) Was the recruitment and retention rate appropriate? Thus, we evaluate the intervention in terms of its expected clinical effects (i.e., primary outcome) and its feasibility and acceptability (i.e., secondary outcomes)."
694,"1. Background: The FDA approved use of Xevinapant (VX-740) in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with previously untreated locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It reduces the incidence of severe adverse events of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Xevinapant has been granted orphan drug designation for various solid tumors including HNSCC by FDA. A Phase 3 clinical trial, START2 (NCT02518348), has demonstrated that Xevinapant in combination with FOLFIRI (XEV in combination with FFIC) improves progression free survival compared to FFIC alone and reduces the occurrence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and neutropenic fever. These findings suggest that Xevinapant has activity in patients with HNSCC. 2. Rationale: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is curable using radiation with surgery, or with radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy. Patients who receive chemoradiation with cisplatin frequently experience treatment-related toxicities, particularly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In a phase 2 study of patients with advanced HNSCC, the median dose of carboplatin received in combination with radiation was 400 mg/m2. The primary objective of this protocol is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when xevinapant is given in combination with Radiation Therapy (RT) and Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in patients with advanced HNSCC. 3. Hypotheses: Phase I: The MTD of Xevinapant in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is estimated to be 200 mg given twice daily on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle. The main toxicities seen when Xevinapant is given in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in patients with PDAC are neutropenia and neutropenic fever. Neutropenic fever is defined as an oral temperature of ≥ 39.0 degrees C while the patient is neutropenic. The maximum tolerated dose in the present study is defined as a grade 3-4 adverse event in < 50% of patients. The adverse events considered to determine the MTD will include all grades of adverse events. Phase II: The primary objectives is to determine the progression free survival (PFS) when Xevinapant is given in combination with chemotherapy and radiation. The secondary objectives include the determination of overall survival (OS), response rate, and the incidence and severity of Grade 3 and 4 toxicities observed. The main objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a combination of RT, carboplatin, and paclitaxel in combination with a xevinapant. This treatment regimen has not been extensively used. The proposed phase 1 dose escalation design has been used in a number of studies. 4. Study Design: Phase I: This is a dose escalation phase I trial designed to determine the MTD of Xevinapant in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced HNSCC. Once the MTD is determined, the next phase will be dose expansion to confirm the MTD, determine safety and efficacy at this dose. The recommended dose to be used in phase II will be based on the safety and efficacy data collected from the dose expansion phase. The study will consist of screening, treatment, and a follow-up period. Phase II: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of this regimen by determining the progression free survival (PFS) of all patients enrolled in the expansion cohort. The secondary objectives included determining the overall survival (OS) of all patients enrolled in the expansion cohort, evaluating the response rate of all patients enrolled in the expansion cohort, and evaluating the incidence and severity of grade 3 and 4 toxicities. Study objectives were determined following discussions with the scientific and clinical team at UT Southwestern Medical Center and an Advisory Board which included experts in medical, surgical, and radiation oncology of the head and neck.
