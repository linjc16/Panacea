-----------------
Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition that affects 15% of the population. It is characterized by urinary urgency, frequency and nocturia. The first line treatment is anticholinergic medication. However, 30-50% of patients do not respond to this treatment. The second line treatment is onabotulinum toxin A (Botox) and sacral neuromodulation (SNM). Botox is a toxin that is injected into the bladder wall. It is effective in 50-80% of patients. SNM is a surgical procedure that involves implanting a small device in the lower back. It is effective in 60-80% of patients. However, there is no consensus on which treatment is the best for patients with OAB. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is a method that can be used to measure patient preferences for different treatments. It involves asking patients to choose between two fictive treatments, each option comes with it's own botox and SNM characteristics. The DCE will be used to measure patient preferences for second line OAB therapy. The results of the DCE will be used to inform clinical decision making.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to measure patient preferences for second line OAB therapy.

9,"1. Background and rationale: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management to prevent complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a technology that can help people with T1D manage their blood glucose levels more effectively. CGM devices measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid continuously and provide real-time data to the user. This information can help people with T1D make more informed decisions about their diabetes management, such as adjusting insulin doses, dietary choices, or physical activity levels. However, the use of CGM devices is not widespread in South Africa due to a lack of evidence on their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. In addition, there is limited evidence on the feasibility and acceptability of CGM use in South Africa. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of continuous and intermittent CGM use on blood glucose levels in people living with T1D in South Africa. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes, unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications, quality of life of recipients of care and their caregivers (where applicable), acceptability and feasibility of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a healthcare provider, recipients of care and care givers perspective, and cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. 3. Study design: This is a three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled study. The study will be conducted in three study clinics in South Africa. The study will enroll 150 participants who will be randomly assigned to one of the three study arms: Arm 1: continuous CGM use; Arm 2: intermittent CGM use; Arm 3: standard of care (control). The study will be conducted over a period of 15 months. 4. Study population: The study population will include people living with T1D who are attending for diabetes care at the study clinics. The study will also include caregivers of children/adolescents living with T1D and healthcare providers involved in clinical care at the study sites. 5. Study interventions: The study interventions will include continuous and intermittent CGM use, standard of care, and qualitative methods. 6. Study outcomes: The primary study outcome will be the change in HbA1c levels before and after treatment in standard of care, continuous, and intermittent CGM arms. The secondary study outcomes will include the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes, unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications, quality of life of recipients of care and their caregivers (where applicable), acceptability and feasibility of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a healthcare provider, recipients of care and care givers perspective, and cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. 7. Study methods: The study will use a mixed methods approach, including quantitative and qualitative methods. The study will use a range of data collection methods, including surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions. 8. Study analysis: The study will use a range of statistical and analytical methods to analyze the study data. The study will use descriptive statistics to summarize the study data, and inferential statistics to test the study hypotheses. The study will also use qualitative methods to analyze the study data. 9. Study dissemination: The study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and other appropriate channels. The study results will also be shared with the study participants and other stakeholders. 10. Study limitations: The study has several limitations, including the potential for selection bias, the potential for measurement bias, and the potential for confounding. The study will use a range of methods to minimize these limitations. 11. Study implications: The study results will have important implications for the management of T1D in South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries. The study results will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of continuous and intermittent CGM use in people living with T1D in South Africa. The study results will also provide evidence on the feasibility and acceptability of CGM use in South Africa. The study results will inform policy and decision-making related to the use of CGM devices in people living with T1D in South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries."

11,"Background
-----------------
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. It is the most common chronic disease in childhood, with a prevalence of 10% in children aged 12-17 years. The disease is characterized by a high variability in the clinical course, with a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. The main objective of asthma treatment is to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations. The treatment plan is based on the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABA), which are the mainstay of asthma treatment. However, adherence to treatment is often poor, especially in children, and this can lead to poor control of the disease and an increased risk of exacerbations. In recent years, the use of digital technologies in the management of chronic diseases has been increasingly studied. In particular, the use of serious games (SG) has been proposed as a tool to improve adherence to treatment and to promote a healthy lifestyle in children with asthma. SG are interactive games that are designed to promote learning and behavior change. They can be used to educate patients about their disease and to promote healthy behaviors, such as physical activity and healthy eating. In this study, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a SG in improving adherence to treatment and quality of life in children with asthma. The SG will be designed to be fun and engaging, and will be based on the principles of gamification. The SG will be used in conjunction with a standard treatment plan, and patients will be followed for six months. The primary outcome of the study will be adherence to treatment, as measured by the number of days of treatment taken and the number of exacerbations. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life, as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and the Skills and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Ita). The study will be conducted in collaboration with the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and will involve 60 children with asthma. The study will be conducted in two groups: one group will receive the SG in addition to the standard treatment plan, while the other group will receive the standard treatment plan only. The study will be conducted in a randomized, controlled trial design. The results of the study will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the SG in improving adherence to treatment and quality of life in children with asthma.

SG will include an adaptive tool to enable the experience based on the child's specific motor skills. The dynamics of SG will be adapted by considering real motor and physiological data acquired during each SG session via a wristband. These data are necessary to keep the child in the aerobic zone (60-80% of maximum heart rate). The movements are: Side bending: Moving an obstacle to open a passage.

13,"1. Background:

The investigators hypothesize that the current practice of weaning infants off of CPAP too early is associated with an increased risk of lung injury and poor lung growth.

2. Objectives:

The investigators aim to determine whether a standardized maintenance/weaning protocol for CPAP will reduce the number of infants who fail to wean off of CPAP.

3. Study Design:

This is a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized control trial involving premature neonates born between 23 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks gestational age. The trial will take place in four Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) within the Rady Children's/University of California, San Diego network, including Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego, Jacobs Medical Center, Scripps La Jolla (Rady NICU) and Rancho Springs (Rady NICU). The investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks CGA exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no). The investigators set the alpha error rate at 0.05 and power at 80%. To achieve a 50% reduction in the CPAP weaning failure rate, they aimed to enroll a total of 80 infants < 28 weeks and 50 infants 28-30 weeks (130 infants in total). Consent will be obtained after the eligible infant has been extubated or has been stable on NIS (defined as CPAP/NIMV/NIPPV- all modes of pressure reliant respiratory support) for over 72 hours. NIS is delivered via occlusive (Fischer & Paykel [F&P]) or non-occlusive (RAM TM/Nioflo TM) interfaces at any pressure and oxygen need. A standardized maintenance/weaning protocol will be implemented for the treatment group (standardized NIS wean) while the control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations. The control group will be weaned according to the unit's or medical team's practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations"

17,"Background
-----------------
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition where the heart muscle is no longer able to supply the body with enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of HF diagnosis in outpatient settings, urgent heart failure visit, heart failure hospitalization, and prescription for guideline recommended HF therapies in patients diagnosed with HFrEF within 6 months.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will be patients with at least two additional risk factors for HF. Male or female > 40 years of age Informed consent At least two additional risk factors for Heart Failure (HF): Coronary artery disease (either a previous documented type 1 myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention or documented stenosis or an epicardial coronary artery (50% left main stem or >70% left anterior descending, circumflex or right coronary artery)). Diabetes type 1 or 2. Persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation. Previous ischemic or embolic stroke. Peripheral artery disease (previous surgical or percutaneous revascularization or documented stenosis >50% of major peripheral arterial vessel. Chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60 milliliters per minute (mL/min)/1.73m2 or eGFR 60-90 mL/min/1.73m2 and urine albumin-creatinine ration (UACR) >300mg/g). Regular loop diuretic use for >30 days within 12 months prior to consent. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) evidenced by one of the following: Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) showing airway obstruction, diagnosis of respiratory physician, CT scan reporting presence of emphysema, or treatment with national guidance advocated COPD therapy. Exclusion Criteria: Inability to give informed consent (e.g. due to significant cognitive impairment). Previous diagnosis of heart failure. This is any diagnosis of heart failure with any ejection fraction of any cause. Renal replacement therapy. Anyone who, in the investigator's opinion, is not suitable to participate in the trial for other reasons e.g., a diagnosis which may compromise survival over the study period.

Intervention
-----------------
Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and if level elevated (>125 pg/ml) a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram."
