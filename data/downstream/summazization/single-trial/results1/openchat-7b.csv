56,"GPT4 Correct Assistant: This study aims to investigate the use of Trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-DXd) in combination with liquid biopsy for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The study will assess the ability of blood-based liquid biopsy to monitor disease progression to Trastuzumab-deruxtecan (as second line treatment) in patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of HER2-positive metastatic disease previously treated with one treatment line for metastatic disease including pertuzumab with Trastuzumab or Trastuzumab alone (associated to taxane). The primary objective is to dynamically assess circulating alterations associated with resistance to Trastuzumab-deruxtecan, including changes of the HER2 status by a novel approach named HER2-2D that simultaneously assesses HER2 amplification and (over)expression in blood. Secondary objectives include molecular stratification of patients, lead time assessment by liquid biopsy, and association between HER2-2D and outcome in terms of progression."
57,"GPT4 Correct Assistant: This study aims to implement Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) in earthquake-affected populations in Türkiye to address mental health issues. CPT is a cognitive behavioral treatment for PTSD consisting of 12 one-hour sessions. The study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial, comparing CPT to Enhanced-Care as Usual (E-CAU) as a control group. The primary outcome measure is post-traumatic stress disorder, with secondary outcomes including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and well-being. The study will include 30 participants, randomly assigned to either CPT or E-CAU."
58,"GPT4 Correct Assistant: The study aims to investigate the perceived quality of family planning counseling among reproductive aged women in El-Dakhla District, New Valley, using the validated and client-centered Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale. The QCC Scale measures three aspects of counseling quality: information exchange, interpersonal relationship, and disrespect and abuse. Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, and the study will also explore associated factors such as client, provider, and visit factors. The results will be used to improve the quality of family planning services in the area."
59,"GPT4 Correct Assistant: The PIVCO study aims to determine the optimal ablation strategy for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) using pulsed-field ablation (PFA) and multielectrode ablation catheters. The study will compare two approaches: pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone and PVI supplemented by additional lesions, such as left atrial posterior wall isolation and mitral and cavotricuspid isthmus lines. The primary endpoint is the recurrence of AF lasting >30 seconds as assessed using repeated 7-day ECG Holter monitoring in patients without anti-arrhythmic drugs during the entire post-blanking follow-up (three months after the index procedure). Secondary endpoints include the first recurrence of on-AADs AF/AT lasting >6 minutes during the post-blanking follow-up period, hospitalization rate, cardioversions, PFA-related complications, and assessment of the quality of life using standardized instruments."
60,"GPT4 Correct Assistant: The Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) St. Joseph's Children Home Visiting Study is a longitudinal study aiming to investigate the effects of home visiting on child development and school readiness, as well as the reduction of child maltreatment, delinquency, and crime. The study focuses on first-born children of parents living within a 3-county area in Florida, who are at least 1 month old and under 3 months of age at the time of enrollment. The study has two groups: the Experimental group, which receives home visiting intervention, and the Business as Usual group, which does not receive the intervention. The intervention is a three-year program for families and their first-born children, using home visiting to deliver a hybrid curriculum called Partners for a Healthy Baby. The study measures child development and school readiness using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), maternal health using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and child health using the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory (AAPI-2) and the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT). The study also assesses child maltreatment using the Conflict Tactics Scale Parent-Child Form (CTS-PC), reductions in child maltreatment using the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC), and linkages and referrals using the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) records. The study aims to measure the impact of home visiting on child development, school readiness, and the reduction of child maltreatment, delinquency, and crime."

The primary outcome measure is the frequency of genetic variants that significantly differ between the two responder groups, while the secondary outcome measure is the enrichment of genetic variants per gene/pathway. No treatment is provided to the participants as part of this study."
