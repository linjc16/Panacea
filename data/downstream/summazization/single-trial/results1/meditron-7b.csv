Background: While attention-deficit-/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia are frequently co-occurring conditions, the comorbidity of ADHD and dyslexia and its correlation with pharmacotherapy utilization for ADHD remains less clearly understood. Objectives: To explore possible ADHD-specific pharmacotherapy use patterns that differ between patients with vs without co-occurring dyslexia. Methods: Based on claims data, 30,354 patients with ADHD were stratified into clusters based on comorbidities with dyslexia at diagnosis. Results: A total of 7.2% (n = 2144) of patients within this ADHD sample were included into one of four different clusters, showing a comorbid ADHD-and-dyslexia prevalence of 17.8% (n = 1062). Within the ADHD population, patients with/without dyslexia were similar in age, sex distribution as well as utilization of non-pharmaceutical treatments, except for psychology services (8.4% more often utilized vs not used in ADHD + dyslexia). Compared with ADHD patients without dyslexia, those with dyslexia used psychotherapy and special schooling more frequently. At least one medicine was more frequently prescribed for ADHD + dyslexia patients. The most commonly prescribed were atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and bupropion, respectively. Atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine and methylphenidate showed significantly shorter DDDs for pharmacotherapy in ADHD + dyslexia patients, compared with ADHD patients without dyslexia. Additionally, medicines with more often used pharmaceutical treatments in the ADHD-only group compared with the overall population. Conclusions: Comorbid ADHD and dyslexia resulted in different patterns regarding pharmacotherapy, especially with regard to the prescription behavior. This implies that pharmacotherapy needs/dosages might differ between ADHD patients with and without dyslexia and thus that clinical diagnosis might be necessary to adjust treatment. Overall, the results highlight the need for additional research on the comorbidity of ADHD and dyslexia, especially regarding pharmacotherapy indication.

# Introduction
Attention-deficit-/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder comprising impaired attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which can lead to a wide range of comorbidities and negative effects on patients' development, functioning, and social integration. ADHD, in all probability, is more frequent than previously believed when compared to the officially defined patient population. For example, a recent German survey of approximately 10,000 children and adolescents with the same mean age as those who reportedly receive outpatient care for ADHD (10.5 years) showed that 3.3% (= 330/10,144) already had a confirmed ADHD diagnosis in the year before the study's survey start. Moreover, a German multicenter study carried out between October 2011 and December 2012 identified ADHD in 13.5% (= 307/2268) of all children interviewed (aged 6 to 8 years; 51% (= 1145/2268) of all interviewed children had at least one mental health problem).
In line with findings in other, mainly larger international studies, ADHD comorbidities can be diverse and range from anxiety disorders, depression, sleep disorders, substance abuse, or obesityas well as learning difficulties such as dyslexia (i.e., a persistent disorder affecting the ability to read), impairments in concentration, comprehension, and memory, which persist throughout their lifetime or significantly interf"

18 of 26 patients with osteosarcomas in the thoracic spine died after surgery or radiation therapy. For this malignant disease the following prognostic factors have been found to be adverse for outcome: primary tumor at TI-T3, soft tissue invasion not controlled, preoperative chemotherapy, and preoperatively high alkaline phosphatase level. These results confirm that a combined approach comprising intensive surgery, primary histological diagnosis by frozen section, and pre- and postoperative chemotherapy is necessary to treat patients with osteosarcoma in the thoracic spine. <EOD> .

Ocular adverse events are an emerging public health concern. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of ocular adverse events associated with the use of antiepileptic drugs among Nepali patients with epilepsy. This hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medical Sciences, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal, from May to December 2022. It included Nepalese patients aged >18 years diagnosed with epilepsy attending the Epilepsy clinic of Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 20.0) and R Studio. A total of 330 patients were included in the study, with a mean (±SD) age 33.95 (±14.06) years. Out of total patients, 196 (59.7%) were male. Among the study patients, 72 (21.8%) patients had used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for ≥10 years. The most commonly prescribed AEDs were oxcarbazepine (65; 19.7%) and Zonisamide (60; 18.2%). In the past 2 years, 15 (4.5%) patients were diagnosed with cataract. Moreover, three (0.9%) patients had experienced blurred vision, and two (0.6%) patients had cataract surgery done. Furthermore, 2 (0.6%) had experienced conjunctival hemorrhage and six (1.8%) had visual impairment within the last year. The incidence of ocular events in this study was lower than those reported in previous studies. The present study concludes that ocular adverse events are not uncommon, but their occurrence is lower than in previous studies. The results might be due to improvements in drug combinations, pharmacotherapy, and the management of epileptic patients during recent years. <EOD> Bactericidal Properties of Synthetic ε-polylysine-based Antimicrobial Coatings.

Input Text: The Effect of Virtual Reality on Preoperative Anxiety Before Abdominal Surgery

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Question to be Answered in the Study The questions expected to be answered in the study to be conducted to evaluate the effect of acupressure application on the anxiety level in the preoperative period in patients who will undergo abdominal surgery; What is the frequency of anxiety before abdominal surgery? What is the effect of virtual reality on anxiety management before abdominal surgery? Which technique is the best and most effective for preoperative anxiety management? Variables of the Research Preoperative anxiety scale/level Data Collection Tools Patient Information Form, VAS-A and a smart wristband with stress level measurement feature will be used to collect data. Form-1. Patient Information Form: It is a form consisting of sociodemographic questions created by the researchers. Form-2. Visual Anxiety Scale (VAS-A): The Numerical Anxiety Severity Scale consists of a horizontal line that begins with the expression 0 or no anxiety and ends with the expression 100 or severe anxiety. The patient is asked to choose the number that best describes the pain, between 0 and 100, by showing the scale. The result of the scale was evaluated over the arithmetic mean (Carr et al 2005; Kindler et al 2000). Smart Wristband: A smart wristband with photoplethysmography (PPG) feature that detects and reports stress-related changes will be used. After assessing whether the data fit the normal distribution with the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, if the data fit the normal distribution, parametric tests (Single Sample t-Test, One- and Multi-Way Analysis of Variance, Spearman's Correlation Analysis); if the data do not fit the normal distribution, non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskall Wallis Test, Friedman Test, Pearson's Correlation Analysis) will be used. Mean, standard deviation and percentage distribution methods will be used in the descriptive analysis of the data. The power of the sample will be calculated with the post hoc analysis to be made. The universe of the research; Between 01.03.2023 and 01.12.2023, all patients who will undergo abdominal surgery in the Trakya University Health Research Center General Surgery Clinic will form. The sample of the research; The sample will consist of individuals who meet the selection criteria and volunteer to participate in the research. Sample of the Study: Mosso et al.

Heparin-binding protein (HBP), a member of the selectin family, is synthesized constitutively by neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, platelets, and by the liver. HBP binds to high- and low-affinity receptors on human platelets and neutrophils and functions as an adhesion molecule. In the present study, HBP levels were established in serum obtained from patients with heart failure (n = 43) and ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies (n = 38), patients undergoing surgery for carcinoma (n = 32), and patients with aortic dissection (n = 10). In addition, normal subjects and other patients without heart failure, cardiomyopathies, or active malignancies were also examined (control group, n = 17). Compared with the controls, serum HBP levels were significantly higher in patients with heart failure or ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathies (P < 0.001, P = 0.008, and P = 0."

Phylogenetic relationships and diversity within the family Rieppeleontidae have long been debated, due to the family’s enigmatic and disparate morphology. Here, we sequenced three mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, cytochrome b, and the control region) for four Rieppeleon samples and 35 samples of other members of the squamate branch of the amniote tree from GenBank. We conducted phylogenetic analyses on the concatenated dataset (n = 94) including other rieppeleontid and squamate sequences retrieved from GenBank (n = 18) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ML), Maximum Parsimony (MP), Distance (neighbor joining and unweighted pair‐group method with arithmetic mean), and Bayesian estimation. For the three mitochondrial genes, we sequenced an additional 10 Rieppeleon samples and compared two methods of DNA extraction: the standard phenol/chloroform method, and a magnetic bead‐based method for DNA extraction. Both methods consistently produced high‐quality DNA samples, and the magnetic bead‐based protocol decreased the amount of time required for extraction by roughly 50%. Sequencing of all three mitochondrial markers produced a well‐resolved tree with strong bootstrap support. Members of the family Rieppeleontidae are well‐supported as sister to geckos (Squamata: Gekkota). The genus Rieppeleon is sister to Angolacerta (Squamata), and therefore, to Rieppeleontidae. Both the MP, neighbor joining, and NJ analyses of the concatenated data support the grouping of Rieppeleon as the basal group of geckos. The DNJ and UPGMA results do not completely agree with the rest of the results. Overall, our results show increased resolution within the Rieppeleontidae and increased phylogenetic stability, with strong support for both Rieppeleon as the basal group for Geckos and the family Rieppeleontidae as the sister clade to Geckos. <EOD> Rheumatoid factors: past, present and future.
Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are autoantibodies against the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G. The detection of circulating RFs, originally in the late 1960s, was a pioneering step towards identifying autoantibodies. RFs are found in 60% to 80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and are associated with severe joint damage. In addition to their utility as a diagnostic aid, RFs represent a unique model to investigate B-cell memory. In this review, we will describe the use of RFs as diagnostic and prognostic markers for rheumatoid arthritis, the generation of naturally occurring RFs during aging, development and the immunomodulatory potential of RFs. RFs have the potential to serve as surrogate markers to define and treat dysregulated humoral immunity in autoimmune disorders. This will guide the development and testing of novel therapies. <EOD> Fatal Pasteurella multocida pneumonia following traumatic dental injury.

He was found to have a biparietal skull fracture and a left otogenic subdural empyema. The otogenic empyema was drained and he was discharged home on a 10-day course of cefepime. The patient was readmitted 7 days later with respiratory failure after developing massive multilobar pneumonia due to Pasteurella multocida. He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for 2 weeks. The patient had a complicated postintensive care unit course due to continued pneumonia and a ventilator associated pneumonia caused by Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Objectives:To evaluate the revised American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 1997 staging system for renal cell carcinoma. Materials and Methods:Records of 672 patients diagnosed with renal cell cancer were examined. The revised AJCC TNM, the old American Cancer Society, and new AJCC staging systems were compared. Results:Age, gender, presenting symptom, and past smoking status were not significant independent prognostic factors. A stage II renal cell carcinoma patient was 50% less likely to have died compared with a patient in a higher disease stage. An overall survival (OS) time of 16.9 months was found to be the threshold separating prognosis into good and bad categories, with survival of 17 months or less representing “not a good prognosis.” The new AJCC TNM staging system improved discrimination compared with the old American Cancer Society staging. The AJCC TNM system yielded improved prognostic discrimination compared with the old staging system. The AJCC, TNM predicted an overall 5-year survival rate of 65% (95% CI, 61.7–68.3%). The new staging system was more predictive of survival than the old American Cancer Society staging system, and the revised AJCC appeared most useful in clinical studies by categorizing a sizeable group of patients (stage II) at low risk compared with the other 2 classifications. Conclusions:The most significant change of the 1997 AJCC TNM staging system was the reduction of the number of groups from four to three based on tumor size and the addition of nodal status as a criterion for T stage. The revised AJCC staging system provides a more clinically useful prognostic classification for patients with renal cell carcinoma. <EOD> FDA Drug Approvals, Mechanism of Actions, and Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Pain: Part 2.
Chronic pain is a significant medical problem in this country and worldwide. Recent national efforts, including the National Pain Strategy, have called for changes in the way chronic pain management is approached. One part of these efforts emphasizes the development of new therapies for chronic pain via randomized controlled trials leading to regulatory approval for these new therapies. This article (part 2 of a 3-part series) describes the FDA drug approvals and mechanism of actions for therapies developed to meet these goals during the period 2013 to the present. A brief comment on pain medication formulations approved between 2010 and 2012, not covered in part 1 of this series, is also included. The FDA approved 43 new therapies for chronic pain from March 2013 through November 2021. Most approvals were for products containing opioids (n = 17), gabapentin-containing (n = 6), and melatonin-containing formulations (n = 4). The mechanisms of action for each of these new approaches has been described in part 1 of this series. Although a review of the literature suggests that many patients with chronic pain who receive these new therapies will have relief, there is currently very limited evidence demonstrating long-term effects on the opioid and other substance use disorders, nonaddiction drug use, and mental health disorders that complicate chronic pain management and often drive continued demand for new therapies. Therefore, this third part of this series focuses on therapies for chronic pain that are currently in development. <EOD> Fertilization of maturing oocytes stimulates glucose transport via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in pig oocytes.

[/INST] <EOD> Sensation-to-Motor Conversion in Human Primary Somatosensory Cortex Drives Self-Mutilation in Tourette Syndrome

Tourette syndrome (TS) is characterized by multiple muscle-twitches and frequent selfmutilation. While clinical symptoms are considered dopaminergic, cortical mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we used fMRI to investigate the neural substrates of tic generation in TS before and after pharmacologically modulated states. Twenty-three adults with TS and age-matched controls were scanned during a tactile finger localizer task, followed by two 10-min tasks to evaluate the relationship between tics and the cortical motor network. Subjects tapped their fingertips during a simple buttonbox finger-tapping task (FT) and were asked to withhold tics when possible. Control subjects showed only somatosensory responses to finger stimulation. Twice as many (n = 650) tics occurred in the FT (Ft) as in the withholding task (without tics: Wt). TS subjects showed bilateral fMRI activation of the primary somatosensory areas (S1) corresponding to the tic locations, with only one subject displaying activation of the secondary somatosensory areas (S2). Tics occurring in S1 during Ft activated bilateral motor cortex (M1), whereas tics occurring in S2 during the withdrawal state (Wt) failed to generate M1 activity. The data suggest that generation of TS tics occurs in sensorimotor cortical areas and that the transition of a somatosensory state into an active motor act is cortically regulated.

Conclusion: Overactive bladder is a disease that negatively affects quality of life. This paper aimed to provide more information on how a diverse cultural population with OAB rate different OAB treatment methods. A total of 101 patients with OAB filled out questionnaires, a discrete choice experiment, and 1-on-1 interviews. The results showed that a diverse population tends to dislike therapies that do not provide long-lasting improvement. They are also more receptive to side effects and would opt for less invasive treatment options if quality of life was improved.

Background
============
Overactive Bladder (OAB) can be described as an increased urge to urinate that is accompanied by urine leakage, and/or urgency and frequency. Symptoms of overactive bladder can be very disruptive to an individual’s daily activities leading to high costs and poorer quality of life (QOL) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), OAB is defined as urinary discomfort perceived to be related to an overactive, bladder. OAB can affect both men and women at all ages, although it is more commonly found in the elderly. Worldwide, the prevalence of OAB in adults has been calculated to be 16% while prevalence in the elderly has been calculated to be 30% .

Management of OAB consists of many treatment options including conservative therapies, antimuscarinics, beta agonists, urethral bulking agents, beta mimetic agents, and neuromodulation (sacral neuromodulation, SNM). Currently, botulinum toxin (botulinum A toxin) (onabotulinum toxin A (ONA)) is used as a second-line treatment for OAB . Botulinum toxin is thought to work by blocking presynaptic calcium channels as a result of which bladder contractions are limited . This paper aims to explore to examine the influence that diversity and demographics have upon how a CALD community rates OAB"

### What are 'Serious Games'?
Serious Games are digital applications with an educational purpose and that exploit all the technological innovations of the digital world. 'Serious Game', an abbreviation of 'Serious Game', means: Game, i.e. a digital entertainment application, but this is a game for educational purposes, i.e. it has a clear purpose, more than just fun.

### What's the difference between serious games and non-educational games?
Serious games differ from non-educational games in several points. A serious game is not only entertaining, but also brings to our attention an important content.

### How serious games differ from normal software?
The software is a set of instructions (or programs) that allows you to control the computer, to change the state of the computers and the information contained within it. These programs are designed to enable us to do certain things. If the software performs a certain function then it is called an APPLICATION. An application uses specific resources such as file systems, web services, access to databases, memory, etc. An APPLICATION is not simply a program.

### What are the most popular game genres?
One of the best known genres is the Action genre, in which is included an entire line of sub-genres, called the Action Adventure genre or Action-RPG. The most popular genres, in the following order, are:
* Action
* Adventure
* RPG
* Arcade

 <EOD> Antithrombotic and antiplatelet effect of T-786, a synthetic anti-inflammatory compound.
T-786 (2-({3--2-propenyl}amino)benzoate dihydrochloride), a synthetic anti-inflammatory compound, was studied for antithrombotic and antiplatelet activities. At a dose level of 10 mg/kg, T-786 showed inhibitory effects on blood platelet activity with dose-dependence in rats. In addition, T-786 (200-600 mg/kg, p.o.) given once daily for 7 consecutive days showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on thrombosis induced by atherogenic diet, as compared with controls. These results suggest that T-786 might inhibit pathways of thrombogenesis, including blood platelet activity and thrombosis. <EOD> A comparison of the efficacy and safety profile of two fixed-dose combination regimens in treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a multiphase, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
OBJECTIVE
To compare the efficacy and safety profile of two fixed-dose combination regimens containing tacrine (18 mg), donepezil (10 mg) and galantamine (6.25 mg) in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.


METHOD
A total of 566 patients taking placebo throughout the 24-week acute treatment period were re-randomized to either once daily active treatment of T-DAG (n: 180), AD-P (n: 20), AD-DAG (n: 69), or placebo (n: 275) for 32 weeks, where the dosage regimens remained unchanged and the efficacy was evaluated at Week 56.


RESULTS
Patients in the T-DAG, AD-P, AD-DAG, and placebo group were administered active treatment for a mean period of 60.4, 12.3, 61.4, and 111.7 days, respectively. The three key secondary outcome measures, ADAS-cog11, BADLS and CGI-I showed that there was no significant difference in the efficacy among the treatment groups or between the T-DAG and the AD-P, AD-DAG, and placebo groups. Among these patients, the incidence rate of adverse events per 100 patient-years for nausea was significantly lower in the T-DAG group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05). Moreover, among the two once-a-day regimen groups"

INTRODUCTION
The frequency of hospitalizations to the pediatric emergency services reflects the characteristics of the morbid profile of the population, the evolution in its use, the epidemiological changes in the etiology of the hospitalizations, the socioeconomic level of the population served, and the organizational capacity of the health system.


OBJECTIVES
To describe the frequency of pediatric emergency room hospitalization of a third level hospital center. And to analyze its evolution over the last decade. To evaluate the factors potentially involved in this evolution.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Observational descriptive study of the frequency hospitalizations in the pediatric emergency department of the General University Hospital of Albacete, a third level hospital in the province of Castilla La Mancha (Spain) in the period of January 1944 to December 2003, that is, the entire period for which hospitalization statistics have been recorded.


RESULTS
The number of pediatric hospitalizations in the emergency room increased from 36,980 to 40,804 (+4.58%). This increase is largely attributable to the increase in the proportion of foreigners in the pediatric population served from 6.87 to 15.45% (+201%) and in hospitalizations to the emergency unit from 0.07 to 2.00%.


CONCLUSIONS
The increase in the number of foreign-born children in our department has contributed greatly to the increase in the number of hospitalizations. We propose to develop an adapted information system that would allow us to analyze and monitor more quantitatively our activity. <EOD> Association of CYP1A1 genotypes with head and neck cancer in Iran.
Head and neck cancer (HNC) has been suggested to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Cytochrome (CYP) 1, a superfamily of P450 isoforms in CYP1 gene family, has been implicated in metabolism and detoxification of carcinogens. The CYP1A1 gene is related with susceptibility to lung, breast, esophagus, kidney, colorectal and bile duct carcinogenesis. Our study aimed at evaluating the association of two polymorphisms in the 5 CYP1A1 gene (-6235G>A and -4464C>G) with HNC risk in the Iranian population. A total of 124 HNC patients and 189 cancer-free controls were recruited. Genotyping of variant CYP1A1 at -6235G>A and -4464C>G was determined by polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The genotype frequencies of -6235G>A and -4464C>G polymorphisms of CYP1A1 were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group. There was no relationship between CYP1A1 genotypes and the risk of HNC in this study. The -6235AA (p=0.025) and -6235GG (p=0.020) genotypes revealed higher risk of HNC in recessive models after adjustment for confounding factors. But the -6235, -4464 polymorphisms were not found to be associated with HNC risk in codominant, dominant and allelic models. This is the first study to demonstrate the association of two polymorphisms (rs1048943 and rs4646903) in the 5 CYP1A1 gene with the risk of HNC in Iran. Our study presented some information of genome-wide associations for the SNP"
15,"[/INST] A 12-month, prospective randomised study with two parallel groups and a one-year follow up including 63 randomized pediatric patients with unilateral cleft lip/ palate aged between 2-6 months was conducted to compare Millardin and modified Mishra technique for treating unilateral cleft lip. 31 patients were allocated to Group A (modified Millard) and 32 patients to Group B (modified Mishra). The study was performed at CranioSpacio, a craniofacial center, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Seth GSMC and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, India. The age range was between 2-6 months and the follow up period was for 12 months. Statistical analysis revealed a mean vertical lip height and horizontal lip length of 18.32 and 21.77 mm respectively in Group A, whereas the lip height and lip length was 10.82 and 16.25 mm in Group B. The Philtral length was 12.66 and 10.36 mm with p value <0.0001. The study concluded that modified Mishra technique gave a better result as compared to the millard technique in terms of lip height and philtral length.

 <EOD> High-resolution optical properties of epitaxial GaN films.
Epitaxial GaN thin-films and layers have the highest quality of all GaN materials studied to date (n's of up to 4.7 x 10(19) cm(-3)). With GaN grown on GaAs substrates using molecular-beam epitaxy, a series of thin-films and layer structures have been developed, and their optical properties have been investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry. It was found that at low coverage, GaN layers have lower effective refractive indices and larger effective optical band gaps than those of thin-films. The effect of growth time and substrate temperature on the structural and optical properties of thin-films and layers was also investigated. The optical band gap of GaN thin-films and layers was investigated in terms of two-band theories with the measured optical constant. In both GaN films and layers, the effective biaxial strain was calculated to be close to -2% and less than one-half of the GaN bulk strain. <EOD> Reaching out to adolescents: an outpatient program for substance abusers"

Input Text: Multidisciplinary Approach for Early Diagnosis of Canadians in Heart Failure Multidisciplinary Approach for Early Diagnosis of Canadians in Heart Failure

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Heart failure describes a chronic condition where the heart muscle is no longer able to supply the body with enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients. This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram.

 <EOD> Effects of short-term dexamethasone treatment on laryngeal resistance and catecholamine release during experimental laryngoscopy and intubation in pigs.
Eligible healthy pigs received 4.8 mg of dexamethasone intravenously 1 h before endotracheal anesthesia. Intubation was performed with 7 lm of cuffed tube and anesthesia (N(2)O + O(2)). Resistance to airflow through a model of the larynx and plasma levels of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) were measured before and during laryngoscopy and intubation. There were no significant differences in laryngeal resistance or plasma E and NE between the two groups of animals. Thus, although glucocorticoid-induced enhancement of the stress response attenuated the development of myosis, these data suggest that laryngoscopy and intubation is not associated with the same stress response that can be identified using other stressors. <EOD> Cranial ultrasound as a prognostic marker of neurological status in premature infants.
UNLABELLED
Cranial ultrasound (CUS) enables the detection of the primary injury of the brain in preterm infants as well as the assessment of brain development in early postnatal age. Our aim was to determine which of the ultrasound features is the best prognostic indicator of neurodevelopmental outcome as measured by Gesell Developmental Schedule at 3 years corrected age.


MATERIAL AND METHOD
We reviewed the incidence of cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), germinal matrix bleeding (GMB) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), ventricle size, and corpus callosum changes (dysgenesis) recorded by first CUS in the first year of life of 49 premature infants of birth weight (BW) < 2000 g and gestational age (GA) < or = 34 weeks. We retrospectively assessed, at 3 years corrected age, whether these findings were followed by neurodevelopmental impairment.


RESULTS
Thirty-eight infants were diagnosed as having normal development, normal neurological examination and normal electroencephalogram (EEG). Eleven infants had cerebral palsy, 8 out of them with epileptic encephalopathy and 8 had multiple major sensorineurologic disorders (MSND). 12/15 infants had abnormal CUS. PVL, GMB, and IVH were found in 16/49 infants, ventricle size changes in 21/49 and callosal dysgenesis in 12/49; all those were associated with abnormal development. No patient with normal development showed PVL and ventricle size changes. 100% of cases with abnormal behavioral/motor patterns and 90% of cases with epilepsy, 83% of cases with abnormal EEG and 84% of cases with hemiplegia were found in group with abnormal CUS.


CONCLUSIONS
We found that CUS revealed the most information about neurodevelopmental outcome among all other procedures; PVL and ventricle size changes were the best prognostic indicators in premature infants. <EOD> Surgery for unstable chest injuries.

# Introduction
Milk kefir is a natural and fermented drink obtained by mixing cow, sheep, or goat milk with the symbiotic mixture of microorganisms called kefir grains. Milk kefir is a traditional food product made with water kefir grains (KGs) and milk. The KG mixture contains a variety of indigenous milk acidifying bacteria and yeast. The fermentation of milk kefir is a complex process involving multiple species of microorganisms including yeasts and bacteria. Bacterial species that have been isolated from milk kefir include Micrococcus lactis, Streptococcus macedonicus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Lacticaseibacillus kefiranofaciens. The Lacticaseibacillus kefiranofaciens (L. kefiranofaciens) is the dominant heterofermentative bacterium in milk kefirand is considered to be the principal strain contributing to the overall fermentation of kefir. It is well known for its ability to produce an interesting biopolymer called kefiran. Kefiran is an extracellular polysaccharide that can be produced by fermentation of L. kefiranofaciens by lactose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and milk powder. Interestingly, kefiran is also considered to be a safe food additive approved by the European Commission. Lacticaseibacillus kefiranofaciens is considered a potential probiotic. It plays an important role in the microbial community of milk kefir. This strain has also been shown to produce 1,3-d-glucose with excellent bifidogenic activity. In addition, it is also used for immune modulation, improving intestinal cellular immunity. Therefore, it is not surprising that L. kefiranofaciens has been studied extensively in the academic research community, and this strain has been added as a starter culture by many dairies to improve milk fermentation in order to produce fresh kefir-like drink products.
Milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity has attracted our interest. We have previously reported that milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity could be used as the carrier to encapsulate probiotic bacteria, and the microencapsulated probiotic bacteria had good survivability in milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity. In addition, L. kefiranofaciens was the dominant strain of milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity, and its growth was not inhibited at pH = 4.00 and alkalinity = 0.30%, indicating that milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity was stable during fermentation, and the bacteria in milk kefir maintained excellent viability. The fermentation process was a complicated biological process in which physiological adaptation mechanisms of the bacteria in milk kefir was an essential step during the adaptation to low pH and low alkalinity. Adaptation of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens JF 293 (LkJF293, hereinafter referred to as Lk) strain from milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity, was found to be an essential requirement to maintain the normal survivability of Lk and maintain the production of kefiran in milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity. Physiological adaptation mechanisms of Lk adapting to low pH and low alkalinity could be considered during the fermentation process of milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity, which can be explored, such as proteomics, metabolomics,"

Detailed Description

# INTRODUCTION
Patients admitted to the hospital due to cardiovascular disease represent a heterogeneous group1. This heterogeneity is evidenced, for example, by the cardiovascular score (ARISCAT, EuroSCORE, SAPS, and SOAP, among others) that includes variables with different degrees of severity to classify patients according to their risk of death in hospital. This classification can be adopted by the professional to better guide the plan of care2,34. Thus, it is possible to identify patients whose prognosis may be precarious and therefore in need of greater care, monitoring, and resources4. The complexity of these patients is not exclusive to the surgical approach but also occurs in spontaneously ventilated patients. The knowledge of this aspect will help in the planning and the proper allocation of human and material resources.

# BACKGROUND
Cardiac surgical patients, among others, are admitted with varying severity of injury. This fact can interfere in the postoperative clinical evolution, in the use of resources by the health team, and in the quality of care5.

Many instruments are used to assess the risk of death in the hospitalization process6. Among these instruments, the ARISCAT (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Disease Classification System) stands out as it has good accuracy and has been recommended for use in adults in different centers7, being among those that has been validated by the American College of Cardiologists and European Society of cardiology8,9. Thus, ARISCAT has been able to identify risk factors for the survival of patients in general and has shown good reproducibility, with an accuracy of 85% for patients with cardiac disease10. The EuroSCORE 11 may also be indicated since it has an excellent performance in the prediction of the risk for the death of patients treated by cardiac or cardiac surgery. In this case, the mortality estimate in patients with a risk greater than 6.56% is lower than the observed mortality, indicating a positive predictive value. This parameter can facilitate the decision to maintain or discharge the patients12. In addition, the SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score), which assesses the severity of the disease and may be linked to the prognosis of the patient13, has good accuracy, having been one of the factors considered in the selection of a model more suitable for the Brazilian reality14. The SOAP (Several Organ Assessment Score) is also a valid tool for the evaluation of cardiac patients who require surgery, having undergone several validations and an accuracy greater than 84%15. All these tools are validated and can be used as a predictor of the patients' risk of death without hospitalization16.

In addition to the risk of death, other factors directly or indirectly interfere with the prognostic evolution of the patient, such as gender, age, and previous comorbidities17, being related to longer hospital stays and greater use of medications and resources18. Aging may indicate frailty and loss of physiological reserves, contributing to loss of functionality and greater risk of death19. Moreover, being aged 60+ years or having two or more comorbidities was associated with six-month mortality in cardiac surgery, which reinforces the impact of these variables on prognosis20.

The severity of the disease also needs to be evaluated according to its impact on daily activities, considering that the degree of restriction on the activities of daily living of a patient can also estimate whether he is at risk for death21. After considering these parameters and combining them with the previous ones, the prognostic evaluation can be obtained, which can guide the choice of clinical and/or surgical care.

Diseases such as lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary disease, and diseases not yet identified in the heart and lung are some of the main causes of mortality worldwide22,23. This situation is aggravated by other diseases, such as sepsis, which"

We studied the usefulness of a single contrast CT of the chest, stomach, lungs and mediastinum (C/SCT) as a screening procedure for detection of gastric cancer in patients in which a stomach screening test result was ""abnormal"" by the examination of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, stool occult blood, serum gastrin and pepsinogen/pancreatic polypeptide, simultaneously. Of the study population of 32 patients, 7 cases of gastric cancer, 5 cases of gastrointestinal ulcers and 4 cases of gastric ulcers without gastric cancer were proved by the examination after C/SCT. This examination gave a false positive result in 8 cases and a false negative result in 4 cases. The false negative cases were in the upper two-thirds of the gastric body or in the stomach without pylorus. C/SCT failed to give a true positive result in 8 out of 7 cases of gastric cancer located in the lower one-third and in the distal antrum. Although 8 false positive cases showed either a history or clinical features of gastric ulcer and gastric erosion, C/SCT proved all the cases to be ulcers without malignancy. In conclusion, C/SCT is useful as a screening procedure for the early detection of gastric cancer particularly in the early stage of gastric cancer, and to distinguish between gastric ulcers with malignancy from those without malignancy. <EOD> Effects of a modified intravenous glucose tolerance test.
Serum immunoreactive insulin and glucose values following a modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were evaluated in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. When the results were compared to those of a standard IVGTT, the test was found in diabetics with elevated fasting blood glucose, but with normal postprandial levels, to be more accurate in diagnosis. In patients with normal fasting levels and borderline postprandial levels the procedure was less reliable. The test was also more helpful in distinguishing between diabetics and patients with thyrotoxicosis. Patients who had a history positive for diabetes and were found to be without abnormalities on the oral glucose tolerance test were tested with the modified IVGTT; in these cases, the test did not alter the diagnosis. We conclude that the modified IVGTT is a reliable diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus and may be best used for distinguishing diabetics from patients with thyrotoxicosis. <EOD> Dental trauma during pediatric dental management

Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of dental injury among children attending a specialized pediatric dentistry clinic at Federal University of São Paulo, and to analyze the etiologic and related aspects involved in these injuries. Study Design: Transversal observational study Design/Period of Study: This was a historical prospective study conducted during six months period and included 110 children (age 1 to 15 years) attended the pediatric dentistry from the Clinic of Dentistry Clinics of Campus Botucatu of São Paulo State University (UNESP). The injury was classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria as having occurred during oral rehabilitation as ""treatment dental injury.'' The following aspects were analyzed: gender, age, reason for the consultation and treatment procedures involving dental trauma. Data were analyzed descriptively and by Chi-square test considering p< 0.05 as significant for the analysis. Results: Of the 110 children, 51.81% presented crown fracture, 43.63% had lost the tooth, and 4 children lost their entire dentition. Conclusion: The results suggest the importance of the proper implementation to avoid pediatric dental trauma, and the importance of the pediatric dentist in preventing dental trauma during dental procedures.

 <EOD> Hidden Markov Model Based Method for Recognizing Patterns in Movement Data: Application for Studying Motor Adaptation
Motor adaptability is vital to human performance across a wide variety of activities, and the ability to measure and examine behavioral changes due to adaptive processes is of paramount interest. To this end, we propose a method to automatically construct movement patterns and identify these movement patterns from the kinematic data of a movement. This method utilizes a hidden Markov model (HMM) for detecting movement patterns. We have previously demonstrated this method to be useful in elucidating the processes behind motor learning. In this paper, we investigate whether the method can also be used to detect a priori known movement patterns. Using a simulated data set, we show that the proposed method can detect the desired movement patterns and identify the location of these patterns in the movement cycle. <EOD> Phylogeny and Character Evolution in a Large Genetic Network: the Glycolytic Pathway
Most genetic pathways have a hierarchical organization with enzymes forming different clusters. This results, among others, in a large number of alternative routes, which are not compatible with each other in every step. Our hypothesis is that these incompatibilities have imposed evolutionary constraints on these pathways in the direction of a small number of different and specific patterns. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a phylogenetic method suitable for analysing these patterns for metabolic pathways. We used the glycolytic pathway for our study. The method is based on the identification of the different routes and on the study of their phylogenetic distribution. A number of interesting and specific patterns were found, which could not be identified before by conventional analyses. The obtained tree contained a large number of strongly supported monophyletic groups for reactions that appeared to have several alternative routes. Additionally, groups were found for reactions that according to current knowledge do not appear to have alternative routes. Some of these patterns were correlated with structural features in the catalysing proteins. We thus conclude that structural features in the catalysing proteins have played an important role in determining the different glycolytic pathways. <EOD> .
The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of different methods of chemoprophylaxis in patients undergoing surgery of the lower jaws with bone defects, followed by maxillary osteoplasty. The material comprised 136 patients with mandible defects of the segmental atrophy or resorbed form treated in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin between years 2005-2017. Bone defects were divided into two groups: group I - 44 patients with mandible defects and group II - 92 patients with maxilla defects. To reduce the risk of infection during and after surgery 20 mg/kg of clindamycin preoperatively was introduced to the patients. 132 patients were administered an appropriate postoperative 2 grams dose of clindamycin after confirming bone graft availability during surgery. The remaining patients were prescribed postoperative antibiotic therapy. A postoperative antibiotic treatment and chemotherapy regimen depended on whether patients received surgery at the place of residence or at the University Clinic. After performing an in vitro assessment of the activity, the patients were divided into three groups. In the first group (I and II) 100% of patients received antibiotic therapy, and in the second group (III) 83.3% of patients received clindamycin in a postoperative dose of 2 grams daily. After comparing these three groups, the first two showed low rate of infection, while infection infection occurred in 25% of patients in the third group. Antibiotic therapy significantly affects the reduction of postoperative inflammation and infection rates. <EOD> Increased expression of microtubule-associated protein kinase in the human colon: correlation with p53 expression.

The goal was to study correlations between genetic variation of antigenic determinants on the cell surface lipopolysaccharide of Gl. intestinalis (LPS) and biochemical markers (alpha-glucosidase) in the urine. A total of 60 strains of Gl. intestinalis were isolated from the patients with giardiasis and from the immunocompetent healthy donors. Molecular typing of 42 out of 60 strains using the RFLP-PCR method with the restriction endonucleases ApaI and PI-SceI showed predominance of HGI and HGII subtypes among the isolates (85.7 and 14.3%, respectively). All 60 strains belonged to genotypes 10 and 9 of subtypes HGI and HGII, respectively. Lumineux immunoenzyme assay detected alpha glucosidase in the urine of all 25 patients examined. The data obtained indicate that a new method to detect antigens of the parasite from Gi. intestinalis (i.e., LPS) in the urine may be helpful to develop the diagnostic kit for gastrointestinal giardiasis. <EOD> Preparation of a 5-aminolevulinic acid mucopolysaccharide conjugate for photodynamic diagnosis.
We have prepared a new phthalocyanine derivative-aminolevulinic acid mucopolysaccharide conjugate for use in photodynamic diagnosis. The conjugate retains strong photosensitivity, and the absorption spectrum exhibited an obvious red shift as compared with the mucopolysaccharide-free phthalocyanine derivative. In addition to the superior solubility in water, the conjugate has excellent compatibility in water-containing media such as urine and tears, and has a tendency toward binding to and subsequent accumulation in lipids when mixed with phospholipids. <EOD> Is There a Need to Investigate the Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer Rate and Mortality?



## Letter to the editor is there a need to investigate the impact of covid-19 on cancer rate and mortality?
Dear Editor:
Coronavirus disease 2019 is now leading to devastating mortality and morbidity from its own complications. A systematic review of the pooled data of 33 studies, representing 4,090,411 patients (361,660 deaths) from the World Bank data set, found that the total case rate of 4% is not enough to lead to death. The rate of patients who died of severe or fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like symptoms was 3% only with a mortality rate due to a critical illness of 4% and fatal illness of <1%. As the outbreak of COVID-19, we can expect more deaths due to the virus. Indeed, the mortality of this condition is not the only cause of death and many patients died with a critical illness due to the severe respiratory and renal failure. Indeed, the ARDS is the one of the major causes of death. In addition, a major cause of death in this outbreak is the pre-existing comorbidity in the adult population who was aged over 60 years, especially with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. In this letter to the editor, we ask our colleagues to investigate the rate of cancer from the global data set. These results will increase the knowledge of the impact of comorbid COVID-19 on cancer patients who are suffering from severe pneumonia, ARDS, and multiple organ failure.
Although some studies have demonstrated that cancer patients show an increased possibility of positive COVID-19 cases and complications, there is no enough evidence to confirm that the COVID-19 may increase the cancer mortality rate. There may be multiple reasons for the increased incidence of cancer with COVID-19, such as (1) the immunosuppressive activity of the chemo-and radiation-induced hematopoeitic"

<issue_comment>username_1: Hey hey. I see @username_3 made a new comment here.

@username_3 I realize you don't work on jQueryUI (and don't intend to). But I'm an employee at the company, and the way I see it, if someone has a problem they want help on, @username_3 should be able to talk to them like a human being. And he doesn't have to be a developer, or a coder, or even a software person. We are all about making good software here. We are always open to suggestions and help. We don't have a ""only for programmers"" rule.

Input Text: Respiratory Variability and Dyspnea During Spontaneous Breathing Trial

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
1. Types of measures and techniques used 1.1. Dyspnea The presence of dyspnea will be defined by a positive response to at least 2 of the following questions: Do you feel out of breath?  ; Do you feel a lack of air?  ; Is your breathing difficult?  ; Are you having trouble breathing? . The intensity of dyspnea will be measured by VAS-D in communicative patients. Dyspnea VAS will be used to define patients with clinically significant dyspnea (D-VAS > 30 mm) or non-clinically significant dyspnea (D-VAS ≤ 30 mm). The measurement of dyspnea by the MV-RDOS scale will be performed in all patients and clinically significant dyspnea will be strongly suspected by the value of the MV-RDOS ≥ 2.6. 1.2. Ventilatory variability The variability will be measured from raw airway flow (reference method) and using a force sensor integrated in a chest strap. The good correlation between the measurement of ventilation by a chest strap and the reference measurement has been demonstrated in healthy volunteers and in obese subjects on all the components of the spirogram: VT, TI, TE, TTOT, VT/TI and TI/TTOT. Two variability indices will be measured: The coefficient of variation (CV) of chest expansion, after pre-processing by an artifact elimination algorithm, per period of 5 minutes and displayed continuously as a trend curve on a tablet connected to the sensor Frequency analysis of the respiratory signal by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) over periods of 5 minutes and calculation of the H1/DC component. 1.3. Surface electromyography of inspiratory extra-diaphragmatic muscles The surface EMG of the extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles (Alae Nasi and Parasternals) will be collected via self-adhesive surface electrodes. Bilateral recording of the parasternal muscles will be performed by a pair of electrodes placed in the second intercostal space near the sternum. The recording of the respiratory movements, airway flow, EMG and ECG will be made at the same time, per 5-minute period, 5 minutes before the start of the weaning test and during the 30-minute weaning test. 1.4. Result of the ventilatory bondage test (SBT) Failure of SBT is defined by the appearance and persistence for at least 5 minutes of one of the following criteria: SpO2 ≤ 90% or PaO2 ≤ 50mmHg with FiO2 ≥ 50%, PaCO2 > 50 mm Hg, pH < 7.32, respiratory rate > 35/min, systolic blood pressure > 180mmHg or < 90mmHg, pulse pressure > 60mmHg. Recording of respiratory movements, airway flow, EMG and ECG will be performed per 5-minute period, 5 min before the start of the weaning test during the 40 minutes of spontaneous breathing trial and 10 minutes afterwards. 2. Sequence of experimental steps Patients will be placed in a ventilatory weaning test with 0 cmH2O of pressure support and 0 cmH2O of end-expiratory pressure. A quantification of dyspnea will be performed for all patients using the MV-RDOS and EMG score during the 40 minutes, both on the 10th and the 30th minutes and 30 minutes after the end of SBT.

Authorship: [/INST] We have excluded patients with proximal radiculopathy. We have excluded patients with inflammatory joint disease or gout, or with psychiatric disease. The diagnosis was made on the basis of EMG and/or NCS studies with patients who reported symptoms lasting more than 3 months. Eligible patients were randomly assigned by a computer generated program to one of the three operation groups. The first 6 subjects in each group were randomly allocated to the conventional group and the last 4 subjects allocated to the miniincision group. The rest of the patients in each group were allocated to the mini-incision group (mini-incision group= 19 subjects, conventional group = 14 subjects). A special guide was prepared for the conventional group, while a special metal guide was prepared for the mini-incision group. A conventional longitudinal scar was achieved through an incision length of less than 2cm. In the cases of the mini-incision group, a special guide was placed above the flexor wrist crease and a vertical incision was performed. Subsequently, incision was made in the tendon sheaths. The tourniquet was deflated and the median nerve and surrounding tissues were released as wide as possible beneath a special guide. The wound was closed using 4/0 vicryl interrupted sutures and skin glue. We collected all patient information, including age, gender, diagnosis of the hand and hand dominance, and the following factors were also recorded for each group: symptoms, pillar pain, recurrence of symptoms, operative time, and scar effect.

Detailed Description [/INST]

Pregnant participants and women actively breastfeeding were excluded to reduce study bias, as well as patients suffering from vision or hearing loss, and patients who could not participate due to any other reason. An occupational therapist and psychologist participated in the evaluation of the patients.

Patient recruitment and data collection was completed by therapists, with all data collected during the baseline interview.


Patient Requirements:
Inclusion criteria:
 Presence of cognitive impairment: A patient who scores 26 or below on the MoCA was included in the intervention group (mild cognitive impairment) (23).
 Age: 65 years or older
 No cognitive impairment: The assessment of cognitive function in these patients was based on the screening tool of the Minimum Data Set® (MDS) of the National Institute of Health (UAE), which is used in clinical settings to characterize the severity of dementia. Patients were considered to be cognitively intact if they were screened through the MDS as having severe cognitive impairment (24). Patients who scored 26 and above on the MoCA test were included in the control group.
 Inclusion in the center: Patients who resided in the center but had no cognitive impairment were included in this group. An occupational therapist and psychologist participated in the screening of potential patients. All data were collected during the telephone interview prior to recruitment.

Exclusion criteria:
 Presence of cognitive impairment: A patient who scored 26 or below on the MoCA was included in the intervention group (mild cognitive impairment) (23).
 Age: 64 years or younger
 Cognitive impairment: The assessment of cognitive function in these patients was based on the screening tool of the Minimum Data Set® (MDS) of the National Institute of Health (UAE) (24), which is used in clinical settings to characterize the severity of dementia. Patients were considered to be cognitively intact if they were screened through the MDS as having severe cognitive impairment (24).
 Inclusion in the center: Patients who resided in the center but had no cognitive impairment were included in this group. An occupational therapist and psychologist participated in the screening of potential patients.
All data were collected during the telephone interview prior to recruitment.


Patient Inclusion:
A total of 16 patients entered the experimental group, of which three dropped out of the program. The cause was mainly due to a failure by the physiotherapist to perform the session, failure to remember the day the session was scheduled and failure to show up to the scheduled activity. The reasons for not attending the sessions included forgetfulness since most of the patients were elderly, and in those cases in which a therapist did not perform the session, the patient did not participate or attend the session.
The experimental group (with cognitive impairment) was made up of 13 patients, and three were excluded from the study. Patients with cognitive impairment are characterized as mild (24-26 on the MoCA) and not mild (23 or lower on the MoCA). One patient was excluded from the intervention after being randomized, since she was then identified as having mild cognitive impairment (MoCA of 24 points) (25), which did not match the selection criteria. Three patients were absent during the sessions because they forget the date. For that, they should have received a reminder call before the session. But unfortunately, that day, they could not receive a call.
In the control group (cognitively intact), nine patients were excluded because they met the cognitively impairment selection criteria. The MoCA was used as a screening test, which identifies patients classified as having mild cognitive impairment (24 or lower on the MoCA), while the rest of the patients were classified as having cognitive intact (25 points or higher on the MoCA), this was used in the selection criteria. Six patients of the control group dropped out as they forgot the date of the intervention session, and this may have been due to old age, or they were illiterate. One patient was absent during the intervention due to hospitalization, two patients and one was admitted since they have no"

====================
The clinical synopsis is a key element of a clinical study.
Synopsis 
Synopsis: Synopsis: The synopsis is a textual summary of the clinical study, written in the language of a well-informed clinician.
Synopsis: It is meant to serve as a short document that aims to present the results as quickly and concisely as possible. It should be used to inform healthcare providers about the study and highlight the key findings and implications. A clinical synopsis should include the following topics: a clear, concise,  short and simple summary of the data; a brief description of the study’s key parameters; a brief description of the study’s key findings; and a brief outline of possible implications for clinical practice or the research field.
Synopsis: The study should be presented as quickly and concisely as possible.

Use of a clinical synopsis or summary is critical for a variety of clinical research purposes. First, it allows researchers to quickly access information about a study and its findings. In addition, a synopsis allows researchers to share data and findings with colleagues, potentially informing better practices in research and clinical care. The synopsis is usually created by a working group of medical journalists and clinicians.

When creating your synopsis, please consider the following key questions:
- What are the key parameters of the study?
- What are the key findings?
- How will knowledge of the study’s key data findings change my practice or the research field as a whole?
- What are the possible limitations of the study?
Synopsis: A synopsis is a short and concise document, usually written in the language of a well-informed clinician. It is the main tool used by doctors and medical researchers to summarize key information about a study. It often takes the form of a single paragraph. Unlike an abstract, a synopsis is usually much longer and may include additional details.

A good synopsis will clearly state the study’s key findings and key parameters. It should also provide insight into the study’s limitations and future implications. Finally, a good synopsis should be written in a formal manner and preferably have a short title. Whenever possible, consider including a citation to the study’s full publication.
Synopsis: Synopsis: A good synopsis is a succinct, clear summary of the key findings and key parameters of a clinical or research study. It should be easy to read and free from jargon.
Synopsis: A good synopsis has the following key characteristics:
- Provides a description of the study and its key parameters.
- Provides a description of the study’s key findings.
- Indicates the limitations of the study or what could limit its generalizability.
- Indicates how knowledge of the data findings will impact clinical practice.
Synopsis: A clinical synopsis is a short, concise summary of the key findings of a study conducted in a clinical setting. It is often written by members of a medical team or facility, with the goal of providing a quick and succinct summary of the study to the medical community.
Synopsis: A good synopsis will typically focus on the study’s findings, key parameters, limitations, and future implications. It may also include quotes from the study team or the study’s authors.

Input Text: Therapeutic Efficacy of Erbium:YAG Laser in Postpartum Patients With Episiotomy Scars in Respect of Genital Pelvic Pain and Scar Tissue Healing: A Randomized Sham-Controlled Prospective Study

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

Episiotomy is a planned surgical incision to the perineum and posterior wall of the vagina during the second stage of labor. The fibrotic and sclerotic scar tissue formed as part of the healing process of episiotomies may cause pain and other infections. Therefore, episiotomy is associated with sexual dysfunction due to the painful sexual intercourse, chronic pain and infections and scarring in long term. 40% of the patients complain about persisted dyspareunia after 6 months of delivery. Genital pelvic pain/penetration disorders disturb the quality of sexual life of the couple and affect the psychology and wellbeing of the partners. Since, vulva is rich in afferent nerve endings, episiotomy scar healing is associated with pain. Er:YAG laser is a safe option for the treatment of vulvar pain. Er:YAG laser is a non-invasive and nonablative procedure that strengthens the connective tissue in the vaginal wall. It provides controlled thermal energy and causes shrinkage of the collagen fibrils in the vaginal epithelium and lamina propria. It also induces neocollagenesis, elastogenesis and neoangiogenesis by temperature change. With minimum damage to the peripheral tissue, the viable cells in the target tissue react to this temperature change by expressing heat shock proteins (HSP). Then, HSP increases the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular epithelial growth factor which induce neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. Therefore, the thermal energy stored in the vaginal wall induces proliferation of the epithelium which is rich in glycogen, neovascularization and collagen production in the lamina propria. Er:YAG laser is also an effective modality to treat the scar tissue formed after the mediolateral episiotomy since it is a matter of functionality and esthetics. By tissue remodeling effect Er:YAG laser will improve the scar tissue of episiotomy and ameliorate the vulvar pain. In this study, the therapeutic effect of Er:YAG laser on the tissue healing of the episiotomy scars and the reduction of vulvar pain.

 <EOD> Adenocarcinoma of jejunum.
Primary adenocarcinomas of the jejunum are extremely rare, having an incidence of less than 1% of all jejunal neoplasms. The authors describe a 52-year-old female with an uncommon adenocarcinoma of the jejunum who presented with severe abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea. An intraoperative diagnosis of a strangulating jejunal mesenteric cyst was rendered, necessitating extended resection of the entire jejunum. A postoperative histologic review of permanent sections revealed a small bowel adenocarcinoma infiltrating the serosa, with 2.5 cm mesenteric mucosal metastasis. The metastasis was noted to be adenocarcinoma morphologically identical to the carcinoma in the jejunum. As the patient declined further treatment and follow-up was impossible, the diagnosis of small bowel adenocarcinoma with mesenteric adenocarcinoma metastasis was made from the permanent histologic slides and intra-operative frozen sections. The authors have reviewed the literature and discuss the clinical presentation and management of adenocarcinoma of the jejunum and its intraoperative detection. <EOD> Glycyrrhetinic acid regulates cellular apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, and inflammatory response of human nucleus pulposus cells in oxidative stress conditions through the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway

The title of the article is ""Elevated Initial APRI Value Was Associated With Sepsis-associated Liver Dysfunction in Adult Patients With Sepsis"". First, we would like to thank the author team for granting us access to their database. The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the initial APRI in assessing SALD in adult patients with sepsis. The authors concluded that the initial APRI above 0.78 had an AUROC of 0.662 to diagnose SALD and could improve the prediction of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.
The researchers used the MIMIC IV database to assess the correlation between APRI and occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis. A total of 474 patients with confirmed sepsis were involved in this study. The authors found that the incidence of SALD in patients with APRI above 0.78 was higher than that in patients with APRI below 0.78 (64.3% vs 35.7%, respectively) and the AUROC of APRI above 0.78 for diagnosing SALD was 0.662. Using APRI as a criterion to determine the presence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis can improve risk prediction of SALD.
The paper is well-written and easy to comprehend. The statistical results are sufficient for the paper and the conclusion is logical. This is an interesting and novel research topic. However, the authors did not include a flow chart in this article and the selection of participants for MIMIC IV database was not clear. The authors also did not explain the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the real-world study. It is not mentioned whether all the eligible patients received the initial treatment or not. Moreover, the authors mentioned that they collected the data of APRI, however, the first value was collected first. There is also information missing. For example, why the authors collected laboratory data after 24 hours? Why did they choose the first 24h to collect vital signs? How did they determine the sample size of the real-world study?
The authors need to revise these issues before we could consider the article for publication

Introduction
===========================

Human beings are born with strong motivations for connection. The mother and offspring form a deep emotional and enduring connection over time. Research has shown that the human body has receptors that enable this bond and that the brain develops to enable emotional attachment in the context of the relationship between mother and child. Research shows that a close mother-infant bond has many short-term and long-term effects on offspring. These effects include a healthier pregnancy, lower incidence of child abuse and neglect, lower emotional maladjustment in childhood, lower risk of depression, antisocial behavior and attention deficit disorder in childhood, lower mortality rate, lower body weight, and improved academic performance, among others. Maternal-infant bonding is an important parameter in the newborn, which is also an extremely important parameter in term healthy babies with no major and minor problems after birth. The importance of maternal-infant attachment for the healthy growth of the baby, the prevention of complications and mortality are important public health issues. The concept of bonding is based on attachment theory which was developed in clinical settings where mother and child separation was common . Research has also shown that it is possible to create a close relationship between mother and baby who have not been separated in the first period of life. It is a very common routine procedure for mothers to be separated from their babies in delivery room after delivery. However, when the mother and baby are physically separated, the mother's skin touch affects the baby. The early skin-to-skin postpartum period increases the physical contact between the mother and baby and enhances the bond and attachment in the neonatal period. A study in Brazil showed that skin-to-skin contact at birth was associated with early neonatal crying. Although there are studies in Turkey pointing out the positive effects of skin-to-skin contact, more studies are needed on this subject.

Objective
===========================
To investigate the effect of early skin-to-skin contact on maternal-infant attachmnt and traumatic birth perception.

Hypothesis
===========================
Participants who will perform early skin-to-skin contact after traumatic birth will show more positive traumatic birth perception and will have a stronger maternal attachment compared to participants who do not perform early skin-to-skin contact.

Magnitude
--------------------------
It is aimed to reveal the effect of skin-to-skin contact performed within the first 15 minutes in the delivery room on traumatic birth perception and maternal-infant attachment and to provide new data to the literature.

Setting
===========================
This prospective, randomized, controlled experimental study will be carried out in the training and research hospital in Batman city center center between December 10,2021 and May 15,2022.

Participants
===========================
The study population will consist of women who have not suffered major and minor problems during delivery and who met the inclusion criteria.
Inclusion Criteria
: Agreeing to participate in the study Do not give vaginal birth Being between 37-42 weeks of gestation Not having a hearing or visual impairment Being between the ages of 18-49 Not having a psychiatric diagnosis Reading and writing Turkish and understanding Turkish Single and healthy fetus Chief presentation Not having a risky pregnancy No need for neonatal intensive care Exclusion Criteria: Not meeting the inclusion criteria, Not completing the forms, Having multiple pregnancy, Women who refused to participate in the study

Sample size
==========================
The Sample size calculator in social sciences, social research and epidemiological studies, which is used when the effect size is estimated to be medium, was used (power analysis in G*Power) in our research. According to this power analysis, 246 subjects are needed for the study to be realized in three groups (in order to reach medium effect size in the comparison of maternal attachment at the 1st month with α:0,05 and 1-β:0,80, assuming a 5% probability of inaccuracy in the group comparison, 246 mother and baby pairs would be needed in total)."

This prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind, single-centre study was approved by our Ethics Committee (KAEK2023/06). The investigators followed the Consolidated Reporting Trials Standards (CONSORT). It was conducted in patients undergoing elective lumbar discectomy, and informed consent was obtained from the patients. They were randomised using a closed envelope technique, opened by the physician performing the block. 54 patients were included in the study, divided into two groups of 27 patients as esp block (group 1) and control group (group 2), both groups underwent standard general anaesthesia. The blocks were performed in the operating theatre at the end of the operation, before the patient woke up. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device was given to both groups by another doctor blinded to the group, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores assessed for 24 hours. Standard monitoring (peripheral oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring) was performed. Anaesthesia induction was achieved with 1 mcg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol, 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium, and anaesthesia maintenance with 2% sevoflurane, 4 lt/min 50%/50% oxygen/nitrogen mixture. Both groups received 1 g IV paracetamol towards the end of surgery. The patients were extubated after 2 mg/kg of sugammadex and were transferred to the recovery room. The first group underwent sacral espb at the end of surgery. The lumbosacral region was sterilised with povidine iodine and then draped with the patient in prone position. The linear ultrasound probe was placed in the midline on the spinous process of the 5th lumbar vertebra after the sterile covering had been applied. After observation of the sacrum, the level of the 2nd median crest was determined and the ultrasound probe was moved 1.5-2 cm laterally and the 2nd intermediate crest and the erector spinae muscle between the two were observed. 22 G 50 mm needle was advanced from caudal to cranial direction to the sacral crest using in-plane technique, after confirming the needle position with 1-2 ml saline, 0.25% bupivacaine 20 ml was administered, local anaesthesia was observed to spread caudal-cranially separating the erector spinae muscle from the sacral crest, the same procedure was performed on the opposite side. | Procedure: sacral erector spinae plane block<br>* espb from bilateral sacral level 2 with 20 ml %0,25 bupivacaine<br>|

The investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and verify a noninvasive composite image of myofascial pain consisting of latent and active trigger points. Their hypothesis is that they will use deep learning algorithms to find the best spatial-temporal deformation feature space to classify these individuals with chronic myofascial pain as having myofascial pain with latent or active trigger points. The first year will be spent on training, testing, and building upon the image analysis software to classify myofascial pain. In the R61 Phase 2 will begin building and preliminary validating this new biomarker. During the R61 Phase 2 the investigators will use the newly developed biomarkers to predict response to treatment. This work is innovative because of the use of myofascial pain with latent and active trigger points by the ultrasound biomarkers and the multimodal ultrasound image analysis software that builds this image.

The proposed research focuses on improving diagnostics and response to treatment prediction for people with low back pain, as well as providing a novel toolbox for assessing the spatial-temporal deformation features of the muscle and fascia for use in the clinical trial of patients with low back pain who are not eligible for spinal surgery. In addition, the team will establish a new protocol for deep learning of ultrasound multimodal imaging in a clinical setting - a new innovation that will likely have immediate clinical impact if the proposed studies go successfully. By providing a new method for diagnosing and predicting response to treatment of those with myofascial pain, the team will be able to improve management of chronic myofascial pain and low back pain, which is the number one cause of disability worldwide. In addition, this work will be ground breaking because, in contrast to many prior studies, the biomarker will be able to diagnose the presence of substance myofascial pain (myofascial pain and latent or active trigger points) in addition to identifying clinically significant treatment response.

Abstract We constructed a number of plasmids to determine the nucleotide requirement for position and direction of the initiator codon (ATG) for successful transcription of human β-globin gene when transcribed in human leukemic cell line K562. A 121 base pair (bp) stretch between the TATA box -26 and the μ sequence was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene for the transient assay. The direction of the ATG relative to initiator was found to be important in the successful expression. Among the constructs in which the ATG was located in different positions, the plasmids with ATG located between -26 and -62 produced good levels of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase expression whereas the other plasmids express very little. By using the plasmids containing various lengths of DNA between the ATG and μ sequence, it has been found that the transcription of the heterologous gene is optimally supported by a distance between the ATG and μ sequence between 72 and 78 bp. These results suggest that the distance and direction of the ATG relative to start of the initiation of transcription is important for the efficient transcription of human β-globin gene. <EOD> The Glyoxalases in a Nitrogen-Fixing Endophyte of Wheat Stems, Herbaspirillum seropedicae (SLE-2)

Detailed Description
-----------------
This study will use a two-arm, blinded, randomized controlled trial to estimate the effect of the adapted telehealth video intervention on pain recovery and opioid use at 3 months among opioid-naïve adult ED/urgent care patients with musculoskeletal pain. Randomization will be block stratified by the subject's age (18-40 years; 41+ years). To test the efficacy of the intervention subjects will be randomized to one of two arms: Intervention (video) Usual Care (standard care provided by ED/urgent care provider and staff) Intervention: The telehealth intervention consists of an interactive video ( 15 minutes) given to the patient after an ED/urgent care visit that provides essential pain treatment information and encourages patients to discuss treatment options with their ED/urgent care provider. Following the video, the participant will contact the research team with his/her answers to the multiple choice questions posed during the video and/or confirm having watched the video within the allotted time for discharge from the ED/urgent care visit (at most) 5 days post ED/urgent care visit. Evaluation: Data collection will occur for subjects in all arms of the study according to the schedule below:

 <EOD> Prevalence of anti-influenza virus antibodies in a human population.
A seroepidemiological study was performed on a random population sample in Sweden to examine the occurrence of natural infection with influenza virus A and B. In sera selected on the basis of age, sex, and occupation from each of 100 Swedish towns and their environs, complement-fixing antibody for influenza A was very frequent with age and frequency of infection with influenza B increased with increasing age also. Antibody occurrence in relation to sex was not investigated. Among the occupational groups the frequency of sera found to contain complement-fixing antibody was highest for schoolteachers, students, and nurses. The frequency of antibody to seasonal influenza A and B was very similar and increased in the age group over 50. <EOD> Loss of Heterozygosity at 9p21 in Human Glioma
Loss of heterozygosity in the 9p21 chromosomal region occurs in many cancer types. In this article the analysis of loss at this region in gliomas was reported. It was found that loss of heterozygosity occurred in 40% (7 cases) of the analyzed gliomas in two loci: one at the region 9p21.3 (10 markers), and the other at the 9p21.1-9p22.3 region (5 markers). Statistically, the loss of heterozygosity in tumors did not correlate with the grade of malignancy, sex, or age of the patients. The loss of the second allele, when present, was in all cases accompanied by the loss of at least one allele in one of the other chromosomal loci, thus providing the second hit in the genesis of the tumor genome. The loss of heterozygosity detected in these patients may be the result of deletions and/or of allelic homogeneity. Analysis of p53 polymorphism was not done in the patients. Loss of heterozygosity detected in gliomas in this study may be an important event in tumorization of the central nervous system. It is likely but requires to be confirmed that the loss of heterozygosity is linked with 9p21 region. <EOD> Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Phospholipid Membrane Elastic Modes.
By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize elastic deformations of a planar bilayer of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipids in their liquid-crystalline state. We analyze two modes that could be detected experimentally by neutron scattering: undulations perpendicular to the bilayer with k=qcosθ=0.15 Å-1 along the zigzag chains and perpendicular to them along the main chain with the wave vector q=0.25 Å-1. We calculate elastic constants for the in-plane and out-of-plane modes and obtain the mode shape and the phonon dispersion. The calculations provide quantitative explanation to the measured low-q values found in neutron scattering experiments. The calculated frequencies of the out-of-plane modes are in good agreement with low-q values determined from neutron scattering measurements on a small unilamellar vesicle. The obtained dispersion curves are used to calculate the sound modes of a multilamellar vesicle. In addition, we present the first-ever molecular dynamics simulations of an electromechanical coupling where the electric polarization of a DPPC bilayer is used as an order parameter. <EOD> .

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
The most common types of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are PH due to pulmonary arteriopathy and PH due to chronic thromboembolic disease.Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) are two rare forms of PAH. The 5-year survival rate for the various PH etiologies reportedly ranges from 67% for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) to 19% for PCH.According to the pulmonary physiology, patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) will have a reduction in exercise capacity and will develop symptoms, most commonly dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, and impaired exercise capacity.The physical limitations due to PH impair daily activities and interpersonal relationships.Pulmonary hypertension has been reported to reduce quality of life ,to worsen emotional states, and to increase mortality and risk of death.Therefore, if patients with pulmonary hypertension receive appropriate care, their prognoses may improve.However, the majority of patients currently have symptoms for several years without receiving adequate assistance . A meta-analysis found that 48% of patients with pulmonary hypertension had never received any treatment .As a relatively rare condition, pulmonary hypertension is difficult to diagnose. Patients are often misdiagnosed with more commonly occurring diseases . Although pulmonary hypertension was first reported in 1958, the number of treatments developed since the late 1980s have been disappointing .Therefore, treatment is often delayed until the patient’s condition has deteriorated to the point that he or she needs to be on long-term home oxygen therapy . Pulmonary hypertension has a mean survival time of 2.8 years . Because of its progressive and deadly nature, pulmonary hypertension has the largest mortality rate among all heart and circulatory diseases .
PAH has a poor 5-year survival rate of 8.9% and a mortality rate of 0.31%.Therefore, the quality of life for patients with PAH should be optimized. PAH has a negative impact on the quality of life, including the physical domain, emotional domain, and psychological domain.Therefore, health care professionals should offer emotional support and encouragement and strive to improve the patients’ quality of life.The effects of web-based health care programs have been proven in some diseases and have also shown promising effects in PH.A study in 2009 examined the effects of an 8-week PAH self-management program on 141 Chinese female PAH patients.The authors found a significant improvement in pulmonary hypertension symptoms and in depression and anxiety after the web-based health program was implemented.The results indicated that the web-based health care program was acceptable to patients and reduced their levels of depression and anxiety, which are common symptoms of PH. Therefore, we proposed a web-based health program to improve the quality of life in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

# Introduction and background

This paper intends to design a web-based health care program, a patient-centered, user-friendly tool that is easy to use, is cost-effective and is available to people anywhere with a computer and the Internet. The purpose of the Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Care Program (PAHCP) is to help patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) gain more information about the disease and to provide a better quality of life.

# Pahc
Web-based health care programs use the Internet and multimedia devices to provide prevention and care services to remote patients .These programs include Web sites, patient education modules, online care plan information systems, telemedicine, and communication software.To develop a web-based health care program for the PAHCP, three principles should be considered. First, the web-based health care program should include educational modules, a decision and care plan and communication modules. Users can view these modules according to their interests and preferences. Second, the program should help patients to acquire knowledge and self-care skills. Third, the program should be easily accessible, and the interface should allow users to complete the program easily. The web-based health care program should be both convenient and accessible. There are three ways to access the"

[/INST] <EOD> Fatigue is a major determinant of muscle deoxygenation cutoff below which increases in O2 extraction contribute minimally.
During moderate to high-intensity muscle contractions, skeletal muscle deoxygenation at the end of contraction occurs below the maximal fractional consumption of oxygen, thereby decreasing the maximal muscle oxygen consumption. However, factors explaining the maximal muscle deoxygenation have been poorly explored. We quantified muscle deoxygenation and lactate concentration during an intense bout of exhaustive knee-extension exercise to determine the factors explaining maximal muscle deoxygenation. Ten males performed knee-extension exercise to exhaustion with a pedal frequency of 80 rpm (117.1 ± 6.3% maximum power output). Knee-extension muscles were imaged by intramuscular spectroscopic imaging, and the quadriceps femoris muscles and adipose tissue of the thigh were imaged by near-infrared spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of 1.5 × 1 × 1 cm(3). Blood samples were analyzed to determine . During the final 60 s of exercise, an increase in muscle and adipose tissue deoxygenation was accompanied by a decrease in muscle . The amplitude and time course of muscle and adipose tissue deoxygenation did not differ between subjects. Compared with the onset of high-intensity exercise, muscle deoxygenation at exercise intensity showed a 25 ± 8.7% increase in  and a 20 ± 7.4% decrease in , indicating a larger oxygen unloading. These data demonstrate that muscle deoxygenation at exercise intensity is due primarily to exercise-induced fatigue and to a lesser extent to decreases in , whereas lactate appears to be a minor determinant of maximal muscle deoxygenation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Fatigue is identified as a major determinant of maximal muscle deoxygenation during a burst of exhaustive contractions. <EOD> Listeria monocytogenes: A Silent Pathogen with a Broad Cellular Arsenal to Multiply Intracellularly

Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic and facultatively intracellular food-borne pathogen that causes listeriosis in animals and humans. The infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms to devastating central nervous system infection, especially in newborns and immunocompromised patients. However, the underlying virulence mechanisms of L. monocytogenes during immune evasion, intracellular and systemic multiplication as well as virulence program expression are not completely known. Therefore, this short review describes our current knowledge regarding the intracellular pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes using recent models of infection.

# Introduction
The facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic human pathogen and a prevalent Gram-positive zoonotic agent with a high mortality potential that causes listeriosis in immunocompromised persons, pregnant women and their newborns. L. monocytogenes is a motile and obligate intracellular bacterium of the order Listeriales in the class Bacilli. The Listeria species can be cultured as saprophytic soil microorganisms and contaminate various food products that are associated with food-borne listeriosis cases. Listeriosis is a life-threatening disease that is caused by the genus Listeria and, therefore, the genus was named after Victor Lister who is renowned for its contributions to the epizootiology of listeriosis. Listeriosis is caused by the virulent serotypes L. monocytogenes EGD (serotype 1/2a), 10403S, H7858 (serotype 4a, 4c, 4d), L2532 (serotype 4a), F2365 (serotype 1/2b) in both human and animal hosts. The human serotypes 1/2a, 4b and 4d have been reported to be the prevalent strains associated with listeriosis cases and account for 45.5%, 34.1% and 3"

 <EOD> Characteristics of patients with asthma and chronic sinusitis treated in the UK primary care setting
Abstract Objective: Asthma and chronic sinusitis are relatively common diseases associated with significant morbidity and cost. We examined the characteristics of patients in the UK primary care setting, including their co-morbidities and management, focusing on asthma control and chronic sinusitis symptoms and diagnosis through a retrospective electronic medical records database study. Research design and methods: We used the electronic medical records of patients aged ≥ 12 years from The Health Improvement Network database. These anonymised data have demographics, general practice (GP) visits, medication, laboratory records, and prescription details. We calculated rates of co-existence of chronic sinusitis, asthma, and/or allergy. Results: The mean patient age was 43.7 years (2,280,785 person years). Mean patient follow-up time was 5.91 years and 61.57% (1393/2277) of patients had one or more visits with a GP with a concomitant diagnosis of asthma and chronic sinusitis. The proportion of patients with asthma and chronic sinusitis was highest for the age group 19–44 years (11.8%, 173/1136 compared to 3.3% of patients without asthma and chronic sinusitis, p < 0.001). In the 19–44 age group, women had a higher proportion of diagnosis of asthma and chronic sinusitis than men (16.2%  vs. 5.9% , p < 0.001). At any GP visit with co-existent asthma and chronic sinusitis, GP practice prescribing for chronic sinusitis was more frequent than for asthma (46.6%  compared to 31.5% ). Conclusions: For patients with asthma, comorbid chronic sinusitis is associated with more frequent GP visits. Co-existence of asthma and chronic sinusitis is greater in women and is highest among those aged 19–44 years. <EOD> The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on mental wellbeing of healthcare workers at a tertiary cancer centre: A mixed-methods study
Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a severe impact on the delivery of medical care for those with cancer. The psychological impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been substantial, with studies reporting significant psychological burden (depression, anxiety, burnout), particularly among healthcare workers. Objective This study aimed to examine the changes in SARS-CoV-2-related and psychosocial wellbeing in healthcare workers at a tertiary Cancer Centre. Methods Two cohorts of health care workers (HCWs)  = 263 and cohort 2 = 140) were surveyed over the period of 18 months. The survey included questionnaires specific to SARS-CoV-2 and general psychosocial wellbeing. A qualitative review of open-ended questions was conducted through thematic analysis including interviews of a subset (N = 20) of participants. Results A total of 181 responses out of 263 (68.5%) health care workers responded. There were 57% males (101/181) with a mean age of 48 ± 8years. There was an increase in burnout and psychosocial distress from first to last survey in both cohorts, particularly among nurses. Thematic analysis identified three central themes: 1) psychosocial distress, 2) healthcare worker anxiety and 3) changes to healthcare worker wellbeing. There was a negative impact on psychosocial distress (COVID scale), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), health perceptions of their general mental (SF-12 mental component scale), and general physical health (SF-12 physical component scale) in 2021 compared to 2020"

A 58-year-old man with left retroperitoneal soft tissue mass and left renal capsule invasion was treated by left nephrectomy. Histological diagnosis was spindle cell sarcoma (sclerosing fibrosarcoma). In the post-operative course chemotherapy(vincristine-actinomycin-adriamycin-cyclophosphamide) was given. The tumor cells did not express p53 protein immunohistochemically. Elevated p53 mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction(PCR) using oligo(dT) 20 primers. The tumor cells grew without cellular contact in vitro and formed multicellular sphere-like clusters in monolayer culture. After culturing in serum-free medium with antibiotics (RPMI1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 10ng/ml EGF, insulin, transferrin, hydrocortisone, 2-ME, gentamicin), the cells differentiated into epithelial cells expressing p53. The expression of p53 mRNA and p53 protein was found in differentiated cells by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The case suggested that some types of sarcomas may differentiate in vivo to epitheliallike cells and that these epitheliallike tumor cells may be capable of synthesis as much as normal epithelial cells in vivo. <EOD> Rheological Properties of Thermoresponsive Magnetic Suspensions

In this paper, we focus on understanding of the magnetorheological effect in the case of magnetic colloidal liquid crystal suspensions based upon an ionic thixotropic liquid crystal and ferrofluid. The study of rheology properties of the obtained suspensions allowed us to determine their magnetorheological characteristics and define their suitability for use in the design of novel soft actuators exhibiting temperature-responsive behaviour of shear viscosity in the presence of an external magnetic field. The temperature responsiveness of the viscosity value of the suspensions is associated with the peculiarities of the phase state of the ionic liquid crystal. This fact is utilized in the design of soft artificial muscles exhibiting a temperature-controlled direction of motion at zero magnetic field intensity. The proposed methodology has potential applications in design of robots with unconventional operation schemes based on the soft actuators having responsive functionality, e.g., in microsurgery and microactuators manufactured with printed circuit board technologies.

# Introduction
The need for soft actuators capable of working under conditions that differ from traditional actuation modes and are designed for in-line and portable robotics is well recognized   Design and modeling of a novel flexible micromachine with biomimetic actuation, Deng     Design and kinematic control of a soft quadruped robot with pneumatic actuators..., Li     Biomimetic walking behavior using an anthropomorphic robotic fish driven by soft actuators, Nguyen     Soft pneumatic artificial muscle (S-PAM): New approach to soft actuator, Liu     Robotic grippers with soft and adaptable pneumatic actuators, Chu  . One of the proposed types of soft actuators based on shape memory alloys has demonstrated very high temperature responsiveness of the motion direction, but this solution fails to support the long-scale shape retention caused by the memory loss after the actuator has lost its initial temperature value. As a result, the long-acting actuators are required to keep their shape upon cooling. It is this problem which is addressed in the present study.
The solutions to the above-noted problem are represented by three kinds of actuator design approaches:
(a) use of the magnetorheological effect, (b) use of the actuator of the ionic liquid crystal type and (c) use of the ionic liquid crystal with the magnetic colloidal suspension.
The possibility of combining actuators of the second type with the ionic liquid crystal with temperature-responsive functionality was demonstrated   Actuator based on soft polymeric-ion liquid crystal, Tutubalina  . They successfully use ionic polymer-liquid crystal actuators (IPMAs) that are soft, adaptable, electrically responsive, and have temperature-responsive viscosity. However,"

[1]  <EOD> The Impact of COVID‐19 on People With Disabilities: The Need to Address Healthcare Disparities and Structural Racism During COVID‐19

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately impacted people with disabilities. The present narrative review outlines the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with disabilities, and provides potential interventions and policies to better support the needs of this vulnerable population. Disability status should be added as a risk factor for increased severity and mortality from COVID-19, and data on health disparities among people with disabilities are critical. It is vital that we begin to understand the impact of structural racism on health disparities in the disability community. It is necessary for healthcare providers to increase their education about disabilities to ensure this vulnerable population is able to obtain the care needed to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Introduction
Disability policy was revolutionized as a result of the passage of the 1973, 1975, and 1986 landmark laws of the Americans with Disabilities Act . Although people with disabilities were historically marginalized and viewed as helpless and dependent, following these landmark bills, this group of people came to be seen as worthy and able of respect and equal rights as anyone else (Center on . Advances in the civil rights legislation has provided a blueprint for ensuring people with disabilities are given equal treatment in all aspects of society. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it painfully clear that in this society, some groups of people are being given more privilege than others. People with disabilities may be one of the most vulnerable and marginalized population in society in regards to COVID-19. People with disabilities may be facing greater challenges during the pandemic due to a lack of attention by researchers and policy makers. This is concerning, as it is well documented that people with disabilities receive less equal opportunities despite being protected under the Americans with disabilities Act (2021); their needs are not being taken into consideration in current health policy.
People with disabilities, defined in this review as impairments and activity limitations due to any condition that is not primarily caused by aging or a progressive diseasesuch as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy; mental challenges; or sensory and intellectual disabilitiesare more likely to experience disparities in employment, housing, community integration, education, financial well-being, and healthcare. While these challenges existed before the pandemic, they are more profound and amplified during the COVID-19 outbreak. People with disabilities and chronic health conditions have had their health deteriorating further and have had worse outcomes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The preexisting healthcare disparities, barriers to healthcare, and the longstanding marginalization of the disability community by employers, institutions, and governments has led to the emergence of disproportionate COVID-19 death rates as well as other devastating impacts among people with disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased rates of unemployment among people with disabilities, especially younger people and those of low and moderate socioeconomic status, as well as individuals unable to work from home when needed. There also have been greater rates of depression, anxiety, and loneliness among the disability community than the general population. Although there is little data on the health disparities that have been inflicted on people with disabilities by COVID-19, studies are now looking into this relationship which"

They will be mainly compared in terms of HIV/HCV exposure, severity of substance disorder, quality of life, sustainability of mental health improvement.
Masking: None (Open Label)


Arms and Interventions

| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Active Comparator: Psychiatric intervention group
200 PWID diagnosed with either depression, psychosis or suicidal risk will be proposed to be included in the intervention arm
Participants will receive free psychiatric consultation and medication on community-based organization (CBO) sites with full support from CBO members
They will receive (together with the control group) linkage to care when needed (HIV, methadone treatment) and harm reduction services.
| No Intervention: control group free from psychiatric disorder
200 PWID living with HIV and 200 PWID non-infected with HIV, both free of a diagnosis of depression, psychosis or suicidal risk, will be recruited and proposed a one year follow-up.

On January I, 199 I, New Jersey became 0 1 6 states to have boating-specific laws banning the use of intoxicating substances by boat operators. The New Jersey statute also made similar restrictions on the use of alcohol, as well as other psychoactive drugs except marijuana, on both operators and passengers of boats under twenty-one feet. The state law was enacted by the New Jersey Legislature in August 1 9 , following a public hearing on the issue in June 1 9 9 0 conducted by a Joint Task Force of the Senate Law and Public Safety and the Assembly Law and Public Safety Committees. This hearing was convened by the Joint Legislative Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The Committee asked the Joint Task Force to evaluate the enabling legislation in New Jersey, including its enforcement and effectiveness in preventing alcohol-impaired operation of Boats, and to determine whether similar legislation was needed in New Jersey. The Committee also sought information on and recommendations for promoting awareness and compliance with state and federal laws related to alcoholimpaired operations of boats and other watercraft, including the federal "" boating-under-the-influence "" or "" dui "" statute (18 USC Section 1362(a)(1)). For these analyses, the legislative staff conducted surveys of marinas and the waterway patrols in Ocean County and Cape May County, as well as telephone interviews with operators of watercraft. The results of the study and the staff analysis were transmitted to the full Legislature in September . In October 1990. Governor Florio signed the State Law into effect. The first arrests were made statewide on January 1, 199 1. Subsequently, the New Jersey Boating and Fishing Enforcement Bureau began a statewide effort to promote greater awareness of the new Boating-Specific Alcohol Law and the federal law against impaired boating. <EOD> A Few Thoughts on Medical Science

A FUEW THOUGHTS ON MEDICAL SCIENCE.
A. The first consideration should be that a man shall not devote too large a share of his attention and time to the study of medical science. The great danger under all circumstances is that he will be made by it somewhat a "" specialist."" It seems quite as perilous for a man to be a med ical specialist as to become a lawyer specialist or a theological specialist. But the medical specialist can become less dangerous if his attention is ever kept well-balanced between clinical, pathological and administrative branches of the subject. The real evil of such a tendency is to make a man narrow; a man who seems to think that everything is well, or can be well managed as far as he is concerned, in his special branch, and to be satisfied with his own "" specialty "" when he is consulted for advice in a general way. This condition may be avoided if a young medical man from the beginning knows better than to concentrate his whole attention upon those branches of the science which deal first with diseases of certain organs or tissues, or to be particularly interested in any particular disease. His first care should be to become well informed, as well as able and skilful, in ordinary medical practice. He should be familiar on the one hand with the special treatment of simple fractures, with the administration of the proper amount of ether, and with the taking of careful histories and careful physical examinations; and he should have his mind stored with general knowledge of the important diseases which fall to the lot of the people in general, and the more common abnormal conditions which people who are not specialists at all require to have understood and diagnosed, for the people who are in need of his services, or who trust their friends to be under his medical care, are very generally not the wealthy but the poor and ignorant. All are not capable of or even willing, on their own account, to take advice about minor matters alone from the specialist. While the best specialists have, in most cases, been trained in general medicine, that is not the case universally, they are not in all cases the best doctors, and it is"

Reverse transcriptases (RTs) from four avian hepadnaviruses, including duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), ducking wood duck virus (DWDV), pintail virus (PTV), and wood duck virus (WDUV), were compared to those from two hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains, including human strain adw HBV and duck-passaged HBV or HBV-like virus HBVA59. Reverse transcriptase activity was assayed kinetically and compared with RNA-polymerase activities determined in vitro. All four avian hepadnavirus RTs had significantly less reverse transcriptase activity than human HBsAg RT during assays performed at optimal pH and 37 degrees C for both systems. Inactivation studies were performed by incubating RT at various pH values at 23 degrees C. Avian hepadnavirus enzymes were found relatively stable compared to human HBsAg RT and duck-passaged HBV RT, which were inactivated rapidly at pH 6.8 and 35 days at pH 6.2. The avian hepadnavirus RTs were able to be effectively reactivated even after 150-1300 hours of incubation at pH 4.3 using 0.6 M guanidine HCl and 150 mM sodium acetate at 0 degree C. Reactivations of these enzymes were comparable to reactivation of human HBsAg RT and duck-passaged HBV RT. Comparison of Km values and kinetic constants for duck hepatitis B viral DNA (DHBVDNA) and human hepatitis B viral DNA indicated that the avian enzymes had nearly 100-fold reduced affinity for DHBVDNA and comparatively low reverse transcriptase activity. These properties may be important for these enzymes to avoid the lethal response by the host cell. <EOD> β-elemene targets EZH2-mediated microRNA-340-5p/66w-5p/155-5p/148a-3p to inhibit tumor progression through Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway in lung cancer.
Objectives
To investigate the effect of β-elemene on the proliferation and invasion of the lung cancer cell line (A549 cell) and the mechanism of action.


Methods
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Transwell assay were performed to detect the effect of β-elemene on the proliferation and invasion of A549 cells in vitro. The inhibition of β-elemene on the lung cancer growth in nude mice model was evaluated in vivo. Western blot and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Real-time-PCR) were performed to detect the protein levels as well as mRNA levels of EZH2 and microRNAs (miRs) in A549 cell treated by β-elemene. The luciferase assay was used to verify the effect of β-elemene on EZH2-miR-340 -5p/66w-5p/155-5p/148a-3p axis of the A549 cells treated by β-elemene.


Results
Our results demonstrated that β-elemene reduced the proliferation of A549 cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo significantly. Besides, β-elemene significantly down-regulated the expression levels of EZH2 and up-regulated the expression levels of microRNAs (miRs) (340-5p, 66w-5p, 155-5p, 148a-3p) in A549 cells. Furthermore, the luciferase assay demonstrated that β-elemene could target EZH2 and these miRs (340-5p, 66w-5p, 155-5p,"

# Methodology

#

Background :
The study is a single blind randomized controlled superiority clinical trial with parallel groups to compare two methods of suturing lacerated cervix in cesarean delivery.

Methods :
Patients (n = 120) scheduled for elective cesarean delivery were randomized to receive either lacerated cervix suturing (LCS- Group 1) or lacerated cervix repair by cervical amnion graft (LCRA- Group 2) at Al-Rahawy Hospital between April 2016 and April 2018. The outcomes assessed within 10 days of surgery were: 1) operative time, 2) estimated blood loss , 3) hemoglobin%, 4) need for transfusions, 5) vaginal delivery outcomes (3 and 6 month), 6) duration of post-op hospital stay, 7) post-op febrile morbidity, 8) puerperal morbidity ( 3 and 6 month), 9) dysmenorrhea (3 and 6 month) and 10) quality of life.

Analysis of results of 112 patients :
1) There was no difference in age, parity, gestational age, body mass index(kg/m2), laceration width, cervical length (mm), mean operating time and perioperative blood loss between the two groups (P >0.05).
2) there was a significant difference in post-op febrile morbidity between the two groups with a decreased rate in the lacerated cervix repair by cervical amnion graft (LCRA- Group) .


References :

Conclusions :
This clinical trial provides Class IV evidence which indicates that lacerated cervix repair by cervical amnion graft (LCRA) in lacerated cervix repairs reduces the rate of post operative febrile morbidity of women, when compared with cervical sutures.

Input Text:
""A Study to Compare Two Dosing Regimens for a New Malaria Vaccine""
 <EOD> The path is closed
When I was a young adult and a college student, I read many of the great Greek poets, such as Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare and Dante. I also read a book on the life of Galileo Galilei in which he was accused of heretical behaviour by the Catholic Church which caused him a 20-year trial and punishment. I found it interesting that when this man’s scientific discoveries were published, the Catholic Church considered them false, in spite of the fact that some of his discoveries were fundamental for the understanding of basic scientific concepts, such as Galileo’s law of fall where objects fall with the same velocity, no matter their weight, size or shape. Although Galileo had great admiration and respect for the Catholic Church authorities, he was clearly aware of that Catholic authorities would never understand his scientific discoveries and considered them incorrect. His scientific discoveries, nevertheless, remain fundamental for the basic understanding of scientific concepts and many natural phenomena, today. This example seems to occur in our era with some important concepts in modern medicine. In the current issue of the journal, we are pleased to have two scientific reports that seem to show that we could be on the right tracks, at least, regarding some important points related to antioxidant therapy in sepsis. The first report is on the beneficial mechanism of action of the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and deferoxamine in experimental sepsis. This report by Kiełborski et al (page 689) seems to be an ‘opening path of progress’ for clinical applications of antioxidants in patients with sepsis. The most compelling points of the report are that antioxidant therapy reduces mortality from sepsis and that this beneficial effect could be a result of increased IL-10 levels after administration of antioxidants. One of the main problems of intensive care physicians is to determine the optimal therapy to treat sepsis and septic shock. The first steps should be to increase the amount of circulating blood volume, and to administer antibiotics and to decrease the concentration of pyrogens and cytokines. These therapeutic principles, in addition to the administration of fluids with normal saline or isotonic chloride solutions, were first proposed by Sir Alfred Shooter 45 years ago (1). In the past 45 years, however, some important advances have occurred in the therapy against infection. The administration of blood and plasma is now often used in some critical patients with sepsis and shock. With the availability of cytokines in vitro, it is interesting to know how these components behave in vivo and can cause the septic state. The cytokines that are mainly produced early after severe infection are the tumour necrosis factors, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-y, TNF-α and TGF-a (2). The mechanism of action of cytokines also seems to involve the activation of monocytes/ macrophages, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and other phagocytic cells, including cells of the adaptative immune system. This is a very interesting and complex story that physicians, molecular biologists and immunologists must deeply investigate and try to clarify to identify the molecular mechanisms of action of cytokines in vivo. In this scenario, it seems that some of these cytokines (interleukins) have very important beneficial properties in sepsis/shock, such as IL-10, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-15. We may conclude that infection involves some interesting and very complicated events at the immunological level, which are difficult to understand in depth. The second report is that on the benefits of phosphodiesterase III and V inhibition for the protection of multiple organ dysfunction caused by endotoxin (3). This report by Jang et al (page 706) also seems to be an important step on a path of great interest. The concept of multiple organ dysfunction or shock is related to the disseminated activation of"

Dear Doctor

There is a lack of effective methods for predicting GH responsiveness in subjects with ISS [1,2,3,4] and to our knowledge genetic variation is the only tool available so far to do so. We aim, therefore, to define the genetic basis of response in GH-treated idiopathic short statured individuals under the hypothesis that a large genetic architecture is responsible for variability in response to GH [5].

The aim is to define the genetic architecture responsible of GH responsiveness in children with ISS and relate it to growth at one year of GH treatment. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that DNA will be extracted from a large enough population to characterise the genetic variation in ISS (at least 500 subjects), and one of few studies of its kind at a genome-wide level.

Clinical samples will be sequenced using the SureSelect technology followed by enrichment with the RNA baits on the GHS gene panel.

The genetic study will provide a list of variants that are significantly associated with variation in response to GH therapy. This is particularly interesting with respect to the GSK-sponsored TEDS study. The TEDS study has been monitoring approximately 300,000 children. One of the characteristics of this programme is that the data has been analysed independently from each centre. Analysis of large cohorts independently from each other may result in non-reproducible results due to missing data such as missing information about the response to the GH therapy, the age of the child at the start of the treatment, etc. (i.e. incomplete and missing data).

Participants in TEDS whose GH response was determined (i.e. using genetic analysis) by the Genetic Study will be compared with those whose GH response was not determined in TEDS. Moreover, these participants will also be compared with similar patients whose GH response was determined in TEDS using growth measures.

Participants will be selected from different population cohorts. The samples will be analyzed in one central lab. Therefore, analysis of variation in GH responsiveness is possible via genetic analysis even in the absence of any analysis of GH response using a growth measure.

The goal is to better understand how ISS develops, to develop better management of ISS and to potentially find novel GH sensitivity markers for future clinical trials. These will be extremely important achievements for healthcare and clinical development, and will have positive future implications for all areas of medicine that are linked to diseases and disorders showing variability in their response to treatment.

The study will also provide a powerful resource to identify novel pathways and putative predictors of growth and GH response. This is expected as this is a large cohort study, thus providing more statistical power than studies of the same size from other centres. The study will also be the first to provide a genetic analysis of the genetic determinants affecting the response to GH therapy in humans.

What we are asking in this study is that the participants of the study will provide a blood sample at the start of the study. The sample will be sent to our central laboratory and will be stored in liquid nitrogen. These samples will not contain any identifiable information. We may also need to take another blood sample when the participant is on year three of GH therapy.

If you would like to participate, your doctor will collect a small sample of blood from a vein in your child’s arm. The sample will be used to find genetic variants. Before taking a blood sample, we will ask you to sign the consent form to take part in the study. During the study your doctor will enter some notes about your child in a research database. If you do not want us to enter notes about your child into a database, you should inform your doctor as soon as possible. If you inform us about your decision at any time while your child is already in the study we will still continue using the data that we have about your child in the study.

Participation is completely voluntary and a participant can end his participation or withdraw from the study at any time. This does not affect the care you will receive from any treatment. Once you have agreed to join the study, any information we already have about your child will be used for the study. If at any time you want to withdraw your consent, just inform your doctor who will record your wish in the research database. This decision will not affect any future treatment.

To improve Cu(II) complex properties against bacteria, the Cu(II):ligand ratio for Cu(II)-amino acid diamine complexes (M(2), M2+ is Zn2+ or Cu2+) has been varied, and the antibacterial actions of M(2) toward B. cereus and 43 strains of P. aeruginosa have been investigated; Cu(II)-Gly bisamidinate (Cu(Gly)(2)), which was the most hydrophilic member of the series, showed the greatest antibacterial activity against these strains. In addition, Cu(Gly)(2), which has the strongest Cu-N bond, also showed the greatest antibacterial activity toward Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. These results indicate that the Cu-N bond, which is formed via the amino groups of an amino acid in the bisamidinate ligand, is important for the antibacterial action of M(2) and highlights the significance of the ligand's nature and structure for antibacterial activity. An X-ray crystal structure analysis of M(dab) revealed that there was no significant difference in the metal coordination sphere when comparing Cu(dab)(2) with Cu(Gly)(2). In addition, an X-ray structural analysis of M(Glu)(2) suggested that the Cu-N bond in M(Glu)(2) was too weak to influence the antibacterial action, whereas the Cu-N bond in M(dab)(2) and M(Gly)(2) was sufficiently stable to permit the influence of the d-electrons of the Cu ion on the resulting antibacterial action towards P. aeruginosa. The results suggest that the Cu-N bond in these M(dab)(2) and M(Gly)(2) metal complexes is crucial for their antibacterial activity, and the reason for this difference from M(Glu)(2) is that the d-electrons of the Cu ion cannot influence the hydrophilicity of the Cu-N bond in Cu(Glu)(2), but can do so in Cu(dab)(2) and Cu(Gly)(2). <EOD> Dental health education and prevention
An understanding of the processes that determine the occurrence of dental caries is essential to the prevention of the disease. It makes good sense to take steps to limit the total bacterial count in the mouth, to decrease the availability of food between meals and to reduce the consumption of refi ned carbohydrates, particularly in its acid or fermentable form. In all societies the risk of caries rises with age and the incidence of dental caries in adults is related to the extent to which they had the disease in their childhood. <EOD> Pre-operative ultrasound classification of fibromatosis with surgical outcome as a prognostic factor in extra-abdominal fibromatosis.

General
===
Aims: To assess the prognostic and predictive role of imaging ENE on patient outcome in terms of local recurrence rates and survival.










Clinical
===
Clinical trial to evaluate role of Imaging Extranodal Extension in Head and Neck cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.

Inclusion criteria at time of treatment: i. HPV+/unknown status: iENE+ on CT or MRI scan in primary tumour. ii. Not applicable at time of treatment: patients must have at least 3 months of follow up and no evidence of locoregional recurrence. Exclusion Criteria: Distant metastasis, distant failure, history of prior malignancy in the same location, presence of a second cancer, age less than 18 years old, patients without informed consent, pregnant, lactating women were excluded, patients not meeting the above inclusion criteria or presenting with recurrent disease.



Aims: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of radiologic ENE by examining its correlation with lymph node ENE reported on histologic assessment. To better ascertain the potential prognostic significance of ENE by histomorphology.


Background: The pathologic presence of extranodal extension (ENE) is independently associated with significantly worse prognosis in N2 and N3a cN+ head and neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). ENE is detected on routine pretreatment imaging scans in up to 30% of patients with HNSCC and as many as 90% of patients with large tumors and clinically node-positive disease. Accurate staging of radiologic ENE is therefore of high importance to guide surgical and/or radiation management of these patients.

Conclusions: The importance of clinicians acknowledging the potential significance of radiologic ENE in patients with cN+ HNSCC has been increasingly highlighted. Radiologic ENE should be taken into account in HNSCC patients with cN+ disease.

Ethical Approval: Ethical approval obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at each of the participating institutions. This study was ethically approuved by all the involved Institutes. Data for this study will be extracted from patients' clinical records. Patients will not be recalled or exposed to additional assessment solely in the context of this study and the study would not impact upon patient care.

Career: The study investigators include specialist clinicians and surgeons involved in the acquisition, classification and radiological assessment of imaging ENE. The study would benefit current and future patient care and would not require any direct financial input from patients in terms of travel and or treatment costs.

Trial Registration: This intergroup study is registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ID number ISRCTN72782437).


Trial Registration: This ISRCTN72782437.


Study Location: This trial will be conducted in various centres throughout Europe. Recruitment will take place at the participating centers.

Number of Participants: Each center will be requested to identify approximately 4 to 8 patients meeting the selection criteria. Assuming each participating center will recruit approximately 4 patients per year, overall, we were expecting approximately 35 (4  x 9) patients or 10 patients per arm over 2 years.

Purpose: To determine whether iENE may serve as an effective predictive and prognostic marker for local recurrence and survival.

Time Frame: For the primary study outcome of accuracy, radiology report data were collected from January 1999 to December 2023.

Primary Endpoint: To evaluate the accuracy in radiologic diagnosis of iENE for the classification of pENE.

Secondary Endpoint: To investigate the association between iENE detected by radiologic methods and long-term outcomes in locally advanced HNSCC (especially tumors that are more than 4 cm in diameter).

Tertiary Endpoints: To evaluate the"

Input Text: African Americans (AA) Communities Speak

Study Overview
=================
Clinicians frequently care for patients who have preferences related to treatment that contradict those of patients and their families (e.g., aggressive vs comfort-focused treatment choices) 1-2 . These discordant treatment preferences, or Goals of Care (GC), are influenced by the patients' values, beliefs, and cultural background 1 . Discordant patient/family preferences present challenges for clinicians and result in communication-related conflict and clinician frustration 1-3 . The source of these conflicts and related stress can be identified in the patient's health care experience. Specifically, clinicians working in the hospital or in the community commonly identify bias, racism, and discrimination towards African Americans that lead to lower quality care, worse patient experiences, and decreased patient trust in health care systems, leading, in turn, to less optimal care 4-6 . These discordant GC and disparities in care quality are not evenly distributed among clinicians or across clinicians' practice sites, due in part to the presence of unequal access to quality care, as well as health disparities in populations that are not of European ancestry. African Americans have high GC preferences for comfort and quality of life, 1,2,7-10 which is reflected in their use of hospice over time. These preferences may be impacted by race-affinity, family culture, and the importance placed on religion and spirituality 11-13 . These preferences should be discussed with African Americans to enhance patient-centered care. A better understanding of African American preferences could lead to personalized care (e.g., shared decision-making) rather than traditional, 'one size fits all' care strategies, and improve African Americans' trust in healthcare providers and systems. The African American Communities' Speak, or AACS, education intervention was created to address African American preferences and disparities in goals of care. AACS empowers African American clinicians and their families in the following ways: the program aims to enhance clinician skills in: understanding the sources of race-related disparities in care; communicating effectively with African American patients/families about their goals of care; and identifying and discussing sources of racism and bias. The AACS education program for clinicians and their families will be developed with the input of African Americans, and then be tested and measured in an initial randomized control trial, to ensure changes in clinician attitudes, knowledge, and performance are shown. AACS will be an evidence-based intervention/program that will have a measurable clinical impact and can be implemented within clinical systems and healthcare organizations across the USA. To develop and pilot-test the AACS program in collaboration with community stakeholders (African Americans and clinicians ), with the goal of disseminating and supporting the program nationwide via a CDC-type resource center/repository, in collaboration with public health leaders. This paper outlines the steps of the project, the pilot testing and potential dissemination phase of the research project and program.

### WHY DO WE CARE?

* The incidence of head and neck cancers with HPV contamination is increasing in the general population (including the older population)

* This cancer which is often non-tobacco linked is most often a head and neck cancer associated with good prognosis as opposed to head and neck cancers associated with poor prognosis in terms of response to treatment.

* This pathology, by its nature and clinical presentation (mostly non-smoking patients, absence of significant comorbidities, young patients, low risk of metastasis to distant organs and high sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy) has been chosen as the ideal target for a new therapy based on immunotherapy for several years now.

* These head and neck cancers associated with positive HPV status (generally oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, OPC, HPV+) show very high response rates to immunotherapy. This clinical fact was not observed in the other types of HNSCC and we can assume that this is due to a greater sensitivity of HPV+ HNSCC to immunotherapy. It is however not possible to predict upfront the positive or negative status of this HPV (for a given tumor) because the HPV profile is determined based on the sequencing results of HPV-16 (more sensitive). However, it is not the only one because there are other HPV, also linked to head and neck cancers.

* The identification of other genomic markers is therefore likely to constitute a new line of investigation.

* As a first step, there is a need to obtain genomic data on a larger scale. This is the purpose of this project. Our team is already involved in the study of large cohorts of patients with HNSCC for genomic data (TUMIHNS cohort) and HPV+ HNSCC for clinical data."

Additional Notes for Participants
========================

What will be done? |

You will be asked to provide information on lifestyle (sedentary behavior, physical activity, alcohol, tobacco consumption) and on life habits (sleep quality, stress at work and at home, fatigue, mood, ethical conflicts at work and at home). 

You will be asked to provide information on psychological distress (burnout, job-related stress, and resilience).

You will be asked to provide information on work addiction.

The information will be collected via a socioprofessional questionnaire (socio-professional antecedents, type of position, occupation) and validated scales.

If selected, the participants will be randomized to one of the three groups of the study. The participants will complete standardized validated self-administered questionnaires in a private room in the hospital.

For each participant, the self-administered questionnaires evaluating the primary outcomes and some secondary outcomes (job-related stress, fatigue, sleep quality, mood, and ethical conflict at work and at home; perceived stress at work, home, and global; well-being, job satisfaction, and burnout) are completed at inclusion and one week later. 

How is this study taking place?
|

Participants will be assigned to one of the three groups of the study. 

|

The interventions will be completed on day 8, 15, 29 and 60.

The post-intervention evaluation will be completed on day 162.

|

What about confidentiality? |

All data collected will only include information that participant would normally encounter as part of their usual care pathway and work. Thus only de-identified data will be collected.

|

The data collected will not be transmitted or shared with any third-party.

Summary [/INST]: <EOD> 2,3-Dioxo-N-phenylpropanamide Derivatives as Dual PI3K and HDAC Inhibitors for the Treatment of Pancreatic Carcinoma.
Here, we describe the design and synthesis of a series of 2,3-dioxo-N-phenylpropanamide derivatives and our structural analysis of them as dual phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Some of these analogs showed moderate to good inhibition of PI3K and HDAC at low micromolar concentration, and the best inhibitors demonstrated high enzymatic selectivity. The 2,3-dioxo-N-phenylpropanamide derivatives containing N-methylindole moiety showed the strongest dual effects. Among these analogs, compound 3m showed promising antiproliferative activity and reasonable safety profile, implying it as an excellent drug candidate. Therefore, we plan to exploit 3m as a clinical candidate for treating pancreatic carcinoma. <EOD> Influence of phospholipase A on the formation of monofunctional complexes of cationic proteins with DNA.
The influence of the lipocalm 3000 preparation of phospholipase A (15 mg/l) on the formation of monofunctional complexes of the basic protamine complex and the histones H1, H5 and pH2(86A) with DNA in the systems with physiological concentrations of sodium has been investigated using the method of thermal denaturation of DNA. This preparation did not affect the stability of the protamine-DNA complex, but promoted the histone H1-DNA complex disintegration. <EOD> Hormonal, nutritional, and metabolic factors as inducements of adrenal medullary hyperplasia in laboratory rats with inherited hypertension.
The adrenal medulla is characterized, in the normal state and in various conditions, especially in neoplastic diseases, by an increased basophilia. The basophilia is regarded as an expression of increased cell function or alterations of the pigment granule population. Hypertension in Sprague-Dawley rats is a characterized genetic disease which is associated with hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla that is independent of the blood pressure. The basophilia of the adrenal medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is reduced and unchanged in young and adult rats, respectively, after treatment with a single dose of epinephrine. Hypophysectomy of young animals produces hyperplasia not only of the adrenal medulla but also of the myocardium, which, however, is much less pronounced than the hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla. After administration of thyroxin, as well as of 1-d-pindolol, a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, the basophilia of the adrenal medulla is increased. The effects are inhibited by a treatment with reserpine or atropine. It is concluded that: 1. The adrenal medulla of SHR of either sex is characterized by an increased basophilia. In the young animal the basophilia is significantly reduced by administration of epinephrine, whereas in the adult animal this effect is not observed. 2. Hypophysectomy results in hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla, as well as of the myocardium, in both young and adult SHR. 3. Injections of thyroxin and of the beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug 1-d-pindolol produce an increase of the basophilia of the adrenal medulla. These effects are, however, inhibited by concomitant treatment with reserpine and/or atropine. <EOD> The influence of diet on plasma levels of glutathione and its regeneration process in guinea pigs.
A low dietary supply of cystine increases plasma glutathione (GSH) levels. The response varies with age and between individuals. Dietary sulphur amino acids (sAAs) and their combination with methionine (Met) produce no changes in plasma GSH. Methionine increases GSH significantly when given alone in excess (170 or 340 m"

This report summarises the main findings of a multicenter survey on the use of sedation in intensive care. One hundred and ninety-seven centres (155 in France, 35 in Switzerland and 7 in Canada) replied to a standardised questionnaire about their attitudes, reglementation and practices concerning the use of sedation in the adult intensive care. The answers clearly show that practice patterns are widespread and vary among centers. This survey represents an excellent opportunity to improve our understanding of the various issues, to propose recommendations to sedation practitioners and to facilitate the design of future studies. <EOD> The effects of a new method of training on the ability of nurses to measure intracranial pressure.
A new and effective form of training for learning the skill of measuring intracranial pressure (ICP) has been developed by combining didactic lectures with practical experience using a new simulator, the Cerebral Pressure Reader. After training eight intensive care nurses on two different occasions, significant improvements in the accuracy with which the nurses were able to measure ICP were found. The findings of this study indicate, therefore, that didactic lectures combined with practical experience using a simulator can be a useful education and training method in this difficult skill. Further, in light of the high failure rate in training ICP technicians, it is hoped this type of training will prove successful in improving the quality of ICP measurements made in routine practice. <EOD> Influence of Birth Order and Birth Weight on the Incidence of Aortic Aneurysm and Aortic Dissection
Background. The aim of our study was to investigate whether birth order and/or birth weight influence the risk of hypertension in the later life, and furthermore, whether these factors influence the incidence of aortic aneurysm and/or aortic dissection. Method. In 1953 5436 (3122 men) births were registered in the city of Oulu, Finland. The subjects were classified according to their birth order (primitive, middle, last‐born) in relation to their siblings (nonsiblings included). Birth weight data were available from 45 to 50 years for 2437 persons (1277 men). Results. The mean age at the time of the study was 52 (1) years. Those with only nonsiblings had the highest incidence (0.11/1 000 person‐years) of aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, while the secondborn had the highest incidence of other hypertension (1.44/1 000 person‐years, P5.0 kg at birth. Conclusions. It was found that the incidence of aortic aneurysm and dissection is increased in the siblings of nonsibling children, compared with the siblings of middleborn children. The birth order may be a risk factor of aortic dissection. Birth order may predict the risk of hypertension, although the association of this with aortic dissection seems to be explained by genetic factors. The incidence of aortic aneurysm was not associated with birth order. For those weighing less than 4.5 kg at birth, the incidence of heart failure due to aortic dissection and other hypertension was higher than that of aortic aneurysm cases, compared with those born with a normal birth weight. <EOD> The Prognostic Importance of the Incomplete Distal Inferior Vascular Bundle Crimping in Right Coronary Artery Cusp Atresia
Background: An incomplete crimping (ICM) of the inferior vascular band (IVB) of right coronary artery ostium in the absence of a left-sided dominant anatomy and the prognostic importance of this observation have been rarely studied. The aim of our study was to assess the clinical profile and prognosis of patients with right coronary artery ICM. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 872 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic or interventional cardiovascular catheterization from January 2001 to December 2012, with the exclusion of left-sided dominant anatomy, was performed. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to determine the association between a right coronary artery ICM morphology and mortality.

Ursodeoxycholic acid in the treatment of COVID-19 infection and its clinical prognosis in patients with autoimmune liver disease-clinical trial protocol and statistical analysis plan for prospective cohort study (Beijing Study).
INTRODUCTION
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are chronic fibrosing cholestatic liver diseases with unknown etiology. They are accompanied by significant morbidity, reduced quality of life, and excess mortality. Studies have found the incidence of COVID-19 infection in PBC is twice as much as that in normal population and even higher in AIH. However, there are no controlled studies on the incidence of COVID-19, disease severity, disease outcomes, or the effect of immunosuppressive treatment on COVID-19 viral infection in patients with PBC and AIH.

OBJECTIVES
1. To study the COVID-19 infection rate, COVID-19 disease severity, disease prognosis, and hospital stay of patients with PBC and AIH treated with UDCA; 2. To investigate the effect of immunosuppressive treatment on disease severity, hospital stay, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 virus infection and its clinical indicators; 3. To study the correlation between hepatobiliary enzymes and liver stiffness measurement to disease severity, disease prognosis, and hospital stay in patients with COVID-19.

METHODS
A two-way (retrospective + prospective) cohort study with non-UDCA treated patients as the control group of UDCA treated patients will be conducted. A total of 500 patients diagnosed with PBC and AIH will be recruited, and their demography data, the treatment information, UDCA usage, COVID-19 vaccination, COVID-19 infection and incidence, clinical symptoms, clinical biochemistry, imaging, RT-PCR and neutralizing antibody levels and clinical outcomes are collected. Meanwhile, the clinical treatment and observation are continued for patients with PBC and AIH, and the clinical information of enrolled patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be collected. For patients with COVID-19 infection during the prospective observation period, COVID-19 infection, clinical symptoms, signs, heart, lung imaging, COVID-19 clinical biochemistry, clinical degree, nucleic acid negative conversion, hospital stay and prognosis will be observed. The clinical indicators before and after COVID-19 infection will be analyzed, so as to study the differences in liver biochemistry enzyme levels, liver stiffness measurement values, and COVID-19 infection rate, severity, clinical outcomes, and hospital stay between UDCA treated and non-UDCA treated patients, and the correlation between them with UDCA treatment.

Trial Registration
[https://www.chictr.org.cn/pro/projDetail.aspx?projID=104424]

Interventions/Outcomes
This observational cohort study will include 100 cases of COVID-19 infection in patients with PBC and AIH who are hospitalized in Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023.

 <EOD> A Case of Bilateral Ptosis and Mild Extrapyramidal Symptoms



## Conflict of interest
No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.
A 75-year-old female with bilateral ptosis and mild extrapyramidal symptoms visited a neurology clinic complaining of intermittent weakness of both upper eyes since 10 days before, and gradually aggravating and extending to both lower eyes for 2 years. Five years ago, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had a surgery. One month after that, she was treated with six cycles of intravenous chemotherapy with albumin-bound paclitaxel with carboplatin. On examination, it revealed symmetric bilateral ptosis,   Parkinson's disease and related disorders, Gershoni-Baruch   and mild rigidity and bradykinesia in both upper extremities (Medical Research Council=4+ out of 5) (Video 1). To exclude central neurologic disorders including stroke, the results of brain magnetic resonance imaging and brain CT were analyzed and the patient was sent for 24-hour Holter monitoring to check cardiac infarction. In 24-hour Holter monitoring, it showed a normal PR and normal QRS intervals along with a normal QT interval on both sides.

# Discussion
Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder, caused by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and a relative reduction in dopamine release in the striatum. The cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease are tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. As the disease progresses, it causes more pronounced stiffness, more prominent bradykinesia, hypokinesia with gait disturbance, postural instability, and difficulty in turning.The incidence rates of Parkinson's disease are 10 to 25 per 100,000 annually. 2 More than 1.5 million people worldwide are currently affected by this disease; over the next 20 years, this number will continue to grow by 40% to 45% in industrialized countries.   Parkinson's disease and related disorders, Gershoni-Baruch   Parkinson's disease, characterized by rigidity, is usually found unilaterally. In bilateral Parkinson's disease, rigidity occurs simultaneously in both upper limbs.   Bilateral idiopathic Parkinson's disease presenting with parkinsonism confined to the limbs, Barbeau     Pure bilateral upper limb tremor in Parkinson's disease, Kim   In the present case, the patient showed bilateral ptosis and mild rigidity and bradykinesia in both upper extremities. To date, we have identified some cases of bilateral ptosis related to Parkinson's disease with an unspecified level of cognition 1-3) but, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of Parkinson's disease with mild extrapyramidal symptoms, such as rigidity and bradykinesia and ptosis, presenting at the same time. <EOD> Is Mental Disorder a Substitute for Organic Brain Disorders?: Results from the New England Hospitals Survey of 1935-1944*

Input Text: Evaluation of Pemetrexed+Cisplatin Therapy Plus Osimertinib for Stage IV Lung Adenocarcinoma With EGFR Exon20 Mutations (EMPULSE-Lung-07) IMPORTANCE
Cancer treatment is one of the highest global health priorities. Advanced lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. More than half of the lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common variant and is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 mutations is clinically heterogeneous, with poor response to standard first line therapy. Therefore, there remains an unmet need to develop effective treatments. Osimertinib is a third generation EGFR-TKI which binds to the same site on EGFR as other first and second generation EGFR-TKIs. A Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of osimertinib in patients with EGFR T790M mutation have shown sustained clinical effectiveness beyond progression on EGFR TKIs with manageable adverse events. EMPULSE-Lung-07 is an open label, phase I/II study which was planned to investigate Pemetrexed+Cisplatin and Osimertinib combination as an EGFR exon 20 insertion first line therapy for EGFR exon 20 insertion NSCLC patients. BLEX404 (BLEX Bioscience, Inc., New Taipei City, Taiwan) is a proprietary 800 mg/ml of EGFR-TKI and MMP inhibitor, which is developed for treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. BLEX404 is a highly water-soluble crystalline powder and is formulated into an oral liquid to optimize convenience and adherence to use by cancer patients through its favorable taste. BLEX404 combined with Pemetrexed or Paclitaxel was found to elicit strong anticancer effect with low toxicity and could be a new therapeutic option in treating NSCLC patients. Study objectives: Primary: Determination the dose-limiting toxicity in the first cycle of combination use of BLEX404 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in stage IV NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations Secondary: Determination the recommended dose level in the first cycle of combination use of BLEX404 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in stage IV NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations Assessments: Treatment-emergent adverse events, objective response rate at Cycle 4 (defined as at least 4 cycles of therapy or at least 90 days on therapy and within 7 days after last therapy), progression-free survival (the probability of subjects surviving with disease progression at given survival time), overall survival (the probability of subjects surviving from the time of randomization until death from any cause), quality of life and pharmacokinetics, and serum concentration of BLEX404, Pemetrexed and H 3 BF 4 , and urine concentration of BLEX404 or Pemetrexed. Study design: Open-label, single center, phase I/II study with a 3+3 doseescalation design in part A. Part B patients will receive BLEX404 800mg/ml, Pemetrexed 500mg/ m 2 , and Cisplatin 75mg/m 2 Q3W.

Prior Research in the Treatment of NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20 Mutations
---------------------------

Treatment options for EGFR exon 20 patients with NSCLC are very limited. Gefitinib/Erlotinib is not useful for all EGFR exon 20 patients because some patients bear a unique in-frame insertion of the ER20 insertion. Chemotherapy is generally used as the first-line therapy"

 <EOD> A Novel Method of Assessing the Risk Factors for Suicidality in Korean College Students: A Multiple Imputation Approach Using 6-Year Data from a 10-Year Population-Based Cohort

Objectives: This study evaluates the methodological issues regarding the accuracy of suicide risk factors using data for college students from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES V1) and the Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS V).Methods: We examined sociodemographic backgrounds, child abuse history (i.e., emotional, physical, and sexual abuse), family and school life, alcohol consumption, and suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide in the participants. The data was collected from the KNHANES V1 (2010-2012) and the KYRBWS V (2011 and 2015), conducted as a follow-up study for adults, aged 19~39 years, who underwent the KNHANES IV surveys from 2007 to 2009. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between various risk factors and suicidality, including suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. We also used multiple imputation by chained equations (N=700) for missing data of child abuse history for more accurate estimation of the impact of the risk factors of suicidality.Results:The findings showed a high prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology in college students. High-risk behavior included current smoking, alcohol consumption, a lower level of caregiver support, and a poor family financial state during childhood. Child abuse history was significantly related to suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. The risk factors for suicidality include younger age, females, physical abuse during childhood, low-level household income, and lower level of caregiver support during childhood. Multiple logistic regression revealed that child abuse during childhood, lower level of caregiver support at baseline, and low-level household income increased the odds of suicidal ideation. In addition, child abuse during childhood, low-level caregiver support, and low-level household income increased the odds of attempted suicide.Conclusion:We found a high prevalence of child abuse history. Suicidality is associated with risk factors including younger age, low caregiver support, low-level household income, and child abuse.

Purpose and description of the study


Study Overview
=================
We use the following methods to evaluate immune responses of kidney transplant recipients to COVID-19 vaccination. After one or two doses of the bivalent Omicron mRNA vaccine we evaluate humoral and cellular immune response in all participants by determination of receptor binding domain (RBD) specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations in serum. After 3 doses of the bivalent Omicron BA.4 and/or BA.5 mRNA vaccine, this evaluation is repeated together with a determination of anti-spike neutralizing capacity. After both vaccinations, we also investigate the frequency of T cells that recognize BNT162b2 virus-infected human cells in the blood of the participants. Furthermore, two-dose COVID-19 vaccination is supplemented by (optional) two doses of the Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (Shingrix). After the second Shingrix vaccination, participants will be included in the vaccine herpes zoster study.

We compare humoral and cellular responses to COVID-19 vaccines in participants who continue treatment with everolimus instead of mycophenolate mofetil. To do so, we will compare responses from recipient of everolimus with matched recipients who remain on CNI.

We also include a group of kidney transplant recipients that receive the herpes zoster vaccine during the study, but do not receive COVID-19 vaccination. This study arm allows us to investigate a potential induction of herpes zoster vaccinemediated immunity in participants on everolimus after COVID-19 vaccination as a side-effect.

The inclusion of participants who accept to provide an additional blood sample after three doses of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will allow us to further investigate cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on the number and phenotype of memory T cells of the participants. We will use the blood samples and compare them with data generated from serum obtained after standard clinical chemistry measurements.

Primary Objective
==================
To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in higher immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination, with a focus on neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain after second vaccination.

Key Secondary Objective
==================
To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in higher immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination, with a focus on frequency of T cells recognizing BNT162b2 virus-infected human cells after second vaccination.

Key Secondary Objectives
==========================
To evaluate the immunogenicity of replacing maintenance of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients to both the bivalent Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 and original/Omicron BA.1 (V-003-2022-NL7401, V15-00987-NL7401, ZIN-203302006.

Intervention Arms
================
Kidney transplant recipients who use everolimus instead of CNI for at least six weeks will receive the bivalent Omicron vaccination during the study. This arm will be matched with an arm with kidney transplant recipients who use CNI for at least the same period of time. After their kidney transplant, each recipient will receive three doses of vaccine and optional two doses of the herpes zoster vaccine, during the study.

Epidemiological investigation carried out after disaster provided the material to study the distribution of the incidence of psychiatric disorders for different periods of exposure to different types of a disaster and to trace the character and time of their recovery. <EOD> The pathology of schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder with psychosis: a retrospective study.
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
A retrospective study of 65 adult psychiatric outpatients, who had not received antipsychotic drugs within the previous two years, underwent detailed psychiatric assessment and was compared to a similar group of 19 normal controls. The patients were classified either as schizophrenics (n = 20) or as having first psychotic schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) (n = 44). The pathologists who examined the autopsy material were unaware of the diagnostic category or the age of the subjects.


FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
At autopsy, the only macroscopic and microscopic differences found were that the cortical sulci were wider and the basal ganglia were larger in the patients with schizophrenia than in patients with SPD with psychosis, and that, compared to the SPD group, more patients with schizophrenia had an old cerebral infarct. <EOD> Improving Healthcare Resource Utilization in the Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome in the United States and Europe.
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment remain essential in achieving optimal outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Current management guidelines for ACS emphasize early recognition and prompt revascularization for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to reduce morbidity and mortality, but also suggest treatment with the same medical interventions applied early in patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) despite more delayed symptom presentation. The rapid diagnosis and successful treatment of ACS, though, are complicated by significant delays in presentation for treatment. The combination of late presentation and insufficient emergency medical services (EMS) transport to the nearest hospital capable of treating ACS are responsible for prolonged delays to hospital presentation. These delays in treatment may occur despite access to healthcare services and may lead to suboptimal patient outcomes. This review demonstrates ways to improve healthcare resource utilization in the treatment of ACS by utilizing evidence-based clinical strategies to reduce and/or eliminate delays encountered during the prehospital and emergency department (ED) phases of care. The review also focuses on measures to improve patient outcomes by reducing door-to-ECG and door-to-needle/balloon times. <EOD> ORIGIN OF VARICOSITIES.

It is stressed that in the differential diagnosis of reticulate areas of the skin, the possibility of hydroxyurea must be kept in mind. <EOD> On the use of a nonlinear diffusion model for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
The impedance of a solid sample with multiple interfaces and thickness much greater than the Debye length, as is the case of thin film electrodes, is often modeled as an equivalent network impedance.

The resulting equations can be directly solved by using an initial value method or by solving a system of implicit differential equations by iteration.

The provided clinical trial is titled: Efficacy of Upper Trapezius Stretching on Neck Pain, Range of Motion and Disability in Patients With Cervical Spondylosis: A Randomised Controlled Trial.

Fourty-two patients with cervical spondylosis were randomly assigned to either the intervention (an upper fibers trapezius stretching intervention) or control group (standard care). The intervention consisted of specific stretching exercises designed to target the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle. The stretching exercises were performed under the guidance of a licensed physical therapist and involved extending the neck while gently pulling the head downward to stretch the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle.

The provided clinical trial results showed that the intervention group had a significant improvement in neck pain at 4 weeks and 3 months compared to the control group, as well as a significant improvement in neck range of motion and disability at 3 months. Overall, these findings suggest that the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention can effectively reduce neck pain and improve neck range of motion and disability for patients with cervical spondylosis.

The upper fibers of the trapezius muscle play a crucial role in maintaining balance, movement, and posture of the neck 1]. Individuals with cervical spondylosis may experience altered biomechanical and motor control of the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle, leading to the development of pain and decreased neck mobility 2,3]. The upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention aims to reduce neck pain and improve neck mobility by re-aligning the shoulder girdle and increasing the passive extensibility of the trapezius muscle, and has been found to be an effective treatment modality in clinical studies 4][5]. This clinical trial provides robust evidence for the use of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention as an effective treatment for individuals with cervical spondylosis.

The findings of this clinical trial are consistent with previous studies on manual therapy for individuals with neck pain, which suggests an overall benefit of manual therapy in reducing pain and disability 6]. This study also aligns with the conclusions of recent systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines on the management of neck pain, which highlight the importance of exercise as a treatment modality and the need for further research to better understand the effectiveness of specific intervention strategies 7,8].

Taken together, the findings of this clinical trial support the use of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention as an effective treatment option for individuals with cervical spondylosis. By providing insights into the effects of the intervention and highlighting the promising potential of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence regarding the management of neck pain and disability.

Background information
__________________

Cervical spondylosis is a commonly occurring pathology of the cervical spine that can cause varying degrees of neck pain. In more severe cases, it can lead to neck stiffness and reduced range of motion 9]. The upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention has been investigated as a potential treatment option to promote improved neck mobility and less pain in individuals with neck and shoulder pain. The intervention involves gently pulling down the head while extending the neck, with the intention of stretching the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle. While evidence suggests that the stretching intervention may be effective in reducing pain and improving function, there is little consensus on the relative benefits of specific trapezius stretching modalities. The efficacy of these modalities can vary based on individual factors such as pain location and severity, neck mobility, and specific features of the stretch being performed. Clinical guidance on the optimal stretching interventions for individuals with cervical spondylosis pain remains limited. This highlights the need for further research to determine the most effective approaches to alleviate the pain and improve the range of motion for patients with cervical pain."

In this study, the effect of 30, 70 g.kg-1 PQ on growth performance, digestion, immune, antioxidation and liver and kidney functions of growing pigs was studied at 90.8 kg BW. The results showed that, compared with the control group, 30 g.kg-1 PQ had no effect on the growth performance, digestion, immune, antioxidation and liver and kidney functions, but 70 g.kg-1 PQ decreased the apparent digestibility of dry matter (P < 0.05) and the total tract apparent digestibility of N and crude fat (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), depressed growth performance (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), decreased serum immunoglobulins (P < 0.05) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD, P < 0.01), increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) (P < 0.05) and diamine oxidase (DAO, P < 0.01), and increased serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN, P < 0.01) and creatinine (CRE, P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In conclusion, the addition of 30 g.kg-1 PQ to diet would improve the growth performance, digestion, immune and antioxidation and ameliorate the liver and kidney functions of growing pigs, and the inclusion rate of 70 g.kg-1 PQ in diet would reduce the growth performance as well as the serum immunoglobulins and T-SOD, and increase the serum BUN and CRE of growing pigs. <EOD> Mucosal and systemic immune responses after oral immunization with plasmacytoid dendritic cells pulsed with VP6 protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus

2022) Mucosal and systemic immune responses after oral immunization with plasmacytoid dendritic cells pulsed with VP6 protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.
Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a swine coronavirus; the VP6 of PEDV is a common viral antigen of the Alphacoronaviruses. Since oral administration of VP6-pulsed plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) has been demonstrated to have good immune protection against PEDV, it is important to investigate the possible mechanism of immunity after oral administration of VP6-pulsed in pDCs. In this study, we found that oral administration of pDCs pulsed with the VP6 of PEDV led to higher levels of VP6-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in serum, feces, and intestinal washouts at each time point (2wk, 4wk, 6wk and 24wk postimmunization) in piglets compared to those of the control groups. The pDCs pulsed with the VP6 of PEDV (1x10 6 cells) elicited a significantly higher frequency of V"

 <EOD> Correlation between oestradiol metabolites in plasma, ovarian venous plasma and follicular fluid.
Ovarian steroids have important roles to play in reproductive function not only as direct messengers, but may also be implicated in the feedback control and regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis, as well as directly in follicular development and ovulation. Therefore, a precise assessment of ovarian steroids is essential to any study relating ovarian steroid concentrations with follicular and luteal development and/or function. Recently, we demonstrated the development and evaluation of a specific, and relatively simple method to extract and quantify steroids contained within complex biological fluids as well as within follicular fluids. We have attempted to use this method to quantify oestradiol metabolites present within the plasma and follicle fluids of 20 patients who had undergone laparoscopy for treatment of reproductive problems with a secondary finding of atrophic ovaries. Plasma was obtained from an antecubital vein in four of the 20 patients from which follicular fluid was also obtained. A 70 microl sample of plasma was extracted with dichloromethane in order to obtain an internal standard and then deconjugated. The extraction efficiency of conjugated steroids was > 85%. The concentration of oestradiol metabolites (conjugated + deconjugated) in plasma, venous ovarian blood and follicular fluid (FF) was estimated by radioimmunoassay. The recovery of oestradiol conjugated metabolites was 50% of the total (deconjugated + conjugated) metabolites. Follicular fluid concentrations of oestradiol metabolites were twofold higher than those in ovarian venous plasma in only three of the 20 patients. The total oestradiol extracted from the ovarian venous plasma samples was fivefold higher than that in plasma samples obtained from the same patients antecubital vein. Oestradiol values of either plasma or follicle fluid are likely to underestimate actual follicular fluid levels by omitting the contribution of the conjugated metabolites present. Therefore, we suggest a correction factor of 5 to be applied to oestradiol fluorescence values obtained from either plasma or follicle fluids to arrive at the correct follicle fluid oestradiol content. <EOD> Interaction of antibody specific for a human melanoma-associated antigen with human and murine melanoma cells in mixed culture.
The mouse monoclonal antibody B27 (IgG3) was found to react with a subset of melanoma cells. B27 reacted with only 4 of 32 (12.5%) human melanoma specimens, and 6 of 6 tumor cell lines established from metastatic lesions. B27 did not react with the cellular components of normal melanocytes, normal glia, normal blood elements, or normal epithelial cells of various organs. In a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay, B27 killed cell lines derived only from patients with metastatic melanoma, which was confirmed by subsequent studies in which B27 bound to the surface of only metastatic melanoma cells and reacted with the antigen only when the cells were grown in serum-free media. B27 bound to the antigen on the surface of the melanoma cells and not to antigens shared by epithelial cells. As demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies with metastatic melanoma cell lines, B27 did not react with antigens shared by other tumors commonly seen in human melanoma patients. When the B27 antibody was reacted with either human or murine melanoma cells under dissociated culture conditions, it preferentially reacted with the murine melanoma cells, a finding suggestive of complement-"

A 48-year-old male patient was referred to our department for evaluation of an enlarged right submandibular lymph node. There were no signs of the metastasis of other malignant tumors. An ultrasonically and CT guided fineneedle aspiration cytology revealed an undifferentiated plasmacytoid tumor showing a dense population of cells with plasmacytoid features in an abundant amorphous background. The specimen from total tonsillectomy was histologically proven to be a plasmacytoid lymphodysplastic tumor, showing positive staining of the chromogranin. The patient has remained well without recurrence to date of 11 months follow-up after total tonsillectomy. Lymphoid neoplasms of the submandibular salivary gland are extremely rare and the differential diagnosis of this tumor is discussed, including the plasmacytoid variant of the lymphoepithelial carcinoma of salivary gland, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphadenitis, and others. Cytological characteristics of this rare tumor and their differential diagnosis by conventional Papanicolaou stain are presented in this case report. <EOD> Correction: The Use of the Adenosine Analogue P169 as a Photoaffinity Drug in Norepinephrine Depletion of Neuronal Cells

The thyroid transcription factor -1 (TTF1) is typically restricted to lung and is well-known for its role in controlling pulmonary surfactant gene regulation. It has also been identified to display functions in kidney formation, thyroid, gastric cellular differentiation, and myelination of the central nervous system. It is considered a poor progression biomarker for numerous cancers, although it has been found to play a pivotal role in brain cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and liver cancer. Studies have shown a differential expression of TTF1 in the prostate. Its expression in prostate cancer has attracted attention since it is not expressed in normal prostate tissue. This review summarizes current knowledge of the relationship between TTF1 with the progression and outcome of prostate cancer.ARTICLE HISTORY

# Introduction
The prostate cancer (PC) tumor microenvironment (TME)-including cancer cells and stroma-regulates tumor growth and dissemination in many human cancers. Improved knowledge in PC TME is a necessity for identifying targets for new therapies aimed at slowing disease progression and the metastatic spread of the tumor. The thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1, also known as NKX2.1) has proven to play a crucial role in prostate cancer progression. It is a homeodomain protein with three important domains: a homeodomain, a Trefoil motif domain, and a DNA-binding domain. The Trefoil motif domain is important for cell adhesion, migration, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. The NKX homeodomain is a transcription factor containing a specific DNA-binding sequence that is involved in cell differentiation. This factor is found in a number of tissues including lung, kidney, and many other tissues.
Recent evidence has shown that TTF1 has a unique role in cancer. Cancer tissue often shows expression of TTF1, but its expression in normal tissue is rare. TTF1 is involved in growth, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. Its aberrant expression in cancer tissues has proven to have an essential role in tumorigenesis. The expression of TTF1 in normal cells and its potential role in PC has been highlighted. TTF1 is now considered a progression biomarker in a number of cancers,"

[<NAME>.] <EOD> Improvement in acute rejection with thymoglobulin induction versus rabbit anti‐thymocyte globulin
Little information about induction with various commercially available antithymocyte globulins is available. Thymoglobulin was evaluated in lung transplants at 3 mg/kg/d for 2 days. Twenty‐five sequential lung transplant patients received rabbit anti‐thymocyte globulin in 1995, another 25 in 1996. A retrospective analysis was completed for 12 months. The rate of rejection was significantly higher (14 vs. 11, p 500 μmol/L, 11 vs. 16, p 440 μmol/L. Two patients had antibiotic prophylaxis. The first used a 5‐day regimen of vancomycin and ciprofloxacin and the second a 2‐week course of ciprofloxacin/metronidazole. Two patients developed P. jirovecii pneumonia; antifungal prophylaxis was not used. The patients on vancomycin/ciprofloxacin had a median course of steroids of 9 days, whereas the second course was prolonged at 13 days, but these values were not statistically significant. Patients from the earlier course required a longer course of steroids. There were no serious complications. Patients who received steroids with thymoglobulin induction had prolonged courses of steroids, but no infectious complications were noted except for 2 cases of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be indicated in patients after thymoglobulin induction. <EOD> A comprehensive evaluation of the antifungal activity of chitosan and its combinations with plant extracts against the common fungal pathogens of tomato
Abstract The present study was aimed at evaluating the fungicidal activity of chitosan (CTS), its combinations with plant extracts and the inhibitory effects of their treatments on fungal growth, disease development and yield attributes of tomato (Solanum lycopersicuum) plants against Fusarium oxysporum and F. solani. The in vivo inhibitory effect of CTS against the tested fungi was assessed by mycelia growth inhibition (MGI), and in vivo growth suppression (IGS), while the in vitro effect was estimated by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The synergistic effect of cinnamon and grape seed plants extracts (PE) in the combinations with different concentrations of CTS on the pathogenic in vitro fungal growth was also estimated using Chaverrón et al (2013) index. The combinations of the tested fungi with 500, 1000, 1500 mg l–1 of CTS were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the percentage of MGI and IGS and also decreased (P < 0.01) the incidence of the studied fungi in the soil. High values of the MGI, IGS and MIC for both pathogens were recorded for the 1500 mg l–1 of CTS. In vitro growth suppression index estimated that combination of GPE-CTS and CSE-CTS were the most effective. The antagonist effect of GPE and CSE was synergistically increased with increase of CTS concentrations. It may be concluded that the GPE and CSE was effective alternatives to chemical pesticides for use as safe and biodegradable antifungal agents against tomato fungal pathogens. <EOD> A novel approach to estimate soil organic carbon pools in the European Soil Data Network

Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most frequent genetic alterations in human cancer, and result in decreased p53 function. Previously, we reported that p53 abnormalities were detected in only 35% of soft tissue and bone sarcomas. In this study we investigated p53 status in more soft tissue and bone sarcomas, and extended our evaluation to include analysis of squamous cell carcinomas and endometrial carcinomas. Since exons 5 to 8, in which 80% of all reported mutations are located, were sequenced in p53 (7), we wanted to test a new assay that detects point mutations in any of the 10 exons of p53. For this assay (PCR-SSCP), we used genomic DNA directly from the tumor specimen. Amplification, denaturation and electrophoresis of the PCR-SSCP products was performed according to the method of T. Man, which was designed to improve the sensitivity of the SSCP technique. We compared results of this PCR-SSCP method with the previously published method (RT-PCR with immunochemistry). This PCR-SSCP assay, in which normal tissue is used as template for control, appears to be better for detecting point mutations in the p53 gene than the mutant-allele-specific PCR (MAS-PCR) assay. The 14 bone sarcomas investigated for mutations in this study by the PCR-SSCP method yielded good results: In 8 cases (57%) there were mutations in the exon 7 (encoding the putative zinc finger region), in 7 cases (50%) in exon 8 (encoding the C-terminus) and in 2 cases (14%) a point mutation was present in exon 5 (encoding the 1st zinc finger). These data suggest that mutations in the p53 genes play an important role in the pathogenesis of bone sarcomas. <EOD> Assessment of in vitro cyt"

The expression of connexin 30 (Cx30), the major gap junction protein in Purkinje cells, was evaluated with a set of specific antibodies with different immunogen/antigen epitopes during Permanent Inactivation of Cerebellar Nuclei (PICN) in the cerebellum of adult rats. Our results show increased Cx30 levels at all nuclear and Purkinje cell layers, being the strongest increase in granule cells during PICN, and a lower increase observed in molecular layer cells, compared to the contralateral cerebellum. The changes in Cx30 expression patterns may be considered a compensatory mechanism produced in the adult rat cerebellum to decrease the disinhibition generated by PICN.

The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in screening for neoplastic lesions in patients with Lynch Syndrome.


Summary of Results
---------------------


This is a multi-central and multi-disciplinary study.

The study has a randomized, stratified, prospective and blinded design with 2 parallel groups (CAD EYE group vs CE group).

Subjects admitted for colonoscopy will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to either the CAD EYE group or the ce group.
A total of 150 patients will be required for this study (CAD EYE group, N.=90; CE group, N.=60).

In the CAD EYE group, the adenoma detection rate will be assessed (ADR).

The study should run from February 2019 to January 2023.

A study timeline has been proposed:

Patients’ follow up:

---------------------

In the CAD EYE group, descent is performed under white light with the CAD EYE switched on. When polyps are detected, they are rigorously described and histological prediction of the endoscopist reported. Then polyps will be removed by polypectomy or mucosectomy. Removed polyps are then sent for anatomopathologic analysis.

In a subset of 40 patients, the endoscopist's description and the CAD EYE prediction will be compared.

At the end of the procedure, CAD EYE analysis is made retrospectively from the images acquired during examination. Only the histological report of the removed polyps defines the final diagnosis. This will be reported to the study sponsor within 6 months after the end of the trial or within 3 months after the end of the individual protocol for patients still included in the trial. Patients will be informed of the results of the procedure and they will receive a copy of the anatomopathy report.

 <EOD> Neuromuscular disease associated with M protein. Occurrence in a normal adult.
This work is a report of a case of neuromuscular disease, affecting almost exclusively the skeletal muscle, associated to a monoclonal IgG-kappa M component in the serum and urine of a healthy 39-year-old woman. Although serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), quantitative serum immune electrophoresis (SIE), immunoelectrophoresis (IEP), and serum protein immunofixation (SPI) were repeatedly normal, a polyclonal component could not be ruled out by IEP and SPI performed on the patient's serum diluted with the patient's urine at a molar ratio of 1:10. No evidence of involvement of the bone marrow, kidney, liver, or salivary glands was found. The monoclonal IgG component, as an intact molecule as well as under dissociative conditions, had an electrophoretic pattern very similar to that previously reported for serum amyloid A in patients with secondary amyloidosis and monoclonal gammopathies. This study supports the hypothesis that ""preamyloid,"" the precursor of amyloidogenic monoclonal immunoglobulins, may arise not only in plasma cells, being the origin of the amyloid fibrils, but also in normal cells, playing no pathogenetic role. The occurrence of amyloid fibrils in the kidneys was excluded by a renal biopsy carried out in 1977. However, urinary tract infections were frequently observed even after the administration of trimethoprim, since the patient also had asymptomatic diabetes. This fact may account for the renal amyloidosis that is rarely reported to affect normal adults. <EOD> The Relationship Between Subjective Memory Complaints and Sleep in Older People

Study Expected Outcomes
=================
* Assessment of rivaroxaban exposure in cancer patients compared to previously reported in non-cancer patients (i.e., Phase I clinical trial and real-life experience).
* Assessment of apixaban exposure in cancer patients compared to previously reported in non-cancer patients (Phase I clinical trial).
* Identification of covariates influencing rivaroxaban and apixaban exposure in cancer patients.
* Identification of covariates influencing cancer patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban (cancer) compared to rivaroxaban or apixaban controls (e.g. AF or VTE).
* Identification of clinical correlates of rivaroxaban and apixaban exposure in cancer patients.
* Population pharmacokinetic evaluation of rivaroxaban and apixaban concentrations adjusted with cancer patients characteristics including sex, age, weight, renal function, DDI, etc.: * DDI includes concomitant antitumoral treatments such as: anthracyclines, taxanes, oxaliplatin etc.
* Potential impact of the DDI on drug exposure (AUC):
Adjustment for weight using allometric method (body weight)
Adjustment for renal function using (eGFR)
Adjustment for sex:
Rivaroxaban: women are known to be more sensitive to DOACs than men (AUC in women is a little bit higher)
Apixaban: to our knowledge no gender-related difference of apixaban pharmacokinetics.
* Potential impact of the DDI on exposure-effect relationship

What is rivaroxaban?



Rivaroxaban is the brand name for a drug that is a highly potent, orally active, direct, highly selective, competitive inhibitor of the enzyme activated factor X bound in plasma. Direct Factor Xa inhibitors like rivaroxaban prevent the natural breakdown of blood clots and prevents blood clots from forming and/or growing. Rivaroxaban does not require frequent laboratory monitoring as the patient's exposure to the drug remains relatively stable at steady-state. It is approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for the postoperative period following hip or knee replacement.



What are the side effects?


Rivaroxaban can result in increased bleeding (bruising, nosebleeds, epistaxis), and bleeding at other sites (e.g. intracranial, gastrointestinal, gingival, gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleedings). Severe bleeding can lead to life-threatening conditions including intracranial hemorrhage or death.




## Why are cancer patients on rivaroxaban? 
The use of rivaroxaban may have the benefits over conventional anticoagulants in cancer patients because it is rapidly absorbed (less interference of anticoagulated food) and does not require laboratory monitoring (lesser inconvenience to patient), and can be associated with less bleeding events. However, clinicians should note that rivaroxaban has a small elimination half-life of 12 hours in healthy volunteers, and a relatively large number of these individuals had an international normalized ratio (INR) above therapeutic range on the last day of drug intake (12 individuals; 12/60; 20%); this can be of increased concern when used in cancer patients receiving concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs. It should not be used concomitantly with direct FXa inhibitors, unless approved drug-drug interaction studies confirm this is feasible and not harmful.
Cancer is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and stroke and the risk is increased by other factors such as a poor performance status, prior vascular surgery, incisional surg"

 <EOD> Increased expression of the beta-interferon promoter in macrophages but not in epithelial cells infected with viruses of the family Paramixoviridae.
The expression of the human beta-interferon (hIFN-beta) promoter was studied in two simian virus 5 (SV5)-infected cells line, namely Vero (African green monkey kidney cells) and MLE (mouse lung epithelial cells), after infections with VSV (Vesicular Stomatitis Virus) or SeV (Sendai Virus), both belonging to the family Paramixoviridae. In Vero cells, SV5 replicated more efficiently than VSV. The expression of the beta-interferon (beta-IFN) gene, as measured by luciferase (LUC) reporter activity, was 3-4 times higher in Vero cells infected with SV5 or with VSV than in uninfected cells, being maximal (at 24-48 h post infection) at lower virus titers. However, in MLE cells, SV5 replicated poorly compared with VSV, and beta-IFN production at high levels was observed at 24 h post infection; thereafter, the replication of VSV also decreased significantly. In MLE cells infected with SV5, at high multiplicities of infection, beta-IFN mRNA, protein and LUC activity were observed at 36 or 48 h, indicating that expression from the SV5 genome was enhanced at comparable multiplicities of infection (at 36 or 48 h). In summary, the levels of the induction of the beta-IFN gene promoted by SV5 were much higher in Vero cells than in MLE cells, although only at low levels of SV5 infection in MLE occurred. It followed that expression of the beta-IFN gene depends on multiplicities of infection in epithelial cells such as MLE cells. <EOD> In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Essential Oils from Artemisia scoparia ssp.

Abstract: 
[/ALL] This study examines gender's relationship to pain, and the impact of both hormonal and social factors on these relationships. Our hypothesis is that these factors have a direct impact on all of our study's outcomes. While we hypothesize specific correlations, the primary outcome is an overall comparison between genders. We will begin by collecting pain sensitivity scores in 100 cis- and transgender people. We will assess whether people with the following gender identities differ in pain sensitivity: transgender man, trans-female, trans-woman and transsexual. Participants will record pain sensitivity scores at baseline and then again after 10 days of either hormone therapy for transgender participants, or placebo for cisgender participants. We will also collect blood samples for immune cell counting and serum samples for hormone levels. We will then follow the cisgender men and trans men separately for 36 days reporting adverse childhoods events, depression, social support, connectedness to their LGBTQ community, and a variety of qualitative measures of pain and gender identification.


Please ensure that your abstract is formatted according to the submission guidelines for manuscript submission.


Data Analysis: [/ALL] For our primary outcome, an overall comparison between gender identities, we will compare the two groups using a two-way ANOVA, with post-hoc contrast testing. To assess our secondary outcomes we will use one-way ANOVA, and will conduct t tests comparing specific gender groups' pre-test and post-test to pre-test performance within each gender group. We will also conduct binary regression analyses predicting post-test from pre-test, with the pre-test acting as a moderator.

# Background & context
[INT]
Researchers have tried to reduce the risk of unnecessary [INT] use and to decrease antibiotic resistance.

In this context, the implementation of tests providing in vitro selective reporting of antibiotics susceptibilities to guide antibiotic dispensing can promote more appropriate [INT] use. Selective reporting aims to restrict the antibiotics that can be prescribed to women experiencing uncomplicated cystitis. As the standard antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) report includes all antibiotic susceptibility profiles,

[INT]
For each E. coli positive urine culture analyzed by LabOuest, GPs will receive an antibiotic susceptibility testing report, with the list of antibiotics restricted according to four E. coli susceptibility profiles, with an emphasis on narrower-spectrum antibiotics.

[INT]
Selective reporting of antibiotics susceptibilities as part of AST reports to guide antibiotic dispensing may contribute to limiting unnecessary [INT] use and decrease antibiotic resistance. Selective reporting of antibiotics susceptibilities may lead to more appropriate antibiotic use.

# Methods
[INT]


In the current study, the selective reporting of antibiotics was [INT].


It may help promote more appropriate. The 7-day time window was used as a proxy of empirical therapy (= 3 days before report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) result), and the 7-day time window was used as a proxy of directed antibiotic therapy (= 5 days after report of the AST result).

# Results
[INT] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Discussion
[INT]

For women with a selective report in the intervention arm, the prescription of narrower-spectrum antibiotics (amoxicillin/ampicillin) increased. After standard reporting, these patients tended to receive a prescription of non-narrower spectrum antibiotics (fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporins) instead.
Intermediateterm analysis of the primary outcome, showed that this increased use of nonscarce antibiotics was not only due to the [INT] but also to the patient-level characteristics.

# Conclusion
[INT]

Targeted reporting of AST results in a selective change in the prescription of antibiotics, with reduced rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing for women with uncomplicated cystitis. This study highlights the interest to promote selective reporting of antibiotics susceptibility.

[INT]
Researchers have tried to reduce the risk of unnecessary antibiotic use and to decrease antibiotic resistance.

In this context, the implementation of tests providing in vitro selective reporting of antibiotics susceptibilities to guide antibiotic dispensing can promote more appropriate antibiotic use. Selective reporting aims to restrict the antibiotics that can be prescribed to women experiencing uncomplicated cystitis. As the standard antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) report includes all antibiotic susceptibility profiles, the clinician needs to choose among available antibiotics. For patients with uncomplicated cystitis, the antibiotic susceptibility report is generally based on the 2007 European urinary tract infection (UTI) guidelines. These guidelines suggest using amoxicillin/ampicillin or nitrofurantoin for the treatment of uncomplicated lower UTI. Ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins could be used only when antibiotic susceptibility tests show resistance to amoxicillin/ampicillin and/or when nitrofurantoin is contraindicated 2 . However, over time, resistance to each antibiotic has been increasing"

Objective:The methanolic extract from Tilia americana and ethanolic extract from Tilia platyphyllos have been evaluated for cytotoxic activity on human oral squamous carcinoma (OSC). Materials and methods: The human oral squamous carcinoma cell line of KB-3-1 (human oral squamous cells carcinoma) was purchased from Nawah Scientific Inc. (Cairo, Egypt). The cells were grown on plastic tissue culture dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). The cells were seeded into 96-well plates in 200 lL DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37°C under 5% CO 2 in a humidity incubator. After 24 hours, the cells were incubated with serial dilutions of both plant extracts in culture medium for 72 hours. The cells were then assessed by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium)-based cell proliferation kit and IC 50 determination (concentration at which the treated cells were inhibited by 50% in comparison to control ones). Results: The cytotoxic concentrations were obtained by adding 20 lL of the extract to the wells in the culture plates in duplicate. Then, the plates were left for 24 hours to allow the treated cells' recovery before MTT solution was added to the wells and they were incubated for 4 h. The result showed that the cytotoxic concentrations of T. platyphyllos extract (TP) versus the methanolic extract from T. americana (TM) were 220 lg/mL versus 200 lg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, T. platyphyllos extracted by ethanol had a greater cytotoxic effect on the human oral squamous carcinoma cell line KB-3-1, as shown by IC 50 values of 197 lg/mL and 220 lg/mL, respectively. Conclusion: T. platyphyllos extract had higher cytotoxic activity than T. americana extract on the oral squamous cell carcinoma. These methanolic or ethanolic extracts from Tilia americana and T. platyphyllos could be useful for developing drugs against human oral squamous carcinoma cell lines.

 <EOD> Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy-related Cytomorphological Features of Endometrial Adenocarcinoma
Aim: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), has been associated with a decrease in the rate of surgical intervention in cases of advanced endometrial cancer, but has also been associated with changes in the cytomorphology of the tumor and its ability to respond to treatment. We report the findings of histopathological and cytological studies of 12 cases of adenocarcinoma obtained before and after NAC. Methods: The pre-, post- and final curettage specimens from 12 patients with endometrial cancer were submitted to morphological and immunohistochemical study. Results: In 5 cases (41.6%) the pretreatment specimen showed squamous differentiation. In 7 cases (58.3%) the cytology was diagnostic of carcinoma. 5 of 12 tumors were considered resistant (<90% necrosis), but 7 tumors had >90% necrosis and were therefore considered responders to NAC in our study. 3 cases presented cell clusters with a clear cytoplasm and central areas of necrosis. 2 cases presented papillary fragments. The treatment was well tolerated by all patients. The only complication was pain during curettage in 1 case. Conclusion: NAC was an effective method of decreasing the extent of surgical procedures and facilitating local control, and should be offered to some subset of patients with advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma when the primary tumor is surgically unresectable. <EOD> A rapid method for detecting Salmonella spp. on foods using a polyclonal immunoglobulin Y-stabilized whole-cell O/W emulsion
A new immunochromatographic method was developed to detect Salmonella spp. on fruits, vegetable leaves, and grains. Salmonella serogroup O antigens were stabilized by adsorption to polyclonal immunoglobulin Y (IgY) stabilized with a liposome system to eliminate the interference of organic fluids present in foods. The assay can be completed (incubating the test sample in a tube) within 1 h of receiving a sample. Two polyclonal IgYs produced in chickens and rabbits against the O antigens of Salmonella (Salmonella group B, C2, and D1) were mixed with a suspension of Salmonella to create the immunochromatographic test strip. All 84 serotypes, belonging to the 22 subgroups, could be detected by the immunochromatographic test strip, although the Salmonella enterica spp. Enteritidis (ET), I 4,[5],12:i :, and Heidelberg O:19 could not be detected. The specificity of the assay in identifying three serotypes differing from Salmonella spp. was 99.2%. In testing more than 6,300 fruits, vegetable leaves, and grains, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatographic test strip were 85.3 and 88.8%, respectively, indicating good accuracy. The results showed that this test strip would be useful as a sensitive, specific method of rapid detection of Salmonella spp. in foods. <EOD> Comparison of Intravenous and Oral Fosfomycin (Fosfan®) Activity in an Experimental Enterococcus faecium Strain Infection In Mice

 <EOD> Aortic stenosis - diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.
AIM
To outline the diagnostic and treatment aspects that are specific to aortic stenosis.


MATERIALS
The literature was reviewed for the pathophysiology, diagnostic and therapeutic implications in aortic stenosis.


RESULTS
Transoesophageal echocardiography is the cornerstone in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis. Other imaging tests may be used to exclude the presence of valvular disease and to document the anatomic characteristics of the valve apparatus. Valvuloplasty, surgery and transcatheter procedures can be used as therapeutic options.


CONCLUSIONS
Differentiating between the patients that would benefit from surgical or transcatheter procedures must be based on clinical or echocardiographic predictors such as the valvulo-aortic diameter and calcium deposits' distribution, respectively. <EOD> Association of Early Postmenopausal Weight Gain With Incident Coronary Heart Disease

Most women gain weight over time, yet its importance as a cardiovascular risk factor is less well defined. We performed a pooled analysis of 77,899 participants with 4,996 incident cases of coronary heart disease (CHD) from the Women's Health Initiative. We evaluated the joint association of early postmenopausal weight gain with CHD risk, and assessed whether the association was mediated through weight cycle-induced changes in lipids and glucose. Compared to women who remained stable in weight between 1 and 3 years postmenopause, women who gained a moderate amount (2.1-4.9 kg) had a 20% greater risk of CHD. This association was attenuated to the null after additionally adjusting for changes in lipids and glucose (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83 to 1.11). In separate analyses of lipids and glucose, we found that changes in glucose explained 34% (CI: − 12 to 66%) of the association between postmenopausal weight gain and CHD, which was attenuated to the null after removal of glucose. Our study suggests that weight gain 1 to 3 years following menopause is associated with CHD risk independent of changes in lipids and glucose, however, this association is attenuated and does not reach statistical significance.

# Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death among women in the US. The onset of menopause marks the beginning of an excess in CVD among women, with the rate of CVD beginning to increase from the age of 45 yearsand approaching that of men by 49 years. Obesity, a wellestablished cardiovascular risk factor, is inversely associated with age of the onset of menopause. Menopause is also accompanied by a decrease in levels of estrogen which has been linked with increased cholesterol levels. Weight gain associated with menopause has been associated with changes in lipids and glucose, which are associated with the risk of CHD in both men and women.
An inverse relationship between age and adiposity exists, such that there is weight gain following menopause, on average. While studies have typically focused on abdominal and central adiposityor overall weight change over time, a study by suggested that weight gain occurring immediately after menopause might be particularly problematic. Given that risk of CHD typically increases after the onset of menopause, an increased risk for CHD is expected if weight gain after menopause occurs. However, while studies have suggested a higher risk of several cardiov"

 <EOD> The ATRS: a New, More Sensitive and Specific Serodiagnostic Test for Southeast Asian Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Infection

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe disease of medical importance that has been reported in many countries. The serologic diagnosis of the disease is based essentially on testing serum antibody titers using the indirect immunofluorescence method (IFA). In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detection of CCHF virus-specific antibodies after adaptation of an indirect immunoperoxidase test (ATRS) described elsewhere. The antibody titers of IgG to 3 structural proteins of the virus (N, Gc, and Gn) and the phosphoprotein (P) from a panel of serum samples collected from patients from Southeast Asia were determined by IFA and the ATRS. The results showed that ELISA using P or G protein in combination with P protein (GpC) to detect IgM antibodies as a diagnostic criterion for CCHF is a promising test procedure in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This ELISA method could be considered as an alternative to more expensive and time-consuming tests like IFA.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe and often fatal disease caused by an arenavirus. It is transmitted by ticks and, in some regions, by bites from hematophagous arthropods. The virus is transmitted to humans by tick bites and by contact with fresh blood, which contains virus-containing ticks, the excreta of infected animals, or the body fluids of infected individuals or patients during medical interventions such as blood transfusions and autopsy procedures, including infected and/or freshly dead animals.
In the former Soviet Union, CCHF was first diagnosed in Crimea during a large epidemic in 1944 and from cattle with hematemesis   Tick-borne viral diseases in animals and humans, Kopácek  . Although the virus was isolated from the blood of a patient in Georgia in 1964, the disease was not diagnosed (1). In 1996, CCHF occurred in a region of Africa where it had not been previously reported (Zakazaki virus), prompting researchers to suggest that the virus occurred in the region before the 1988 outbreak in the Southeast Asian countries and that the viral infection was undetected. The disease was associated with the consumption of uncooked organs of infected animals by tribesmen in the area. In 1999, the first cases were seen in Turkey, and the disease subsequently has appeared as endemic in Turkey and Iran   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus: genetic analysis and phylogenetic comparison of strains with..., Sevucu  . The virus also occurs in the Balkans, southern Europe, and Africa, as well as throughout Central Asia   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the New World, Wilson  .
The CCHF virus has 4 different molecular groups or genotypes, termed Balkan, West, East, and Central Africa. The disease has not been observed in North America or Australia. In southeast Asia, three different genomic subtypes are present, and each subtype consists of many different genotypes.
The disease shows no or only mild flulike symptoms in the beginning but usually develops as a lethal disease (case death rate, 30 to 50%) after a short febrile phase with sudden onset of capillary and petechial bleeding that increases mortality (case fatality rate, Ͼ50%). The incubation period can range from a few days to 2 weeks. The mortality rate in humans is higher for infections acquired by tick bites than for infections acquired by contact with animal blood. Splenomegaly is always present, and hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and neurologic symptoms occur as well   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ergonul  . Fecal shedding has been reported in some patients, and the virus has been cultured from seminal fluids. It has been"

104,"[/INST] This trial aims to assess the interest of a Doppler ultrasound at day 30 and 60 for the early detection of the disappearance of thrombophlebitis and to determine the duration of ultrasound signs of septic thrombophlebitis on central venous catheter and midline.

Background: [/INST] Thrombophlebitis caused by catheterization can be complicated by bacteremia. This requires the early administration of antibiotics. However, in the early days of the bacteremia process, there is no sign allowing to make the diagnosis. The only proof of the bacteremia is the culture obtained on the blood drawn for routine. To get early proof, the detection of a bacteria positive blood culture is required which can only be obtained to take a peripheral blood specimen. This can delay diagnosis and thus treatment. It is therefore necessary to be able to detect signs of bacteriological interest (sign of thrombophlebitis) earlier which will allow to administer antibiotics in time. This study aims to assess the interest of a Doppler ultrasound at day 30 and 60 for the early detection of the disappearance of thrombophlebitis and to determine the duration of ultrasound signs of septic thrombophlebitis on central venous catheter and midline.

The National Diabetes Data Group defined diabetes mellitus as fasting serum glucose greater than 7.78 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) or oral glucose tolerance greater than 11.11 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) at any time two hours after a load of 75 g of glucose, even in the absence of symptoms. Subnormal levels of tolerance after an oral or intravenous glucose load are not of major importance in defining hyperglycaemia. The impairment of glucose tolerance to a level that predisposes to a vascular crisis is related to the duration of blood glucose greater than 11.11 mmol/L, in addition to the usual features of the disorder. Glucose intolerance greater than 7.78 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) for two hours is less important as a cause of disease, and the value of 6.67 mmol/L (120 mg"

 <EOD> In Vitro Evaluation of a Bait-Advanced Interceptors Implemented with Pheromones to Control the Formosan Termite, Coptotermes formosanus
ABSTRACT 
 The new bait, the Bait Advanced Interceptors (BAIs), is designed to simultaneously provide an aboveground food source and a termite-attractive pheromone scent. These BAIs were evaluated to verify their ability for attracting foraging Formosan termites, Coptotermes formosanus, using several traps. Two commercially available baits, i.e. BASF AdvanceTM and Advance 2.0, as positive controls, were used for comparison. In the laboratory, the BAI did not demonstrate a statistically superior ability to both of baits to attract Formosans. On the other hand, in the field tests, the BAI attracted more termites than the commercial baits in most of the traps placed randomly at the ground of outdoor areas. In addition, the termite captures increased in the BAI and the commercial baits from the second to the fourth trapping weeks. The aboveground portion of the BAI significantly enhanced the termite attraction of the commercial baits. Collectively, this new technology has great potential to be a replacement of the currently available and well-known bait against Coptotermes termites. <EOD> 2-Hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid as a versatile chiral auxiliary: use in synthesis and NMR studies of biologically active compounds.
2-Hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid (4, 2-hydroxy-acetophenone, or salicylaldehyde) reacts with cyclic primary amines at ambient temperature to provide the aza-Michael adducts 4 in about 80% yield. The NMR spectra of 4 (or 11, 4-N,N-dimethylaminocyclohexylamine) prepared by this method show that the hydroxyl group of the 4 substituent is shielded by strong electron-withdrawing substituents on the cyclohexyl ring. An exception appears to be the NMR spectra of 4 prepared by reaction of 4 with amine NH2(4,4'-iminodipyridine) (8), which give a broad singlet signal (3H) centered at about 8.38 ppm, corresponding to one exchangeable hydrogen atom. The NMR spectra of the adduct 11 (or 44, piperidine) prepared from 4 and piperidine exhibit a singlet at 6.20 ppm corresponding to 2 exchangeable hydrogen atoms. A 2,2-dimethylamino substituent at the 3-position of 4 reduces the chemical shift of the hydroxyl proton to 8.45ppm. A 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidino substituent on the 4-position produces a singlet at 8.31 ppm. The formation of these adducts with aniline 16 and a substituted aniline 42 in 80 and 100% yield, respectively, has allowed their NMR spectra to be recorded and their structures confirmed by the X-ray analysis of 49 (or 100, 4-aminodiphenylacetic acid, 4-ADPAA) with the aniline substituent on C-4 position of the 3-phenylpropionic acid core. These results and a brief review of the early synthetic applications of phenylpropanoic acids (or simple acid chlorides derived from the 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehydes) are presented. The adduct 42 has been synthesized from the readily available D-tyrosine by the selective oxidation of the 3 hydroxyl group, the aldehyde cyclocondensation, and the dehydrogenation with sodium triacetoxyborohydride, conditions which were first developed for the aromatic hydroxylation of mono- and diamino amines. <EOD> Transurethral resection of the prostate in horseshoe kidney: A case report

The inhibitory effect of acute dose of 25 mg/kg 5-hydroxytryptophan upon behavioral responses induced by apomorphine, morphine and amphetamine was studied in rats. This dose of serotonin precursor was found to abolish the increase of 5-HT content in the cortex, striatum and hypothalamus induced by apomorphine, morphine and amphetamine. This effect of 5-HTP was found to be antagonized by pretreatment of the animals with 5 mg/kg p-chlorophenylalanine. Behavioral response to the drug treatment in absence of 5-HTP was used as the control measurement. When p-chlorophenylalanine was administered in saline solution in a dose  as of 5-HTP, the increase of 5-HT content in the cortex of apomorphine and morphine pretreated animals were similar to those induced by the two drugs in 5-HTP untreated animals. On the other hand, the reduction of 5-HT content induced by amphetamine and its effect upon apomorphine-induced 5-HT response were not influenced by pretreatment of animals with p-CPA. <EOD> Synergism of the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin in human small cell lung carcinoma in a nude mouse model.
Gemcitabine (difluorodeoxycytidine, DFdC) is a new dideoxycytidine analogue with proven potency against a large variety of human solid tumors. Since gemcitabine can exert potent antitumor activity in a variety of tumors with DNA-damaging effects similar to those of alkylating agents, we investigated a potential chemotherapeutic synergy of gemcitabine and cisplatin (CDDP) in the nude mouse human small cell lung cancer model. We were able to demonstrate an additive effects of the combination of gemcitabine plus CDDP in comparison to a single-agent treatment with either drug. <EOD> The Clinical Value of Quantitative Dementia Assessment Using Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Critical Review and Meta-Analysis of the Literature

Background: The accuracy of clinical dementia assessment by cognitive screening and diagnostic criteria may be improved through integration of biomarker information. We conducted a thorough and systematic review of the literature with the objective to examine the potential of biomarkers for clinical staging of major dementia types and assess their clinical utility as a surrogate for disease progression.Methods and Findings:We analyzed and described all 35 papers included in this review published until June 2011, and extracted data of neuropsychology and demographics, biomarker type, assay technique, study outcome measures, cut-off definition, and study quality. Meta-analysis and sensitivity testing were applied to the analysis. There was a large overlap between studies of AD and DLB/PDD, and therefore these two patient groups were treated as one group for meta-analysis. AD and FTLD studies were not analyzed. Most studies were case-control designs with small sample sizes, and the majority of studies with longitudinal designs were cross-sectional analyses. Overall, there was significant heterogeneity in the study designs. The results showed that the majority of AD studies demonstrated a positive linear relationship between the severity of dementia and cognition, with patients with mild dementia performing significantly better than patients with moder"

The effect of different types of lasers on infiltrative and destructive pulpitis has been evaluated by 7 pulp specialists who reported 633 root canal treatments, in 535 patients (242 upper central incisors, 147 upper first bicuspids, 58 upper second bicuspids and 87 lower central incisors). The first series of cases comprised 326 patients, the second one 303 patients (laser group). In the laser group, 64.7% were treated with Nd : YAG laser, 26.4% with CO2 laser, 6.8% with argon, and 1.1% with laser in conjunction with a surgical handpiece. In the laser group, vital pulp therapy was carried out in 54.6%, partial pulp devitalisation in 29.1%, and pulpectomy in 16.3%. The results showed that patients treated with Nd : YAG laser had better pulpotomy results regarding postoperative sensitivity than these treated with CO2 laser. The results of a questionnaire on 412 patients completed by 7 specialists from 3 countries were also analysed. In the case of pulpotomy, the majority of practitioners would not use laser. <EOD> A Simple Screening Test to Differentiate Primary Lymphocytic Enteritis from Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Introduction. Lymphocytic enteritis (LGE) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory enteropathies of unknown etiologies. These diseases are characterized by diffuse or segmental mononuclear cell infiltration in the intestinal mucosa, but the precise pathogenesis remains elusive. The present study was performed to determine a simple clinicopathological index for distinguishing LGE, Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) from other enteritis. Methods. Sixty-eight patients with enterocolonic diseases were divided into groups A (LGE), B (CD), and C (UC). Histopathological changes in the mucosa were examined and a histological score and villous atrophy of the enteritis were scored as 0-3. We analyzed the inflammatory cell types, eosinophils, and lymphocytes at the inflammatory site. We examined the ratios of inflammatory cells, immunoglobulin (Ig)-A-plasma cells, and Ig-G-and Ig-A-containing cells at the inflammatory site. Results. Patients in group A had a higher ratio of Ig-A-plasma cells and Ig-A-containing cells"

 <EOD> Neuropathology of neurodegenerative diseases following human fetal neural and glial cell transplantation – implications for cell based therapies in Alzheimer's disease
A number of recent studies have suggested that there are potential adverse patho‐physiological effects following brain cell replacement therapy for neurodegenerative diseases with neural and glial cells of both fetal and postnatal origin. These include: i. potential detrimental functional effects from aberrant host myelination, ii. induction of cellular migration and neuritis, and iii. induction of inflammatory processes. The current report reviews these potentially adverse effects focusing on two diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the current review reports and investigates possible mechanisms by which this detrimental graft pathology may occur. <EOD> Choline Metabolism Shapes the Immune Microenvironment and Promotes Regulatory T cells
High choline phospholipid metabolism increases T regulatory cells and antitumor immunity. Phospholipids Shape the Immune Microenvironment An emerging field of interest in immunology is the role of nutrients and their metabolites in affecting the T cell response. Many of the enzymes that drive metabolic pathways in T cells are also responsible for producing signals that influence antitumor immunity and tolerance. In this study, Shen and colleagues find that one of those enzymes, choline kinase alpha (ChoKα), increases choline metabolism and antitumor immune response. To better understand how choline metabolism shapes the immune response in a tumor microenvironment, they compared naïve and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for alterations in choline metabolism, which had not been addressed in previous studies. This was done by metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of naïve and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from mice with or without tumors. The authors found a high intracellular choline metabolic flux in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which was accompanied by an increased choline metabolic gene signature compared to naïve lymphocytes. To understand the functional effect of choline metabolism altering T cell phenotype, they used an inhibitor of choline phospholipid metabolism, CK-699, which increased naïve helper T lymphocytes that differentiated in vitro into regulatory T lymphocytes. They further showed that the addition of choline promoted a regulatory T cell response and antitumor immunity in syngeneic tumor models. The authors conclude that high choline phospholipid metabolism increases regulatory T cell populations and may be a therapeutic target in tumor immunotherapy. T cells play crucial roles in regulating the antitumor immune response, which has been well studied for its contribution to tumor evasion. In contrast, knowledge of the immune cell metabolic requirements required to sustain the antitumor response is less understood. Using mass spectrometry–based metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis, we identified a high choline phospholipid metabolic flux in tumor-infiltrating T cells, as well as enhanced choline metabolism in naïve T cells from tumor-bearing hosts. Pharmacological inhibition of choline metabolism with a CK-699, which interferes with phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, skewed peripheral naïve helper T lymphocyte differentiation toward regulatory T lymphocytes, enhanced antitumor immunity, and decreased tumor growth in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. These results show that choline phospholipid metabolism shapes the T cell immune environment in cancer. Graphical Abstract <EOD> Correction: Evaluation of the effic"

Input Text: Breast cancer in patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative, or triple-negative disease is the most common malignancy arising in women. The standard treatment in this setting includes surgery and adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy, which is toxic. Endocrine agents, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators, may reduce ovarian function and thus worsen quality of life or decrease survival. Endocrine therapy can be used as an adjunct or alternative to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens have recently been extended to include the taxanes docetaxel or paclitaxel, which, like anthracyclines, appear to improve both progression-free survival and overall survival. Aromatase inhibitors, including exemestane, anastrozole, and letrozole, are now the standard adjuvant endocrine treatment after tamoxifen. In the pivotal NSABP-B-34 study, the 5-year survival rate with exemestane was 93%, and 7 years after the start of treatment, it was 83%. The 5-year rates of survival with tamoxifen were 89% and 69% at years 6 and 7. Patients who complete 5 years' adjuvant tamoxifen and have a recurrence have worse survival outcomes. Among them, exemestane improves overall survival and reduces mortality by 22%. In the NCIC CTG MA.17 trial, the rate of recurrence was lower in the group assigned to letrozole, without an apparent change in survival. In the IES study, letrozole significantly improved 3-year disease-free survival compared with placebo. In a randomized phase 3 study, the effect of anastrozole treatment in metastatic breast cancer on bone mineral density showed a significantly higher rate of bone mineral density loss in the anastrozole group. In the adjuvant setting, the effect of tamoxifen on ovarian function has been recognized to be dose dependent, and it is generally accepted not to exceed 20 mg/d to reduce the onset of menopausal symptoms. In the EBCTCG meta-analysis of randomized adjuvant endocrine trials done in patients receiving 20 mg/d or more, the duration of tamoxifen treatment was not significantly linked to the risk of death, but was related to adverse events. Among endocrine adjuvants, the risk of adverse events appears to be greatest with exemestane, aromatase inhibitors, and fulvestrant. One meta-analysis found a trend towards improved outcome for 8 to 18 months of letrozole, but not for 18 to 30 months duration. In clinical trials comparing different aromatase inhibitors, endocrine treatment and letrozole are similar. Endocrine therapy or chemotherapy is administered for 3 years, after which it is discontinued in patients with a high rate of disease-free survival at 2 years of treatment. Patients experiencing recurrence can receive new-generation endocrine therapy, second-line chemotherapy, or treatment combinations with cytotoxic and endocrine components. Patients should be advised to continue exercise and to eat a healthy diet. If the patient is overweight, weight reduction is recommended. Women on tamoxifen therapy should undergo bone density screening and bisphosphonate therapy if recommended. Patients receiving third-line or later treatment should receive psychological and supportive care, according to individual needs.

# Background Information
=========================


| SPECIFIC BACKGROUND/STATEMENT OF PROBLEM |
| --- |
| Pancreatic cancer is the third highest cause of cancer death in Canada and the US. The 5 year survival rate is 11%.1 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer, is usually an aggressive disease with poor overall survival. 2,3 Advanced pancreatic cancer does not respond to conventional chemotherapy for most patients. In a significant minority of patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) is often given post-operatively.4 There are two FDA approved drug regimens for neoadjuvant therapy: FOLFIRINOX (a combination of irinotecan, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxalipatin) and nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine. 1

| REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE & SIGNIFICANCE |
| --- |
| Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody specific for the IL-1β
cytokine. In an interim analysis of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/Alliance trial C9681, among patients with non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, significant improvement in PFS was observed with chemotherapy and anti-IL-1β versus chemotherapy alone (7.0 vs. 5.5 months). IL-1β blockade was associated with a 38% decrease in risk of progression, with a similar decrease in risk of death, but these results were not significant.5

| Study rationale/intervention description |
| --- |
| This is a phase IB, single armed, single center study using Canakinumab and Nab-Paclitaxel with Gemcitabine in patients with a resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel for up to six cycles will be given until progression of disease or intolerable toxicity or consent withdrawal. The primary endpoint is to assess safety and tolerability of Canakinumab and study drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel until the first dose limiting toxicity of all 4 agents or any grade 3 toxicities with any combination of the two immunotherapies are observed. The secondary endpoint is to assess whether study drugs delay an aggressive clinical course of the disease.3

Hexamita, a flagellated protozoal parasite, and Sarcocystis neurona, an oocyst-forming coccidian, are the most commonly encountered pathogens in feline gastroenteritis. Hexamita spp. live in the intestine of wild terrestrial carnivores and cause necrotising typhlocolitis, a disease characterised by pyrexia, anorexia, tenesmus and diarrhoea. Clinical lesions can be subtle and diagnosis at postmortem is difficult. Hexamita-infected cats can present with diarrhoea and chronic weight loss. These infections are self-limiting in healthy animals but predispose to enteropathogen infections, bacterial enteritis (predominantly enteropathogenic Escherichia coli  and Campylobacter jejuni ) and myiasis. Chronic disease progression can be associated with chronic stressors and immunocompromise due to endogenous or exogenous causes.

Spiral colon lesions include lymphocyte foci, eosinophilic crypt dilation and villous blunting. This is often accompanied by colonic crypt inflammation (increased lymphocytes and plasma cells). Ulceration of the colonic mucosa may be present but is not a specific feature for this disease. These histopathological features can closely resemble those of dietary or environmental enteropathies.

Hexamita infections may be endemic or sporadic depending on feline population density or other unknown factors at a specific location.

The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to challenge healthcare systems worldwide and has led to an unprecedented global effort to contain the disease. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has claimed the lives of over 430,000 people and affected nearly 10 million others since its first outbreak in Wuhan, China was reported in December 2019   Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China, Guan  . The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare, with the need for acquisition, manufacture and deployment of personal protective equipment (PPE) (for both healthcare providers and patients), social distancing protocols, and the need to prioritise resource utilisation during a time of scarcity.

 <EOD> Preeclampsia among African and Caribbean pregnant women living in France: maternal risk factors and perinatal outcome

Preeclampsia in migrant women is an underexplored topic. The objective of this study was to describe epidemiology of preeclampsia among African and Caribbean pregnant women living in metropolitan France. It aimed to characterize associated maternal risk factors and perinatal outcomes. We conducted a retrospective multi-center study from January 2010 to December 2013. Women with preeclampsia from the two largest university maternity centers in Paris (France) were included. Women of African ethnicity were compared to Caribbean women. Risk factors were compared using univariate analysis with Χ 2 test, and adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression. A total of 609 cases of preeclampsia were identified, including 366 in Caribbean and 243 in African women. Hypertension before pregnancy was the strongest risk factor for preeclampsia (OR = 2.9, 95% [2.1;4.0]). Caribbean women had a two times higher risk for preeclampsia than African women (OR = 2.3, 95% [1.8;2.8]). Both Caribbean and African women had higher birthweight (C-BW +426g; A-BW +394g) and lower preterm deliveries (C-12.1%; A-16.6%) among babies of preeclamptic women than babies of healthy women (C+269 g; A+ 280 g) p < 0.01. Lower BW and higher preterm deliveries were associated with severe form of preeclampsia, whereas lower preterm deliveries were associated with non-severe preeclampsia.

Input Text: Influencing Panoramic Imaging Errors With Strips

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Introduction Panoramic radiography is an extra-oral imaging technique and is considered an effective, fast, and relatively inexpensive diagnostic tool to examine dentofacial structures.Despite the advantages of panoramic radiography, it also has some drawbacks, including a low quality panoramic radiograph as a result of incorrect patient positioning. Patient position error is one of the most common errors reported in panoramic radiography. Various patient positional errors include the lack of head extension, the lack of tongue positioning against the palate, and the failure to use a celluloid matrix tape. Various studies reported that the average positional errors of the tongue were 77.5 percent for the mixed dentition period and 9.5 percent for the permanent dentition period. Failure to hold the tongue against the hard palate, using the palm of the hand for positioning the patient, failure to give an explanation of the tongue position before and during imaging, or not requiring the patient to do so have been shown as the main causes of failure to keep the tongue in an adequate position.The main cause of PGA error in panoramic imaging is not correctly holding the soft palate and tongue with the hard palate, causing the space between the soft palate and tongue with the hard palate to be visible in the image. This error is seen in approximately 10% of panoramic radiographs.This error occurs due to an incomplete and non-coordinated closure of the mouth on the hard palate during imaging, in other words due to uncoordinated closure of the lips and hard palate on the tongue. In these cases, the tongue is usually not tightly attached to the hard palate. The use of rubber bands or chewing gums could be helpful in this case. Other reasons for error in this issue include uncoordinated contraction of the lips, the tongue and the cheek, the lack of cooperation of the patient or the operator, swallowing during imaging (which may be prevented by asking the patient not to swallow), gagging, and not following the instructions. Thus, failure to hold the tongue adequately against the hard palate is considered one of the most common errors in panoramic radiography. Failure to use celluloid matrix tape is another frequent and preventable error in panoramic radiographs.In this error, the patient or the person conducting the imaging may unknowingly forget to use the tape while performing imaging. Also, in cases where the patient is not fully cooperative, use of a more reliable tape instead of a piece of cotton thread is recommended. Using a 6 mm × 20 mm celluloid matrix tape for oral and maxillofacial radiography, in cases where the patient or the person responsible for radiography are required to perform the imaging without the tape, can prevent this error.Food and chewing tubes can be considered in patients who unintentionally did not use the tape or in cases where the tape cannot be used. According to the literature, using strips of food or chewing tubes can successfully control the tongue position (more than that of the celluloid matrix tape). Using some strips in combination with chewing tubes also reduces the risk of error. Using a chewing rod during imaging reduces tongue tension to a certain degree; using food strips is more effective in this regard; using these two tools simultaneously can effectively reduce tongue tension in this error. Thus, it can prevent this error in panoramic radiographs in various cases.Based on the above facts, it can be inferred that using a wide variety of strips during the panoramic imaging technique of patients can reduce the error rate of panoramic imaging. Therefore, using different strips during imaging will prevent the error of panoramic imaging. Thus, the tongue and soft tissue can be adequately attached to the hard palate. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the use of strips effectively reduces the error related to palate imaging. This article examines the effect of using different strips on the effect of radiograph positioning to the error of tongue.

 <EOD> The Association Between Socioeconomic Status and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis at AJJCC-7 and AJCC-TNM Stages Using Health Insurance Claims Database.
PURPOSE
We aimed to investigate the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and prostate cancer diagnosed at AJJCC-7 (American Joint Committee on Cancer, seventh edition) or AJCC-TNM (American Joint Committee of Cancer Tumor Nodes Metastases) in the Republic of Korea using Health Insurance Claims (HICs).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
For patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014, we used the HIC database of the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service to evaluate the relationship between SES and prostate cancer diagnosis at stages AJJCC-7 and AJCC-TNM using the Cox and logistic regressions, respectively.


RESULTS
Compared to the AJJCC-7 group, a higher proportion of people in the AJTC-TNM high-risk group were identified as having had low SES (18.1% vs. 21.4% in the low-income group and 31.5% vs. 35.8% in the education level-based low-income group, respectively). The risk of prostate cancer diagnosis at high SES or AJTC-TNM low-risk group was 0.627 times lower (95% confidence intervals : 0.566-0.697, p <0.001) and 0.560 times lower (95% CI: 0.503-0.626, p <0.001) than that at low SES or AJTC-TNM high-risk group in the Cox proportional multivariate hazard regression. The proportion of patients with low SES in the high-risk group was higher than that in the high-risk group. The proportion of patients with AJJCC-TNM low-risk stage was 52.8% (95% CI: 44.6%-61.2%, p <0.001) in the high-income group and 76.8% (95% CI: 72.8%-80.4%) in the high education level group and 64.5% (95% CI: 56.8%-72.3%, p <0.001) in the low-income group and 82.6% (95% CI: 74.2%-90.7%, p <0.001) with lower education level, when compared to the high-risk group in the logistics regression.


CONCLUSION
We identified significant differences in SES among patients at the AJJCC-7 or AJCC-TNM cancer stages based on administrative data.

Cerebral venous thrombosis in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: Results of the interagency registry for cervical artery dissection. Stroke. 2017;48(12):2991-2997.

In this study, researchers aimed to determine the incidences, characteristics and outcomes of cerebral venous thromboses (CVTs) in patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). They collected the medical records on 100 cases of CVTs (proven either by neuropathological or radiological findings) and 3,628 patients with SAH or aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) from the inter-agency registry for cervical artery dissection (IRACAD) of the Uppsala, Sweden. CVTs occurred in about 2% of patients with SAH, which was consistent with previous data. There was no association between the location of aSAH and CVT. CVTs in patients with aSAH most commonly were found in non-dural sinuses (54 patients), and 9 of 54 patients had the thrombosis in the transverse sinus. For the 100 cases of CVT and the 3,628 aSAH or SAH patients, a clinical follow up of about 30 months was done to show the incidence of recurrent CVT, death, and dependency (modified Rankin score > 2) were about 15%, 9%, and 49%, respectively.

Aim: In response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, many schools worldwide have closed and classes have been moved to online education. This study investigated the effects of the pandemic on diet and lifestyle to identify problems and develop measures for college students and to assess how the pandemic affected their feelings and life satisfaction.Materials and Methods: A total of 723 students from a college in Japan completed an online survey. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted to assess the diet and lifestyle habits of students during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, as well as their feelings, depression and anxiety levels, family cohesion, and life satisfaction. The Student Satisfaction and Health (SSH) score was used to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students.Results: About 25% of students did not follow the same diet or ate less food during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, and 35% had low daily physical activity and sleep habits (< 6 h). The SSH score of all 723 students was 3.79 ± 0.84 (range 2 to 4 points), with about 20% having high or low scores. Multiple regression analysis showed that the following affected the impact of COVID-19 on life satisfaction: (1) decrease in physical activities (β = −0.116; P < .05), (2) lack of sleep or increase in sleep time (β = −0.097; P < .05), (3) feeling ""I want to stay at home,"" (β = −0.082; P < .05), and (4) negative feeling about the future (β = −0.128; P < .05"

AIM
the study of the activity of oxidative enzymes and the content of lipids in the red blood cells of patients with various variants of the clinical course of COVID-19, which is a marker of oxidative stress in various diseases.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
23 volunteers without complaints were examined. The patients were divided into 5 groups in the following order: healthy donors of blood (control) who had never suffered from COVID-19; previously infected patients (recovery group); patients with moderate course of COVID-19, with the first time infection for less than 2 weeks; patients with moderate COVID-19, more than 2 weeks from the time of the infection; patients with severe form of COVID-19, less than 2 weeks since infection; patients with severe form of COVID-19, more than 2 weeks from infection.


RESULTS
it was found that in the red blood cells of patients with severe and moderate forms of COVID-19, which caused the accumulation of lipid deposits, a significant increase in the activity of the succinate oxidase system, which reflects the state of cellular mitochondrial metabolism, was observed. In the red blood cells of patients with a moderate form of COVID-19, the activity of the hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase systems decreased, which indicates the weakening of glycolysis, the accumulation of intermediates in the cycle. It was revealed that in patients with various variants of COVID-19, including severe forms against the background of significant anemia, the intensity of phosphorylation of erythrocyte metabolism increased and the intensity of phosphorylation of intermediates of glycolysis and pentose pathway decreased. A significant relationship was revealed between the level of severity of clinical course and the decrease in hexokinase activity. Phosphofructokinase activity was more than two times higher than the average level of activity compared with the control sample. Also, there was a significant positive correlation between the intensity of the accumulation of lipids in the red blood cells of patients with severe and moderate forms of COVID-19 and the activity of the ATP-dependent systems of erythrocytes in the direction of the accumulation of lipids and oxygen consumption.


CONCLUSION
we revealed the differences in the metabolic processes in the red blood cells of patients with COVID-19 in different variants of the disease at all stages of the development of infection. We observed the relationship between the intensity of changes in metabolism and oxidative stress in COVID-19. <EOD> Exact solution for the nonequilibrium free-energy gap of the one-dimensional Bose gas near the critical point.
A simple model for free expansion is used to study the nonequilibrium free energy for the Bose gas as a function of time in a one-dimensional harmonic trap for large values of the dimensionless temperature. In this model the system is represented by a stochastic process with Langevin dynamics. A stationary distribution may be obtained. Results for the free-energy gap are compared with exact analytic results, numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, and Langevin simulation with a large number of particles. <EOD> Diagnostic methods for bone tumours and tumour-like lesions.
To diagnose bone tumours and tumour-like lesions, imaging investigations have a decisive role. The application of imaging techniques allows for the recognition of pathological processes, their type and size, as well as for making a prognosis and planning further treatment. Modern imaging techniques based on ionizing radiation, in comparison with traditional methods, are characterized by higher accuracy and minimal invasiveness, which allows for the reduction of additional radiation dose for patients, thus excluding its negative effects. The article reviews the possibilities of applying computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound in the diagnostics of bone tumours and tumour-like lesions. The advantages and disadvantages of mentioned techniques are presented. The article also discusses the role of radionuclide bone scintigraphy in bone pathology. <EOD> Gadolinium-Based Nanowire Arrays for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Biosensing.

BACKGROUND
To design, synthesize, and demonstrate activity of 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonists as orally active drug leads for diabetic retinopathy.


METHODS
Two subtypes of serotonin receptors, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A, in mammalian retina were investigated in mice using microdialysis. Serotonin was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The binding affinities of 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonists were determined by radioligand competitive binding assay. The effects of 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonists on glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The cell viabilities of serotonin-stimulated HepG2 cells were measured by MTT (3--2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method or lactate dehydrogenase assay.


RESULTS
The two subtypes of serotonin receptors showed similar dialytic rates on administration of serotonin. Binding studies indicated that 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonists could bind to the target rapidly and that they were good drug candidates. A cell-based assay revealed that 5-HT2A antagonists had an inhibitory effect on the progression of diabetes by lowering serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and preventing the degradation of the IRS-1 protein in HepG2 cells.


CONCLUSIONS
A 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonist could be a novel orally active diabetic retinopathy drug. <EOD> High-resolution mass spectrometry and metabolomics analysis of the genus Miconia species (Melastomataceae).
INTRODUCTION
Analyses of the chemotaxonomic and geographical signatures of Miconia and its subgenera (Tetramicra, Miconia, Miconella, and Acrocele) are crucial for further plant bioprospecting. We combined metabolomics methodology (HRMS, multivariate analyses, and chemometric models) with a chemotaxonomic approach based on the profiling of diterpenoids and simple phenolic derivatives from M. albicans, M. caesifolia, and M. crinifolia.


OBJECTIVE
This study aims to understand which taxonomic markers can be used in identification and bioprospecting of drugs from this genus.


METHODOLOGY
In vitro culture of M. albicans, M. caesifolia, and M. crinifolia was evaluated to produce and accumulate biomass and metabolites, and also the quality and authenticity of the natural drug were analyzed. The chemical analysis of 50 diterpenoids and phenols was obtained by HRMS and NMR analyses.


RESULTS
The metabolomics models were developed by multivariate methodology (partial least squares), followed by chemometric tools for the identification of molecules. The model had a satisfactory separation between the species, particularly the first three components explain approximately 59.7% of the total data variance. In conclusion, this study revealed 10 metabolic markers, which differentiate the three species, including 8 terpenoids and 2 phenolic compounds.


CONCLUSION
The metabolomics methodology proved to be a new tool for the phytochemical classification of M. albicans, M. caesifolia, and M. crinifolia subgenera,"

 <EOD> Efficient expression of TNF-α gene in human cells by HVJ-liposomes
A series of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor α (rHuTNF-α) genes fused with the cDNA coding for reporter protein firefly luciferase gene (luc) were constructed. The genes contained several nucleic acid sequences with poly A signals on their 3′ ends. These recombinant genes were synthesized in vitro as double-stranded DNA by PCR method with pUC18 plasmid as template and ligated to plasmids which were circularized by circular reaction. In the final stage of reaction, the circular plastic DNA was incorporated into liposomes made of lipids derived from Sendai virus by reverse genetic approach. This viral DNA was then transfected into human embryo kidney cells (HEK293) and HepG2 cells by addition of HVJ-liposomes. Expression of the genes and activity of rHuTNF-α protein were detected by immunocytochemical and biological methods. <EOD> The Rising Prevalence of Pediatric Extra-intestinal Abscess in Australia
Objectives Pediatric extra-intestinal abscesses (EIAs) are a serious manifestation of invasive bacterial infection. The rise and fall of EIA rates with antibiotic prophylaxis has not been well defined. Methods This was a population-based cohort study using administrative data from Australia’s largest health service, NSW Health, for all children and adolescents (0–14 years) diagnosed as having an intra-abdominal abscess from January 2010 to December 2017. We calculated EIA rates as ratios of number of patients diagnosed as having any type of EIA during the study period, compared to numbers predicted by the Poisson regression analysis using an autoregressive error structure. Results A total of 10 747 children were diagnosed as having a intra-abdominal abscess (IA) of whom 64.4% (n=6883) had EIA. There was an increase of EIAs among children over the study period, with a doubling of the EIA numbers across the data for the years 2011 to 2017 (mean IA 1401; mean EIA 701). Over this period the ratio of EIA to total IA (including EIA) rates increased by 50%/year (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1–5.0). Over the study period, EIA rates increased for all age groups (p trend <0.05), including infants aged <1 year, with EIA rates/1000 person-years increased by 16.9% with an annual increase of 5%. Conclusions The prevalence of EIA as a proportion of total IA in children has continued to increase over the study period, with all age groups over 1 year having significantly increased EIA rates. This increasing burden of EIA is likely multifactorial including increasing prevalence of risk factors (eg, prematurity and obesity) and increased access to subspecialist care. <EOD> .
AIM
The main challenge in surgical treatment of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is the achievement of long-term remission of symptoms. Our study aimed to estimate long-term outcomes of operative treatment of CP in a single medical centre.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study included 110 patients with CP, who underwent surgery in 1984-2016. They were divided in two groups: 65 cases surgery was performed in 1984-2006 and 45 cases surgery was performed in 2007-2016. In group 1 66 operations were performed; in group 2--40 operations. Most common was Whipple procedure--42 cases in group 1 with 1-st postoperative mortality 6.5 %. In group 2--28 cases of Whipple procedure and 1-st postoperative mortality 5 %. Overall follow-up time was 14-126 months. Kaplan-Meier method was used.


RESULTS
The long-term outcomes of CP operative treatment depend on disease's severity. Pancreatic steatolysis is a rare"

 <EOD> A new role for the S-antigen: as a receptor for the protein adduct of the glutathione adduct of 4-hydroxynonenal.
In the human eye lens, the reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) reacts with glutathione to form a reactive protein adduct (Gly-Cys-S-HNE). By using solid-phase competition assays, we have found that the 32-kDa S-protein, formerly referred to as beta b1-crystallin, possesses a binding site(s) for Gly-Cys-S-HNE. No other crystallin possesses such a binding pocket. Thus, although the S-protein is classified as alpha-crystallin because it has two alpha-crystallin domains, one at the amino-terminal region and the other at the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule, it appears to have other, as yet undefined, functions. Immunoblot analyses have shown that only the S-protein is present in the supernatant of lens extracts, and not other crystallins, at 1-5 M NaCl. This suggests another function for the S-protein in lens physiology. <EOD> The effects of oral administration of hydrogen sulfide in cyclophosphamide-induced testicular damage in rats.
AIM
We aimed to investigate the effect of oral hydrogen sulfide (H2S) administration on oxidant and antioxidant parameters and histopathological changes in cyclophosphamide-induced testicular damage in rats.


METHODS
The study used 36 male Spraque-Decker, Albino rats aged 12 weeks, randomized into six groups: control group, single-dose control group, cyclophosphamide group, cyclophosphamide group with 6 days of H2S treatment after cyclophosphamide administration, 30 doses of H2S group, and 60 doses of H2S group. Testicular damage was created by a single intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide injection at 300 mg/kg. The control group was given tap water by mouth. The H2S treatments were applied by placing a single H2S capsule in the mouth. Serum, testis, and epididymis tissues were taken. Testosterone, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde parameters were studied in serum. Histopathological evaluations of the testis and epididymis were performed under a light microscope.


RESULTS
Dose number and duration increased in the 30 and 60 H2S doses compared to the control and single-dose groups (p<0.05). Serum malondialdehyde levels were reduced significantly, and testosterone levels were increased in the H2S treatments compared to the cyclophosphamide group (p<0.05). The histopathological findings showed that testicular damage in the H2S group decreased compared to the cyclophosphamide group.


CONCLUSION
In conclusion, these findings revealed the beneficial effects of H2S treatment on oxidation and antioxidation parameters and testicular damage in experimental cyclophosphamide-induced testicular damage. Therefore, these results suggest that H2S is likely be an excellent candidate for the management and prevention of testicular damage. <EOD> Antagonism of morphine-induced hyperactivity and antinociception by a μ1 opioid antagonist in rats.

Abstract
____________

Objective:
------------------
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common male cancer in Finland and most western countries. Gut microbiota has been suggested to play a major role in the PCa development. However, the mechanisms mediating the protective or harmful effects of gut microbiota remain elusive. Therefore, we aim to study the associations between gut microbiota features, metabolic parameters, and therapy response in a clinical trial study involving both PCa patients and healthy men starting therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Patient Population:
------------------
Totally, 50 PCa patients starting androgen deprivation therapy with degarelix (40 mg single injection, monthly thereafter) and 50 men starting prostatic hyperplasia medication (5-ARI) were recruited during a two-year time interval. The participants are evaluated before starting the medication and after 2 months using standard laboratory methods including microbial and metabolomic profiling and imaging modalities.

Study Design, Endpoints and Analysis:
-------------------------
This is an OVID-based, prospective, case-controlled, longitudinal, open-label study to evaluate the role of gut microbiota in PCa treatment.

Discussion:
-----------
The study has been planned to fill the existing knowledge gaps regarding prostatic diseases and their treatment outcomes. We aim to assess the role of gut microbiota and its relationship to PCa and its response to 5-ARI or degarelix treatment in a large clinical trial setting.

Funding:
------------
Financial grants have been received from the Helsinki University Hospital (191407, 196919, and 164016), EVO fundings from University of Helsinki, Helsinki University Hospital and Finnish Cancer Organizations (Finnish Cancer Society) (199524, 195186, and 213070), a grant (103210) from the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the Sigrid Juselius Foundation, and a research grant from the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation.

 <EOD> The Relationship Between the Housing Conditions of Older Persons and Their Psychosocial Status: A Study From The Netherlands
This paper examines the relationship between the housing conditions of elderly persons and their psychosocial status and well-being. The study population consisted of 684 persons aged 66 years and over who reported the main problems concerning their housing to be related to the availability of water and electricity. One of the main problems concerned the availability of electricity: 8% of the elderly considered being without electricity a health hazard. The average household contained 1.4 members. More than 33% of the respondents stated to be living comfortably in their current living arrangement. The majority (53%) found it necessary to ask help from family or acquaintances, but only one out of five elderly persons needed financial support. A significantly higher percentage of older persons in poor housing was found to suffer from chronic and/or psychological disorders. The study suggests that the housing condition of elderly persons may influence their well-being. Improvements in dwellings should follow a policy of integrating housing and other services, including medical and social services, to contribute positively to the quality of life of elderly persons. <EOD> A Covalent Organic Framework–Based Imaging Agent with Aggregation‐Induced Emission for Breast Cancer Inhibition via Targeting P‐Glycoprotein
A tumor multidrug‐resistance (MDR) overexpressed membrane protein, P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp), is responsible for drug efflux leading to chemotherapy resistance and has become a therapeutic target for eliminating cancer chemoresistance. Thus, the design of a P‐gp‐targeting cancer therapeutic agent is highly desirable. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF) with multicolor aggregation‐induced emission (AIE) fluorescent (17@H‐COF)@Rhodamine B (RB) and Nile Blue (NB) composite based on the COF derivative HOP‐COF, is designed and prepared. Interestingly, the three‐channel luminescent features of HOP‐COF and the intrinsic P‐gp‐targeting ability of RhB and NB are inherited by the 17@H‐COF@RB and NB composite, and hence it is endowed with three‐step tumor imaging function and triple MDR tumor inhibition ability. Furthermore, 17@H‐CO"

Please elaborate <EOD> The efficacy and safety profile of tacrolimus for the prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic cord blood transplant.
7064 Background: Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor and has a potential to block the immune responses.


METHODS
Eighteen patients with hematologic malignancies  who underwent unrelated cord blood transplantation between July 1999 and April 2003 were studied. The patients were divided into two study groups. Cyclosporin A (5mg/kg/day) was administered from day 0 and tacrolimus (TAC, 0.1mg/kg/day) from day 21 until day 100 in the 1st group and from day 11 until day 60 in the 2nd group (9 patients), while CsA (5mg/kg/day) was administered from day 0 and CsA (10 mg/kg/day) from day 21 until day 50 in the 3rd group (9 patients). One patient of the 2nd group and one of the 3rd group lost the follow-up, while all patients of the 1st group were followed up until day 100. For the assessment of the acute graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD), the clinical and biological criteria and for chronic aGVHD, the organ manifestation and the skin involvement.


RESULTS
The incidence of severe aGVHD was 42% in the CsA (5mg/kg/day) group but there was no patient with > grade II aGVHD in the TAC group, while there was no severe aGVHD in TAC group who had CsA (10 mg/kg/day) for the prophylaxis of aGVHD. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 52% in CsA (5mg/kg/day) group, 44.4% in CsA (10mg/kg/day) group and 0% in TAC group. The patients were followed up for 26.8 months (range; 6-44 months) in the CsA (5mg/kg/day) group, 24.1 months (range: 3-17 months) in the CsA (10mg/kg/day) group and 32.5-months (range: 6-52 months) in the TAC group (p>0.05). The survival was 70.0% in CsA(5mg/kg/day) group, 77.8% in CsA (10 mg/kg/day) group and 100% in the TAC group (p>0.05).


CONCLUSION
TAC might be more efficacious than CsA for the aGVHD prophylaxis in the CBT patients, though there was no statistically significance difference. Although longer follow-up is necessary for clarification, TAC might be a good alternative for prophylaxis of aGVHD and for the better survival in the CBT patients. No significant financial relationships to disclose. <EOD> Development and validation of the"

[STOP] <EOD> Clinical utility of MALDI-TOF MS for rapid and accurate bacterial identification in blood cultures: a 3-year retrospective study in a single-center tertiary care hospital.
In this study, we assessed the clinical validation of MALDI-TOF MS for the routine identification of various clinical isolates in a tertiary care hospital in Shanghai, China. The accuracy of this method using the Biotyper system for the identification of bacteria isolated from blood culture (BC) was investigated. Among the 402 microorganisms tested, 368 isolates (91.61%) could be identified at the level of genus. Among the isolates, Bacillus (36.07%) was the most frequently isolated, followed by Escherichia (13.96%). Among the Gram-positive isolates tested, 206 isolates (69.01%) could be identified at the species level, while among the Gram-negative isolates only 139 isolates (72.65%) could be identified at the species level. The most frequently detected species were Bacillus subtilis (22.05%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (18.31%). We found 30 unique bacterial spectra which could not be identified by our in-house MALDI-TOF MS database. However, identification results could be obtained in the database after using the MALDI Biotyper web query service. After our database was updated, the overall identification rate increased to 95.42%. In conclusion, our study revealed strong accuracy of the MALDI-TOF technique for identification of BC agents. <EOD> 2007 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism Classification Criteria for Primary Sjögren's Syndrome: Prospective Validation Study
OBJECTIVE The objective of this article is to validate the classification criteria for primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS). METHODS We assessed 704 consecutive subjects with suspected SS recruited in 20 centers in 7 countries for an SS trial (EC-SS; NCT00647127). All subjects underwent an assessment of criteria fulfillment, clinical and serologic evaluations, and oral and ocular dryness evaluations, and data were compared with those of 100 subjects with SS and 300 matched controls. RESULTS The sensitivity of the criteria was 65.7% and specificity 88.7%; 24.6% of the subjects not diagnosed with SS who met the criteria required a biopsy to diagnose definite SS. Among the subjects studied, 26.6% met only the minor criteria, 20.7% scored 4, 13.4% 5, and 2.4% 6. Increased scores were observed with older age and male sex. CONCLUSIONS This validation study using clinical data from a large prospective patient cohort with established diagnosis and extensive characterization validated the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for primary SS, including the presence of dry eyes (ocular staining) and a positive unstimulated salivary flow test. This study confirmed the low sensitivity of the presence of abnormal labial salivary gland (SGs) biopsy and the requirement for additional tests to diagnose SS. <EOD> In vitro evaluation of anti cancer activity of aqueous and acetone extracts of leaves of Dracocephalum kotschyi on two cancer cell lines.

The aim of this study was to measure the stability of short implants versus standard length implants (6 mm Straumann
BLX), placed with internal sinus floor elevation in posterior maxillae. The primary outcome measured was the
crestal bone level. A total of 160 edentulous patients that needed a posterior maxillary implant, were randomized to
either of the two treatment arms: short implant or a standard length 10 mm Straumann implant, placed with internal sinus
floor elevation. A single straight implant was placed in all the patients, irrespective of the group to which they had been
randomized. The periapical radiographs were taken immediately after surgery and at six-months, one
year, and three years after implant restoration. Crestal bone level (CBL) was measured intraorally by a trained examiner and
intraoral X-radiographs (paralleling technique) with a long-cone paralleling technique were taken. The radiographs were
analyzed by a blinded evaluator using the computer densitometry technique. CBL measurements were made at the baseline.

Treatment outcomes of this randomized clinical trial revealed that three-year survival rates of the short and the conventional
implants were comparable (86.7% vs. 87.5%), demonstrating good stability. In case of conventional implants, a
superior stability (higher success rate) was shown, although the difference was not statistically significant at
95% Confidence Interval. The overall bone loss of less than 2 mm after three years was comparable in both of the two
groups. The results of this comparative investigation confirm the usefulness of short implants in the posterior maxillae.

A clinical trial was conducted as a proof of concept study, in order to compare the outcome of short vs. standard length
implants. The results of this study showed the same outcome for short and standard length implants.

# Summary of study results
The null hypothesis was rejected since the difference between the two groups was significant. The mean crestal bone level
was higher in Control group. The conclusion drawn was that the short implants showed the same success rate as the control group,
although not statistically significant. Moreover, no significant difference with respect to the marginal bone level
was recorded between the study and the control groups. Thus, within the limits of the present study, it could be suggested
that the use of short implants is a suitable alternative to full-length implants in posterior maxillae.

# Limitations
- One limitation was the radiological assessment, since it could be influenced by several factors that were outside of the
control of the researchers. These disadvantages could potentially compromise the quality of the radiographic technique
in spite of the efforts of the researchers to standardize the procedure.
- In addition, the clinical crown reconstruction was not identical in each group. This was because the standardization of the
clinical crown, with prosthetic crowns being 3 mm apical and 2 mm coronal to the alveolar crest, was not considered appropriate
to avoid damage to the bone.
- It is likely that two implants per patient would be more advantageous in the long-term survival of the implants and the bone
dichalcea. Implant treatment in patients with narrow bone dimensions may be considered a challenge. However, short
implants, with sufficient primary stability and bone apposition after placement, can restore function and aesthetics.

# Statistical Methods
Statistical comparisons were performed by the Chi-squared test. To perform univariate analysis, the survival tables were
constructed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe and analyze survival rates. The statistical evaluation was
based on a 5% level of significance.

Treatment outcomes of this randomized clinical trial revealed that three-year survival rates of the short and the control implants were comparable (78, 27, 86, 27%). In the short implants group, there were three failures during the healing period, one of them requiring implant removal secondary to infection, two were due to fracture of the bone supporting the implant. The failures of implant in the control group occurred in 4 patients during the healing and rehabilitation periods. One of these four failures was due to the fracture of the implant (se"

Human Wharton's Jelly Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(WJ-MSC) are promising stem cell therapies.




## This phase I trial aims to assess the safety of WJ-MSC infusions in a cohort of patients undergoing a haploidentical HSCT according to a standard rIC protocol(fludarabine 150mg/m2,  & 20mg/kg, TBI 200 cGy x 2)

 

It will describe the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity as the primary endpoints. It will then describe the early effects on immune reconstitution, engraftment kinetics and outcomes 






# Introduction:
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2896392 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for patients with certain hematological malignancies  , with or without evidence of residual disease prior to HSCT  . Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) allows a more robust engraftment  , with lower relapse rate, and higher overall survival (OS). However, it leads to substantial morbidity and mortality. In order to increase the number of patients who can benefit from HSCT, reduced intensity conditionings (RIC) were introduced. With RIC transplantation, acute GVHD and graft vs host disease (GVHD) incidence is lower, but the rate of graft failure and relapse is increased. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) are the major complications after HLA matched as well as mismatched unrelated HSCT. The incidence of aGVHD after MAC ranges from 30% to 80 %  ; with a higher risk of grade II to IV in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as compared with patients with chronic GVHD (36%vs 13.2%)  . However, cGvHD remains the most important cause of late mortality  . 

Cyclophosphamide (CY) added to traditional myeloablative conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI) may promote long-term engraftment and GVHD prophylaxis  . However, it leads to delayed engraftment and a higher rate of severe regimen-related toxicity(RRT)  .
Immunologically, TBI induces a cytokine storm, increasing the risk of post-transplant complications 

Allogeneic disease progression can also be an issue in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning (MAC). A higher degree of myeloid malignancy has been associated with a reduced engraftment rate, and increased relapse and transplant-related mortality (TRM) post HSCT . However, an extensive review of the literature did not show a significant difference of OS when transplanted with or without MAC (HR for OS=1.31  versus 1.09  respectively) . There is no clear consensus on whether the HSCT should be postponed or not in MDS patients with progression.

Human Wharton's Jelly Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (WJ-MSC) are promising stem cell therapies 

Cellular therapies may induce long-term remission in steroidresistant acute GVHD  and might decrease the toxicity linked by to the use of immunosuppressive agents. In particular, WJ-MSC infusion appears safe and effective in both adults and children . The toxicity associated with their infusion has not been reported, due to their low mutational load and the low immunogenicity of WJ-MSC. WJ-MSC have anti-inflammatory properties, and have been used to prevent and treat steroidresistant aGVHD and cGVHD . The mechanism of action is not yet fully understood 

However, the dose of WJ-MSC infused is probably a key factor. In fact, the first study in adults with aGVHD showed a good effect on skin aGVHD  with a low dose (5x106 cells/kg/d"

Study Overview


Detailed Description



Objective


-  Identify hospitalized adults with underlying sepsis or high-risk presentations through use of machine learning.

-  Offer real-time feedback regarding severity of illness and predicted risk to progress to adverse outcomes (critical illness or death).

-  Pre-alert and guide clinical decision-making.

-  Reduce adverse physiologic and clinical outcomes.

Design and Setting
-----------------
This is a prospective, adaptive implementation study with 3 hospitals participating in the first phase of evaluation. There are no comparator sites in phase 1. The intervention hospitals have implemented a real-time machine learning program within their EHR (Healthfusion), which includes real-time alerting and decision support. Clinical deterioration is operationalized as the algorithm identifying the clinical trajectory of a hospitalized patient leading to severe illness and requiring escalation in care. The algorithm identifies two patient characteristics that inform clinical deterioration risk, and its alerts are presented in the patient record where the nurse can use it to guide decision-making. The patients and sites are expected to remain in the study for 12 months. Following onsite training and consultation, an interdisciplinary team will implement and evaluate the program's function within their facility. A pilot quality improvement program has already implemented and is showing potential in terms of impact. Phase 1 will be followed by evaluation of performance of the program as the tool becomes available at other hospitals within the healthcare system.

Input Text: African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
African-American (AA) mothers have a higher risk for perinatal depression than Caucasian women that is attributable to increased socio-environmental stressors. In addition, AA women have poor healthcare utilization and compliance with psychiatric treatment compared to Caucasian women. An intervention is required to supplement and support the clinical objectives of the mother's depression care without requiring the mother's direct involvement. Fathers are an underutilized resource to reduce the mother's environmental stress and encourage healthy maternal behaviors. The African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment- Partners alleviating Perinatal Depression (ASSET-PPD) protocol will target the fathers' support of the mothers' mental health treatment and their active engagement in the family to reduce maternal stress. The ASSET-PPD intervention will be designed to have 4 active modules that address key factors to reduce maternal stress during the prenatal period and 2 postpartum review sessions. The modules will be individual sessions constructed to provide training, information, and behavioral assignments to increase fathers': 1) prenatal and postpartum family involvement; 2) mental health psychoeducation; 3) interparental communication and relationship skills; and 4) balanced division of family tasks. ASSET-PPD will be evaluated in a pilot RCT with 50 cohabitating or non-cohabitating fathers and AA mothers who will be randomized into the ASSET-PPD intervention or the comparator group. Fathers only will participate in the intervention, and mothers and fathers will complete measures of mental health and parental experiences. Maternal depressive symptoms will be assessed as a primary outcome, and breastfeeding and parent-infant interactions will be assessed as secondary outcomes.

 <EOD> Challenges with the measurement of patient-centred outcomes in the follow-up of head and neck cancer survivors

The measurement of health outcomes in patients with oral and oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer (HHNC) is a challenge. In this article, we describe four perspectives on what can be measured to capture the long-lasting impact of head and neck cancer (HNC) on quality of life (QoL). These perspectives include the clinical point-of-view, the viewpoint of health-related QoL (HRQoL) measures, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and patient experience. Each perspective provides important insights in the measurement of HRQoL in HNCC care. The clinical perspective informs how the clinician can identify patients that need attention in HRC healthcare delivery, and the viewpoint of HRQoL measures provides useful instruments to measure this outcome. In addition, the perspective of PROMs, i.e. patient-completed questionnaires, as well as from a patient experience perspective, helps to understand how patients perceive their clinical symptoms as problems. Based on four specific examples taken from the literature, we discuss differences and similarities in the interpretation of clinical symptom expression, HRQoL, PROMs, and patient experience. The four perspectives discussed in this review can be valuable to clinicians, researchers, and policy makers to better understand how patient-centred outcome domains fit within routine clinical practice and research.Plain English summaryHead and neck cancer (HNC) has adverse impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). QoL is a multidimensional concept that comprises various aspects, such as physical symptoms, socio-economic status, and psychological distress. Different perspectives exist with regard to what is considered as relevant outcome factors for HNC care. In this article, we describe four perspectives on this issue. The clinical perspective focuses on specific physical symptoms that have a direct impact on cancer survivors, and the perspective of health related QoL (HRQoL) measures provides a valuable addition to capture generic aspects of QoL in HNCC care. Both have their limitations in explaining the full impact of HNC on patients. The perspective of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provides information on the burden of symptoms from the patients' point of view. The perspective of patient experience is a novel way to capture the broader and less objective perception of the patient on how HNC influences their daily life. This paper provides insights in how different perspectives can complement each other in HNC care.A B S T R A C TSurvivors of head and neck cancer (HNC), oral and oro-and hypopharyngeal cancer (OHCC), have an impaired quality of life (QoL) and HRQoL, owing to the adverse side effects of HNC cancer, its treatment and the subsequent medical consequences[1,2]. For example, the majority of HNC survivors [3-8] experience problems with swallowing (dysphagia), ranging from mild to severe, which influences HRQoL[9,10]. These symptoms often endure, despite treatment completion, and can significantly impact aspects of eating, socialisation, and emotional well-being. Due to their long-term nature, symptom persistence is often a problem in HRC healthcare delivery. A common understanding within HNC care across clinicians, researchers, and policy makers that considers QoL in the assessment of health service effectiveness and the provision of care is therefore highly desirable.In this article, we describe four perspectives on what can be measured to capture the long-lasting impact of HNC on patients' QoL . These include the clinical point of view, the viewpoint of health-related QoL (HRQoL) measures, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and patient experience. Our aim is to provide insights into the HRQoL measurement perspective in HNC care, and to help understand how these perspectives can be translated within"

The analysis of the experience with treatment of 311 patients with severe thermal (42 degrees C and higher) abrasion lesions and burns showed that the severity of the disease was a criterion of adequacy of the treatment tactics. Patients who received basic burn dressings and surgical debridement as burn wound treatment were in the majority. At the present time, the development is evident of the more complex multicomponent therapy of burn wounds to include the use of the new pharmacological and antiexudate agents. There is no need in repeated transplantation of healthy plastics except in cases of full-surface defects of the face by exerting the autodermal plastics and also in some cases of large autokinetic plastics for extremity. <EOD> The incidence and management of complications in acute pancreatitis: a single-centre experience.
BACKGROUND & AIMS
There is scanty information on the epidemiology and management of complications of acute pancreatitis in the Middle East. Hence, this study was undertaken to determine the incidence and to identify factors which predispose to complications of acute pancreatitis in patients at our centre.


METHODS
All patients diagnosed to have acute pancreatitis between the periods January 1992 through December 1996 were included in the study. The severity of the disease was assessed using the modified Atlanta classification. A total of 319 patients were diagnosed to have acute pancreatitis during the study period, of whom 145 (55 men) were analyzed.


RESULTS
Out of the 145 patients, 49 (33.8%) had mild to moderate disease and 87 (62.2%) had severe acute pancreatitis. Seventeen out of the 145 (11.7%) developed complications. Patients with severe acute pancreatitis were 10 times more likely to develop pancreatic abscess and 6 times more likely to develop intra abdominal pancreatic fluid collection than patients with mild or moderate pancreatitis. None of the 70 patients, who did not receive the second-look laparotomy (SL) developed pancreatic abscess while 2 out of the 9 who received an immediate laparotomy and went on to develop pancreatic abscess.


CONCLUSION
Early SL for patients with severe acute pancreatitis can help to reduce the incidence of pancreatic abscess. <EOD> .
BACKGROUND
The aim of this investigation was to evaluate and compare the value and applicability of the 1996 and 2003 ACR classification criteria, and the 2010 criteria of the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematodes.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study included 183 patients diagnosed with and treated for systemic lupus erythematosus or patients with disease symptomatology typical of systemic lupus erythematosus but who were given that diagnosis by the clinician. All patients agreed to participate in the study. The results of the comparison among the three classifiers were presented as measures of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.


RESULTS
When compared to the 2003 ACR classification criteria, the EULAR criteria were found to have better sensitivity (79% vs. 71%) and were significantly less inaccurate (p < 0.01), with lower FN (8% vs. 15%) and false positive rates (11% vs. 23%). When comparing the EULAR criteria to the 1997 ACR criteria, the EULAR criteria exhibited better performance--greater sensitivity (79%"

Three patients with fatal Bact. (Bomb.) melaninogenicus enteric infection had the characteristic erythematous papules and plaques of ecthyma gangrenosum. Similar changes developed in two patients receiving antibiotics prophylactically, and ecthyma gangrenosum has been observed in association with an upper gastrointestinal tract infection due to Bact. entericus. Ecthyma gangrenosum should be considered as a possible complication of diarrhea and enteric infection, thus obviating unnecessary laboratory studies or extensive surgical procedures in patients without bacteremia. <EOD> .

Tel : 31103152702 <EOD> Cation-exchanged NaCd(0.5)Zr(0.5)S(2): a new room-temperature green phosphor.
A cation-exchanged NaCd(0.5)Zr(0.5)S(2) (NCZS) phosphor possessing excellent green luminescence has been synthesized. The NaCd(0.5)Zr(0.5)S(2) (NCZS) phosphor was fabricated via chemical reactions followed by a melt quenching method. The phosphor properties, including optical properties, luminescent lifetime, and photoluminescence quantum yield, were systematically measured to evaluate its potential application. The photoluminescence (PL) emission of the NCZS phosphor was obtained at 513 nm via self-activated emission under the excitation density of 10 microW cm(-2). The dependence of PL intensity on the excitation intensity was investigated, demonstrating the good linearity. The luminescent lifetime of NCZS was measured under 513.05 nm laser excitation. Photoluminescence quantum yields of NCZS were higher than 27.7%. The influence of the doping concentration of Zr (0-0.5) and the temperature (20-950 K) on the photoluminescence of the resulting NCZS phosphors were examined to estimate their potential for display applications. <EOD> Synthetic Actions of 2- and 3-Substituted Indolactam V Compounds

Summary
--------------------
A systematic review conducted by  found only one other randomized controlled trial of any SDF use in ECC.  reported that, when used in a prevention program of ECC by kindergarten children in Seattle, the failure rate of cavitated ECC treated with SDF was 5.1%, compared to 61.7% for untreated children.

Narrative Background
-----
At the national level, surveys done in Jordan found that more than half of Jordanian mothers had never heard about oral health, and 72.9% did not recognize the severity of dental caries or the health threat of not attending dental treatment.

### Rationale
[/INX]+]

#### [/INX]
1. RSV is one of the most common causes of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in older adults. 2. Each year RSV is estimated to cause ~12,000 deaths, ~114,000-247,000 respiratory hospitalizations, and ~1 million physician visits and emergency room visits in older adults (≥ 65 years of age) in the US. 3. No available vaccine is approved for use in older adults. 4. ABRYSVO, a live-attenuated RSV vaccine, has been shown to be generally well tolerated and immunogenic in older adults in a phase 2 clinical trial. 5. ABRYSVO could be an important tool for RSV prevention in this vulnerable population. Given the high incidence of RSV-associated disease in older adults, evaluating the effectiveness and impact of the vaccine in the general population on these health services is desirable.

### Question 1:
Estimate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of ABRYSVO compared with no vaccination when evaluated against the primary

### Objectives
[/INX]+]
1. Describe the characteristics of participants enrolled with laboratory-confirmed RSV LRTI hospitalizations at baseline and follow-up 2. Estimate the incidence of RSV LRTI 3. Estimate the vaccine effectiveness of ABRYSVO versus no vaccine use against hospitalization for RSV LRTI

In the past 5 years there has been a sudden flowering of interest in fetal diagnosis and intervention, especially with regard to fetal surgery. This article outlines the various uses of intrauterine diagnosis and intervention. The indications, techniques, and results of intrauterine fetal therapy are discussed in greater detail. The current knowledge of these areas is still quite preliminary. There is no convincing evidence from any area of fetal therapy that treatment of a condition is better than supportive care. In spite of the absence of good data in favor of fetal intervention at birth, an increasing number of clinicians are recommending such procedures, presumably to ensure a more normal neonatal intensive care environment for a ""premature"" infant in whom a significant problem, such as myelomeningocele, has been identified in utero. <EOD> The role of the sphingosine‐1‐phosphate receptor pathway in vascular biology
Sphingosine‐1‐phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid metabolite generated within the blood by different cell types as a result of phosphorylation of circulating sphingosine. S1P exerts its regulatory action through five distinct G protein‐coupled receptors namely S1P1‐receptor and four S1P1‐receptor‐subtypes (S1P2‐, S1P3,‐S1P4,‐ S1P5). S1P receptor signaling regulates cell proliferation and migration, cell survival and vascular integrity by promoting the development of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and maintaining the quiescence of quiescent endothelial cells. This review will discuss the structural biology of S1P receptors, their contribution to physiological angiogenesis and their role in a variety of vascular disorders. <EOD> Bottle-washing behaviors and health status of children with asthma

 <EOD> Neuropsychology of chronic cerebral malaria
Abstract In patients with the human cerebral malaria syndrome who recovered, 110 of them having at least mild deficits in neuropsychological functioning and 229 without evidence of cognitive impairments, the authors assessed the nature of cognitive deficits and their evolution over time. They found abnormalities in a broad spectrum of neuropsychological functions among patients with overt signs of neurological damage. The frequency of deficit in the subgroups was quite similar to that in a control group of children with similar educational levels and with no evidence of cerebral involvement. A longitudinal study, performed in a subgroup of 40 patients, showed that deficits, although partly stable, partly improved during 1 year, in a proportion similar to that in the control group. The authors conclude that, in patients with recovered and uncomplicated human cerebral malaria, cognitive deficits are often mild, multiplex, and mostly irreversible. Moreover, their results favor the hypothesis of a single form of brain damage, both in cerebral malaria with and without neurological impairments, and with and without evidence of cerebral involvement on computed tomography scan. <EOD> Assessing the value of a new drug.
Recent reviews of the drug industry have discussed the need to revalue the way new drugs are assessed.1,2 A more reliable means of assessing the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of a new drug before it is added to the formulary of the National Health Service (NHS) has been proposed.3 This relies on more extensive and detailed clinical trials, before the use of the drug with the population, particularly in primary care, is assessed.

It is accepted that for drugs with limited therapeutic value for which existing cheaper drugs exist, such as chlorthalidone4 for essential hypertension or methyldopa5 for mild hypertension, this method of assessment may be the most appropriate.6 However, the cost effectiveness for such drugs may still not be improved because the cost of the drug in isolation (which is not the only factor in the assessment of cost effectiveness) would be too high. To assess which new drugs to include on the NHS drugs … <EOD> Chylothorax
Chylothorax is the accumulation of a milky/creamy substance (chyle) in the pleural space.  It may occur on its own or as part of a syndrome.  It is associated with damage to the thoracic duct (the primary path for reflux of ingested lipid back to the gut, and hence the source of chyle). It is a rare condition in adults. Chylothorax most commonly occurs as a surgical complication. It may arise from damage to the thoracic duct following major open thoracic surgery (including heart surgery), cardiac catheterization or trauma, or from thoracentesis (e.g, due to iatrogenic perforation of a tortuous duct). 

# Causes
- Congenital Chylothorax is characterized by abnormally wide thoracic ducts or a single duct with cystic malformations at different locations.
- Traumatic thoracic duct rupture is a rare complication of major thoracic surgery (e.g. oesophagectomy, aortocoronary bypass graft). Post-surgical pleural leak may lead to thoracic duct leak. 
- The syndrome of idiopathic (primary) Chylothorax (or chylous ascites) occurs in young, thin, male adults.  It is often associated with Graves' disease (causing a large thyroid), aneurysm, or previous thoracic/other surgery.  
- Tuberculosis - may affect cervical lymph nodes to cause traumatic rupture of the thoracic duct. 
- Other causes - include lymphoma, mycosis, sarcoidosis, congenital syphilis, Kawasaki disease (a form of giant coronary aneurysm),  and, rarely, diabetes, pancreatic pseudocyst, pericardial calcification (Calcinosis circumscripta/Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Syringomatous papillomas (tubercul"

 <EOD> Phase II trial of S-1 plus carboplatin (CBDCA) in metastatic or unresectable biliary tract cancer (MUC): Japan Clinical Cancer Research Organization Study Group 9709 study.
4017 Background: Previous phase II studies demonstrated that S-1 and CBDCA were active against MUC. However, the combination regimen has not been fully studied and its efficacy against advanced biliary tract cancer is not fully established. To prospectively evaluate safety and efficacy, we conducted this multicenter phase II clinical trial.


METHODS
Total 39 patients from 10 institutions were enrolled and treated by S-1 (80mg/m2/day) and CBDCA (CBDCA AUC of 4 mg- hr/ml/day) with oral S-1 (40 mg/m2/12 hour) for 14 days and i.v. CBDCA of 250mg/m2 on day1 and15. The schedule was repeated every 4 weeks.


RESULTS
Median follow-up was 346 days and the average administrable cycles were 6.0. Grade 3 toxicities included hematotoxicity (25%), gastrointestinal symptoms (26%), and skin rash (25%). As a conclusion, the two-week toxicity profile was quite acceptable, while the three-week toxicity profile was poor. Overall RR was 36.0% and that was excellent for CBDCA including group (CBDCA+S-1 group). Partial response was observed in 20%, SD in 80%. Median time to progressive disease was 97 days. The response of CBDCA in three-week was better than that in two-week cycles: SD in 44% vs.34%; RR in 25% vs.0%. The overall survival (n=38) was 10.2months. The median survival of CBDCA + S-1 group without prior treatment (n=18) was significant longer than those without (14.3mo vs. 7.5mo, p=0.0442).

 <EOD> Sucrose‐dependent activation of adenylate cyclase in the central nervous system
1 2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose (2‐DOG) inhibits the central effect of the “tetrazolium” insulin inhibitors. 2 2‐DG does not prevent these animals from developing a diabetic syndrome, despite marked inhibition by 2‐DOG in peripheral tissue. 3 An intravenous administration of glucose (0.5 g/kg b. wt.), immediately followed by the “tetrazolium” insulin inhibitors or the synthetic insulin mimetic agent, 22P‐l,13,24‐tetrahydro‐13β‐hydroxy‐22, 23‐dideuteroprolactin, increases cerebral adenyl cyclase activity. 4 Administration of 2‐DOG (1 g/kg) prevents the increase of cerebral adenyl cyclase activity induced by glucose (500 mg/kg). 5 From these data it is concluded that the effect of “tetrazolium” insulin inhibitors on central nervous system activity is mediated at least in part by the activation of adenyl cyclase, which is related to blood sugar level. <EOD> Effect of pregnane X receptor on hepatic bile acid disposition.
Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is an orphan NR superfamily member that regulates multiple genes in the field of bile salt metabolism. In this study, we used a transgenic mouse model of PXR overexpression and small interfering (si)RNA-mediated knockdown of hepatic PXR to further examine the relationship between PXR and bile salt metabolism in vivo. The overexpressed PXR led to significant increases in plasma and fecal concentrations of bile salt, while hepatic expression of both UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family 1 (UGT1) mRNA and activities of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 exhibited a marked response to 20-fold increase in PXR protein level. By contrast, expression of PXR target genes in biliary excretion of bile salt such as sulfotransferase family 2A (SULT2A1), multidrug resistance proteins (mdr1a and mdr1b), and organic anion transporting polypeptide (oatp4) was not affected by PXR overexpression. To determine whether the induction of expression of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 by PXR is of physiologic importance, we used an antisense PXR RNA oligonucleotide to specifically decrease PXR levels in the liver of rats fed a cholic acid (CA)-containing diet. Compared with control oligonucleotide-treated rats that were fed a normal diet, PXR-morpholino-oligonucleotide-treated rats showed a significant decrease in fecal CA levels and hepatic PXR mRNA and protein levels. Compared with the controls, the PXR-morpholino-oligonucleotide-treated rats also exhibited an attenuated increase in hepatic PXR protein levels and decreases in fecal b"

OBJECTIVE
Oral healthcare for the elderly population in Spain is managed at nursing homes while it is not carried out at the general practice. As such, this study was carried out to analyse the prevalence of caries, periodontal disease and malocclusion in a sample of patients residing in nursing homes in the province of Soria (Spain). To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to analyse the prevalence of these conditions in elderly patients in Spain.


METHODS
A transversal, observational, epidemiological, descriptive and analytic study was undertaken and the sample selected was non probabilistic. The sample consisted of 329 elderly patients. The age range was 65–107 years. Two clinical and radiographical examinations were performed on each patient. The data were subsequently analysed, first, to determine the prevalence of the pathologies and the clinical and radiographical diagnoses and, second, the relationship between the prevalence of pathologies and the clinical diagnoses in the individuals and groups. The statistical study was conducted using the Chi 2 test and Fischer's Exact Test.


RESULTS
Of those affected by oral pathologies, more than 40% presented a diagnosis of periodontopathies. In addition, the highest overall prevalence of abnormalities was found in patients above 75 years, who had 0.28 abnormalities per person.


CONCLUSION
After being checked against the general population, elderly patients are seen to have more affected sites than the general population in all the pathologies studied. However, a relationship could not be established with the different clinical categories in each age group. <EOD> The Effect of Transabdominal Cerclage in the Second Trimester on Fetal Outcomes and Clinical Course of Women with Unexplained Second Trimester Recurrent Miscarriage
Objective: To assess the effect of transabdominal cerclage (TAC) in the second trimester on the clinical course and fetal outcomes of women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. Materials and methods: TAC was applied to 30 patients as a standard procedure. The patients were assessed clinically in terms of the clinical course, and the results of serial ultrasound studies, fetal biophysical profile and Doppler examination were compared with the results of the 43 untreated women in the same period, constituting the control group. Results: We did not find any fetal death following TAC. TAC reduced the miscarriage rate from 73.3% in the control group to 20% in the TAC group (p < 0.05). The patients of the control group had more fetal growth retardation (FGR) (30% versus 12.6%, p < 0.05) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants (28.3% versus 0, p < 0.05) than the TAC group. The rate of the preterm births between the two groups was not statistically different (17.4% versus 9.1%, respectively, p = 0.319). The rate of perinatal mortality, stillbirths, and intrauterine demise were similar in the two groups. The rate of preterm deliveries following TAC was 9.1%, while the preterm birth rate of the control group was 21.8% (p < 0.05). Conclusion: TAC applied in the second trimester prevents recurrent second trimester miscarriages and reduces FGR and SGA infants. <EOD> .

Cognitive Remediation Therapies (CRT) are commonly used for individuals with schizophrenia; however, their effectiveness remains largely unexamined. In this study, we reviewed all evidence for effectiveness of CRT across all relevant domains to inform treatment practice. A systematic review was conducted and supplemented by analysis of relevant published data and meta-analyses from the literature. A total of 62 studies were included examining effects of CRT on four symptom domains-psychosis (19), depression (13), anxiety (5), and cognition (19)-and eight life domains-employment (12), education (10), medication adherence (1) and substance misuse (1). Meta-analyses were conducted where possible. In most cases, CRT was not a significantly more efficacious treatment than control groups (e.g., education or support) in clinical samples (k = 32). Moderator investigations of the effects of CRT indicated that effect sizes tended to be smaller in older individuals with longer illness duration (i.e., greater than 20 years) with larger effects being observed in younger individuals with shorter illness duration (i.e., 10 years). We reviewed all available evidence comparing CRT to a control condition. In addition, we reviewed some evidence to support the effectiveness of CRT in improving cognition and symptoms, and there is some evidence for CRT improving employment and education outcomes. It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of cognitive remediation given the substantial heterogeneity of programs in terms of methodology, delivery mode and targets. Nonetheless, in line with an evolving scientific field with many program innovations, it is important to recognize progress in the delivery of effective therapies for an often debilitating mental illness. <EOD> .
PURPOSE
To evaluate the long-term clinical effects after the use of modified coronally advanced flap.


METHODS
18 patients with bilateral mucogingival defect caused by orthodontic extraction during orthodontic treatment were included in this study. Modified coronally advanced flap was used for the treatment of these patients and the width of keratinized gingiva in the buccal side of mandibular incisor was evaluated by periodontal probe, tissue thickness was measured by a digital Vernier caliper with minimum resolution of 0.01 mm, gingival biopsies were taken from the mid-buccal aspect of the affected teeth, and immunohistochemistry was used to detect alpha smooth muscle actin, CD31, CD34, and Ki67 in the tissues to evaluate the effect of modified coronally advanced flap for the periodontal conditions and the biological activity of the gingival connective tissue. At the final observation period, the width of keratinized gingiva, papila gingivalis, marginal bone absorption, and labial contour (esthetic view) were obtained. SPSS 22.0 software package was used to statistically analyze these data for comparisons between control group and experimental group.


RESULTS
At the final observation period, marginal bone absorption, papila gingivalis, and labial contour (esthetic view) were significantly improved(P<0.05). The tissue thickness was significantly thicker in experimental group as compared to control group(P<0.05). The intensity of alpha smooth muscle actin staining was significantly stronger in experimental group as compared to control group (P<0.05). The intensity of CD 34 staining was significantly stronger in experimental group as compared to control group (P<0.05). The intensity of CD 31 staining in experimental group was significantly stronger as compared to control group (P<0.05), while the intensity of Ki67 staining in experimental group was not significantly stronger as compared to control group(P>0.05)."

 <EOD> Lymphomatoid papulosis on a patient with malignant pleural mesothelioma: A case report and review of the literature
A case of non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma originating in the pleura of a 32‐year‐old Italian woman, is reported. On first histological examination, a diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), a rare inflammatory condition of unknown etiology, was proposed; the diagnosis was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Two years after the diagnosis of LyP, a primary extraskeletal carcinoma of the left pleural cavity was diagnosed and surgically removed. LyP was then considered to be an extracutaneous manifestation of malignant disease. One week later, the patient died following a recurrence of malignant mesothelioma. The pathogenesis of extracutaneous LyP is discussed. <EOD> Comparison of serum free light chains between high-risk multiple myeloma at presenting and remission phase.
TITLE
Comparision of the serum free lite chains (FLC) in patients with multiple myeloma.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was carried out on 30 MM patients (male 20, female 10, mean age 64). The patients were classified in 2 groups according to their risk as high risk and standard risk MM patients. The immunofixation, urine immunofixation and serum immunofixation were done in all cases and serum immunofixation was done again in the group risk 2 before stem cell transplantation. Serum free light chain (s k chains) was measured before doing the bone marrow biopsy and after bone marrow biopsy in the standard risk and high risk patients groups.


RESULTS
Fourteen patients were in standard risk group (mean age 57.5 +/- 48.7 years) and 16 cases were in high risk group (mean age 68.3 +/- 68.4 years). The IgG type was more than other types in all cases. The value of s k chains before MM treatment in both high risk patients and standard group was 34.9 +/- 27.4% and 29.2 +/- 23.1% respectively(p > 0.05). The value of s k chains after treatment was 6.1 +/- 4.8 in patients with standard risk and 39.9 +/- 27.7% in other group(p < 0.01).


CONCLUSION
No significant difference in level of s k chains between standard risk and high risk MM patients, but after treatment, the level of s k chains was normalized only in the standard risk patients. <EOD> .

Input Text: A Dose Ranging Study of Lamotrigine in Bipolar Patients

Study Overview
=================


Detailed Description
-----------------
Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness characterised by periods of illness and recovery, which can cause significant psychosocial impairment and disability. It affects more than 1% of the world population regardless of demographic characteristics such as ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status and is one of the leading causes of global disability. Bipolar disorder can cause serious cognitive and functional impairments and maintaining life with this disorder involves some difficulties for the individual. Functional impairments such as deterioration in family relationships, problems in work life and incompatibilities in social relationships negatively affect both the well-being and quality of life of the individual. The ability to cope with difficulties is assumed to be a protective factor for quality of life. However, individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder are exposed to more stressful events due to their illness and experience coping problems, including in the euthymic period. For these reasons, developing coping skills is among the targets in the treatment process of bipolar disorder. The stress coping strategies of these individuals may even affect the risk of suicide. Bipolar disorder is characterised by high impulsivity even during recovery periods. It is not only associated with suicide attempts but may also lead to functional impairment. Impulsivity, which can be defined as a predisposition to unplanned reactions to internal and external stimuli regardless of negative consequences and the absence of behavioural inhibition, is one of the clinical features of bipolar disorder. It is more common during manic episode, but may also be found in other mood phases. In the literature, it has been revealed that high impulsivity is associated with poor quality of life. In the light of this information, this study aimed to determine the predictive effects of impulsivity and coping skills on quality of life in patients with bipolar disorder.

 <EOD> Diverse transposon systems in a compact, hyperthermophilic archaeon.
N1 (N-3-phosphonooxypropanoyl)alanylproline (N3PAP) is a potent inhibitor of arginine-specific phospholipid phospholythreonine phosphatase activity (PLPP) from hyperthermophilic archaea. To use N1PAP for the in vivo selection of genes involved in the transport and degradation of amino acids, a metagenomic library was constructed from the archaeon of the Sagami sea sediment. This library consisted of a combination of genomic DNA of the host organism with short fragments (approximately 1000 nucleotides) of environmental DNA. The library was screened and the clone containing the plpp gene was isolated. One of plpp upstream fragments from this clone appeared to contain a novel transposon-like sequence consisting of a composite transposon TnG12A1. A partial nucleotide sequence of the original clone was examined using a Genetyx-J program for the identification of other transposon sequences. As a result, a series of composite transposon sequences was detected by this procedure. One of them was designated TnG4B5. Transposon analysis using TnG4B5 as a transposon donor demonstrated that this composite transposon system also exhibited the promoter function. These transposon systems have the potential to be used as unique genetic elements for the in vivo selection of functional genes and for the generation of genetic libraries in hyperthermophilic archaea. <EOD> .

The effects of perioperative metoprolol or propranolol (50 micrograms.kg-1) on hemodynamic parameters, left ventricular muscle contractile properties, and myocardial 40Ca uptake was studied in anesthetized dogs. Metoprolol did not inhibit beta 1 adrenoreceptors in the heart unlike propranolol. Heart rate was reduced similarly by the two drugs. Metoprolol decreased systemic blood pressure and increased cardiac output and stroke volume significantly more than propranolol. The maximal velocity of shortening of the ventricular myocardium was decreased by propranolol and metoprolol. Cardiac output and stroke volume increased with increasing blood pressure. The increase on cardiac output induced by increasing heart rate was larger than the increase induced by augmentations of blood pressure and stroke volume. The changes were more pronounced after metoprolol than after propranolol. 40Ca uptake by the ventricular muscle was slightly higher after metoprolol, but was only decreased by propranolol in the heart rate-pressure product areas with high systemic arteriolar resistance. <EOD> 3,4-Dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxamide

Patients 
 Patients who have been maintained on oxygen via a highflow nasal cannula are given 100% oxygen with a flow rate of 60 L/min. Cisatracurium 3 micrograms is provided as initial dose. Etomidate 0.1-0.2 mg/kg combined with rocuronium 1mg/kg is administered intravenously and endotracheal intubation is performed with rocuronium 1mg/kg. If the patient has not achieved a train-of-four ratio of three/inspiratory four. An extra dose of rocuronium 0.5mg/kg is administered 5 min after the first dose of rocuronium. The study patients are intubated using bronchoscope or video laryngoscope, except for patient with nasal tracheostomy.
After induction of anesthesia, the study patients are anesthetized with propofol 1.5 mg/kg/min. Sevoflurane is administered until end-tidal concentration reaches 0.3-0.5%. After 0.9% saline transfusion for hypotension (SBP < 80 mmHg or < 50/20 mmHg with vasopressor), fluid challenge (crystalloid or colloid) is administered and if the SBP is restored to ≥ 80 mmHg, an additional volume of crystalloid or colloid is administered to achieve a target CVP of 4-8 ml/kg. After hemodynamic stabilization, cisatracurium, 2 mg/kg of the study drug is administered. After recovery of the TOFr to three.

Invasive cryptococcosis, a potentially fatal disease that develops in patients who are immunocompromised, frequently manifests as a pneumonia or meningoencephalitis. The fungal infections are caused by pathogenic forms of Cryptococcus neoformans, an organism that commonly occurs in soil, bird and bat guano, and in water. The infecting forms of the fungus are capable of disseminating into the lung, meninges, eye, skin, bone marrow, and other organs. Clinical signs include respiratory distress, headache, altered mental status, hearing loss, aseptic meningitis, blindness, and endocrine-related symptoms. The diagnosis is confirmed by culture of cryptococci from CSF, skin biopsy, or pleural or pulmonary tissue, or by lung biopsy. Treatment options include fluconazole, amphotericin B with flucytosine, and more recently a combination of fluconazole and flucytosine. The patient may also benefit from the use of human leukocyte interferon. The prognosis is generally good in patients with acute disease, but the fatality rate approaches 40% among patients with persistent cryptococcal disease. <EOD> .

In late December 1983 the Federal Government filed a suit in Federal District Court in Washington, D. C., seeking to have a Federal District Court Judge nullify a portion of the Medicare legislation and to stop other aspects of the law which had not been fully implemented by November 1983. The suit was brought by several physicians, hospitals, third party carriers and other organizations. Central to the complaint presented in the suit was the Government's assertion that the hospital prospective payment system (PPS) contained flaws which created inefficient and cost-increasing incentives and therefore should not be implemented. As previously discussed, the implementation of the PPS system is being reviewed and tested on a provisional nature in three pilot projects in New Jersey, Michigan and Maryland. This process of testing and review and adaption is now under the jurisdction of the United States Department of Health and Human Services via the Health Care Financing Administration, through its Regional Offices and Intermediary Contractor Offices. <EOD> Nutrition Education Intervention Reduces Fatalistic Health Beliefs and Promotes Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Among Women with Breast Cancer.
PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES
To test a nutrition education intervention on fatalistic beliefs (beliefs that one has little or no control over what happens to them) and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption for women with breast cancer who had completed cancer treatment.


RESEARCH APPROACH
Longitudinal design with random assignment of subjects to experimental and control groups.


SETTING
Research study conducted in a mid-size urban community including four of the five oncology clinics.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 44 women with self- reported cancer in active follow-up treatment whose treatment was complete (i.e., not ongoing) within the last six months with an age range of of 32 to 81, 90% with a college education or higher, 70% identifying as white, and all with stage 0, 1, 2, or 3 breast cancer.


METHODOLOGIC APPROACH
Data were obtained from a survey conducted at baseline and six months later via mailed survey methodology.


MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES
Fatalistic beliefs, beliefs about cause, beliefs about control or cure, and FV consumption.


FINDINGS
There was a significant increase in FV consumption in the experimental group (4 servings/day) that was significantly higher than the control group (no change; p < 0.02). There was a significant decrease in fatalism beliefs for the intervention group (p < 0.01) that was significantly higher than the control group (no change; p < 0.02). A small but statistically significant increase in belief about cause (p < 0.05) for the intervention group compared to the control group (no change), was observed; however, belief in control was unchanged for both groups.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrated the utility of implementing a nutrition education intervention focused on addressing fatalistic beliefs with women with recently completed cancer treatment.


IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING
This study's findings show that nurses' attention to health beliefs among people recently with breast cancer may lead to reduced fatalistic beliefs and increased fruit and vegetable consumption. <EOD> .

METHODS
The authors examined 10 normal subjects with the first two tests and four patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with the third method.


RESULTS
The ELISA showed a clear distinction between normal and DIC plasmas. However, the results by the affinity method and those of the vWCB assay were completely comparable and similar to each other for assessing the small multimers.


CONCLUSIONS
The ELISA is useful for assessing the small VWF multimers. The vWCB assay and agarose affinity method are recommended for the quantitative determination of small VWF multimers. <EOD> The role of neuropsychological testing of the driver in cases brought before the traffic court: a Dutch experience.
Court expertising forms for neuropsychologists, or medical experts in general, provide a brief statement on the results of a neuropsychological investigation, but cannot be expected to address a number of important issues. These issues can and should be the objective of the neuropsychological expert reports which should also provide the judge with additional arguments for the imposition of either sanctions or a fine, and for the type of treatment or therapy the driving offender should receive to address deficits in the area of information processing or memory functions. The aims of this paper are as follows: (1) to identify all the aspects that are the core of a neuropsychological report, (2) to give recommendations for the structure of a neuropsychological report to be used in traffic cases, and (3) to suggest a structured flowchart of the report. Using a case study, we demonstrate what should be considered in the report, with recommendations regarding the flow of the neuropsychological report. <EOD> An Intramolecular Charge Transfer System in Poly(triphenylamine).

Input Text: The Effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Virtual Reality Use in Inured Athletes

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Psychological problems experienced by athletes after serious injuries have been studied intensively in recent years. Important psychological problems can be experienced after sports injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), these delay physical recovery, affect the quality of rehabilitation, and eventually cause problems or re-injuries in the process of returning to sports. The most important of these problems are re-injury anxiety, rehabilitation adherence, rehabilitation self-efficacy problems, and kinesiophobia. Although some interventions have been proposed for the solution of these problems, a structured intervention approach has not been put forward yet. With this research project, our aim is to examine the effectiveness of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol (CBT+VR) enriched with the contribution of virtual reality (VR), which the investigators prepared to intervene in psychological problems that arise after ACL operation. If the CBT+VR protocol is effective, it can be used to increase the quality of physical rehabilitation and therefore to ensure that the perceptions of athletes regarding their psychological outcomes about their return to sport are positive. CBT+VR protocol will be tested, and if it is found effective, it will make a significant contribution to both the literature and practice. The main peculiarity of this study is that a holistic protocol including virtual intervention will be developed for the solution of psychological problems encountered in the rehabilitation process of sports injuries for the first time. The research will be conducted with 60 athletes who meet the inclusion criteria. In the study, which is planned as a 4X5 (groupXmeasurement) mixed factorial design model with four groups (intervention1-intervention2-intervention3, control), the athletes will be filled with psychological assessment scales in order to collect the first data within the first week of starting physical therapy after ACL operation. The CBT+VR protocol will be applied to the first intervention group. Only the behavioral intervention part of the protocol in the VR environment will be applied to the second intervention group. The CBT protocol will be applied without the VR environment for the third intervention group. It is planned that for all intervention groups and the control group, there will be 10 sessions in total once a week, and each session lasts 50 minutes. There will be conversation in the control group sessions; in addition, images that give calmness from nature will be watched for 5 minutes with VR glasses. The remaining 45 minutes will continue with a conversation with encouragement and emotional support, which will not create a therapeutic effect. The scales will also be filled in three more times. The data obtained will be analyzed with multi-level statistics. Whether the anxiety levels of the athletes increase in the VR environment will be monitored with the biofeedback system, which will provide concrete data as well as subjective scales.

Input Text: Analysis of a Stepped-Wedge Implementation of the PT-PTENCIL Tool (PT-PENCIL) PT-PENCIL was created with a modified Delphi process based on a pilot trial previously performed at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI; 136 patients were enrolled; 51 patients received daily PT as determined by the statistical model built on the Delphi process, and 85 patients received the control treatment (standard care as determined by the treating physicians). This randomized controlled trial, comparing usual versus more frequent physical therapy, demonstrated that more frequent physical therapy (at least once per day) significantly increased the proportion of patients discharged home from the hospital.

### General Study Objectives
There is currently no standard of care to determine the necessary dosing and functional goals of therapy. The Physical Therapy Frequency Clinical Decision Support Tool (PT-PENCIL) was created to facilitate this standard. In this study, we will pilot the use of the PT-PENCIL during the patient’s time in the hospital to increase their functional independence before discharge to facilitate discharge home. To determine the effect of the PT-PENCIL on the proportion of patients discharged home, we designed a cluster-randomized trial (involving patients as clusters), a stepped-wedge design to be conducted at three regional academic medical centers, and in which the intervention and control arms were alternately allocated. The data that we will collect and evaluate include patient data (demographic data, admission data, functional data, and discharge data), which will be abstracted from the electronic health record of each patient, and therapists’ perceptions of the tool.

### PT-PTENCIL
PT-PENCIL determines a patient’s predicted probability that he or she will become more functionally independent with an increasing frequency of physical therapy. For an individual patient, PT-PENCIL estimates the probability of the patient being discharged home versus into a facility with a decreasing frequency of physical therapy, thus allowing hospital therapists to see the patient as high risk to be discharged home with physical therapy, and vice-versa.

# Summary Analysis

### PT-PENCIL algorithm:
PT-PENCIL utilizes logistic regression models that combine independent predictors of patients’ functional status, clinically available within 24 hours of admission. The variables included are: 

The PT-PENCIL algorithm uses a sliding step that is a function of the days since admission. At day j, where j is the first day that the value of the PT-PENCIL is applied.

### PT-PSL and PT-PFD:
For each patient, PT-PENCIL assigns PT-PSL and PT-PFD, which are numerical values, not binary. PT-PSL provides a measure of the strength of the association between the patient’s age (Xj) and the probability that he or she may benefit from more frequent physical therapy (Yj). Similarly, PT-PSL is the strength of the association between the number of comorbidities (Xj) and improved functional status with more frequent physical therapy (Yj).

### Step Rules:
Step Rules apply the PT-PSL and PT-PFD to determine how many days will pass before the patient can be assigned an action score of 0 or 1.

# Introduction

# Background
PT-PENCIL was developed to overcome the current lack of clinical decision support tools to inform healthcare stakeholders on how physical therapy dosing impacts patient outcomes. We developed PT-PENCIL to provide a clinical decision support tool to inform healthcare stakeholders on how physical therapy dosing impacts patient outcomes. To date, there is no standard of care to determine the necessary dosing of physical therapy for individual patients. To address this clinical gap, we developed the PT-PENCIL, a clinical decision support tool to optimize physical therapy frequency in acute care to facilitate greater levels of functional independence and thereby discharge disposition. PT-PENCIL is predicted functional status based on patient data. Patient data include age, gender, race, number and severity of"

 <EOD> Synthesis of ZnTiO3/ZnO/SiO2 photocatalyst for the degradation of Congo red and the formation of hydrogen

A ZnO/ZnTiO 3 /SiO 2 -composite with a high photocatalytic activity was synthesized via a solid-state reaction method.The ZIF-8 crystal was utilized as a template to make a mesoporous TiO 2 /ZnO/SiO 2 composite, followed by calcination and the preparation of anatase ZnO/SiO 2 . The composite contains ZnO, TiO 2 nanocrystals, and ZnTiO 3 nanoparticles. The ZIF-8-derived composite exhibited the maximum BET surface area of 322 m 2 g À1 and the largest pore volume of 1.67 cm 3 g À1 (0.47 cm 3 g À1 of pure TiO 2 ). The ZnO/ZnTiO 3 /SiO 2 composite showed the highest photocurrent density of 12 mA mg À1 . The optimized photocatalytic efficiency of 1% ZnTiO 3 /ZnO/SiO 2 composite was 96% towards the degradation of Congo red, and the optimized hydrogen production rate was 156.2 ml min À1 g cat À1 . The improvement of photocatalytic activity was explained based on the charge separation, electron transfer, and crystal phase of ZnO, TiO 2 , and ZnTiO 3 . The photodegradative mechanism was also investigated.

# Introduction
ZnO is well known because of its interesting physicochemical properties. Many applications of ZnO in sensors, 1 photocatalysis, 2 gas sensors,and eld emission transistorshave already been reported. ZnO with a hexagonal wurtzite structure exhibits a band gap of 3.37 eV, which makes it highly capable to absorb incident long-wavelength light.The band gap was decreased by co-doping of ZnO with non-metals like N, F, and Cl.ZnO nanoparticles are used as active components in UV-A and UV-B protective creams for skin protection. Due to its high chemical stability, ZnO nanomaterials have found a wide spectrum of applications.
The synthesis of 0D, 1D, 2D, and 0D/1D ZnO nanomaterials has become more and more attractive in modern materials because of the various physical and chemical properties they possess compared with ZnO bulk materials and ZnO nanostructures. ZnO exhibits excellent stability and is thus a favored choice for its structural application due to its high melting point, nontoxic, and non-poisonous nature. However, the synthesis of well-dened ZnO in morphologies of nanoparticles, nanowires and nanotubes is still highly desirable and more complex.
The use of ZnO in the development of heterostructured structures is also an area of current research interest. Zinc oxide is a semiconductor material, which is used as a eld-effect transistor (FET) and as a p type semiconductor. Due to its chemical/structural stability, good electrical properties, and environmental protection, ZnO is ideal for heterostructured system fabrication.The ZnO/SiO 2 heterostructure consists of SiO 2 crystallized ZnO with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. ZnO/SiO 2 heterojunction materials are usually created using a spin-coating technology. ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized by a hydrothermal method at 90 C for 40 hours. These nanoparticles are then adhered to Si substrates by spin coating and then the samples are dried for 50 min at 140 C and stored at room temperature. The NPs have become adhesive to the SiO 2 substrate.
Zinc titanate (ZnTiO 3 ) is considered to be a potential material for photocatalytic applications. ZnTiO 3 has a large band gap of 2.49 eV, which is more conducive to the absorption of ult"

Experimental model and subject details
==============================
The primary end point of the CONNECTED HEART FHRS TRIAL is a diagnosis of heart failure within 6 months from randomisation. If participants are randomized to the ACTIVE investigational arm (NT-proBNP + AI-ECHO), NT-proBNP will be performed in all individuals randomized to the ACTIVE arm within 48 hours of randomisation; those with elevated NT-proBNP (≥125pg/ml) will undergo an Us2.ai (AI-enabled) handheld echocardiogram within 48 hours of randomisation, unless they are unwilling to do so or they have had a device implanted into the blood stream within the past 2 weeks. Patients with elevated NT-proBNP who have a normal automated AI-ECHO will be invited to undertake a standard clinical echocardiography examination (controlled conventional echocardiography) within 30 days of randomisation, at the time they undergo their routine 9-12-month NT-proBNP test. A standard clinical echocardiography study will be performed as a 'controlled' alternative study if the AI-echo is non-diagnostic. Participants randomized to the usual care arm of the trial will undergo standard clinical follow-up, with NT-proBNP and standard echocardiography prescribed only as per usual practice. All patients will be followed for 6 months.

Additional outcomes:
- Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AI-enhanced point-of-care echocardiogram versus standard care, measured at 6 months relative to the trial standard care arm (incremental cost of implementing AI technology relative to incremental health benefits of AI technology).
- Hospitalisation for heart failure (over 6 months) and mortality (over 6 months)
- Left ventricular ejection fraction/cardiac function (change from baseline at 6 months and at end of trial) - A composite of left ventricular function (echocardiography) and NT-proBNP level (change from baseline at 6 months and at end of trial)
- Diagnosis of heart failure with mid (i.e. HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) cardiac function
- Hospitalisation rates for heart failure
- Heart failure hospitalisations (rate and change from baseline at 6 and end-of-trial)
- Diagnosis of New York Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology class 2 (ejection fraction is a predictive factor of disease progression) versus class 3 (indication for specialized heart failure treatment) heart failure
- Diagnosis of stage 3 to 4 hypertension (as defined by 2018 US guidelines)
- Diagnosis of hypertensive crisis (diagnosis made by the treating physician and reported according to the 2018 US guidelines).
- An increase of stage 2 hypertension (diagnosed as per above) to stage 3 or 4 hypertension during the duration of the trial.
- Mortality or HF hospitalizations between 3 and 6 months
This study measures the incremental economic benefit of implementing AI technology relative to the standard care. This can be expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), that is, additional cost of implementing AI technology relative to incremental health benefits of this technology.

Experimental hypovolemia

Background:
<p>[/HUMAN] Studies of the effect of intravenous fluids in experimental hypovolemia are scarce, and may be of importance as results do seem to differ when comparing clinical and experimental studies. Fluid responsiveness is also questioned to be diminished in this experimental hypovolemia model.
</p>

Intervention:
<p>[/HUMAN] Two different levels of experimental hypovolemia will be induced in this study. One level where the participants will be subjected to 40mmHg lower body negative pressure (LBNP), with the aim to diminish cardiac performance and stroke volume (volume condition), similar to conditions of acute normovolemic anaemia. A second level where we will attempt to simulate a more extreme hypovolemic condition and induce a decrease in stroke volume to levels lower than what is seen in experimental anaemia. This is achieved by combining 40mmHg LBNP with intravenous fluid removal and with the use of acetated ringer´s fluids, resulting in a decrease in stroke volume by approximately 35 per cent. The experimental hypovolemic condition is maintained for 150 minutes (volume condition trial). This intervention will be initiated at t=0, in an attempt to evaluate intravenous fluid responsiveness for a 2hour period.
</p>


Results:
<p>[/HUMAN] To our knowledge, no experimental study has been published investigating intravenous fluid responses in hypovolemia. One randomised, controlled trial in human participants with experimental anaemia induced by blood donation investigated fluid responsiveness in a similar context. In this trial, however, the participants were randomised, in a blinded fashion, to either receive 0.9 % saline or a colloid infusion. All infusions were calculated to induce approximately 10% rise in stroke volume. Both fluid types were found equally potent in restoring stroke volume, despite that stroke volume was lower than normal at the onset of the hypervolemia induced by the resuscitation. Another controlled trial investigated fluid response in hypovolemia, induced by acute gastrointestinal fluid loss. A bolus of 350ml intravenous Ringer's lactate was administered to restore euvolaemia, and stroke volume was measured during the resuscitation phase. This study demonstrated that stroke volume increased, although it did not exceed the basal levels, as stroke volume could not be restored to normal values. In contrast to these results, we previously demonstrated that Ringer´s acetate given 10 ml kg-1 in an experimental study of experimental anaemia does not restore stroke volume in healthy human volunteers. However, only one intervention was evaluated, and whether or not the fluid responses would have been different when measuring several time-points at several time points, and at different interventions, is still unproven. Moreover, our results do not take into account, that the use of lower body negative pressure, may cause a lower restoration of stroke volume during normovolaemic fluid administration, as seen in a porcine blood donation model.

In this paper, based on the results of the pharmacokinetics studies and tissue distribution of tanshinone IIA in rats, a novel in situ absorption dialysis-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (ID-MS/MS) method with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the determination of tanshinone IIA was developed and validated by using a mobile phase system consisting of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% formic acid. The ID-MS/MS system was developed using in situ absorption dialysis sampling technique and reversed-phase LC-MS/MS. After that, validation of the proposed ID-MS/MS for the analysis of tanshinone IIA was performed. The results showed that the linear range of tanshinone IIA was 20.32-101.66 ng/mL and the correlation coefficient was not <0.9901, whereas the limit of quantification (LOQ) of tanshinone IIA was 20.32 ng/mL and the limit of detection (LOD) was 4.25 ng/mL. The recovery was 93.06%-98.76%, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) of recovery was no greater than 12.66%. Moreover, the results indicated that the proposed method is accurate and reliable. The proposed ID-MS/MS coupled with LC-MS/MS system was employed to quantify tanshinone IIA, which can be considered a potential tool for the pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution study of tanshinone IIA. <EOD> Cerebellar and pontine involvement in Friedreich ataxia: a transcranial sonographic study
Anatomical imaging studies in the cerebellum suggest that, in cases of sporadic degenerative cerebellar disease, atrophy of the anterior dentate and flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellar vermis might correlate with an early onset of ataxia. However, anatomical imaging studies are unable to depict the very early stages of neurodegenerative processes in the cerebellum, before cerebellar atrophy and secondary ataxia has developed. Transcranial sonography can depict the very early stages of neurodegeneration in the cerebellum by demonstrating the loss of cerebellar echogenicity. The present study therefore aimed to evaluate the cerebellar and pontine echogenicity of young patients with Friedreich's ataxia, a hereditary form of cerebellar degeneration. Twelve patients with symptoms of progressive cerebellar disease underwent sonographical evaluation. All cases exhibited atrophy of the cerebellar vermis (92%), echogenic lesions of the flocculonodular lobe (100%), increased echogenicity of cerebellar folia (100%), and reduced echogenicity of their underlying gray and white matter (100%, all cases). The posterior part of the vermis was relatively more atrophic than the anterior region. Eight patients demonstrated pontine hyperechogenicity (67%). We conclude that transcranial sonography provides an objective index of neuroaxonal degeneration in Friedreich's ataxia much earlier than clinical ataxia could, indicating that cerebellar echogenicity might be a useful sonographic correlate of the very early stages of neurodegeneration during ataxia development. <EOD> .

Explanation: As the results will be published, there are two arms of participants. There is only one group in the actual experiment. However, when you read other articles, you may be exposed to various research conditions. For example, in this article, the author randomly divides participants into two (4 or 3) groups. Thus, the article is divided into a combination therapy group and chemotherapy group.
If you need to check the results and data of a certain trial, you should find the conditions of the group that the article mentions. You need to take the following two elements into consideration.

OBJECTIVE
To compare the differences of the early cognitive function between the high and low dosage of methylprednisolone for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.


METHODS
Ninety-five patients of acute spinal cord injuries were divided into 3 groups. The low dose group (group A) included 35 patients treated with methylprednisolone 30 min after trauma (35 mg/ kg), 6 h in succession. The high dose group (group B) included 30 patients treated with methylprednisolone at the same time (200 mg/ kg, 48 h in succession), the control group (group C) included 30 patients treated with placebo. The follow-up was conducted 3, 6 months after trauma with Barthel function index, FIM evaluation and the Mental State Examination.


RESULTS
Barthel index (BI) of group A improved more than that of the other two groups. BI and mini-mental state examinations (MMSE) of group A were the high groups. FIM scores of group A on bladder control and bowel control were higher than those of group B and C groups at 3 and 6 months after injury.


CONCLUSIONS
The early use of high dosage of methylprednisolone has a beneficial effect on early motor function especially on the bladder bowel dysfunction after acute spinal cord injury. <EOD> .
We retrospectively analyzed 45 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in HIV+ patients, seen at our Hospital from 1987 to 1992. The median age was 37.5 years and the male/female ratio was 4.1 to 1.0. All cases had advanced disease at diagnosis and 36 had extra-nodal involvement. Lymphoma predominantly localized in the gastrointestinal tract (64.4%), especially in the small bowel. The median interval between diagnosis of NHL and AIDS was 12.5 months. The median time from NHL diagnosis to death was 8.1 months; the main cause of death was myeloma (39.5%). Clinical manifestations included abdominal pain (7.8%), ascites (13.6%), GI bleeding (8.8%), constitutional symptoms and weight loss (88.8%), abdominal mass (40%), hepatomegaly (42.1%). B symptoms (fever and night sweats) were present in one case. Laboratory findings included CD4+ cell count < 50/mm3 (28.8%); the median CD4+ cell count was 121.5/mm3; 64.4% had HAART treatment before diagnosis of lymphoma. Extra-nodal involvement (mainly, gastrointestinal tract); B symptoms were less frequent than in other series of NHL. CD4+ cell count < 50/mm3 was infrequent, we presume that the low incidence of lymphocytopenia was a false negative and not a real one. The role for HAART in our NHL patients remains to be determined. <EOD> .

 <EOD> Evaluation of the cytotoxic effect of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on the growth of primary human periodontal ligament fibroblasts

Background:Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, is often prescribed to treat patients affected by periodontitis. In the present study, the drug cytotoxicity to the human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLF) has been studied in details. Materials and Methods: For cell culture, 4 freshly extracted wisdom teeth were aseptically extracted from 3 patients who were clinically and radiographically diagnosed as having a dental extraction indication and required a tooth extraction for periodontal reasons. All teeth were extracted at dental clinics for periodontal reasons after obtaining consent from patients. Extracted teeth were immediately transferred to the Department of Periodontics, Faculty of Dentistry. On the same day after tooth extraction, hPDLF were isolated by enzyme (0.25% Trypsin/EDTA [GIBCO, Grand Island, NY]) digestion and subcultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO) and 1% antibiotic and antimycotic solution (GIBCO). For the experiments, primary osteoblasts of hPDLF were exposed to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 25 and the cell viability was assessed using trypan blue and methyl thiazoldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results: There was no statistical difference between the number of dead cells after 1 days exposure between the experimental and control groups (P > 0.05). Also, viability of hPDLF did not change significantly after the 7-day culture (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid has no significant cytotoxic effect on hPDLF and can be considered as the choice of choice for the regenerative approaches.

# Introduction
Antimicrobial agents have been used for treating dental problems since the early 20 th century. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is widely used in dentistry for periodontal disease treatment. Amoxicillin is effective against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid has an excellent antimicrobial spectrum and may provide the maximum therapeutic effect at the lowest total dose of antibiotic.   Efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: A double-blind,..., Ozcura   However, the overuse of this antimicrobial agent may cause the development of resistant microorganisms and its toxic effects on human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLF). hPDLF are localized between the tooth and periodontal ligament (PDL), are derived from PDL stem cells, and may differentiate into osteoblast or fibroblasts. Also, they are responsible for synthesis of connective tissue constituents during bone formation, and play a crucial role in maintaining periodontal tissue.   Cellular changes in jaw periosteum in response to orthodontic force application, Tanimoto   Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid has been reported to affect the cell proliferation and morphology of cultured periodontal ligament cells (PDL) and bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSC).   Cytotoxic effects of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on periodontal ligament cells and bone marrow..., Jang   Nevertheless, the present study did not clearly address any cell proliferation or morphological changes due to prolonged exposure of amoxicillinclavulanic acid. Moreover, it is unclear if the PDL cells and BMSC differ from hPDLF in their responses to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid"

Purpose
| The purpose of this study is to investigate the working mechanism of Endocalyx Pro. We expect our main hypothesis that Endocalyx improves fluid retention is true, since we hypothesize that the Glycocalyx will be better restored in Endocalyx treated patients. This will improve diastolic compliance of the heart and reduce congestion, therefore decreasing congestion-related symptoms such as leg swelling. Endocalyx is a special food supplement containing glycosaminoglycans derived from marine-produced seaweed. We expect Endocalyx to be an effective and promising treatment option since it will also normalize sodium overload. Previous publications have demonstrated improved physical limitations and hemodynamic parameters in patients with CHF that received Endocalyx compared with patients who received placebo.(16) Endocalyx is expected to be especially useful in patients who suffer from CHF with preserved or mid range EF (EF >40%) and suffer from congestion due to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade or a diuretic(3, 7, 11, 16, 17, 29).

| Term | Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adverse Event | AE | An adverse event refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product.|
| Adverse Drug Reaction | ADR | An adverse drug reaction is defined as a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in man. An ADR can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not considered related to the drug. An ADR (as opposed to other unfavorable or unintended effects of medicinal products) can generally be distinguished from a lack of clinical effect [No Effect (NE) by inability to produce a drug effect by a combination of dose, time and subject].|
| Suspected Product Defect | SPD | A suspected product defect is defined as a biological or mechanical error in the manufacture of a product. An SPD (as opposed to other undesirable and unintended effects [for example, a lack of clinical effect]) indicates a deviation from a product within normal manufacturing specifications.|
| Relatedness | Rel | A relationship (Rel) describes causal relationships between an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) or a Suspected Product Defect (SPD) and a given pharmaceutical product. According to the Guidelines of the Uppsala Academic Centre, three levels of relationships can be distinguished:|
| - Conclusion 1: The event does not result from, does not follow, and is not caused by the administration of the product as described in the protocol. - Conclusion 2: Lack of an observable relation; the event does not result from, does not follow, and is not caused by the administration of the product as described in the protocol. - Conclusion 3: The product directly (but dose not necessarily) causes the event. Thus, the relationship between the event and the drug is certain.|
| Causality | Cau | This term describes the likelihood of a causal relationship between an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) or Suspected Product Defect (SPD) and a given pharmaceutical product. The causality assessment is an individual assessment, based on the totality of information available (including the outcome of diagnostic tests). The results of the causality assessment lead to one of the following causality ratings:|
| - Not likely | - Probably not | - Possible | - Probable | - Definitely | - Certain (proven in court of law or based on evidence of a medical and forensic nature) |
| Duration | Dur | The evaluation of the duration of a drug effect is a measure of effectiveness when a drug is used in accordance with its indication in a clinical context that does not change over a preset period of time and duration.|
| End of Treatment | EOTE | Measured from the first administration to the date of the last administration of a study drug.|
| Efficacy | EF | Efficacy is a measurable or quantifiable benefit of treatment in disease or health care and is measured by assessing various levels of response, for example, changes in the total number of cells or changes in the total amount of protein in a patient before and after treatment.|
| Effectiveness | EF | Effectiveness is a measurable or quantifiable benefit of treatment in disease or health care and is assessed by an assessment of a range of clinical endpoints, for instance the reduction of pain, anxiety, or the number of relapse in disease patients.|

 <EOD> Effect of high protein vs high carbohydrate on weight loss, body composition, hormonal profile, blood pressure, and hepatic markers during short-term high-calorie diet in overweight subjects.
AIMS
The purpose of this study was to compare effects of a high-protein, low-carbohydrate (HPLC) vs a high-carbohydrate-low-protein (HCLP) diet on weight loss, body composition, hormonal profile, blood pressure (BP), and hepatic markers during short-term high-calorie (HC) diet in overweight subjects.


METHODS
Forty male and female subjects with body mass index (BMI, in kgm(-2)) of 27-35 were randomly assigned to one of two 21-day HC diets (70% HCLP and 30% HPLC, respectively). On the last day of the study subjects were weighed, completed a 24-h dietary recall and the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. Their BP was also measured and blood samples were obtained for assessment of total protein, electrolytes, lipid profile, hepatic markers, plasma glucose, and insulin (HPI), plasma leptin, thyroid stimulating hormone, and lipid peroxidation (LPO).


RESULTS
Total body water and fat percentages, as well as systolic and diastolic BPs decreased in the HPLC, while total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs) and LPO increased in the HCLP. Weight, fat mass (FM), HPI, serum alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) decreased in the HPLC, while leptin and TSHs increased. The HCLP subjects had higher total protein, chloride, and calcium than the HPLC subjects. HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly in both groups. There was no change in plasma glucose in response to both diets. There were no significant differences in the mood states of both groups.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study suggest that at least during a short-term HC diet, the HPLC diet is characterized by more desirable changes in markers of body composition, insulin sensitivity, lipids and glucose homeostasis, BP, hepatic markers and total protein. <EOD> Improvement of the performance of p‐type SiNW FETs using self‐passivated nanowires by forming self‐organized silicon oxide
Si nanowire (SiNW) field‐effect transistors (FETs) fabricated by using an N‐type Si nanowire (SiNW) as a nanotransporting channel are regarded as the most promising candidates for next‐generation electronics due to the advantages of high electrical conductivity and large surface‐to‐volume ratio. However, SiNWs typically grown by vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism are p‐type in nature because of the presence of a thick Si core/shell structure due to the lack of the surface passivation, and the fabrication of p‐type SiNW FETs has been a great challenge so far. Here, we report high‐quality p‐type SiNWs and p‐type SiNW FETs fabricated by using a self‐organized silicon oxide (SOS) as a nanotemplate for Si crystal growth. An SOS substrate composed of a monocrystalline Si core and a SiO2 shell has been reported previously, which is capable of self‐passivating the Si NW surface of the SiNWs grown on it. In this article, the SiNW grown on the SOS substrate has been shown to possess an excellent electrical performance, which originates from both of the unique structural and physiochemical properties of the SOS template, including the self‐passivated and chemically homogeneous shell layer, the uniform amorphous silica core and the high electrical conductivity of silicic acid liquid. The fabricated p‐type SiNW FET without surface treatments shows an on–off current ratio of 109, and is comparable to that of a p‐type SiNW FET with a surface thermal oxide. This indicates the high performance capability of using the SOS as a"

 <EOD> Sources of error in the calibration of gasoline particulate analysers
The gasoline particulate analysers (GPA) used in calibrating the California Low Emission Vehicle Rule are susceptible to calibration source-dependent errors. This study quantifies the degree of measurement bias of these instruments and identifies sources of error that may be contributing to the bias. Three commercially manufactured vehicles were used to evaluate the GPA: the General Motors Geo Metro, the Ford Escort-6V and the Ford Tempo-2.7L. The Geo Metro met Euro emission limit criteria. The Ford Escort failed to meet Euro 2b.0 emission limits for the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Tier I test for oxides of CO and hydrocarbons (HC). The Ford Tempo failed to meet Euro criteria. The test vehicles were operated using a variety of engine control settings and fuel grades to ensure that maximum source dependence would be measured. The performance evaluation of GPA 11A and GPA 836C included 20 different source compositions and seven other types of error sources including the use of a 1 L calibrator. Results demonstrated statistically significant calibration source-dependent errors for both instruments, with a variation of approximately 12 to 33% in the performance of the low and high levels measured by the two analysers. The effect of each error source on the calibration of the instruments was evaluated and the instrument error components were identified as source-dependent, systematic instrument errors; these errors were identified as the source of approximately 5% to 10% of the bias in measurement of the source-dependent errors. <EOD> Influence of Different Preparation Methods and Different Forms of Garlic Extract on the Antioxidant Properties and Cholesterol Reducing Potential
The present study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant properties of alcoholic extracts, aqueous extracts and oleoresins of garlic (Allium sativum Linn.) prepared using different techniques (hot, cold etc.) and in different forms (bulb, powder, whole plant, leaves etc.) and to assess their potential to reduce cholesterol concentration in HepG2 cells. The results have indicated that the ethanolic extracts produced by hot and cold maceration have shown significant (p < 0.05) antioxidant activities. Oleoresins prepared using the cold maceration technique have also shown significant antioxidant activities. Antioxidant activities and cholesterol reducing potentials of all the samples were also assessed using GC–MS. On further analysis, the oleoresin samples were identified having good antioxidant potentials. The present study indicates the different extracts and forms of garlic preparations to have good protective effect against oxidative stress. The study also indicates that the cholesterol-reducing potential of garlic may be attributed to both total phenolics and flavonoid contents due to the presence of some active phytochemicals. The cholesterol reducing effect of alcoholic extracts may be attributed to its active component, the diallyl disulfide. <EOD> Comparison of the in vitro immunomodulating effects on murine and human lymphocytes and on murine fibroblasts of two distinct types of phenytoin esters
Different species differences in in vitro effects of phenytoin esters on immune responses may be responsible for the disparate species‐specific antitumor effects of phenytoin esters. A recent study indicated that two different preparations of phenytoin esters, one derived from the aromatic ammonium salt of phenytoin and the other from the aromatic carboxylate ester of phenytoin, both with molecular weights of 206, exhibited antitumor effects in murine tumor models but not in a human tumor xenograft model in nude athymic mice. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if the two preparations of phenytoin esters possessed different biochemical effects, including those on immune responses. This was undertaken by comparing the following immunomodulating effects of the two distinct types of phenytoin esters in vitro on (1) cellular and cell membrane immunogenicity, (2) helper T cell (TH) and suppressor cell (TS) activity, and (3) activation of primary mouse spleen cells.

 <EOD> Is SBRT a safe treatment for spinal metastasis with severe osteolytic destruction, vertebral compression fracture, and spinal instability?
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of spinal metastasis (SMS) with severe osteolytic destruction, vertebral compression fracture, and spinal instability.


METHODS
The study comprised patients with cancer, who had received SBRT combined with external beam radiotherapy for SMS, between August 2014 and March 2022, at our institution. Of 2867 patients, 37 were diagnosed with SMS with severe osteolytic destruction, vertebral compression fracture, and spinal instability. One patient was ultimately excluded due to incomplete medical records, leaving 36 patients for the study. SBRT was initiated in May 2017. Spinal instability was diagnosed based on bony involvement of the spinous processes, osteolytic destruction, and sagittal-oblique vertebral compression fracture. Compressive fractures were classified as types A (bone density not reduced), B (reduced density of <1000 Hounsfield units ), and C (reduced density of >1000 HU). Bony involvement was classified into two grades: grade 1 (spinous process) and grade 2 (transverse process, vertebral body, or pedicle). The follow-up period was from SBRT to the occurrence of adverse events until December 31, 2022. The maximum dose constraint in our institution is not clear due to a lack of prospective clinical studies of SBRT for the treatment of SMS. However, the maximum dose value of adverse events occurrence is as follows: ≤30 Gy for the skin; ≤22.5 Gy for the bone marrow; ≤16 Gy for the spinal cord; and V20 ≤ 39.9% for the thyroid.


RESULTS
The median follow-up period was 19.2 months (1.2 to 53.1 months). The median and maximal doses delivered were 20 Gy in 5 fractions (range 14.7-27 Gy in 5 fractions) and 20 Gy to a maximum of 27 Gy in 5 fractions, respectively. The median planning target volume (PTV) did not cover the whole bone region and ranged 0.7 to 18.8 cm3 (17.4 cm3 in median). The median dose to the whole PTV was 18 Gy (range 10.0-27.0 Gy), delivering at its maximum in any one fraction 27 Gy. The median dose to the bone region was 45 Gy in 5 fractions. The median radiation dose to the skin and spinal cord was 11.8 Gy (0.8-27.0)"

Input Text:
TESA is one of the most common sperm retrieval techniques, and is considered
inferior to mTESE. Zymot is also a sperm selection device, but is able to
separate viable sperm from semen or testicular aspirate. There is limited
evidence comparing fertilization rates between TESA-ICSI, Zymot-ICSI, and
direct ICSI with testicular sperm. This multi-center, randomized
controlled trial aims to evaluate the fertilization and pregnancy rates of men
with testicular sperm undergoing TESA-ICSI or Zymot-ICSI, as well as assess
clinical outcomes of blastocysts using the trophectoderm biopsy. The present protocol
is the first international, multi-center, RCT evaluating the utility of Zymot-ICSI
for selection of viable sperm in men with high sperm DNA fragmentation and was
developed by the Canadian Testicular Sperm Retrieval Team in conjunction with
the ICSI Working Group of the Society of Assisted Reproduction
Technology. The trial is anticipated to be the largest RCT in the field of
microfluidics to date, with an estimated target population of 150 participants.


Background and Justification
===============

1. Pregnancy rates in couples who have used ICSI with testicular sperm should be
the same whether testicular sperm is retrieved with TESA or Zymot. A multi-center
RCT comparing TESA-ICSI vs. MMS-ICSI in this population may prove this point.

2. There is limited evidence comparing the fertilization and pregnancy rates of couples
with testicular sperm that underwent IVF/ICSI with testicular sperm retrieved with
either TESA or Zymot. A multi-center RCT comparing TESA-ICSI to Zymot-ICSI in
this population may prove this point.

3. TESA-ICSI and Zymot-ICSI should produce an equal number of blastocysts eligible for
trophectoderm biopsy. A multi-center RCT comparing TESA-ICSI to Zymot-ICSI in this
population may prove this point.  

Ethics and Disclaimer
===============

Participation will be voluntary. The participating couples will be provided with
information describing treatment alternatives and potential study results. Prior to enrollment in
the trial there will be opportunity for couples to discuss treatment options (e.g.
direct ICSI of testicular sperm from Zymot vs. TESA and then ICSI of viable sperm
selected using the Zymot device) with their doctor and other qualified
infertility care providers.

 <EOD> An Analysis of the Use of Health Insurance and Other Sources of Funds for Treatment: A Health Care Reform

Background: Many low-income individuals use public assistance to cover the costs of medical care. The amount of money a person receives in assistance, however, should not only cover his or her out-of-pocket medical costs, but should also cover other expenses. Thus, if a person's income is such that they qualify for assistance, they should be able to survive on what they are given. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different strategies for determining how much money low-income individuals in the United States make. As a result, this study aimed to increase the amount of coverage provided by health care reform without compromising the well-being of the poor.Methods: Using the data of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2002 to 2010 for a survey sample of 948,427 respondents, a logistic regression analysis was conducted. The dependent variable was dichotomized as to be low-income-receiving subsidies-or non-low-income. The independent variables were sex, age, education level, marital status, size of household, health insurance, health status, and the type of coverage.Results: In terms of household characteristics, marital status and education level were found to have a positive but marginal effect on health insurance. Also, a person having Medicaid or Medicare had approximately 15 percent lower odds of having other sources of funding for treatment than that of those without health insurance (OR = 0.85;"

Study Overview
=================#

Detailed Description
-----------------#

Archery can be described as a comparatively static sport requiring strength and endurance of the upper body, in particular the forearm and shoulder girdle. Skill in archery is defined as the ability to shoot an arrow to a given target in a certain time span with accuracy. The discipline is described as a three-phase (the stance, the drawing and the sighting) movement. Shooting can be divided these phases into six: bow hold, drawing, full draw, aiming, release and follow-through. Each of these phases represented a stable sequence of movements and was ideal for studying the motor control and skill acquired during this voluntary kinematic process. An archer pushes the bow with an extended arm, which is statically held in the direction of the target, while the other arm exerts a dynamic pulling of the bowstring from the beginning of the drawing phase, until the release is dynamically executed. The release phase must be well balanced and highly reproducible to achieve commendable results in a competition. The bowstring is released when an audible impulse is received from a device called clicker that is used as a draw length check. Each arrow can be drawn to an exact distance and a standard release can be obtained using the device. The clicker is reputed to improve the archer's score and used by all target archers. The archer should react to the clicker as quickly as possible. In particular, a repeated contraction and relaxation strategy in the forearm and pull finger muscles should be developed for this reason. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of stabilization and stabilization-related parameters on shooting performance at the cervical, lumbal and scapular levels in archery athletes.

In the past three years, we have diagnosed 16 patients with HIV infection. 11 of these were AIDS and 3 had AIDS-related illnesses including one with Kaposi's sarcoma. The median age was 39 years. The mean length of hospitalization for these patients in our hospital was 13 days, twice as long as the patients in the previous year, and three times as long as the patients in the year before that. Three patients died, and one patient remains in our surgical ICU. The causes of ICU admission were bacterial pneumonia (1 case), viral colitis (1 case), and pulmonary aspergillosis (another). Although all of these patients were under treatment with potassium iodide for pulmonary mycobacteriosis, their CD4 cell counts decreased, and their opportunistic infections increased, indicating that these drugs are not very effective for immune recovery. The main drugs for AIDS patients included AZT (11 cases), d4T (2 cases), ddI (3 cases), and diethylpropion (1 case) for weight maintenance. <EOD> The prevalence and extent of neurological involvement in psoriatic arthritis: a study in 112 patients.
Ectopic calcification is an important feature of psoriatic disease and may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. The role of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the development of vascular pathology and osteopathy is not yet clear. We retrospectively reviewed the files of all patients with psoriasis followed in the outpatient Dermatology Department from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2011. One hundred and 13 psoriasis patients were initially selected, and 112 of them had arthritis. At the time of diagnosis, patients were subdivided according to PsA presence, and a correlation between the presence of arthritis and clinical and laboratory findings was established. Statistical analysis was performed by Chi 2 test. We followed the same methodology for those patients who were free of arthritis at the time of diagnosis. In both groups, the presence of arthritis was recorded according to the year of follow-up with psoriasis. The frequency of PsA in patients with psoriasis was 11.5%. Diabetes was 500% more frequent in arthritic patients. Cardiomyopathy had a higher prevalence in the non-arthritic group, being 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively. There was a significant association between PsA and metabolic disease in the group of arthritic patients (P < 0.001). The presence of arthritis at the time of diagnosis of psoriasis does not affect the prognostic and overall survival. In conclusion, arthritis in psoriasis is an aggressive disease that affects the metabolism of the patient. <EOD> The epidemiology of fetal alcohol syndrome and partial FAS in a contemporary US birth cohort.

Detailed Description
-----------------
This study will provide estimate of the cumulative lifetime risk of vitiligo in the population overall, and by important sociodemographic groups, including age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation, which will prevalent key data to show the relative burden of vitiligo across the aforementioned groups. These approaches allow creation of cumulative lifetime risk plots which provide an excellent and accessible way to display the relative disease burden across groups. The cumulative lifetime risk of vitiligo will be estimated at age 80 years (approximate lifetime expectancy in the UK) using survival models, with age as the timescale and accounting for competing risk of death. This study will also perform a subgroup analysis in the vitiligo population to identify health-related disparities across people in different deprivation, sex and ethnic groups. The disparities that will be considered are: Mental health conditions; healthcare utilisation; and work impact (time off work and unemployment), The assessment of any associations with baseline characteristics and the outcome of interest will be used using Cox proportional hazards models (time to event outcomes) and generalised linear models.

 <EOD> Enhanced production of nitric oxide and its precursor in the aqueous humor of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
In contrast to diabetic retinopathy, previous studies have shown that the amount of nitric oxide (NO) in the aqueous humor is low in neovascular glaucoma, iridocyclitis, and retinal diseases. Although age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an age-related disease, the concentration of NO in the aqueous humor of patients with AMD has not been determined. In this study, aqueous humor was obtained from 11 AMD patients undergoing aphakic operation. The cGMP levels in the aqueous humor of AMD patient was examined using a cGMP radioimmunoassay kit. The amounts of NO in the aqueous humor from AMD patients were determined using the Griess reaction. The amount of NO in the aqueous humor of the patients was significantly higher than that of other diseases, including diabetes mellitus, uveitis, and cataract. The cGMP levels were correlated with the amount of NO in the aqueous humor of AMD patients. <EOD> Internalization of bacteria by retinal pigment epithelium: an additional potential mechanism for endotoxin-induced uveitis.
PURPOSE
Previous studies have shown that endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) can be exacerbated by prior retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and complement components (CCs). The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that this exacerbating effect is due to the internalization of gram-negative bacteria by RPE cells.


METHODS
Sheep RPE cells were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of CCs, and these treated RPE cells were then incubated with a fluorescently labeled gram-negative bacterium, Proteus mirabilis. After extensive washing, fluorescence was measured in pellets by fluorometry, cell-associated fluorescence by flow cytometry, and intracellular versus free bacteria by confocal microscopy. Cells were also exposed to FITC-labeled dextran (3 to 500 kDa molecular size) and observed by confocal microscopy to examine the effect of LPS treatment on RPE cell monolayer permeability.


RESULTS
RPE cell treatment with LPS and CCs resulted in increased bacterial internalization compared with control RPE cells. RPE cells treated with CCs prior to bacterial incubation also showed a concentration- and time-dependent increase in intracellular bacteria. RPE cell permeability to albumin, as measured by the leakage of intracellular fluorescein-labeled dextran, was not affected by LPS treatment when compared with control cells.


CONCLUSIONS
These data suggest that LPS uptake, via complement primed RPE cells, can lead to internalization of gram-negative bacteria, a potential cause of exacerbation of EIU. As such, endotoxin-induced uveitis may be a multifactorial disease resulting, in part, from LPS-induced activation of resident RPE cells. <EOD> Preparation of the Methylated DNA Immunoassay Using Monoclonal Antibody AE3 for Evaluation of Apoptosis
An immunoassay using methylated DNA and a monoclonal antibody (AE3) against the triethylene glycol moiety of the N-methyl group of the methylated DNA of DNA fragmentation-induced cultured cells was developed for estimation of apoptosis. Methylated DNA immunoassay of apoptosis in cultured cancer cells is useful for investigating the apoptotic events in cancer chemotherapy. The amount of methylated DNA was measured using an immunoassay employing biotin-conjugated digoxigenin and streptavidin-conjugated enzyme to label the captured immunoprecipitates. The amount of biotin-digoxigenin-labelled methylated DNA immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody (AE3) to the triethylene glycol"

The [/INST] study is to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone (digital) appetite awareness + behavioral weight program aimed at treating Black women who experience Binge Eating Disorder (BED). Aim 1 will adapt and validate a validated program to be culturally relevant to address the unmet need of treating binge eating in Black women with obesity. Once the adaptations are made, Aim 2 will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the smartphone digital health program in a four-arm randomized study design.


# Key elements
=====================
## Summary
=====================

Federally-funded study to examine the efficacy of culturally-relevant, digital, self-management intervention for treating obesity and binge eating behaviors.


## Aims/Research questions
=====================
### Aim 1. Modify and adapt a validated program to be a culturally-relevant digital health tool for binge eating and weight management for black women (bmi > 30 kg/m^2) who binge eat. aim 1a. identify the barriers and facilitators to detecting and treating binge eating in black women with obesity, and identify strategies for optimizing digital health tools to engage and retain this population. aim 1b. conduct usability testing with a group of stakeholders to guide content and design refinements; refine tool.
### Aim 2.
In a randomized clinical trial, evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the digital health appetite awareness + behavioral weight program in primary care.

## Study Setting
======================

The study will be conducted virtually.  In-person interactions and testing will be conducted at the partnering institutions.

## Study Duration ____Months__
======================

We will develop and adapt the program within four months and then recruit participants for an in-person 30-minute focus group session. We will then recruit participants for the feasibility study.

## Study Size
==================

We will be conducting a single arm feasibility study of 40 obese Black women. The sample size for this feasibility study is based on the SPIRIT Statement: Estimating Required Information Size for Pilot Trials in D&I research. Specifically, to provide 80% power to detect a ≤ 0.1 SD change in the number of Binge Eating Episodes from Baseline to Month 6 at the 0.05 significance level, we would need a sample size of n = 40 (36 evaluable participants)

# Background information
==================

Because many of the tools that clinicians are using for assessment and treatment of eating disorders or obesity are not responsive to the particular challenges of Black patients, Black patients are underrepresented in the eating disorder treatment literature (5). Treating Binge Eating and Obesity Digitally in Black Women: A Feasibility Study will create a digital treatment tool for addressing culturally relevant issues that uniquely impact Black women with Binge Eating and Obesity (BED and obesity).

# Background rationale
==================

Background rationale: a. Existing treatment approaches are not responsive to the cultural issues and other challenges unique to Black women. b. A digital health tool will address these unmet needs.

Background and Rationale: [/PART]

Background and rationale:

Although beetroot juice is well established as an effective ergogenic aid for enhancing performance during endurance running and cycling, to date, its influence on sporting tasks of shorter duration, such as resistance exercise, remains to be investigated. Beetroot juice supplementation could augment resistance exercise performance since previous ingestion studies show a heightened post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery (PCr), oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbohydrate oxidation compared to nitrate-free beetroot juice. Importantly, these improvements were evident across both lower (e.g., leg extension) and upper (e.g., dumbbell incline press) body resistance exercise, which highlights the potential of nitrate supplementation as a means to maximizing performance in a wide array of exercise tasks. However, the dose-response effects of dietary nitrate on resistance exercise performance are underinvestigated with previous research only investigating high doses of beetroot juice (76 mmol nitrate; 1-2.5 L) in healthy, endurance trained males. In summary of the evidence, dietary nitrate supplementation may provide a simple means for improving resistance exercise performance, however, a large degree of uncertainty exists regarding the dose-response effect of beetroot juice on resistance exercise performance. Thus, the primary purpose of this study will be to compare the effect of differing doses of dietary nitrate (low, moderate, and high) on neuromuscular performance (e.g., jump height, countermovement jump kinematics, velocity, power) during an acute resistance exercise bout. An elevated dose of dietary nitrate will also be included to determine if a ceiling effect occurs for performance enhancement. In addition to this, secondary goals of the study will compare the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation on resistance exercise performance between healthy, healthy, and resistance trained individuals. Finally, the study will evaluate the influence of dietary nitrate on indices of physiological stress (e.g., heart rate, rate of perceived, muscle pain) during resistance exercise.

Summary: [/INST]


Alternatives to the study: 

Beetroot juice is the most potent elicitor of exercise-induced plasma nitrate
Beetroot Juice supplementation has been shown to acutely enhance endurance exercise performance, particularly at exercise durations lasting greater than 10 min, through improved oxygen extraction and increased PCr resynthesis. Recently, beetroot juice supplementation has also been investigated before an acute bout of power and resistance exercise, where it heightened exercise performance in anaerobically-dominant movements such as sprinting and weightlifting. However, the relationship between dietary nitrate and resistance exercise performance is relatively unexplored, with previous research suggesting elevated dietary nitrate intake has no influence on resistance exercise performance. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the effects of different doses of dietary nitrate (low, moderate, high) on resistance exercise performance in healthy, untrained, and resistance trained individuals. We hypothesize that a low dose of dietary nitrate (7 mmol) will not enhance performance, a moderate dose of dietary nitrate (23 mmol) will enh"

Input Text: The Effect of Two Different Intra-abdominal Pressure Applications on Mechanical Power in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
In laparoscopic surgeries; a trocar is inserted through a small incision and an intervention is made into the peritoneal cavity. Approximately 3-4 liters of carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation (inflating the abdominal cavity with carbon dioxide gas) is applied and the intra-abdominal pressure is adjusted to 10-20 mmHg. Intra-abdominal pressure is continuously measured by pressure monitoring, which is routinely performed during laparoscopic procedures. The applied intra-abdominal pressure is determined by the surgical team and the most optimal value that creates pneumoperitoneum for the patient is preferred. Abdominal compartment syndrome can be seen due to abdominal hypertension at intra-abdominal pressure values above 20 mmHg. Both pressure values aimed to be applied in this study are applied in laparoscopic cholecystectomy operations and do not cause any harm to the patient and their superiority to each other has not been determined. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy operation is routinely performed with 12 mmHg or 14 mmHg pressures in our operating room. Both pressure values applied to the patients intraoperatively are within safe ranges. The mechanical power of ventilation (MP) is the amount of energy transferred per unit time from the mechanical ventilator to the respiratory system. Although this energy is mainly used to overcome airway resistance and respiratory system compliance, some of it directly affects the lung tissue, potentially causing ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). MP is a summary variable that includes several components, including tidal volume (VT ), peak pressure (Ppeak), driving pressure, and respiratory rate (RR). These components; requires that the mechanical ventilator be adjusted so that the least amount of energy is transferred to the respiratory system per unit time for each patient in order to prevent ventilator-associated lung injury. In the researches; a relationship between mechanical power (MP) and complications such as ventilator-associated lung injury (VILI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been found. The findings suggest that the mechanical force applied to the lungs should be reduced during intraoperative ventilation in patients undergoing major surgery. In adult patients undergoing general anesthesia during major surgical operations, higher patient exposure to ventilation as measured by higher mechanical power; it has been associated with increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications and acute respiratory failure in the first 7 days of the postoperative period. In the results obtained in the published studies; increased mechanical strength has been associated with increased in-hospital mortality and higher hospital stay and higher ICU follow-up requirement. The airway pressure of patients who undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been shown to increase in the intraperitoneal pressure group in the intra-operative period and to improve in the postoperative follow-up period with the intervention of the mechanical ventilator in patients operated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the present study, this finding will constitute a basis for the study. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the short / long-term mechanical strength and respiratory mechanics values of the patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with 12 mmHg and 14 mmHg intra-abdominal pressure applications.

In this summary text, we will focus on the overview of the study and the keywords that would have been chosen using the CBM, PubMed and OVID databases. Since the three of them can use very different terminology, it's worth knowing in what way they summarize articles. In general, there are no differences, however, some words may be missing or they are not used correctly. In text mining, the first step is to determine the general terms describing the text, e.g. title, keywords, abstract or headings, and next the more detailed ones with regard to the content of the article - e.g. keywords phrases, which can be the subject of a query for a specific database. It is advisable to find your keywords before creating a paper abstract form, because keywords phrases are used for indexing purposes in many databases. Thus, the main question is to identify the most important keywords for the title. In turn, summarizing the study overview from the point of view of the CBM, PubMed and OVID databases allows for the determination of different keywords phrases (see   Table 1: Keywords phrases for a given summary  .

 <EOD> Synthesis and Evaluation of the Cytotoxic Activity and Pharmacokinetic Properties of Antiproliferative 1,2,4-Triazolo[4,3-a]pyridines

A structural modification of the previously assessed pyrrolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazine 11 was done successfully at position 2, and five new ethyl 3-aryl-5-(3-chloro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-{[(4-methylthiazol-5-ium-2-yl)oxy]methyl}-1H-1,2,4-triazole-4-carboxylate)prop-2-enoates 3a−e were synthesized, and their antiproliferative activity was evaluated. The most potent compound has high selectivity index (SI) against ovarian cancer cells. 9-Bromo-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-10-hydroxy-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-3-ium bromide 2 showed inhibition of proliferation growth by the induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cell lines. The pharmacokinetic properties of triazolo[4,3-a]pyridine 2 were investigated using the HPLC and LC−MS/MS methods.

# ■ introduction
Several compounds have demonstrated antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines in vitro and also in tumor xenografts in vivo. A number of agents have been tested in cell culture assays and even the majority of the most promising drug candidates have failed in clinical trials. A strategy currently used in medicine and drug discovery to select for drugs with desired properties is to design drugs bearing multiple pharmacophores. We previously reported the synthesis and antiproliferative activity of 12 N-unsubstituted tricyclic 2-aminopyridines.   ]triazoles for the Treatment of Cancer, Sajid   A pyrrolo   ]triazoles for the Treatment of Cancer, Sajid   triazine 13 containing the quinazolinone substituent 4 and its ester 5 was obtained. These compounds showed inhibition of proliferation growth by the induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 and DLBCL cells. We found that introduction of ethyl substituents into the ester moiety improved antiproliferative activity. We considered that we could improve the antileukemia activity of compound 5 by increasing the length and lipophilicity of alkyl substituents on the N 1 nitrogen atom. We synthesized analogues of 11, 13a,b by reductive amination of ethyl 3′-amino-4′-nitropyrrolo   ]triazoles for the Treatment of Cancer, Sajid   triazine 14a with a variety of substituted ethanes. These compounds (11, 13a,b) have been patented. We found that the amine 11 showed antiproliferative activity against DLBCL. The compounds were also active against MCF7 and ovarian CAOV3 cell lines. We proposed that the anticancer effect of 1,2,4-triazoles 11, 13a,b was probably associated with the targeting of several intracellular proteins. We reported that the compounds act as anticancer agents inhibiting the growth of DLBCL, ovarian, and MCF7 cells. The compound 11 also showed promising in vivo anticervical cancer activity.

 <EOD> Livedoid Vasculopathy: An Update on the Management
Abstract Livedoid vasculopathy (LV) is a thrombotic vasculopathy of small dermal vessels that produces painful purple-red, ulcerating skin lesions of the lower extremities (6). Its pathogenesis involves a deficiency of angiogenic or inflammatory factors that impairs neovascularization and contributes to the thrombotic events (6). Management of LV lesions is complex and not well defined. LV thrombosis may arise acute or chronically, can be localized or systemic, and may be transient or persistent (5). The majority of clinical studies have assessed the benefits of systemic anticoagulation (eg, direct oral anticoagulants  or low-molecular-weight heparin) for the management of LV (6). Other therapies have included topical therapies (eg, anti-TNF or cytotoxic drugs), immunosuppression, platelet suppression, or hyperbaric oxygen (4,9). <EOD> Neuronal expression of the glycine transporter 2 in rat brain: An immunohistochemical study
It is well known that glycine is one of the transmitters in central nervous system. Glycine transporters, glycine receptors and glycine‐N‐methyltransferases play critical roles in the metabolism of glycine in central nervous system. Glycine transporter 1, or GLYT‐1, is well known as a glycine transporter. In this report, we have examined the expression of glycine transporter 2 (GLYT‐2) in central nervous system. <EOD> A phase II study of epirubicin and a short course of hormone therapy in metastatic breast cancer patients.

 <EOD> A comparison of two scoring systems to evaluate diphasic feeds in pediatric patients.
OBJECTIVE
To compare two scoring systems to evaluate the outcomes of diphasic feeds. This study was carried out at 2 large surgical centers.


DESIGN
Prospective randomized study of 2 clinical scoring systems: 1) Pediatric Nutrition Support and Metabolism, Hospitalized Children's Assessment of Nutritional Difficulties (Hospitalized Charts Assessment of Nutritional Difficulties-H CAND-1), and 2) Diphasic Feeds (DIF-) Candidate Index Scoring System for Evaluation of H CAND (DIF-CI).


SETTING
Two large surgical/intensive care units.


PATIENTS
A consecutive group of 465 hospitalized children aged 1 month to 4 years with a diagnosis of acute, severe malnutrition.


INTERVENTION
Children were randomly assigned to receive exclusive diphasic feeding (N = 241) or traditional high-calorie diet combined with trophic feedings (N = 224) over a 10-day observation period. At the completion of feeding for 10 days, patients were scored by using H CAND-1 and DIF-CI.


OUTCOMES MEASURED
Outcomes measured at the end of the 10-day feeding period included the number and severity of feeding complications as measured by the presence and severity of refeeding syndrome.


RESULTS
Both H CAND-1 and DIF-CI identified patients who developed complications after prolonged fasting before diphasic feeding. However, H CAND-1 was better in identifying patients in less severe refeeding syndromes, whereas DI-F-CI was better in identifying children in more severe refeeding syndromes. H CAND-1 and DIF-CI were also equally in identifying children with mild refeeding syndromes. The DIF-CI was better able to identify severe refeeding syndromes after 10 days of feeding with diphasic feeds.


CONCLUSIONS
H CAND-1 and DIF-CI were both useful in identifying patients in severe malnutrition with severe refeeding syndromes. However, H CAND-1 was better in identifying children in less severe refeeding syndromes, whereas DIF-CI was better in identifying patients with more severe refeeding syndrome after 10 days of diphasic feeding. <EOD> Dental Caries in 951 Adolescent Prisoners, England 2009/10.
BACKGROUND
To determine the prevalence and extent of dental disease in adolescent offenders in England.


METHODS
Prison staff in three youth offender institutions in England collected data for 951 16-18-year-old prisoners in 2009/10 according to a pre-published protocol. A combination of clinical measures (e.g. number of teeth present and decayed) and self-reported information was collected. National age-standardized estimates and differences were calculated, using the census population as a reference group.


RESULTS
All prisoners had their own decayed, missing or filled teeth (DMFT) score recorded. Incisor, canine and premolar experience scores were lower in offenders than in the population, with median scores of 3.4 (95% confidence interval : 3.1-3.6), 2.0 (95% CI: 1.6-2.3) and 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1-1.1) respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
There is an opportunity for oral health promotion in detained adolescent offenders in England. <EOD> Developmental regulation of the transitory state between the 7S and 11S microsomal ribonucleoprotein complexes in rat liver.

Aims of the investigation: This study is proposed to identify the therapeutic effects of Calisthenics Exercise Program and Pulsed Electromagnetic Therapy on Liver Function Following Burn Injuries.


Background:
[/P0]
Burns are harmful injuries that cause significant tissue damage and impairment in major body systems. Liver damage is a complication of burns, which can happen through liver ischemia, reperfusion injury, and hepatoenhancement through local release and inflammatory mediators. The liver is a major pathway of clearance for most drug and toxins compounds and therefore major organ dysfunctions can happen when drugs or solvents are consumed. A variety of physical treatments are used in physical therapy program for the healing burned patients. Some examples are electromagnetic therapy, laser therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and aquatic therapy..
[/P1]

Major issues and problems (Mention also those that need more investigation)

| Issue | Problem Statement |
| --- | --- |
| Burns occur mostly in the first few years of life. | Liver enzymes are elevated in approximately 75% of pediatric patients with burns, even when they are not exhibiting hepatic symptoms. Liver enzymes in burned patients have shown a high level of variability, making interpretation of these tests difficult. |
| Burns occur mostly during the hot months (May to September) as is the summer season. | During the summer months children are more likely to spend time in the sun for longer periods, playing and swimming in the pool. Exercising in the sun and/or swimming in the pool without wearing protective sun-block can raise the risk of burn injuries among children. |
| In Egypt, burns cases reached 30,000.| In Egypt, about 1100 burn cases occur yearly.|
| The average monthly temperatures in the Egypt are extremely hot; about as high as 40 degrees. | In Egypt, the average monthly temperatures in the summer season are high; averaging about 32C.|
| Burns occur mostly in the first 3 years of life. | Approximately 75% of pediatric burns occur in the first three years of life. The mortality rate of burns in young children is highest in infants; the mortality rate is 9.5 times higher than in the elderly.
| Burn injury is responsible for most of the morbidity in children, and it contributes to a large number of physical disabilities and impaired social life activities as the result of scar contracture and loss of function (especially of the hands). |
| Children have a decreased tendency towards thermo-tolerance which makes them more susceptible to burn injuries; heat-retaining clothing and protecting their skin with clothing during hot weather can aid in preventing burn injuries. |
| Children, especially infants, have a decreased rate of sweat gland development compared to the elderly, which make them more susceptible to burn injuries; avoidance of overheating with preventive measures such as cool clothing during hot weather can aid in preventing burn injuries. |
| Burn injuries among children increase in the summer to fall seasons because of lack of children-oriented preventative strategies during these seasons. |
| Infants have thin skin and poor vascularity which make them prone to burn injuries; they require careful attention while in the summer seasons. |
| Child-care centers are places of multiple burn accidents.| Children in day-care centers spend more time out of the home where they are exposed to burn hazards like hot beverages and hot food.|
| Children less than 6 and children above 6 are the major victims for burn accidents. | Children less than 6 years old and those older than 6 have different caregiver needs during summer months. Children less than 6 years old are cared for by the mother while older children are more likely to be in day-care centers during the summer months. Burns in child-care centers can spread to other children through skin and/or clothing contact; having child-care centers with more heat-retaining equipment such as air conditioners and more spacious spaces during hot summer months can decrease the incidence of burn accidents.
| The incidence of burn injuries in day-care center burns in children less than 6 is greater than that in children 6"

 <EOD> Focused Electrically Mediated Thrombolysis in Patients with Mechanical Heart Valves: Analysis of Catheter-related Complications
We experienced 40 focused electrically mediated thrombolysis (FEM) cases in patients with mechanical valve prostheses, and the incidence of catheter-related complications was 2.5% (1/40). The catheter-related complication occurred in the aorta, and it may have been caused by a slight misalignment of the catheter tip in a severely calcific area. The FEM system provides a highly effective method of thrombolysis with fewer complications. <EOD> RCN responds to DHSE report.

PURPOSE
Oestrogen actions in developing retina have been examined using chick embryos, and we have quantified the effects of the steroid on cell loss, DNA synthesis and specific gene expression.


METHODS
Chick embryonic retina were incubated for short (4 h) or long (48 h) periods with estradiol (E2), oestriol or vehicle with or without the oestrogen receptor antagonists fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) or tamoxifen. Apoptotic cell numbers were determined from TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL) data. Changes in total DNA and cell number were determined in retinas labeled with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU). Protein levels were determined by western blot. Quantitative PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of specific oestrogen target genes known to be involved in DNA damage responses and apoptosis in these tissues.


RESULTS
Oestrogen induced apoptosis in the avian retina. At 4 h, the numbers of retinal cells positively stained for apoptosis were doubled in E2-treated retinas relative to the control. In addition, we found that E2 stimulated DNA synthesis and retinal cell growth, but only after a delay in growth. After 48 h, cell numbers were significantly higher in E2-treated retinas, and this effect was partially blocked by the oestrogen receptor antagonists. Western blot data demonstrated that the oestrogen receptor subtype alpha (ERalpha), was rapidly up-regulated after a 12-h exposure to E2. Expression levels of the ERalpha were inhibited by ICI 182,780 and fulvestrant. The Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-w), tumour necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha), Fas ligand, osteoprotegerin, cyclin E and CDK-2 were significantly up-regulated in E2-treated retinas at 4 h as compared to the control. Although mRNA levels for some of these genes decreased at 24-48 h in the E2 group, their levels remained significantly higher than those in the control group. Expression levels of cyclin d1 and survivin increased significantly after a 24-h exposure to E2. At E2 concentrations equivalent to that of the chick's natural circulating oestrogen, i.e. 3 x 10(-9) mol/l, proliferative cells were also labelled in the control, an observation that supports the idea that there may be a proliferative effect in the retina of oestrogen-signalling components at low doses. When E2 was co-administered with ICI 182,780, levels of cyclin E, cyclin d1, CDK-2, and survivin mRNAs were inhibited.


CONCLUSIONS
E2 may affect retinal cell proliferation and survival during oestrogen synthesis (3 x 10"

Detailed Description:

Study Overview:
The study is structured into two parts. In the first part the investigators will be recruiting 10 patients with MDD-AD and 10 Healthy controls, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each participant will be evaluated by a team of experienced psychiatrists and clinicians, administering structured clinical interviews to assess the presence/absence of axis I and II psychiatric disorders (SCID-I and SCID-II) (first visit). Furthermore, in all subjects the degree of depressive/manic dysintomatology will be measured through the use of clinical scales and psychopathological tests such as:the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery- Asberg Depression rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (second visit; within one week of the first screening visit) . Moreover, additional clinical data will beextrpapted from medical records and interviews with psychiatrists (if available). The investigators will also evaluate the suitability of each participant to undergo the multimodal acquisition of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data with a 7T GE scanner. The neuroimaging session, performed during the third visit (within one month of the second visit) will include: T1-weighted image acquisition: to study the volumetric differences of white and gray matter between subjects in the prefrontal-limbic pathway. fMRI: to assess functional connections between prefrontal cortex and limbic system. 1H-MRS: to study glutamatergic neurotransmission within the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The sequences will be optimized thanks to the 32-channel brain coil (NovaMedical), to reduce artifacts and inhomogeneities in images. The second part of the study will involve murine models. More specifically, to assess whether Pcdh9 deficits affect the number and morphology of excitatory synapses, electron microscopic analyses will be performed in Pcdh9-knockout mice. Glutamatergic signaling will also be studied at the biochemical level: the expression levels of all major glutamate receptor subunits (ionotropic and metabotropic) will be investigated by analyzing cortical protein lysates (total lysates) in adult mice (3-4 months). In addition, to identify finer changes in glutamate receptor expression, their intracellular and surface expression will be analyzed using the BS3 crosslinking assay. The investigators will also proceed in the characterization of the interaction between integrin β3 and Protocadherin9 using co-immunoprecipitation analysis from mouse brain: in case of positive results (at least 3 replicates), further analysis will be conducted to study whether overexpression of integrin β3 or protocadherin9 could compensate for defects in synaptic glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs. In this case, experiments on murine models will be perform to determine whether overexpression of integrin β3 or protocadherin9 could compensate for deficits in glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs.. <EOD> Interactions of tau proteins and actin contribute to tau pathologies

Background: To report results of a 4-year follow-up study of the treatment of pediatric patients with intractable lupus nephritis.Methods: Six children with refractory nephritis were treated with a low dose of dexamethasone, mycophenolate mofetil and intravenous immunoglobulin G for 3 months. The disease state was then monitored monthly, and re-treatment was continued for another 12 months if necessary.Results: Four patients responded, including complete remission in 3 patients, while 2 patients remained unresponsive. After the 12 months of treatment, we observed improvement in the blood concentrations of inflammatory markers, blood pressure levels, urine protein levels, and the renal function of the kidneys.Conclusion: Our results indicated that a 12-month course of methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and prednisone or mycophenolate as induction therapy is effective in the treatment of lupus nephritis, especially in patients with low levels of antinuclear antibodies.

# Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with diverse clinical manifestations and an unpredictable disease course, and can range from mild renal pathology to the most aggressive and destructive renal disease of any of the autoimmune diseases. Renal involvement is detected in 20-70% of all SLE patients, and the prognosis of the disease is related to the severity and type of renal involvement. The main renal manifestation is nephritis. The prognosis of the disease also depends on the presence and type of lesions in the kidney. Dermal lupus nephritis (LN) patients have the least severe prognosis, while patients with mesangial proliferation and membranous LN are more likely to have a worse long-term prognosis. Therefore, LN remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among SLE patients.
The current treatment of LN has not achieved satisfactory results. The treatment for LN is based on a disease-modifying-anti-rheumatic-drug (DMARD), and combined use of prednisone and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil in children. Although immunosuppressive therapy is effective in treating mild renal lesions, the mortality and recurrence rates are relatively high in severe renal involvement. Refractory LN often fails to improve with conventional treatment, and the use of new drugs has also been limited because of adverse reactions or contraindications.
Based on the use of intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) and oral cyclophosphamide as treatment, the pediatric rheumatology clinic at the Shanghai Children's Medical Center has created a new treatment regimen for children with refractory multi-system organ disease activity. During the process of treatment and follow-up for patients, we found that some of the patients had refractory LN, and that the children with refractory LN had a good response to treatment that included steroid therapy combined with methotrexate and mycophenolate. In 3 years of treatment and follow-up, the patients' hematuria and proteinuria disappeared. After 1 year of treatment, the concentration of anti-nuclear antibodies decreased.

 <EOD> Higher Incidence of Hip Osteoarthritis in Women than in Men: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Women have a significantly higher prevalence of hip osteoarthritis (OA) than men, yet it remains unclear as to whether the female predominance exists in the incidence of hip OA. The current study aims to address this issue. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane library were searched up to February 2015, with language and article design restriction as no limitations. To examine whether the prevalence of hip OA in women is higher than in men, we extracted data from relevant epidemiological studies, which were included in 19 out of 14,879 articles (after screening all initially retrieved articles) for meta-analysis. The total number of participants involved in all included studies was 1,310,287, and the total number of participants with hip OA was 490,750 (628,047 hip joints). The combined prevalence of hip OA in women was 2.84% (95% CI 2.01-3.68) and in men 1.96% (95% CI.1.12-2.80). The incidence of hip OA in women was higher than in men (OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.26-2.12, z = 3.617, p < 0.001), and the result was robust in multiple sensitivity analyses. Meta-regression demonstrated that the prevalence of hip OA in women decreased with increasing age (p < 0.001). We conclude that the incidence of hip OA in women is higher than in men, and thus, gender should be taken into account when diagnosing and treating hip OA. A trend showing higher incidence in women might be explained by post-menopause hormonal status.

 <EOD> Proximity hybridization to detect Escherichia coli O157:H7 in surface water.
Rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of target organisms in water, particularly during large epidemics of waterborne illness, remains a difficult technical and public health challenge. Currently, detection is based on microbiological culture, which although definitive is slow and unsuitable for large-scale or epidemiologic studies. Bacterial detection using fluorescence in situ hybridization has recently been demonstrated to be sensitive, but generally requires cell filtration and hybridization incubation. Using a similar concept, but with a simplified detection approach, we evaluated a non-radioactive and easy-to-perform proximity-hybridization assay for the rapid detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, an enteric pathogen and etiologic agent of foodborne disease. The assay used labeled probes and an immunoassay detection format incorporating a unique signal-enhancement molecule, a peroxidase enzyme substrate, and luminol chemiluminescence as a reporter system. The assay detected E. coli O157:H7 in pure culture and in mixed-microbial suspensions in a 96 well plate format (1 CFU/10 CFU/mL). The detection assay was optimized to take 2 to 4 h to complete, including DNA extraction. Signal intensity correlated well with increasing concentrations of target cells and decreased linearly with the dilution of a mixed-microbial suspension. The assay successfully detected as little as 1 CFU/mL in Escherichia coli O157:H7 mixed with common river waterborne and foodborne microbes, Salmonella enterica, and the foodborne pathogen Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Finally, the assay is sensitive and specific to E. coli O157:H7 in a lake and river water matrix spiked with this strain, and other fecology strain-specific test organisms. The study, as opposed to other pathogenic microbe applied approach is required for human biological detection methods (i assay to assessments for O15710 CFUr organisms study design method, and applied as the assay and detection.

Input Text: Supporting Refugee Parenting Community and Family Mental Health in Tijuana

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

Month 1: The researchers will use a participatory research model to convene focus groups engaging community stakeholders in two large shelters in Tijuana to prioritize 3-5 parenting skills. Month 2: The researchers will recruit participating parents until reaching a sample size of 120, divided into 8 groups of 15. All participants will vote for 1-2 interventions from a list of 5 to revise and adapt to the local context through small group discussions and consensus building. Month 3: Participants will complete baseline questionnaires anonymously. Half of the participants (Group 1, N=60) will be randomized to receive the adapted learning curriculum in groups of 15, twice a week for 4 weeks. At the conclusion of month 3, all participants will complete the same questionnaires as pre-intervention. These data will serve as post-intervention data for Group 1 and a second baseline for the remaining participants (Group 2). During month 3, Group 2 will receive a two-page handout on childhood nutrition in Spanish. They will serve as the control group for the first wave of intervention. Month 4: Group 2 will receive the same intervention as group 1 in month 3. At the conclusion of month 4, participants will complete the same questionnaires as pre-intervention. They will also complete open-ended feedback interviews. Month 5: Researchers will analyze all anonymous data and share preliminary results with the community through peer leaders. Month 6-7: Researchers will conduct a phone follow-up for all available participants (2 months post intervention) and collect data anonymously. Month 8: Researchers will again analyze the aggregate data and share results with the community. Month 9: Researchers will draft a manuscript, share final results with the community and nonprofit/academic partners.

Input Text: Fluorescence Imaging With Indocyanine Green (ICG) in Endoscopic Spinal Surgery

Study Overview
----------------=

Detailed Description
-----------------
With the accelerated pace of the global aging society, the prevalence of degenerative diseases is increasing. At present, spinal degenerative diseases caused by body degeneration have become the most common type. With the continuous deepening of the research on spinal degenerative diseases and the continuous development, update and promotion of minimally invasive surgery technology and instruments, minimally invasive surgery has attracted more and more attention of spine surgeons due to its advantages of rapid recovery, small trauma and fewer complications. The core of endoscopic spinal surgery is nerve root decompression. The procedure is centered on the nerve roots, which can be damaged with the slightest carelessness. According to statistics, the incidence of nerve root injury under spinal endoscope is 1.8-2.5%. Most of the injuries include the stimulation and edema of the nerve root during the operation, which may lead to postoperative sensory retardation and motor weakness, which will damage the patient's physical function and reduce overall satisfaction. The intraoperative nerve exploration is time-consuming and critical, and the variability of the patient's nerve anatomy will also add difficulties to the operation. A real-time auxiliary intraoperative nerve identification technology is necessary. With the progress of optical technology, fluorescent-guided surgery has shown considerable prospects in assisting in identifying nerves. It has been applied to clinical research of thoracic sympathetic ganglion, facial nerve, phrenic nerve and pelvic nerve.

Summary of the Clinical Trial:
[
The purpose of this single centre, open-label, quasi-randomized controlled trial is to evaluate a structured, home-based parenting programme aimed at improving the child care skills and knowledge of parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs), to investigate whether there is any parent-programme interaction (intervention x time effect).
A single blind rater will evaluate parents with IDDs and their children. The primary outcome is change in the parent's perceived competence concerning child care.
Secondary outcomes include change in the parent's perceived distress and children's functioning. The trial will include 160 participants (divided into an experimental study group and a comparative control group). Parents living with children aged 0 to 9 years old will be recruited for the study from three Child Welfare Centres and by outreach from community social centres, and will be randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to either the experimental group or the control group. Outcomes will further be evaluated at baseline and 9 to 12 months post-intervention. At this time point, in the experimental group, parents will have received a minimum of six months of structured coaching sessions (parenting skills training), and will continue to be followed up weekly by the coaches for at least another six months. In the control group, parents will receive treatment according to the programme's routines in the social services (treatment as usual).

Intervention Plan
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Parenting Young Children, is a home-based intervention programme involving weekly, one-hour sessions over a period of at least six months. The programme has two core modules (1) Parent-Child Interaction and (2) Child Care Skills and Safety. The Parent-Child Interaction module focuses on the parent-child relationship and interaction skills such as parents' responsiveness to the child's signals, giving the child attention and encouragement, and supporting prosocial behaviour. The Child Care Skills and Safety module targets safety at home and the parent's caring skills (e.g. food, health, and hygiene). Checklists are adapted to each parent in order to support the PYC practitioner and the parent. The programme is compiled in a manual that includes work tasks"

 <EOD> A novel transposition of chromosome 10 (10;11)  is associated with an apparently balanced translocation  t(1;2;11;22)(q21;p12;q11;q11) in a boy with growth retardation and congenital malformations.
Cytogenetic investigation of a one-year-old boy with mental retardation and typical features of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) revealed an apparently balanced translocation  t(1;2;11;22)(q21;pl2;q11;q11). The PWS type of clinical manifestations (except for a specific body habitus) was due to an apparently balanced  reciprocal translocation carrier state. PWS was excluded due to other chromosomal causes (deletion 15q11-13). Therefore, the karyotype was checked by a molecular cytogenetic approach. A novel complex chromosome translocation , which is apparently de novo, was detected. The clinical features of the patient are compared with the 40 known patients carrying the der(10)t(1;10)(q21.3;p11.2--q11.2). The clinical spectrum in translocation patients with 10p duplication is remarkably varied, but some distinct features are common: body habitus of the facial shape, short stature, abnormal ears, hand malformation, urogenital abnormalities, and mental retardation in the mild form. <EOD> Molecular basis of amylin resistance in transgenic mice expressing a mutant human amylin gene.
Amylin (AMY) has been implicated as a beta-cell secretory peptide and is present in pancreatic beta-cells. The peptide has been found to be deficient in patients with the neurodegenerative disorder of type 2 diabetes. We report that transgenic mice, expressing a mutant human AMY gene which causes the disease, have a significant defect in glucagon stimulated-secretion of AMY, resulting in pancreatic beta-cell dedifferentiation. These results provide insight into the biochemical defect that accompanies AMY resistance in sporadic type 2 diabetes mellitus. <EOD> 
Gastric cancer (GC) remains a highly aggressive neoplasia, particularly at an advanced stage, which often presents several resistances to treatment, being considered one of the major public health problems. One of the hallmarks of cancer is angiogenesis, which allows the growth, invasion, and cancer progression of blood vessels. The development of these vessels occurs mainly in proinflammatory environments. In GC, the proinflammatory environment is present as part of the chronic immune response to inflammation at the host-pathogen level. On the other hand, tumor cells produce cytokines, which, along with the high expression of angiogenic factors, mediates the generation of the angiogenic phenotype of tumor endothelial cells. Thus, this review will focus on the immune-angiogenic environment of the tumor microenvironment, which is related not only to the prognosis and development of GC but also to neoangiogenesis, which is a strategy for successful treatment in patients and may be used as a new target of potential antiangiogenic therapies to treat and prevent progression to the disease. <EOD> Effect of exercise on postmicturition sensation in the neurogenic bladder.

Synthetic estradiol (E2)-3-bromocarbanilide (Bromocarbanilide estradiol, BCO) was recently synthesized and purified at the Regional Institute of Ophthalmic and Visual Science (University Park, Ilorin) and investigated to validate its estrogenic effect using rat uterine model. Ovariectomized Wistar rats were pretreated with progesterone, administered orally with either 1 or 0.1 mg of the drug, or normal saline for 6 days before sacrificing. The ovariectomized (normal) were used as positive and vehicle (normal saline) as negative control. Following euthanasia, blood and uterine tissue samples were collected for biochemical and histological analyses. A 2-factor fractional (A 2 B 2 ) design was applied, and blood and uterine estrogen concentration and histology were used to predict the estrogenic effect of BCO. The results were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 software. BCO caused a significant increase in blood estro-gen, uterine estrogen concentration, uterine wet weight and uterine index compared with control (P<0.05). The drug showed 19.99 times more potent than normal saline in uterine wet weight and 0.0205 times weaker than estradiol in uterine estrogen concentration. The high and low doses of BCO increased the effector variable to 163% and 165%, respectively whereas, the response factor of estradiol to the two doses of the drug (13.23 and 12.34 g) was very low (P>0.05). The ANOVA for the BCO-induced uterine wet weight was significant and the effect of the drug, 289.2% and 304%, was high. Moreover, the ANOVA for the BCO-induced uterine estrogen concentration showed that the drug effect was high (244.7%), but not significant. In conclusion, BCO displayed significant estrogenic effect, especially, in uterine wet weight, which is very important in the maintenance of pregnancy. The findings suggest that the drug could substitute for the currently used hormonal contraceptives. <EOD> Infections in kidney and liver transplant recipients.
Patients who undergo kidney or liver transplantation are significantly more likely than are the general population to develop serious infections with serious antimicrobial resistance or for which there is limited antimicrobial treatment options. Infections that occur after transplantation can be divided into three groups: (1) infections due to opportunistic pathogens that are transmitted from donor organs to recipients after solid organ transplantation, (2) infections acquired in the recipient from environmental contamination or contaminated health care devices, and (3) infections due to pathogens that were carried by the recipient into the transplant clinic. Management of infections in kidney and liver transplant patients is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach to antimicrobial stewardship. Proper selection of the appropriate antimicrobial and antifungal drug therapy should always be based on clinical judgment, as overuse and misuse of antimicrobials in transplant recipients can result in adverse patient outcomes including development of drug resistance and drug-induced toxicity. <EOD> Diabetes and dyslipidemia: risk factors in cardiovascular disease.
Over the last 15 years, several studies have reported the relationship between diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. The relationship between diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia is known.

Background:To determine whether the history of proctitis symptoms (diarrhea and/or rectal pain/bleeding) was a significant risk factor for urogenital symptoms which could be used to identify possible pathophysiological mechanism behind lower urinary tract dysfunction.Methods: 1286 male subjects who were followed in an andrology outpatient clinic were recruited to this study between May 1, and December 31, 2004. Patients filled out a standard form that contained questions regarding urogenital symptoms and proctitis symptomatology. Results of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and uroflowmetric measurements were recorded. Patients with any significant urological disease, including prostate cancer, were excluded from the study. The study population was divided into four groups: (a) No urinary and no proctitis symptoms, (b) urinary symptoms and No proctitis symptoms; (c) No urological symptoms but proctitis symptoms, and (d) urogenital and proctitis symptoms. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0. For the analysis of the data, c 2 tests and Student's t-test were used to compare urological symptoms in the groups as appropriate.Conclusion:An association between proctitis symptoms history and LUTS (voiding and storage symptoms) exists. The existence of a causal relationship between proctitis symptomatology and lower urinary tract dysfunction has not been determined. In this study, the relationship between proctitis symptoms and sexual dysfunction were investigated. However, we did not detect any correlation between proctitis symptoms and sexual impotence.

# Introduction

## Lower urinary tract
Symptoms (LUTS) is a general term used for describing storage, voiding and post-micturation symptoms. LUTS can be simply defined as a combination of symptoms including frequency, urgency, nocturia, weak stream, hesitancy, intermittent flow, painful micturation, straining, incomplete emptying and terminal dribbling   Urinary frequency as a major symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia, Abrams     Medical Management of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Younger Adult Men, Eckstrand  . These symptoms may be related with the physiological changes that are frequently seen in older men and women or may be the results of other systemic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease and cigarette smoking. The symptoms can be classified into ""irritative"" or ""obstructive"", both of which can cause a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
Several mechanisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of lower urinary tract dysfunctions, and several risk factors for these syndromes have been established. Etiology of LUTS, however, is not always clearly understood, as several systems can be affected by aging. Dysfunctions in the autonomic nervous system as well as altered bladder sensation and detrusor muscle function all contribute to the development of LUTS, and there seems to be a certain bidirectionality of these functions.

 <EOD> Genetic Analysis of a β-Glycan Locus, Cgt1, to Identify Resistance to Clostridium perfringens Enterotoxin in Rats

Glycoprotein rearrangements resulting from glycan synthesis, degradation, conjugation, and methylation are implicated in the invasion of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) to target cells because CPE recognizes N-acetylneuraminic acid in the membrane glycoprotein. Glycan rearrangements are orchestrated by N-acetylglucosaminidases, beta 1,4-glycan-branch mannose, and beta-galactoside-specific O-glycan phosphorylases, which are activated by cAMP. CPE-resistant rats, established through successive backcrossing with Wistar rats, showed a 2.4-fold reduction in cGMP levels after CPE administration, compared with those in CPE-susceptible rats without backcross. These results suggested that the rat strain harbored a polymorphism in the Cgt1 gene, which encodes N-acetylglucosaminidase and beta 1,4-glycan-branch mannose, and that the CPE-resistant allele showed lower cAMP-induced activation of N-acetylglucosaminidases compared with that for wild-type rats. We further investigated gene-deficient and knockout rats to define these differences among rat strains and genotypes. The gene-deficient rats exhibited reduced CPE resistance, and Cgt1-knockout rats displayed impaired mucus production in the duodenum, which is regarded as a major entrance for CPE. Genetically modified rats are a useful animal model for analyzing the molecular mechanism of CPE-induced colitis.

 <EOD> The use of the transabdominal approach to the hip joint for the treatment of recurrent congenital dislocation of the hip.
The technique of the transabdominal approach to the hip joint was assessed prospectively with a view to evaluating the indications for its use. The series comprised 24 children with recurrent congenital dislocation of the hip and with previous attempts at realignment failing to stabilise the hip, or with failed operations. Two children had open reduction of their subluxated hips at the time of the first operation. Sixteen of the 24 children had a good result from their first operation, and the technique was useful in securing an anatomical reduction of the hip when the dislocation could not be reduced by the usual techniques. However, the authors consider that this procedure should be kept as a last resort, except perhaps in the open reduction of a dislocated hip. <EOD> .
Using scanner and optical analyser system, we examined serum lipids, apolipoproteins, HDL and its enzymes in 69 schizophrenics at hospital (all men) and 37 men of the control group similar in age and body weight. We found lowered concentration of HDL-cholesterol, HDL-phospholipids, HDL-apolipoprotein A 1, cholesterol ester transfer protein, and higher concentration of triglycerides, and apolipoprotein C in schizophrenics hospitalized for 3-49 years. We found, in schizophrenia, a negative correlation of HDL concentration with severity of illness, with negative psychotics symptoms, and with severity of positive symptoms. These changes could be connected with the decrease in quality of life. <EOD> Interacting quantum particles.

The spermatogenesis and oogenesis–specific factor SUN domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2) localizes to nuclear pore complexes in the nuclear envelope. SUN2 dissociates from the nuclear pore membrane during sperm chromatin remodeling but reassociates following fertilization. In this study, we investigate whether the SUN2 function at the outer nuclear membrane is linked to sperm maturation in vitro or sperm chromatin remodeling in vitro. Sperm chromatin remodeling is required to release the histones that form the nuclear proteins during spermiogenesis. In vitro treatments of mouse sperm chromatin remodeling with trypsin and/or with nuclease to eliminate the inhibitory effect of nucleoplasm on chromatin remodeling indicated that chromatin remodeling in vitro is mediated by different proteins compared with in vivo in ejaculated sperm, and the histone component of the sperm core nuclear matrix is a barrier to the chromatin remodeling. Mouse eggs incubated with sperm chromatin remodeling medium preactivated with Ca2+‐ATP, trypsin, and nuclease failed to reach metaphase, but Ca2+‐induced activation occurred when eggs were washed after activation and incubated with fresh medium or with sperm chromatin remodeling medium without Ca2+‐ATP and nuclease. These results indicate that inhibition of the egg by sperm chromatin remodeling involves a soluble factor(s) distinct from the nucleoplasm and not eliminated by the treatment in the experimental in vitro conditions. We found that the SUN2 signal was present with the sperm chromatin remodeling medium, which suggests that SUN2 remains associated with nuclear pore complex components after chromatin remodeling. Our results show that, in vitro, the release of fertilin, which is a sperm surface protein responsible for capacitation and sperm binding to egg vitelline coat, takes place during sperm chromatin remodeling and that this process could"

The C‐terminal binding protein‐2 (CtBP2) gene encodes to a corepressor. It plays an important role in the CtBP2–controlled transcription by associating with several transcription factors, including nuclear receptors. CtBP2 also implicates in many biological processes and functions, such as proliferation, progression, and tumor metastasis. We have synthesized novel compounds based on the previously reported tricyclic compounds, containing CtBP2 inhibitors. Thirty compounds were synthesized from 5‐imidazo pyridine to 3‐imidazo pyridines according to the synthesis route. All synthesized compounds were characterized using melting point, IR, mass, 1H‐NMR, 13C‐NMR, and elemental analyses. Cellular activity of CtBP2 inhibitor‐2 (CtBP2i‐2) was determined by using cell proliferation MTT assay against normal lung fibroblast cell line (WI‐38), human breast cancer cell lines (MCF‐7), human prostatic cell line (PC‐3), and human ovarian cancer cell line (SK‐OV‐3). The results showed that compound 15, CtBP2i‐2, showed more selective growth inhibition at a concentration of 10−5 M against MCF‐7, PC‐3, and SK‐OV‐3 cell lines. In conclusion, the results showed that CtBP2i‐2 could be used as a lead compound in the treatment for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer. <EOD> Genetically Modified Insects for Pest Management: Evolution in the Gene Pool

Insects are among the most successful animals in the history of life, largely because they are able to adapt. In fact, insecticides are designed to kill the pests, whereas the pests have evolved mechanisms to counteract this assault. Genetic modification (GM) technology can be used to develop novel insect management strategies by expressing desirable traits in insects, through interfering with their pest potential, and increasing their vulnerability to lethal insecticides. In theory, some insects can be modified to interfere with one or more steps of the insect life cycle, from laying the next generation, making the offspring nonsterile, disallowing reproduction or destroying their genetic information via inducing mutations, thus altering the ability of insects to become pests so that the number of fertile adults is substantially lower than before. GM insects may be also made more vulnerable by expressing mutated genes responsible for detoxifying the insecticides. It is important to realize that a new generation of gene carriers will always emerge due to mutations, selection and natural genetic variation, which may be harmful to pest control because the transgenes may be rendered ineffective. In the present paper, we critically discuss the evolutionary aspects of GM insects, and explore the potential risk for introducing genes into wild insect populations to suppress the pest population.

# Introduction
Biological insecticides based on naturally occurring insect pathogens and parasites have not been used in a large-scale due to the risk of causing unanticipated harm to non-target organisms. Genetically modified (GM) insects can potentially be reared in a controlled environment and reintroduced back to the field in a timetested manner, and thus it is believed that GM insects would be more environmentally friendly and less hazardous   Biotechnological advances in insect pest control, Armes  . In recent years, the development, testing and licensing of GM pest management technologies in field trials have dramatically escalated, since they have the great potential for combating or avoiding pests in areas where insecticide use is problematic.

Please write a clear and concise description of the subject. Don't make it too long. Use only the relevant information. Here is a great study that has been studied by two researchers in 2005: The  and 
The authors in this study studied the effectiveness of epidural administration of lidocaine vs. bicarbonate infusion in the management of neurogenic pain, secondary to spinal cord injury. 
The inclusion criteria were patients who suffered from neurogenic pain secondary to traumatic spinal injury, with pain severity scores of greater than 5 on a rating scale of 0-10, and for whom less than one hour had passed since the last epidural infusion. 
Patients were excluded from the study if they had a history of hypertension, or any medications that were known to cause secondary hypertension. 
The study consisted of five groups of patients, receiving epidural injection of 5 cc of the following: normal saline, procaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, and dexmedetomidine, all combined with an equal amount of 8.5 % sodium bicarbonate.  All patients were able to receive additional doses of study medication or placebo at any time for the first 24 hours. 
Hypertonia, defined as an increased tone in the paralyzed muscle, was the main outcome measure.  The pain scores were also analyzed.  A visual analogue scale (VAS) was recorded on an hourly basis, prior to every injection, as well as a few hours after the injection. 
This study showed a decrease in pain score from a baseline of 6.2 for 24 hours in the procaine group, to 4.7 for 24 hours in dexmedetomidine group, to 5.1 for the bicarbonate group, and to 4.5 for the dexmedetomidine group. The lidocaine group showed an initial decrease from 4.6 to 1.6, which plateaued over 24 hours. 
Overall, the mean pain score for the lidocaine group was significantly less than the control group, at any time point, indicating the effectiveness of epidural injection with lidocaine. However, due to the small sample size, the conclusions of the study are limited.  <EOD> Acquisition of inhibitory synaptic input to spinal dorsal horn lamina I neurones is regulated by group I somatosensory activity
Somatosensory activity alters dorsal horn neurones in a manner that indicates the development of spinal somatotopy (‘tuning’). To understand how this alteration occurs at the receptor level, we compared the development of GABAergic and glycinergic responses to innocuous hair mechanoreceptive (Aβ-fibre) activity in rat lamina I dorsal horn (LIDH) neurones. The responses recorded by whole cell voltage clamp (I GABA or I glycine) were characterized from cell to cell (within anaesthetized rat) by their activation time and voltage dependence. In one group of cells (‘naive’), innocuous Aβ‐fibre‐evoked GABA and glycine synaptic currents were not maintained on the same cells. Within 1–3 days after dorsal rhizotomy, Aβ‐fibre input to cells with low spontaneous activity was associated with an increase in inhibition. By contrast, Aβ‐fibre input to cells with high spontaneous activity was associated with a decrease in inhibition. This increase or decrease could be prevented by tetrodotoxin (TTX). Therefore the activity‐dependent increase or decrease in inhibition after dorsal rhizotomy relied heavily on action potentials and was not a reflection of the direct activation of the presynaptic terminals with the somatosensory activity. The activity‐dependent changes in postsynaptic response were not limited to the LIDH. Recordings of dorsal horn cells in the spinal cord with the"

 <EOD> Membrane-tethered C-Terminal PB1 Fragment of Influenza Virus Polymerase Protein PB1 Binds to and Activates the Host RNA Polymerase II Transcriptional Factor c-Fos
ABSTRACT The influenza virus polymerase (P) complex is a heterotrimeric protein composed of PB1, PB2, and PA molecules. Here, we report that, in an earlier study, we had inadvertently cloned what we now call the PB1-C-terminal (PB1-C) protein into our plasmids instead of PA. This protein was transfected into cells along with the influenza virus polymerase, and our data suggested that PB1-C protein could be the missing link required for the polymerase, which lacked certain transcriptional activity, to obtain the same activity as the wild-type P complex. To test this hypothesis, we prepared recombinant PB1 protein, from which the N233 fragment had been removed, and assessed the transcriptional activity in the human HEK293T cells by transient transfection with the recombinant proteins. PB1 protein activated the transcription of a reporter gene, containing the promoter region of the host RNA polymerase II, in the presence of the polymerase. A mutant PB1 protein lacked this ability, indicating that PB1-C protein might have some transcriptional activity. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the presence of active protein kinase-like activity in the PB1-C protein. Further, the PB1-C protein might interact with the DNA-binding host c-Fos protein. Since the PB1-C protein retained PA-binding affinity, the protein was added to a reaction mixture containing the polymerase and c-Fos protein, but the PB1-C protein did not interfere with the interaction between the polymerase and c-Fos. Finally, the PB1-C protein did not affect the c-Fos interaction with the transcriptional factor, cAMP response element-binding protein. These results suggest that PB1-C protein might regulate the host RNA polymerase II activity by binding to c-Fos protein. <EOD> Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia causes accelerated atherosclerosis. The early diagnostic marker for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is xanthomas involving the tendons and tuberous ectasia, and the definitive diagnosis is based upon genetic analysis to determine whether the patients have a homozygous mutation of the low- density lipoprotein receptor (null LDL receptor genotype). Treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia by surgical or pharmacologic therapy is still exploratory and requires validation for safety and efficacy. For high-risk homozygous hypercholesterolemia, a combination of aggressive medical and cardiovascular surgery is recommended. <EOD> Association between physical activity and risk of all caneer, according to type of activity: a prospective large population-based study of 344,008 men and women

Background: The benefits of physical activity on cancer risk are well established but there is little information regarding whether the effect is the same in men and women, overall and according to type of activity. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of physical activity on all cancer risk according to sex and to evaluate whether the effects were the same according to activity type. Methods: Study subjects in this prospective large cohort study were recruited in the general population from the Danish FINDRISC Health Examination Surveys (2006)(2007)(2008)(2009). A total of 344,039 people from the Copenhagen and Aarhus region, Denmark, were offered a questionnaire assessing activity status (active/inactive) and physical activity according to type of activity over the previous year. The average duration of activity was calculated using time spent in different activities (sport/leisure/transportation).

What is a Behavioral Health Home (BHH)? [/INST]

A BHH (Behavioral Health Home) is a team of people whose job is to work with people with mental health and medical problems. Some team members are from the mental health system. Others are from the medical and social services community. Working with the BHH helps the person get mental health care when needed and more quickly (like having an appointment within 72 hours). People with serious mental illness who are connected to the BHH receive a new person-driven payment plan called Managed Care Behavioral Home (MCBH). You can see this plan as a way to coordinate behavioral health and medical care, but your behavioral health team will be there by your side to help you get the most of this program.

This paper discusses the need for a multidimensional measurement of poverty and how to apply the methodology to health policy. It points out how poverty is commonly understood, and identifies its dimensions and how these are measured. The discussion shows that social vulnerability is a more appropriate concept than poverty to understand the situation of the poor. However, social vulnerability is still measured in terms of income, which only covers one of the multiple dimensions of poverty. The conceptual framework adopted in the Brazilian Project for the Improvement of Quality of Life and Access to Services (PRO-AFASS) is presented and the tools currently being studied to measure the various dimensions of deprivation are described. PRO-AFASS consists of a series of complementary studies that are being undertaken to produce a multidimensional index on social vulnerability and assess strategies to improve access to public services. <EOD> Influence of the Dorsal Root Ganglion on the Extraction and Preservation of Axonal Proteins
Abstract : After peripheral nerve lesions, nerve endings undergo retraction of axonal sprouting. The effect of lesions of the dorsal root ganglia on axoplasmic enzyme activity in the distal stumps of rat sciatic nerves has been studied. The axonal protein content has been measured using a biochemical and histochemical technique. A significant increase in activity over control levels has been detected on the day after the nerve lesion. Protein concentration is significantly increased 1 day after nerve lesions. The data suggest that there is a loss of material from the nerve fibers after lesions, and that there could be an extracellular supply of axonal components in cases of neurological lesions. <EOD> Acid secretion in patients with duodenal ulcer. Evidence that Helicobacter pylori slows gastrin-induced parietal cell activity by suppressing somatostatin secretion.
We studied the in vivo effects of Helicobacter pylori on antral somatostatin (SRIF) and inhibitor of acid-splitting (IAS) output and on the gastric acid response to exogenous human gastrin-I (1-27). In 2 separate studies 15 duodenal ulcer patients underwent intravenous infusion of H. pylori, and SRIF and IAS concentrations and acid output were measured in gastric juice. Increased SRIF output was seen in both groups, and in group A there was a significant increase in gastric IAS output. Gastric juice pH was reduced by Helicobacter pylori to a significant degree, but the rise in gastric juice IAS concentration, an index of gastric acidity, was only 57%, perhaps because of a reduced gastric capacity, which was evident in that gastric output of SRIF was low. The gastric acid response to human gastrin (120 pmol/kg per hour) was measured in the patients before and after Helicobacter pylori infusion. The gastric acid response to gastrin was significantly ( P less than 0.01) reduced in the presence of the organisms. These findings suggest that gastric somatostatin secretion, at least under these conditions, is only partly responsible for the gastrin-induced reduction in acid secretion. On the other hand, Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with parietal cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy in the antral mucosa in association with a significant increase in somatostatin output, an important endocrine factor inhibiting parietal cell activity. <EOD> Nucleo-cytoplast fusion in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells: A preliminary study

PURPOSE
To study whether patients having suffered a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) with a time lag between injury and rehabilitation (TLB) differ in outcome parameters from other patients admitted without a TLB.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cross-sectional-design with 83 patients (56 males, 27 females) within their first 6 months after severe TBI. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: I) 25 patients (32 %) had a TLB (TBI+TLBD), II) 58 patients (78 %) attended the clinic directly after the TBI without a TLB (TBI+TLBD/-). Standardized assessments of attention/psychomotor speed, memory (verbal), executive functions, language functions, sensation and visuospatial functions, depressiveness, quality-of-life (QOL), pain, and neurologic examination were performed within 120 days post injury. Age, time to hospital admission, severity at admission (GCS), and type of TBI (extradural, subdural, intraparenchymal, contusion) had to be considered for evaluation. The Mann-Whitney-U test and ANOVA (independent t test) were applied.


RESULTS
For some parameters no correlational differences could be found between the groups. In contrast, patients with a TLB had better performance than those with no TLB in attention/psychomotor speed, the memory (verbal), the executive functions, language functions and the neurologic examination.


CONCLUSION
At least for the first 6 months after TBI the type of TBI, the age and the time from injury to inpatient admission are relevant factors for cognitive outcome. Although it is a cross-sectional-study, the patients with a TLB seemed to have a better cognitive outcome than those with no TLB. <EOD> Phase noise and optical signal fading in optical frequency division multiplexing.
Optical frequency division multiplexing allows for the encoding of multiple channel functions with the frequency offset of each function as the multiplexed carriers. In the proposed 6.6 Gbit/s 16-channel system with optical carrier-suppressed phase-shift keying (O-CPSK) modulation formats, the coherent optical pulse shaper is directly inserted into the data-transmission system to perform pulse-shaping and frequency offset conversion. Phase noise and signal fading induced by the direct insertion are analyzed and characterized. Experimental results show that the relative coherent pulse-shaping performance, compared to that of the coherent optical pulse shaper in an optical add/drop module, is basically identical. The optical signal fading induced by pulse shaper-transmitter mismatches is also negligible within the time scales studied. <EOD> Genetic Determinants of Skeletal Muscle Insulin Resistance in Non-Obese, Normoglycaemic Individuals

Individuals, with normal glucose metabolism, who exhibit insulin resistance (IR) in the muscle are at an increased risk of developing T2DM. The underlying mechanisms that determine this intrinsic phenotype remains to be clarified. Here, we have utilised a cohort of non-obese, normoglycaemic individuals (n = 100), to identify genetic determinants of muscle IR. We show that plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, as well as HOMA-IR, are higher in IR groups compared to the IR groups' respective controls. Insulin action in muscle was lower in the IR groups compared to controls, as determined by the insulinogenic index; but there were no differences between the IR and control groups for hepatic insulin resistance as determined by the HOMA-β%, or in the rate of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal during an O"

1.1 Background



Auditory Information

    For the benefit of the individual performing the screening, the following auditory information is provided below:









1.2 Signs and Symptoms of Hearing Loss in Children






    Auditory sensitivity in children is inversely proportional to age and is expressed as a loss of hearing sensitivity in dB.
    1)  17% of children with normal hearing at birth have some hearing loss by age 2
    2) At age 2, the hearing loss is 20-30db
    3) By age 6, it is 30-40 dB
    4) By age 12, it is 45-55 dB
    5) By age 60, it is > 70 dB







1.3 Types of Hearing Loss





    There are four types of hearing loss:
    1) Conductive Hearing Loss
    2) Mixed Hearing Loss
    3) Sensory Neural Hearing Loss
    4) Peripheral Hearing Loss












    1.3.1 Conductive Hearing Loss





    A conductive hearing loss is due to a sensory hearing issue. Although the outer and middle ear are normal, the sound cannot travel easily to the inner ear, which is anatomically inaccessible. The conductive hearing loss will typically be conductive hearing loss is typically seen in adult males, and is not a concern in children. It is the outer or middle ear pathologies that must be ruled out.






    A Conductive Hearing Loss can be congenital, unilateral, or acute or chronic.
    1) Congenital
    2) Unilateral
    3) Acute
    4) Chronic



    1.3.2 Sensorineural HearingLoss





    If the conductive hearing loss is ruled out, a sensorineural issue is usually the cause. The inner ear (cochlea) is a complex sensory organ designed to perceive sound. The  sensory nerve fibers travel directly from the cochlea to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain. These fibers cannot regenerate; therefore, when they are permanently damaged, such as an acoustic trauma or ototoxically, they will result in permanent sensorineural hearing loss.





    The sensory nerve fibers are myelinated nerve fibers that carry sound information to the brain. These nerve cells must be alive and connected.
    1) Sensorineural Hearing Loss
    2) Sensorineural
    3) Myelinated
    4) Nerve Cells






    1.3.3 Mixed Hearing Loss





    A mixed hearing loss is due to a combined sensory issue and a structural or fluid issue within the ear canal or middle ear where the sound is created. An example of a mixed hearing loss is a middle ear infection (ie. Otitis Media).





    There are four types of mixed hearing loss

    1) Conductive plus Sensorineural
    2) Conductive plus Sensorineural
    3) Sensorineural plus Mixed
    4)Conductive plus Mixed





    A mixed hearing loss will usually have a sensorineural hearing issue that is accompanied by a conductive pathology such as a fluid issue.






    1. 3.4 Peripheral Hearing Loss





    The central pathways in the ear are the last to lose sensitivity. A peripheral hearing loss is"

 <EOD> The effect of preincubation on the uptake of p-hydroxybenzoate by rat kidney slices.
1. The uptake of p-hydroxybenzoate exhibits a lag of half-life of 4–5 min at 370 C. The effect is eliminated by preincubation with 10–3m-p-hydroxybenzoate or with 0-1mm-p-aminobenzoate. 2. A similar effect is also obtained with asparagine or L-leucine supplied during preincubation; other substrates or phosphate are without effect. The decrease in initial activity is not accompanied by a comparable decrease in final activity. 3. There are two kinetic components to the uptake of p-hydroxybenzoate, with apparent Km'S of 0.09 mm and 2.62 mm at 37° C in unincubated slices, or 0.03 mm and 0.32 mm after 5–10-min preincubations. Preincubation with the organic substrates inhibits only the high affinity transport component. <EOD> The Effect of High Intensity Interval Training on Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor and C-Reactive Protein in Women with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial

Methods Using a randomized controlled clinical trial design, 185 diabetic and non-diabetic women with BMI (≥30 kg m−2), age (18–45 years) and normal blood pressure were selected and randomly allocated into 3 control (CG), aerobic training (AG), and interval group (IG), 62 in each group. ACR in AG and IG was performed once for 16 weeks and 20 sessions 5 days a week on a treadmill and on a bike with 50–70% HRmax. The interval training group did 30 s exercise, 15 s pause and the aerobic group performed one-minute exercise, one-minute pause. Blood samples and body composition were measured at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks. BDNF, CRP, IL-6, and insulin also were analyzed. Results The effect of exercise training on anthropometric indices, cardiopulmonary and vascular parameters, insulin and lipids are all in the normal range. BDNF significantly higher in the interval group (p = 0.05) compared to the other groups at the end of the 16th week. Insulin has significant relationship with BDNF-IR in the three groups; whereas, CRP in both the AG (p = 0.01) and IG (p = 0.03) has a negative relationship with BDNF. Conclusion High-intensity interval training significantly improves BDNF and inflammatory factors in diabetic women. It is recommended that this form of exercise be practiced. <EOD> A case report of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum following vaginal delivery complicated by maternal sepsis

 <EOD> A case of cutaneous and systemic necrotizing vasculopathy due to human herpesvirus 7 reactivation
A 36‐year‐old woman visited a dermatologist with multiple erosions on the lower extremities. Histopathological tests and polymerase chain reaction revealed an infection with human herpesvirus 7 (HHV‐7). She was referred back to the original hospital because of systemic symptoms of myalgia, fever, anorexia and skin ulcers. Biopsy of rectal mucosa confirmed HHV‐7 infection. Immunoglobulin G and M anti‐HHV‐7 antibody titres were high. We diagnosed her as having an HHV‐7 reactivation–associated systemic vasculopathy. The skin ulcers gradually disappeared under antiviral treatment. Mild cutaneous vasculopathy in HHV‐7 reactivation has been reported, but this is the first Japanese case of cutaneous and systemic necrotizing vasculopathy due to HHV‐7. <EOD> A case series of cerebral venous sinus thromboses in COVID-19

COVID-19 is a global pandemic whose association with thrombotic complications continues to be an area of emerging research. In the present study, we report the incidence and outcome of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. From March 2020 to May 2020, we evaluated 656 patients with proven COVID-19 at our tertiary care hospital; 7 patients (1.06%) were found to be clinically diagnosed as having cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without any congenital anatomical abnormalities. These patients were subsequently evaluated by detailed medical history, routine laboratory testing, electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, computed tomography scan of the head, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, lumbar puncture and cerebral venous sinus angiography. They were then managed based on clinical and radiological findings and treated symptomatically including steroids, anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs and immunoglobulins. Six patients with CVST survived. One patient died despite maximal supportive therapy. COVID-19 infection should be recognized as a prothrombotic state and appropriate anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy should be incorporated into the treatment to decrease the risk of thromboembolic events. Further research is needed to validate a higher incidence of this thrombotic phenomenon with this new disease.

Background: There is evidence to support the existence of a physiological upper limit of cross‐sectional area (CSA) in the carpal canal. There is also evidence showing that in most patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), the CSA of the carpal canal is greater than a hypothetical threshold value for normal individuals. In this study, we evaluate whether ultrasonographic measurement has any specific predictive value as means for diagnosing CTS. <EOD> Corrosion-resistant electrocatalyst with a bimetallic nanoparticle cluster.
The rational design of heterogeneous catalysts for practical renewable energy technologies is limited by the lack of structural understanding of the intermediates during the catalytic reactions. To bridge this gap, we synthesized a 3D intertwined network (INT) structure as an electrocatalyst using an organic molecule and metal salts with a large excess of Na2S2O8 to promote a controlled co-reduction and reaction under extremely mild conditions. 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTD) was employed as a cointercalator to generate a high surface area, which enables a precise investigation of the catalytic activity. The network structure and the specific coordination environment with the cointercalator enabled an excellent chemical stability of the intertwined network at 125 °C for 48 h and 100 °C for 24 h. We investigated the effects of chemical composition, structural characteristics, and thermal stability on the catalytic performances of the as-prepared INT by in-situ electrochemical X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The intertwined network structure with a controlled degree of alloying in the heterostructure showed 4.4-fold higher durability than a Ni(OH)2 single crystal as a representative of a bulk conventional catalyst. In addition, the optimized heterostructure showed a significant improvement in the electrocatalytic activity and thermal stability, which was attributed to the reduced surface defects and the high cointercalator coverage in the INT structure. This approach provides a new methodology for the development of highly stable, robust electrocatalysts from existing state-of-the-art materials. <EOD> Association between body mass index and preeclampsia severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
BACKGROUND
Excess maternal weight has been associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia (PE) and severe maternal morbidity with an increased risk of preterm birth. However, the evidence is not clear. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examined whether the association between BMI and PE severity risk in pregnant women is modified by preconception BMI, preconception GWG, trimester of onset, and ethnicity.


METHODS
We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, and CENTRAL and included studies published until 21 August 2020. The primary analysis compared the adjusted effect estimates of the association between BMI and PE severity to assess the overall effect of BMI on PE severity. Sensitive analysis was performed by separating the sample of included studies into two subgroups (i.e. 27-week-based studies and 34-week-based studies) and examined their effect size.

BACKGROUND
Estimates of the prevalence of depression among elderly Indians vary widely, ranging from 9% to 45%. We estimated the prevalence of depressive symptoms and its correlates among elderly persons (aged ≥ 60 years) residing in urban India using nationally representative data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI).


METHODS
We used the two-stage cluster sampling method to randomly select 72,250 persons from 640 clusters in rural (314) and urban (326) areas of all 29 States and 6 Union Territories of India. A total of 45,411 respondents with complete observations were included in this study.


RESULTS
The weighted prevalence of depressive symptoms was 11.4%. Persons living in the northeast had a 1.21 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.26) times higher prevalence, persons widowed or divorced had a 1.23 (95% CI: 1.15-1.30) times higher prevalence, those with a history of heart disease had a 7.1% (95% CI: 6.0-8.3) higher prevalence, persons with one to three chronic conditions had a 1.53 (95% CI: 1.39-2.70) times higher prevalence, and participants who had depressive symptoms also had an 8% (95% CI: 2-14) higher likelihood of living alone.


CONCLUSIONS
Nearly half of the elderly persons who have depressive symptoms in India are living alone.


IMPLICATIONS
The current study provides a clear insight into the prevalence of depression in later life in India after nearly a decade, along with a multitude of risk factors associated with depression in old age. These findings will add to the existing knowledge of depression in old age in general and in India, in particular. <EOD> Association of the D349G variant of the human mu opioid receptor with heroin addiction
Heroin is metabolized to a long‐acting, 3–30 times more potent morphine‐like substance, 6‐acetylmorphine (6‐AM). Both opioid receptors and CYP2B6, the enzyme responsible for the first step in 6‐AM metabolism, are differentially regulated by morphine and 6‐AM; therefore, understanding the association between the genes that encode or regulate either protein may help further unravel how morphine use alters opioid and other substance use and dependence. This report investigated the genetic association of the opioid system with heroin addiction in 360 European American heroin addicts and 687 European American controls using a candidate gene approach. An additional goal was to assess the contribution of genetic variation in the human μopioid receptor (OPRM1) on both self‐reported measures of past week heroin use in 258 addicted individuals and toxicological detection of this drug and related metabolites in blood from individuals (N=47) who sought emergency treatment for acute opioid intoxication/overdose. We identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1799971, in the OPRM1 gene, that contained the highest association with heroin addiction (P=1.9 × 10−4; OR, 1.73; CI, 1.30–2.32). This locus is adjacent to the SNP rs6267, which contains the common D349G polymorphism that has been linked with altered human OPRM1 expression and function. We investigated this putative functional polymorphism in 477 individuals and found that the G allele was associated with both increased addiction liability (P=0.02; OR=3.8; CI, 1.3–12.4) and increased past‐week heroin use (P=0.001; d=0.87; CI, 1.40, 2.25).

 <EOD> Influence of the number of implants installed on the stress distribution on the interim abutments.
BACKGROUND
This study evaluated the stress distribution of provisional abutments installed on implants.


METHODS
Eight implants with varying diameters were tested. Three abutments were selected (3, 4, 5 mm). These abutments were placed in four positions:
(1) A single 4.0 mm implant. (2) Four implants with an interimplant distance of 3.6 and an implant/abutment diameter ratio of 1.0. (3) Four implants with interimplant distance of 2.3 mm and an implant/abutment ratio of 1.4. (4) Six implants with an interimplant distance of 3.6 mm and an implant/abutment ratio of 1.5. The study was conducted in two steps: (a): In the experimental model made in resin and in the µCT bone scan, the implants received a diameter of 5.0 mm and a length of 12 mm. Then, the resin model was scanned by micro-CT, and the µCT bone scan was co-registered with CT. This process gave 2D and 3D images. (b): Three provisional screwed connections were assembled with two interimplant distances, 3.6 and 2.3 mm. To simulate the physiological condition of the mouth, a weight of 100 g was loaded 2 cm above the implants. A static axial load of 130 N was imposed for 6 s. Finite element analyses (FEA) were performed in order to determine the maximum principal stress (psi) of the abutments and their implants.


RESULTS
The results revealed that the implants with short interimplant distance showed lower stresses than the implants with long interimplant distance. The 2.3 mm interimplant distance and the provisional implant with 4 mm diameter showed the lowest stresses with the lowest variation, and were considered the most suitable for clinical application in the implant/abutment ratio of 1.4.


CONCLUSION
The maximum stress observed in the 2.3 mm interimplant distance model was 21 MPa. Therefore, these implants can be recommended in cases of partial restorations, as they are shown to be suitable for clinical application. <EOD> Evaluation of a new radiographic progression criteria (TiMER) on radiogroups of rheumatoid arthritis patients
Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate a new radiographic progression criteria (TiMER method) in a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients starting a first therapy either with anti-TNF blockers or synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (sDMARDs). Methods 137 anti-TNF treatment naïve RA patients were prospectively included in this study. A conventional radiological scoring was performed at inclusion (time T0) and after 12 months (T1). All joints were counted on total number of radiographies. Joint progression >0.513 unit of Sharp van der Heijde score (SHS) was considered as significant erosion progression (EPS). Results The EPS rate at T0 was 22.8% in the biologics group and 25.0% in the synthetics. At T0 and according to EPS, a significant difference was found between the two treatment groups (p = 0.0005), with a more severe erosion score in RA patients under synthetical treatment. EPS evolution at T1 was not significant between the two treatment groups (p = 0.49). Conclusion The TiMER method is a new useful method to assess RA severity and for assessment of anti-TNF drugs efficacy"

Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivative possessing a thione moiety exhibited excellent antifungal activity (MIC 1.5-6.25 mg mL À1 ) in vitro against Candida, Aspergillus species. Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-thione-derivatives displayed potent inhibitory activity against C. albicans 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (GND) with Ki values of 1.2 to 14.7 mM.

# Introduction
Imidazo-pyridine scaffold has attracted signicant attention owing to its wide range of biological and pharmaceutical activities. 1 Compounds containing this scaffold exhibit activity as platelet activating factor (PAF) 2 and thromboxane A2 3 antagonists, inhibitors for histamine N-methyltransferase, 4 histamine H(3)and H(4) 6 receptors, phosphodiesterase-IV inhibitors 7 and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine was also reported to show antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, and Microsporum nanum. 9 Imidazopyridine derivatives exhibit excellent fungicidal activity against C. albicans and Aspergillus species. 3j 10 In fact, an imidazo pyridine-based chlorine molecule has been used as a commercial antifungal agent. Herein, we report an investigation into the synthesis of a new class of antifungal agents involving substitution of the pyridine nitrogen with a thione moiety to impart additional reactivity. The imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-yl-1H-imidazoles were readily prepared from the reaction of bis(chloromethyl) azoliums with sodium formate. 12 Reaction of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-formates 4 with hydrazines generated novel series of imidazo[1,2-a] 5 pyridine-2-thiones, containing a formyl function, and in situ addition of this formyl function to sodium azide afforded the target compounds 6 (Scheme 1). In fact, we discovered that an imidazo[1,2a]pyridine nitrogen bearing a 2-thione moiety exhibited a higher antifungal activity than the 3-pyridylamine compound.

# Results and discussion
The target imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives were rationally designed to target a fungi-specic C. albicans 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (GND). Thus, the reaction of 5-(tosylmethylene)-2-formyl imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 4a 12 with hydrazines in dioxane, followed by aqueous work-up of the reaction mixture, afforded the desired synthetic targets, imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-thiones 6a and 6b and pyridine-2-thione 7, in 47-75% yields. Compounds 6 were generally isolated as white solids and 1 H NMR spectra showed that the 2-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-thiones 6a and 6b had a singlet peak at 8.87 and 8.83 ppm for the azomethine protons, respectively. Also, in the case of 7, the 2-pyridine-2-thione proton appeared at"

Due to a lack of an admission BNP level of 400 pg/mL (if in sinus rhythm) or 600 pg/mL (if in atrial fibrillation), we will exclude patients with end-stage renal disease (stage V) or those needing renal replacement therapy.
Due to the above reasons, we think that the results of this study may not provide sufficient evidence to apply the new recommendation of the ≥20% reduction of ECF over a 6-hour period on an outpatient basis in patients with heart failure and fluid overload.
This trial will enroll 50 patients over 4 months. The study will be powered to detect an effective treatment for treating overt fluid overload in acute heart failure. The 2 groups will be balanced through random assignment to increase the validity of the study. The inclusion criteria are patients with acute heart failure with overt fluid overload and a BNP level of ≥400 pg/mL (if in sinus rhythm) and ≥600 pg/mL (if in atrial fibrillation).

 <EOD> Risk of cancer in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and incidental pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension
Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious lung disease with complex pathophysiology, and a variety of diseases is often comorbid. However, the incidence and risk factors of lung cancer in patients with pulmonary fibrosis with incidental finding of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension have not been studied. Therefore, we performed a retrospective cohort study of newly diagnosed pulmonary fibrosis (IPF or non-IPF) with incidental finding of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension from January 2005 to December 2018. There were 1657 participants (1049 IPF, 568 non-IPF, and 44 pulmonary embolism), and the median follow-up was 4.2 (interquartile range, IQR: 2.5–7.4) years. Lung cancer incidence rates in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and incidental pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and without embolism or hypertension were 1.1, 1.7, 1.3, and 0.6 cases per 10000 person-years, and the corresponding adjusted hazard ratio was 1.24 (95% CI 0.55–2.83, P = .60). After multivariate analysis, lung cancer occurred more frequent in non-IPF group (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.21–3.00, P = .005), and it was associated with older age (HR per 10-year increment 2.40, 95% CI 1.19–4.88, P = .013) and female sex (HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.26–5.73, P = .011). Lung cancer was more frequent in non-IPF patients than those in IPF group (HR 2.76, 95% CI 1.20–6.35, P = .017). Therefore, there were no statistically significant differences in risk of lung cancer among patients with pulmonary fibrosis and incidental pulmonary thromboembolism or pulmonary hypertension. <EOD> Mild cognitive impairment and dementia: the importance of modifiable risk factors
Modifiable risk factors for dementia include physical activity, smoking, diet, sleep, hearing and vision problems, and social deprivation. Treatment options for conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and hearing loss, could potentially prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Furthermore, improving access to screening tests used in the diagnosis of dementia could reduce delays to diagnosis. It is hoped that such advances will enable better planning by healthcare systems to deal with the increasing numbers of people diagnosed with dementia. <EOD> Transplantable human hepatocellular carcinoma as a possible hepatic fibrotic model.
Aim: We conducted this study to determine whether human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can regenerate and produce fibrotic stimulus in the liver of non-tumor bearing mice. Methods:-In this series, 1 × 107 HCC tumor cells were suspended in 120 μL RPMI-1640 medium and implanted by ultrasound guided intrasplenic injection method into the spleen of Balb/C male mice (n = 10). The tumor size was measured with ultrasound every week. The samples were frozen in optimal cutting temperature medium and stained by various histological methods. The tumor cell line was confirmed through electron microscopic examinations. Results: Transplanted HCC cells in  vivo, similar to parent nontransplanted HCC tumor cells in vitro, were found to be of hepatocellular origin having morphological features and electron microscopic characteristics of hepatocytes. The HCC grafts reached a size with features of fibrogenesis in vivo following about 4 weeks. The livers of recipient mice showed chronic hepatitis with fibrotic changes.

 <EOD> Cutaneous Manifestations of Intramuscular Cocaine Use: Review and Case Report.
Abstract
Intramuscular (IM) injection of cocaine is commonly observed at autopsy and in forensic cases. It is an increasingly common cause of cutaneous injury and complications in the clinical setting. Although injection of cocaine to the thigh is the most frequent anatomic location, injection into the back, chest, and extremities are also reported. Implantation and abscesses are among the more common cutaneous complications of IM cocaine use. In addition to these common complications, rare complications have also been described and include vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and other ulcerations, necrotizing fasciitis (NF), arterial thrombosis, and septic arthritis. The authors review the cutaneous clinicopathological spectrum of cocaine injection and report on a patient with PG due to cocaine intramuscular injection. <EOD> .
OBJECTIVE
To determine the influence of anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative substances upon the wound healing capacity in an experimental burn trauma. The substances tested in the present study were alpha-ketoglutaric acid and vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid).


MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred forty-four rats were burned with 1/2 of the total body surface to make the lesions comparable. The animals were divided into four groups: 1) burn, no treatment; 2) burn/ alpha-ketoglutaric acid, 10 mg; 3) burn/alpha-ketoglutaric acid, 100 mg; 4) burn/alpha-ketoglutaric acid, 300 mg. After a latency period of 3 days, the lesions were covered with occlusive, polyurethane film for the following 3 days. As in group 1 a positive control (burn) and in group 2 a negative control (untreated burn) were formed. The treatment groups 3 and 4 had to be treated twice daily with aqueous alpha-ketoglutaric acid solution. The wound healing capacity was measured. After 4 weeks a histological analysis was done by light microscopy.


RESULTS
The most favorable values for the percentage of re-epithelialization were found in the treatment groups 10/300 and 100/300 mg, as compared to the two negative control groups (untreated burns).


CONCLUSION
An optimal treatment with alpha-ketoglutaric acid was found in the concentrations of 100 and 300 mg/kg body weight. It can be assumed that the observed effects are due to the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activity of alpha-ketoglutaric acid. <EOD> Implications for cancer drug development

Cancer is a disease that continues to pose a formidable problem for public health and for medical science. Although great advances in cancer therapy have been made over the last century, the therapeutic landscape in oncology has remained fundamentally unchanged. Many cancer types still lack an effective cure or therapy for incurable disease. We propose a novel way forward, based at the interface between mathematics, biology and medicine. The implications of this way forward are significant and broad, embracing the future of both cancer biology and general biology, and perhaps, biology as a whole. Although the proposed future of general biology is perhaps not the main thrust of our argument here, it is certainly noteworthy, and deserves thought and action.
1. The standard way to treat cancer has remained fundamentally unchanged for decades. This is because the standard way is designed for only the rare case of local and early cancer, when the standard approach has its best chance of cure. When the cancer is regional and advanced, or metastatic and late, a number of other therapies are available but none has a cure, and none is curative. However, we believe that the standard way is now a weak relic, increasingly irrelevant.
2. Recent advances have exposed weaknesses and redundancies in the standard therapeutic approach. Increasingly, these weaknesses and redundancies may limit the generalizability of the cure for local and early cancer. Instead, those weaknesses"

[*] 1. What is the effect on personal treatment goals of ITB therapy by means of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)?
[**] 2. Is there an effect of ITB on spasticity and/or dystonia?
[**] 3. What factors influence treatment success after ITB treatment in the long term?
Background: As most cerebral palsy (CP) is resistant to therapy, medical innovations will only take part in optimizing functional outcome in these patients. Intrathecal baclofen (ITB), a central nervous system (CNS) de-excitator, may be such an innovation to influence functioning in children with CP. ITB allows continuous, intrathecal administration of baclofen. CNS symptoms that are treatable with high dosages of oral baclofen are difficult, if ever possible, to treat with ITB. ITB may be beneficial in children with severe CP with intractable spasticity, dystonia, spasmodic and/or unpredictable, painful lower limb tremor (PLMT), dysarthria or scoliosis refractory to conventional physical therapy. Currently, only a small subset of children with CP is eligible for ITB therapy. The medical potential of ITB will only be unleashed when we have a better insight into predictive factors for the effect of ITB in CP. Insight in predictive baseline characteristics influencing treatment outcomes and side effects would allow tailoring interventions to patients with ITB. In adult CP patients, we have studied which baseline demographics and clinical factors might be predictors of treatment outcomes after ITB, as is for example an effect of spasticity on the effect of ITB. We showed that a higher dystonia score before ITB was associated with less improvement in the domains of daily life after starting ITB. Moreover, the level of dystonia decreased under ITB in adult males with CP. We wondered whether similar results are found in children with CP treated with ITB. Moreover, as no data on factors affecting treatment outcome are available, we also aim to study which other baseline demographics and clinical factors might be predictors of treatment outcomes after ITB, and in particular factors affecting treatment outcome in the domains of daily life. This is the first study that systematically investigates which baseline factors affect treatment outcomes in children with CP treated with ITB. This study will answer the question of what are the short- (3, 12 and 24 months), medium-(1 year) and long-term (2 years) effects of ITB on personal treatment goals as assessed using the GAS in children with CP. It will also study which baseline demographics and clinical factors might be predictive for treatment outcome in domains of daily life (i.e. self care, mobility, life at home and occupation).

Introduction to the Study
- The study aims to investigate baseline factors associated with effect of ITB treatment in children with spastic hemipleig CP, dyskinesia or choreoathetotical CP. This study will answer the question of what are the effects of ITB on personal treatment goals, after 3,12,24 months, and on which clinical outcomes.

Objectives (3-5 objectives): - First objective: What are the short-,medium- and long-term effects of ITB compared to baseline on personal treatment goals? - Second objective: Which factors are associated with effect of ITB in personal treatment goals?
Outcome Measures | S2 File
- The primary outcome measure is improvement in personal treatment goals (assessed by goal attainment scaling [GAS]) measured after 3,12 and 24 months.
- The secondary outcome measures are: 1. The effect on spasticity according to the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS, as soon as possible and at each interval of 3 months) and the selectivity scale (SMISC; at baseline and 12 months) and improvement of spasticity and/or dystonia according to the Tardieu Scale (at baseline and 12 months) and Clinical Global Impression Scores (CGI-S and CGI-C, assessed at 3, 12 and 24 months).
- Other secondary outcome measures include the following:
- The effect on dystonia according to the Tardieu Scale and the Bar-ill Brady Scale
- The effect on muscle tone and muscle spasms according to the Modified Ashworth Scale,"

# Conclusion
===================

Through this study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of Nordic walking and its ability to reduce the fear of falling among older adults at risk of falls. By evaluating participants' adherence to Nordic walking and assessing their safety, we hope to gain insight into the practical implications of the intervention and identify challenges that could impact its implementation. As a result, we expect to establish Nordic walking as a safe and effective intervention for older adults at risk of falls, thereby improving the safety and quality of life of this vulnerable population. Our findings will inform future studies and guide healthcare and rehabilitation professionals in determining optimal interventions for older adults at risk of falls.

* [/END INST] Did you really look at your article? There is nothing there but your summary. This was supposed to be a conclusion.

# Background
=====================

In conclusion, the study sought to investigate the efficacy of Nordic walking as a primary preventive intervention for older adults at risk of falls. In comparison to traditional exercise programs, Nordic walking has been found to have several advantages: It may have the potential to effectively reduce the fear of falling, it can be practiced safely by individuals with various chronic conditions, and it is more cost-effective than traditional exercise programs. It has been observed that the fear of falling impacts the quality of life of older individuals, as it can restrict their activity levels and limit their willingness to engage in social activities and travel. Thus, Nordic walking programs for older adults at risk of falls are important to evaluate as they have the potential to improve the quality of life of this vulnerable population. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Nordic walking to serve as a valuable resource to meet the physical, psychological, and social needs of older adults at risk of falls.

# Implications
====================

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of Nordic walking as a preventive intervention for older adults at risk of falls. Nordic walking is a low-cost option that may have potential to improve the quality of life of older individuals who are at risk of falling. This is especially important to consider in the United States, where falls are a leading cause of injury and mortality among older individuals. With an aging population and an increased risk of falls, it is essential to consider the development and implementation of cost-effective preventive interventions. The implementation of Nordic walking programs, if shown to be effective, has the potential to benefit a broad range of individuals, as Nordic walking has been found to be a safe exercise option for individuals of various ages and health conditions. Furthermore, these programs can be implemented as a primary preventive method to reduce the fear of falling in the target population. The fear of falling impacts the quality of life of older individuals, as it can lead to social isolation and limit their ability to engage in physical activities. Identifying Nordic walking as a primary preventive intervention for individuals at risk of falls has the potential to improve their quality of life. Thus, Nordic walking may serve as a valuable resource for addressing the physical, psychological, and social health-related needs of older individuals at risk of falls.

## [/END]

# Conclusions
=====================

Through the results of this study, we expect to establish Nordic walking as an effective preventive intervention for older adults at risk of falls. This will contribute to an accumulative body of evidence that Nordic walking is a safe and effective activity"

 <EOD> Sustained Release of a New Active Ingredient in a Polymeric Microspheres System
Abstract— Thiazolobenzotriazole (TIBO) has been used as an active substance in the form of the TIBO‐laurate ester, known as TIBO‐L. For the local delivery of TIBO‐L to the vagina, a novel microspheres system has been prepared using a controlled porosity method with a polymeric core. Using acrylic porogenic beads as a template, polymeric particles, with a controlled size, size distribution and porosity, were obtained. By a co‐extrusion process in a three head extruder, poly (bis‐lactide) microspheres containing the TIBO‐L were produced, the drug being encapsulated in the inner layer. The surface of the microspheres was subsequently covered with a hydrophilised membrane to avoid any drug loss during the storage period. The release of the active ingredient from both types of microspheres, i.e. with open porosity and encapsulated in a porous polymeric layer, has been studied by a release‐rate measurement cell, designed for high viscosity materials. The results show a burst effect during the first three days, followed by a slow sustained release. The drug release from both types of microspheres was correlated with the particle density of the core, the extent and the rate of the water uptake by the microspheres. The release‐rate profile was not significantly altered during the storage period of six months. <EOD> 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 treatment in multiple myeloma: a novel approach using the VDRE and miRNA targeting
Abstract Although multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease, it may be possible to significantly improve treatment by targeting genes and pathways not currently being affected using the current agents/targeted therapies. We have targeted the gene for VDR, the receptor for metabolite of vitamin D3 (25-OHD3) in MM cells using DNA plasmid or VDR siRNA treatments. Treatment was then followed by transcriptional profile analyses of genes that are up- and down-regulated using RNA array. We found that treatment of MM with either 25-OHD3 or VDR siRNA induced the expression of genes which mediate the apoptosis of myeloma cells such as, BID, CASP3, and PMAIP1 in myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples. To further understand the mechanism/s by which VDR treatment inhibits cell growth in MM and to determine if there is a causally relationship between VDR expression and the regulator microRNA genes (miRNA), we conducted a transcriptome association study and found that the expression of certain transcription repressors are positively correlated with the expression of vitamin D-mediated genes, while three other microRNA isoforms are negatively correlated with certain transcription repressors in vitamin D-regulated genes. We then treated MM cells and primary patient samples with 25-OHD3 followed by RNA array analyses and found that genes that are involved in the differentiation of myeloma cells, like MITF, NKX3–1, and SOST were significantly up-regulated. Our findings suggest that vitamin D3-mediated anti-myeloma activity that is involved in the expression of tumor suppressor genes and microRNA genes.  <EOD> Detection of Tuberculosis: Molecular Diagnosis.
Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading infectious disease cause of death in the world and the second leading cause of death from infectious disease. Rapid and early diagnosis of TB with appropriate bacterial load determination is the critical component of clinical decision making. The introduction of molecular diagnostic techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has improved our capabilities. Although the World Health Organization recommends a diagnostic algorithm based on clinical and radiological studies supported by mycobacterial culture and sensitivity testing, these methods are slow and lack sensitivity. The addition of molecular methods for detection in the diagnostic algorithm improves detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria, provides prognostic information, can predict resistance to a key TB drug isoniazid, and can be used to track outbreaks. The utility of these techniques has been most evident in"

Inclusion criteria Written informed consent. 18-75 years of age. ECOG score for performance status is 0-2. Locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (T3-4/N+M0) with pathological and MRI diagnosis. Patient will undergo NCRT and TME therapies and develop RAII during NCRT or within 1 month. Exclusion criteria Patients with other active malignant tumors. Patients who have received pelvic radiotherapy or immunotherapy. Pathological tissue cannot be obtained after TME. Patients with toxicity (CTCAE Grade ≥ 2) caused by previous treatment that has not subsided. Pregnant or lactating women. Interventions The eligible patients who voluntarily sign the consent form will undergo NCRT and TME according to treatment guidelines. Outcomes The primary outcome is the AUC of chronicization of RAII predicted by the prediction model. The secondary outcomes are accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity of this prediction model in predicting chronicization of RAII. Recruitment Patients aged 18-75 years who have been diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer and consider NCRT+TME therapies and develop RAII during NCRT or within 1 month are eligible for the study. The study physicians will inform the patients about the study in detail. After obtaining informed consent, the patient is recruited to the study. We will follow up the occurrence and progression of radiation-induced intestinal injury within 1 year after TME. Expression levels of immune factors will be detected in pathological tissue after TME and applied to the prediction model to predict the chronicization of RAII. Participant timeline Recruitment started in March 1, 2023 at The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University. Sample size We plan to enroll 200 patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer by pathology and MRI, who undergo NCRT and TME and develop RAII during NCRT or within 1 month. Data management, collection and monitoring All protocol-required information collected during the study will be entered by the investigator in the electronic case report forms (CRF). The investigator should complete the CRF as soon as possible after information is collected. An explanation should be given for all missing data. The completed CRF will be reviewed and signed by the investigator. The main investigator will continuously monitor data. Data will be stored in the secured network of Sun Yat-sen University and for security reasons, in an external hard drive which will be used to back up regularly the database. Statistical methods For statistical analysis of the quantitative variables with normal distribution, the mean, standard deviation (SD), median and interquartile range will be calculated. Group comparisons will be made using t tests or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Associations between the categorical variables will be tested with the Chi-Square-test or the Fisher exact test, when appropriate. Paired values (before and after therapies) will be compared for each patient using a paired t test or a Wilcoxon test. The data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 27.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). A significance threshold of p < 0.05 will be adopted for all tests.

 <EOD> An APC-like gene in Drosophila melanogaster with differential patterns of transcript expression in larval and adult tissues.
Differential display of mRNA from larval and adult tissues has identified an APC-like sequence in Drosophila melanogaster. This 2.6 kb transcript, dubbed D-APC, which was amplified using degenerate primers, appears to result from splicing of alternative transcripts from the gene previously described. The pattern of transcript expression for D-APC is not identical to that of Caenorhabditis elegans APC during late embryogenesis. This suggests that APC may play multiple roles during development in different organisms and that there may be distinct forms of APC. <EOD> Fascioloides magna tegumental antigens modulate host cytokine responses to a LPS challenge: comparison of intravenous, rectal and oral routes of exposure

Luminescent bacteria (LuxS) were detected in the hepatic parenchyma, hepatic vasculature and biliary tree. Additionally, the luminescent biliary ducts were visualized in all groups. These data suggest that the biliary tree is a possible portal of entry and/or a reservoir for O. felineus, in cases of high parasite burden. Moreover, the data presented here also support the use of the hamster model to assess the protective effect of vaccine candidates.AbstractPurpose: The prevalence of opisthorchiasis and the distribution of opisthorchiasisassociated cholangiocarcinoma are increasing in the Asia-Pacific region. Clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of opisthorchiasis-associated antigen (Ov-16) is a safe and efficacious strategy to reduce levels of liver fluke infections. These results support the need for improved methods to detect, define and monitor parasite burden. Methods: Using an ultrasound scan (6.7-13.5-MHz linear intraoperative end-fire array transducer), O. viverrini and its associated larvae were detected in the liver, biliary system and peritoneal cavity. Intravital imaging with bioluminescent light (Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI)-O. viverrini) was utilized to assess parasite dissemination in BALB/c mice; additionally, it identified the sites of larval activity within individual organs and intravascular compartments of the vasculature.

Study description
--------

Cross-sectional clinical trial measuring therapeutic alliance in an acute, inpatient psychiatric setting

Location
---------

University Psychiatric Hospital of Zurich (Upcz), Zollikerstrasse 107a, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland

Sponsor information
--------------
This study is funded by SGPP.

Background
------------

Motivational Interviewing was developed more than two decades ago [1], as an effective therapeutic intervention to promote readiness to change in persons with psychiatric and other addictive disorders. A meta-analysis showed a large effect size of motivational interviewing on substance use and readiness to change [2], which can be transferred into the acute phase of psychosis. Although this method is well accepted in many psychiatric settings, it is not routinely practiced. Especially in the acute inpatient unit with patients severely affected by psychosis, this procedure has never been tested and its implementation in regular psychiatric care is lacking.

Aims
-------

Aim of the study is to investigate whether motivational interviewing in acutely ill inpatient patients with psychosis can enhance therapeutic alliance, adherence to treatment and psychological self-efficacy.

Eligible patients will receive four brief sessions of motivational interviewing and adherence to treatment, self-efficacy as well as therapeutic alliance will be assessed at different time points. To test whether therapeutic alliance is associated with adherence to treatment and self-efficacy, multiple regression analyses will be computed. Furthermore, comparisons between the MI and the control group will be performed to detect effects between the intervention and a supportive conversation.

In addition, we will conduct interviews to examine physicians' and psychologists' attitudes towards motivational interviewing. 

Aims of the CBT
-------
- To improve the patients’ personal resources to recover. A first aim is to create an empathic and supportive contact between patient and therapist. The therapist should listen carefully, accept the patient without any prejudices and be supportive and encouraging. This is important as we hypothesize that this enhances therapeutic alliance and subsequently adherence to treatment with a consequent improvement in psychotic symptoms, adherence to treatment and self-efficacy.

- To help the patient to learn coping strategies with the challenges they encounter at this time in order to improve self-management skills. 

- To increase the patient's motivation to change and give him/her the opportunity to talk about his/her ambivalence about the use of medication.

- To educate the patient about medication side effects or unwanted effects.

Inclusion and Exclusion criteria

Expected Outcomes
=============
The expected study outcomes will be:

- Enhanced therapeutic alliance
- Increased adherence to treatment
- Improved psychological self-efficacy
- Enhanced therapeutic relationship and non-supportive clinician input by the patient (BARS)
- Improved subjective medication adherence (BARS)

- Improved therapeutic relationship and negative symptoms by clinician (STAR-C)
- Improved therapeutic relationship and negative symptoms by patient (STAR-P)

- Improved therapeutic relationship and positive clinician interaction by clinician (STAR-C)

 <EOD> Characterization of pH-responsive nanoparticles for efficient delivery of siRNA in the lung.
Lung cancer is a major cause of global mortality, with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the most common subtypes. The current therapeutic options for both lung cancer subtypes are limited due to the lack of effective delivery of drugs and drug molecules to the tumors in the lung. RNA interference (RNAi) strategies targeted at specific key mutations and oncogenes are promising for overcoming the present limitations in lung cancer therapy. However, a challenge with this approach, as well as with other nonviral nucleic acid delivery systems, is low delivery efficiency into the cells, with low cell internalization of delivered DNA/RNA due to their size and susceptibility to degradation, coupled with nonspecific interactions with the airway epithelium. In this paper, we describe pH-responsive polymeric nanoparticles for efficient delivery of siRNA for effective lung gene silencing. These nanoparticles with a core-shell architecture in which siRNA was encapsulated to prevent its degradation into the small bronchial airways before cellular entry have a size of 500 nm. After entering the endosome, proton-activated, pH-sensitive polymeric nanoparticles responded to the low pH of the endosome through protonation of an amino linker, releasing the siRNA into the cytosol. We have demonstrated that the pH-responsive polymeric shell provides a better siRNA delivery performance compared to nonresponsive particles. <EOD> PDZ-SLiM: a PDZ domain surface for specific interactions with short (<15 residue) peptides
Although protein–protein interaction modules, such as SH3, WW, and PDZ domains, typically bind to peptides of 10–30 residues, increasing evidence indicates that these modules also interact with short peptides of fewer than 15 residues. While short peptides are generally not able to mimic the full recognition sequence of long peptides, many have nonetheless been shown to interact with their domain modules through a single specific interaction site, often referred to as a short linear motif (SLiM). In this study, an algorithm was used to derive specificity scores for every residue in a series of 230 PDZ domains, and from these, 251 PDZ domain surface sites for specific short peptide-binding sites were identified. These binding sites were termed PDZ-SLiMs. PDZ-SLiM specificity scores on the domain surface could predict short peptide specificity in the majority of cases. Many PDZ-SLiMs were located in close proximity to the pSer-binding pocket of the PDZ domain, an observation that could explain why short peptides are often involved in a wide range of signaling pathways. However, a significant fraction of PDZ-SLiMs were located away from the peptide-binding pocket, which could be important for a number of biological functions, such as membrane organization, protein–protein interaction networks, and targeting proteins to specific localizations. <EOD> Slow and fast muscle metabolism during prolonged exercise.
Energy turnover as measured from the recovery of isotopically labelled substrates was increased progressively during 1 h of prolonged moderate (30% VO2 max) cycle ergometer exercise with both fast (biceps brachii) and slow (medial gastrocnemius) leg muscles of nine volunteers (mean age 31 years). The increase in muscle metabolism was greater in slow than in fast muscle. Slow muscle turned over more carcass glucose, amino acids and fatty acids than fast muscle. The turnover of muscle glycogen and intramuscular lipids was decreased progressively to a similar extent in both muscles. The results show that the energy metabolism of"

This study is divided into two parts. In the first part, oxygen saturation measurements will be taken at 40 minutes by applying the block and the patient will receive the operation performed under general anesthesia.
Throughout the surgery, the arterial and central venous pressure and blood gas measurements will be recorded. The following parameters will be recorded for every 15 minutes before the operation, following the surgery: central venous pressure, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation (using a pulse oxymetry device), peripheral oxygen saturation (NIRS), peripheral arterial pressure, central arterial pressure (finger), central venous pressure (finger), arterial blood pH, bicarbonate value, hematocrit, hemoglobin, prothrombin time, partial prothrombin time, activated blood coagulation, fibrin degradation products (d-dimers) and C-reactive protein. Blood gases will be collected every 15 minutes throughout the operation. The urine output of the operated limb in the 30th minute of the operation will be also recorded. In addition, when the sensory block (cold touch) becomes negative, the total amount of analgesics required in the recovery room within 48 hours will be noted. It will be tried to keep the blood pressure within normal limits until the operation is finalized with the patients who did not have any complications (except mild hypotension) throughout the operation. At 45 minutes into the operation, the sensory block will be made positive with cold stimulus again using the NIRS device and measurements will be taken 40 minutes into the operation.
In the second part, a peripheral oxygen saturation probe will be applied under ultrasound control, after 40 minutes, to the block site. The sensory block levels will be determined by cold touch. Patients will receive the same anesthesia protocol and intravenous analgesia (diclofenac sodium 1ml + nefopam hydrochloride 1ml + morphine 10mg) and their analgesic requirements will be taken. If the arterial oxygen saturation value is less than 90% it will be treated under the supervision of the ICU doctor and the case will be terminated.

Background: Inhibition of Akt, Erk1/2 and Bcl2 signaling has shown promising results for tumor treatment. Flavonoids, naturally found in many plants, have been identified as potentially effective for a variety of pathological conditions, including cancer. In this study, we tested chrysin and naringenin, flavonoids isolated from Citrus fruits, for their ability to inhibit Akt, Erk1/2 and Bcl2 as a method for their potential use to treat glioma.Methods: In vitro glioma cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V staining and flow cytometry and by the detection of the cellular apoptotic markers Bcl2, Bax, and caspase-3. The kinase activity of Akt and Erk1/2 was examined using an antibody-based assay and Western blot analysis.Results: Both chrysin (10 −6 , 10 −5 , or 10 −4 M) and naringenin (200, 400, or 800 µM) significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in 9L glioma cells. Both chrysin and naringenin have been shown to induce apoptosis in a concentration-and time-dependent manner through the suppression of phosphorylated Erk1/2 and Akt, Bcl2, and Bax expression"
257,"[/INST] #This study uses a smartphone app (mindLAMP) integrated with a multifamily intervention (COPSI) to improve outcomes for people with schizophrenia (participants). A smartphone app, mindLAMP, allows for on-demand engagement with the intervention content to provide content that can be used in the participant's home, providing real-world information and educational videos in addition to providing a forum to connect with other participants with schizophrenia and their caregivers. The goal is to train participants to understand the causes, natural history, and treatments for schizophrenia as well as how they can manage and improve their own health outcomes. As part of the study, data will be collected such as participants' medical history, physical assessments, and demographic data. Measured effectiveness information will include disability levels, cognitive performance, psychiatric symptoms, and general quality of life. If the participants are hospitalized during the course of the study, information about the type and length of their stay and any treatments prescribed will be collected.

The study is a 12-month prospective interventional trial on 26 patients with chronic pain due to active myalgia and arthralgia, and/or headache attributed to TMD. Exclusion criteria are degenerative temporo-mandibular disorders with subluxation, pregnancy, oral contraception, dental infections, periodontal disease, and any oral and dental surgical procedures within the last 6 months. Patients are selected using the temporo-mandibular pain screening questionnaire and the Axis II diagnostic criteria on myalgia and arthralgia, and headache attributes to TMD. Following baseline visits, participants are allocated to the treatment group (occlusal splint therapy), and the control group. After occlusal splint therapy, participants will be assessed one month and three months following treatment. The primary endpoint will be the change in the cytokines level (IL-1beta, IL-13, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, TNFalpha) in circulating blood after stabilization occlusal splint therapy. Secondary endpoints will include change in the pain free opening, maximum unassisted opening, pain-related disability after stabilization occlusal splint therapy and oral health-related quality of life, jaw function limitation, depressed mood, anxious feelings and behavior, non-specific physical symptoms, the presence of parafunctional behaviors. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to three groups (26 patients/group, 78 teeth in 26 patient), treatment group (occlusal splint therapy), controls (no treatment). Participants will receive occlusal splint after a three-month period baseline visit.

* Summary: <EOD> Diagnostic Accuracy of Three-Dimensional Ultrasound (3D-Ultrasound) Scan in the Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis

A prospective study on diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound (US) in diagnosing acute appendicitis was conducted. 130 subjects with acute right iliac fossa (RIF) pain were recruited. They were divided into acute appendicitis group and non-appendicitis group. Clinical, US, three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US), computed tomography (CT), and radiological diagnosis were compared in differentiating acute appendicitis. Clinical features, US, 3D-US, CT and radiological diagnosis had high accuracy (>75%). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of clinical diagnosis were all low. US had no significant differences (P>0.05) in terms of 84.9-89.8% sensitivity, 78.6-86.2% specificity, 78.9-87.6% positive predictive value, 86.0-90.0% negative predictive value, 71.5-79.5% diagnostic accuracy and 2.71-3.81 likelihood ratios (LR) for acute appendicitis diagnosis (acute appendicitis group versus non-appendicitis group). 3D-US had higher sensitivity (91.5%) and lower specificity (53.3%) than US, resulting in 90.4-91.1% of diagnostic accuracy with positive LR of 1.86-2.48 and negative LR of 0.08-0.17 (acute appendicitis group versus non-appendicitis group). The accuracy of US combined with 3D-US, CT, and radiological diagnosis was higher than US and 3D-US. US and 3D-US can accurately diagnose acute appendicitis by observing the size of appendix, wall thickness, and diameter of appendix lumen. The use of 3D-US is recommended to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, while US combined with other methods is more accurate than US or 3D-US alone if the results are similar.

# Introduction
Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of emergency care and surgical admission, accounting for about one million appendicitis-related hospital visits per year, of which 90.0% is acute appendicitis in the United States. Clinical study showed that abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa (RIF) is considered the typical symptom for appendicitis patients. However, it is not absolute. When acute appendicitis attacks, RIF pain is accompanied by nausea and vomit in 70.0% of patients, and accompanied by pain in lower right quadrant of abdomen in only 20.0% of patients. In addition, 2.5-30.0% of patients had abdominal pain and 2.5-49.0% had nausea or vomit, but had no abdominal pain in 12.0% and lower right quadrant tenderness in 66.0%. This is partly why the gold standard diagnostic method of appendicitis is surgery because the pathophysiology of this disease is not well understood. Without early and efficient treatment, rupture and perforation will ensue after 1-2 days, which leads to increased morbidity rate and mortality rate. Since 1914, ultrasound (US) examination for acute appendicitis has been conducted by several different surgeon groups, but it was unable to find specific US features of appendicitis. Since 1978, US was gradually applied in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis clinically, with reported sensitivity of 80.0-90.0%, and specificity of 80.0-95.6%. In recent years, with the further development of"

# Introduction
The Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) is an economically devastating pathogen of livestock animals belonging to the genus Pestivirus and family Flaviviridae   BVDV viremia monitoring in cattle following treatment with bovine viral diarrhea modified-live..., Sivula  . BVDV is further subdivided into two subtypes, biotypes 1 and 2 (BVDV1 and BVDV2), based on antigenic, genomic, host specificity, and biological characteristics. Furthermore, the subtype 1 virus exists either as cytopathic or noncytopathic, while the subtype two virus is cytopathic   Biological characterization of two bovine viral diarrhea virus subtype 1 isolates with..., Kim  . Two subtypes of BVDV exhibit differences in pathogenicity; the noncytopathic BVDV (nbpBVDV) is known as a biotype 1 virus and is noncytopathogenic because of its inability to replicate in cell culture in contrast to the cytopathic BVDV (cpBVDV). However, ncpBVDV (biotype 1) has tropism for the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), while the cpBVDV (biotype 2) has tropism for epithelial cells in different organs such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts. It is also capable of targeting the endothelium of the blood vessels and leukocytes   Molecular biology and pathogenesis of bovine viral diarrhea virus, Salvati  . However, it is not clear why the ncpBVDV has tropism for leukocytes and the cpBVDV towards epithelial cells.
Several host immune responses are mounted against pestivirus infection; however, it still remains unknown how pestivirus modulates the innate immune response of the host. The initial responses of the innate immune system against pestiviruses include type I interferon production mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signal-dependent kinase (MAVS) sensing of viral dsRNA during infection   Biology of pestiviruses, Enders  . Furthermore, interferon-inducible genes such as MxA, OAS-1, and IFIT-5 are essential for the induction of multiple antiviral responses   Early innate immune responses to bovine viral diarrhea virus, Hernández     Bovine viral diarrhoea virus induces the delayed expression of IFN-stimulated genes, Davies  . BVDV can also circumvent these IFNmediated antiviral responses by downregulating the induction of interferon-stimulated genes   Figure 1: Schematic diagram displaying the interferon-mediated innate immune responses against pestiviruses     Interplay between pestivirus and the type I interferon response, Peterhoff  .
Several studies have highlighted the infection kinetics of pestiviruses in animals. Bovine Pestiviruses (BPVs), for instance, infect the macrophages of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes within 2-4 h, and it takes about 14-24 h to develop clinical signs. Subsequently, it enters the spleen and inactivated cells from the spleen are infected by viruses   Early innate immune responses to bovine viral diarrhea virus, Hernández     Immune parameters in Pestivirus infection, Gutiérrez-G"

The output should only be the summarization of th <EOD> Comparison of three methods of obtaining titer for detection of antibody to Pasteurella multocida in canine sera.
Three different methods to obtain serum antibody titers in canine sera for detection of antibody to Pasteurella multocida were investigated. The methods compared were the use of serially diluted, pooled sera, the use of individual canine serum samples diluted to a defined end dilution, and the use of canine serum samples pooled at 4 log10 antibody titers. It was concluded that the last-mentioned method was the preferred method in this study. <EOD> Effect of a combination of a polyvinylalcohol dressing and silver sulfadiazine on the healing of excised rabbit corneas--a pilot study.
A commercially available polyvinylalcohol (PVA) dressing (Tegaderm) has been applied in the treatment of non-ulcerated and ulcerated cornea surface damage in a pilot study. PVA may be applied successfully for the prevention of damage to the uninjured corneal surface of excised corneas. The PVA dressing also showed promise in the healing of ulcerated corneal defects. Additional experimentation will be required to substantiate the observed positive effects. <EOD> Infection in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Review.
Both the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are rising worldwide, including in pediatric populations. It is no longer uncommon for children with IBD to require lifelong immunosuppression due to the complex immunological defects in the gastrointestinal tract that are involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This, along with the use of other immunosuppressant medications, puts children with IBD on a higher risk of infection, and the infectious disease risk in this population is increasingly recognized. While it has long been established that immunosuppressants confer a risk of serious infections, there has been concern about increased infections in adults with IBD, but not children. Here we review the risks of infection in children with IBD and discuss the epidemiology of infection in pediatric patients and the evidence supporting increased risk in this population. <EOD> .
We determined the concentration of 18 elements in serum of 34 subjects of an area close to La Coruña who were all exposed to high levels of nickel since the 50s to be able to assess them as an integral element of the Environmental and Occupational Health Monitoring System of La Coruña (MSEOACor). Serum metals were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry using an Atomscan Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer with a 120-discharge tube with the double air-acetylene flame and slit monochromators of 3 lines in the spectra. We detected 18 elements: V, Cr, Cd, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Mo, Ni, Al, Hg, Zr, Ce and Pb. We determined a reference study group from the general population of Galicia, comparing the concentration of metals in serum of exposed subjects with the reference group to find out if the serum levels of the exposed group differed from the reference group. Finally, the values found were compared to the data of another similar study group which had a reference group which had not been exposed to these metals in the last 30 years. The statistical study on these results has been applied by computing Student test. At first, we considered V, Cu, Zn, Pb, Hg, Al, Mo, Ni and Cd since they are essential elements, Mn since it is very important to evaluate the toxicity of nickel, Fe for the same reason and Co which is a tracer of other compounds. We consider As, Co, Rb and Cr of interest due to some reports of these in the environment. The results are discussed through the comparison between the two study groups, exposed and non-exposed. For every element except for Al, the concentration in the exposed group had p < 0.05 or p < 0.01. We discuss the possible sources of the differences between both groups. The results were compared to those obtained in a"

267,"[/INST] <EOD> Clinical features and predisposing factors of perilymph fistula.
OBJECTIVE
We report the clinical and audiological features and risk factors in patients diagnosed with perilymph fistula.


DESIGN
Retrospective clinico-audiometric study.


SETTING
Specialist tertiary referral centre hospital in the West of Scotland.


SUBJECTS
One hundred and nineteen patients who presented from January 1994 to December 2000.


OUTCOME MEASURES
Clinical and audiological details recorded.


RESULTS
Sixty-four men and 55 women presented. The age at presentation ranged from 1 to 82 years. Hearing loss was the usual presenting complaint, even though tinnitus, balance symptoms and dizziness were the main clinical feature in 30 patients. The underlying pathology was reported in 42 patients but eight had no identified cause. Trauma was a reported cause in four cases. Men had a higher incidence of middle ear abnormalities and cochlear degeneration. However, there was no relationship between sex and cochlear or vestibular abnormalities.


CONCLUSIONS
The clinical and audiological features of the perilymph fistula overlap with many other diseases including acute audiovestibular and vestibular disorders. Thus clinical judgement and experience is essential. <EOD> Tympanoplasty: a preliminary report.
Fifty two patients were operated during the period March, 1989 to September, 1993 for various types of tympanoplasties and their records analysed. Nineteen patients were from a tertiary level teaching hospital; the remaining 33 were referred to the Unit as a last resort from peripheral level hospitals by ENT Unit Head, Department of Surgery, M. D. U., T. B. Hospital, Roorkee where they were not operated either for various reasons and lack of expertise or facilities. There were 35 males and 17 females, mean age of 35.5 years and 59% in 3rd Decade. All cases of chronic middle ear disease and hearing loss were included in the study except those having coated and mutilated tympanum and labyrinthitis (3 cases), cerebellopontine angle tumour and neurogenic deafness (7 cases) and deafness due to congenital anomalies and labyrinthitis. All patients had the basic preoperative investigations, namely Otoscopy and Audiometry. Preoperative pus was obtained in 53% patients. The results, although not too significant in a small series are encouraging and indicate the need of this type of training at district level hospitals. It is hoped that this teaching program will improve the present unsatisfactory situation. <EOD> .
On the basis of an intensive 11-year-examination the authors determined the frequency of the disease. In 6268 examined children the age incidence amounted to 0.3%, the hereditary predisposition is 35%. Epilepsy is very frequently associated with congenital malformations (60%). An epileptic seizure frequently recurs. The course of the disease in the first five years is unfavourable in 70% of the children. <EOD> Interleukin-2 therapy and Hodgkin's disease.
In summary, high-dose IL-2 did not have a positive clinical effect in patients with advanced refractory HD. In addition, it was accompanied by a number of hazards, two of which-one being myocardial infarct/death and the other possibly being pulmonary edema--needed to be prevented by rigorous patient selection and close observation and aggressive medical therapy. In contrast, the therapeutic index of IL-2 therapy may in fact be higher in patients who are not pretreatment refractory to chemotherapy. At this point, two open IL-2 trials for patients with pretreatment refractory progressive or relapsed HD are ongoing in NCI. If one or both trials proves positive, then IL-2 therapy will be available as second- or third-line treatment for this indication. This is an important accomplishment, and it appears to represent the first agent active against this disease with acceptable toxicity and minimal myelosuppression. <EOD> LIP"

Overview
-----------------------------------------------
• This is an observational study, and no drug or medical device(s) will be used.
• Study design: A total of 694 consecutive patients (diagnosed as acute pancreatitis in 12 months or not) with first episode of acute pancreatitis that recommended for iophendylate 370 mgI/ml contrast enhanced pancreatic CT scan within 14 days after onset of symptoms (the sample size ratio of training set: test set: validation set is 5:2:3) will be sequentially enrolled at ten sites. Relevant clinical information of the enrolled subjects is collected, including age, gender, height, medical history, concomitant disease, body weight, vital signs (body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate), laboratory test results (blood test, urine test, liver function, renal function, lipoprotein, coagulation function, and electrolytes) and the results of abdominal images. Radiomics features will be extracted. The subjects will be followed up for 12 months and divided into recurrent group and non-recurrent group according to the first recurrence status. The sensitivity and specificity of the model to quantitative predict acute pancreatitis recurrence in 12 months follow up period will be evaluated.


Objectives

Abstract Background The US Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database is a publicly available resource for data on cancer incidence and outcomes. We aimed to assess prognostic factors of survival and trends in cancer‐specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was designed using data from the SEER database from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2017. Patients were grouped into 3 cohorts for each year based on 3 stages: localized, regional, and distant stage. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify prognostic factors for survival among patients with colorectal cancer. Results: The total sample was comprised of 293,861 patients, including 219,759 patients (74.61%) at localized stage; 340,328 (117,070  at regional stage; and 379,451 (156,753  at a distant stage in 2013 to 2017, respectively. Married, white, older, female patients, those with well‐differentiated lesions, those not diagnosed with liver metastases, those with larger tumors, and those not diagnosed at a localized stage (vs regional and distant stages) were significantly more likely to have a better prognosis. Conclusion: Cancer‐specific mortality, which may be related to tumor or metastasis invasion, has increased in colorectal cancer patients. A better prognosis may have led to increased cancer‐specific survival. <EOD> .
On the basis of clinical and pharmacological experience a method for psychiatric diagnosis is described by using combined doses of 5-HTP and imipramine. The test involves a systematic clinical evaluation 3, 6 and 12 h after a single oral dose of imipramine (50 mg or 100 mg) and 150 mg of 5-HTP on the first day, and 150 mg of 5-HTP and 50 mg of imipramine on the second day. A rating of ""mild"" to ""excellent"" response is used for the psychosocial behaviour of drug treated patients. The results are interpreted according to the pharmacological interactions induced by the combined use of these drugs. In the presence of a good relationship between the clinical result and the drug interaction, a definite diagnosis is possible. The method was applied on a group of patients hospitalized for schizophrenia, and on a group of female patients hospitalized for anxiety neurosis and depressive neurosis. The results suggest the existence of a distinctive profile of depressive and anxious-paranoid patients among schizophrenic patients, which are clearly recognizable for the clinician by a simple test. <EOD> Cucurbituril-induced isomers of a series of 1,10-phenanthrolines in aprotic organic solvents.

The molecular structure of CB·P1H (3) in dichloromethane was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The host-guest interaction between CB and 1,10-phenanthrolines P1H and P2H is attributed to the hydrophobic interactions of aromatic rings and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the CB end"

The aim of this study was to determine if formaldehyde solution can cause methaemoglobinaemia and if so, the concentration of solution and duration of exposure sufficient to produce clinical symptoms or physiological changes. We measured the concentration of methaemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation immediately after exposure in 16 men who ingested 1.2%, 3.75%, 6.67% and 7.5% formaldehyde solution and compared them to a control group of subjects who only ingested water. Twelve of 16 subjects who ingested the formaldehyde became affected with a rise in methaemoglobin concentration higher than the control group. Methaemoglobinaemia was more severe in the 7.5% formaldehyde group when compared to 1.2%, 3.75% and 6.67% groups. A significant decrease in oxygen saturation was observed in the 1.2% group and less significant decreases in all formaldehyde groups with higher increase observed in the 7.5% group when compared to the control group. We concluded that formaldehyde solution can cause methaemoglobinaemia, with a significant decrease in arterial oxygen saturation dose-dependent fashion. <EOD> Exposure of Chinese college athletes to potentially harmful activities and substances

China's Ministry of Education and State General Administration of Sports have issued policies prohibiting college athletes from having hazardous hobbies (such as smoking, hanging out at night, or consuming alcohol), excessive exercise, or the consumption of energy drinks or caffeine. However, many college sports are often full of such harmful activities, with students' health at the time.

| The number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation after acute illness is increasing. Their long-term outcome is poor and has not improved significantly over the past 20 years. The symptom burden for patients is considerable, and family members often suffer from significant physical and emotional strain. Long-term survivors report lasting physical limitations, but their emotional health is generally good. Care for many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is shifting their post-intensive care unit setting. While this trend has resulted in cost savings for hospitals and payers, it has not had a major impact on patient outcomes. Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation consume a disproportionate amount of healthcare resources and clinician time. Measurement and knowledge of their outcomes will guide efforts to improve their care. This study will be conducted in Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from August 2023 to January 2024. |

 <EOD> The influence of low protein diet on fructose induced carcinogenesis in rat liver.
Low protein (15%) and fructose (20%) alone and combined were given to rats (40-60 g) for 6, 10 and 24 weeks. Groups receiving low protein diet alone had increased DNA/RNA ratio on the 10th and 18th week, as compared to control on the 10th, 18th and 25th week. These biochemical changes were not inhibited by fructose treatment, possibly because, the total energy requirement was not diminished while glucose in control groups was 2.5 g/100 g and that in low protein fructose groups was 8 g/100 g with only 70 per cent protein. <EOD> Inhaled nitric oxide for the prevention of postextubation respiratory distress in adults: a meta-analysis

Background: Postextubation respiratory distress (PERD) is defined as clinical features of incipient respiratory failure, or a need for more ventilatory setting and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (> 2 h) after extubation. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in reducing the incidence of PERD in adults.Methods: We conducted this meta-analysis using data from randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of iNO in adult patients. PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies published between January, 1980, and January 2015. Relevant reference lists were checked and reviewed by two independent authors. We pooled dichotomous data with risk ratios, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method, and expressed 95% CIs.Results: Fourteen studies, involving 12 adult studies (1359 subjects), met the eligibility criteria, and were included in the meta-analysis. Using the fixed-effects model, the results showed a significant reduction of PERD with iNO when compared to NO (RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.86).

The provided clinical trial document is the following: <EOD> Comparison of transoral laser microlaryngeal surgery and external carotid artery ligation in dogs.
This prospective randomized study compares the use of an ultralow-setting carbon dioxide laser to radio frequency cautery with that of high setting for laser microlaryngeal surgery with anesthesia in dogs. Radio frequency cautery is shown to be a faster and more efficient method to use if the surgeon is willing to risk the possible complications that may be associated with this method. Although the use of an ultralow-setting carbon dioxide laser is shown to be a safer procedure and provides better hemostasis, use of the laser is time consuming due to the small tissue lesions that are created. However, for lesions that are small in size, surgical precision is paramount, and use of a low setting is beneficial due to the small diameter of the necrotic regions that are created. <EOD> The GHSR is involved in the modulation of lipid metabolism in rats after a high-fat diet

Background and Aims: The liver plays a critical role in regulating energy metabolism, including cholesterol biosynthesis. However, the metabolic mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear. The expression levels of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) in skeletal muscle and its influence on whole-body metabolism have been reported previously. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of the GHSR in the regulation of liver lipids and glucose metabolism by using a high-fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD rat model. Methods: Liver damage in HFD induced rats was evaluated by histologic and biochemical assessments. We analyzed hepatic lipid accumulation and the expression levels of Ghsr in rat livers of normal, HFD, and HFD plus intracerebroventricular melanotan-II (i.c.v.-MTT) (HFD/MTT) groups to assess the function of the GHSR in the liver. Metabolic cage, indirect calorimetry, and the insulin tolerance test were conducted to evaluate lipid and glucose metabolism. The expression levels of key enzymes that participate in lipid metabolism were measured using western blotting. Results: We showed that MTT, an agonist of the GHSR, decreased lipid deposition in rats that were fed HFD. Additionally, the expression levels of Ghsr in liver sections were decreased in rats that were fed HFD. The expression levels of key enzymes that participate in lipid metabolism showed opposite trends in the HFD/MTT group compared with the HFD group, indicating an improved metabolic profile. Overall, our study demonstrated that blocking the activation of the GHSR can improve lipid homeostasis in rats fed an HFD. Conclusion: We found that MTT, an agonist of the GHSR, can protect against liver injury while improving lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in HFD animals. MTT may be a potential treatment for NAFLD by acting on the brain liver axis.

Since the beginning of this century in the Soviet Union, a series of laws were passed, setting different age groups apart. These laws were directed at school children, the youth of the USSR. The aim was to regulate the age when children attend school. This paper traces the main provisions, in particular a ban on the early ageing of children, and the punishment for late school attendance. The development of the school laws can only be understood in connection with the socialist understanding of social change and the relationship of the USSR with the world of nations. <EOD> .

## To the editors:
We have some serious concerns about the interpretation of the results of the Antiretroviral Therapy of Asymptomatic HIV-Infected Adolescents (AAA) study, recently published in The Journal .
The authors of the study are very well-informed and experienced clinicians, so clearly, we do not want to undermine their expert opinions. However, we do question the authors' interpretation of their results. In our opinion, some of the authors' conclusions regarding the safety of treatment can be misleading and erroneously reassuring to patients, clinicians, and investigators. We suggest that a more careful analysis of the results would be helpful to all of those who work with HIV-infected adolescents. This is particularly important as a consequence of the unique study population and the unique characteristics of the treatment regimen.
The AAA study population differs very clearly from other study populations of HIV-infected individuals. Adolescents who are already diagnosed as being infected with HIV, while they continue to develop, have usually already been exposed to a considerable amount of psychological distress because of knowing they are infected with a potentially lethal disease and they are in the process of adjusting to the psychological distress associated with disclosure of being HIV-infected. If they have a close relationship with the adult caregiver or parents, even more so because of the stigma of AIDS, they generally face not only fears associated with their own health, but also with their families. With regard to the specific characteristics of the AAA study population, we are also concerned that, by enrolling both those who are infected ""perinatally"" (presumed infection being at birth) and those who are infected ""postnatally"" (presumed infection during the subsequent development of the immune system), the ""perinatal"" group will probably respond differently psychologically and behaviorally to the adolescent population as a whole. The impact of exposure to HIV, including any family discord that this infection causes, may not be readily apparent in AAA until a late phase of adolescence, when the cognitive and social development of the participants is fully functional. This may mean that these participants may show signs and symptoms of HIV-induced distress in a later phase of adolescence than those participants who were infected ""postnatally."" The latter group will already have attained a very high level of adaptation to the HIV-infected status.
As regards the treatment regimen, we agree with the investigators, except that we do not feel that it is particularly advantageous to participants because of its nonmodern nature. We are therefore concerned that using this treatment regimen is disadvantageous because it does not maximize the chances for survival and because its possible consequences, such as significant toxicity, can easily be missed by clinicians and researchers. Because of its unique characteristics, namely, the use of a toxic drug at low dosage (zidovudine) and the absence of a protease inhibitor, the treatment regimen of the AAA study cannot be expected to be tolerated as well by participants as the treatments currently recommended (1). As a consequence, there is a substantial chance that the adolescents in the study would prematurely have switched to another treatment that was more acceptable to them-and would certainly have resulted in higher rates of viral suppression and lower clinical and immunological progression, with substantially better long-term outcomes. Moreover, because this treatment regimen is not standard-of-"

This was a 28-day trial conducted from March 2019 to May 2019 at Centre Hospitalier de Valida, Valida, Quebec, Canada. The trial included 12 people diagnosed with trans-radial upper limb amputation but have yet to receive a prosthesis or trained in using a myoelectric prosthesis. The MyoTrain AR system was evaluated on participant’s ability to achieve functional hand movements, grasp stability, hand rotation, and control. There were two intervention arms in this study, MyoTrain AR and control (a non-invasive motor imagery exercise). Three outcomes measures were used in the trial to measure the following:
* GaMA cup transfer task completion time: the time to successfully complete the entire task trial (10 movements per cup).
* GaMA cup transfer task completion rate: percentage of trial attempts completed successfully.
* Quantitative measure of capacity for myoelectric control (QM2): assesses capacity for control of patient-specific myoelectric prostheses, i.e., ability to perform a targeted activity as well as accuracy, speed, and smoothness.
There was no interim analysis and data were analysed with the general linear model using a mixed effects repeated-measures ANOVA. This study concluded that MyoTrain AR is a viable training tool to improve motor control and upper limb prosthesis use, and provided a new approach for functional task training. MyoTrain AR had a significant improvement in movement time but QMA2 showed no significant effect.

The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias.ResultsEighteen studies were included in this review. The overall intervention effects of all PA interventions, non-weight-bearing PA (NWBPA) interventions, weight-bearing PA (WBPA) interventions, muscle strengthening PA interventions and non-aerobic PA interventions were 0.04 (95% CI: −0.04 to 0.13), 0.20 (0.07 to 0.33), 0.19 (0.05 to 0.34), 0.09 (−0.10 to 0.28) and 0.32 (0.12 to 0.51), respectively. Compared with the control group, the intervention effects of the three subgroups were as follows: 0.34 (0.20 to 0.48) for WBPA interventions, 0.31 (0.05 to 0.56) for muscle strengthening PA interventions, and 0.22 (0.11 to 0.34) for nonaerobic PA interventions. The results of the subgroup analysis indicated heterogeneity within these three categories of PA interventions.Conclusions There were positive effects of PA, WBPA and muscle strengthening PA interventions, on BMD among healthy adolescents and young adults. NWBPA seems to be less effective.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term effect of aromatherapy and music, or both on pain and anxiety levels of cancer patients receiving palliative care, based on vital parameters. In this study, the experimental group who received music therapy in palliative care services was evaluated. The participants listened to the relaxing music playlist which was composed of instrumental music containing elements such as nature sounds (foggy forest, ocean waves, babbling stream) as well as music pieces composed specifically for this study. 5% of lavender oil was used in the aromatherapy and aromatherapy inhaler group. Data were collected three times with a questionnaire consisting of four parts before and after music, at the beginning of every music session, at the beginning of every aromatherapy session and after five minutes of aromatherapy, after listening to the music at the end of the session, and at the beginning of the third, fifth, and seventh days. The data obtained in the study showed that both aromatherapy and music effectively reduce pain, anxiety, and vital parameters, improve sleep quality and mood, and increase positive states. However, this study has a number of limitations, such as only male patients being included in the study, not randomly grouping the patients, only evaluating in five days, etc. All study results should be evaluated by considering these characteristics.

The study also shows that aromatherapy and musical stimuli can have a positive impact on pain control in palliative patient by reducing anxiety and improving vital parameters and states like sleep quality and mood.

The patients with a cancer diagnosis undergoing palliative treatment who are experiencing anxiety, stress, and pain have a high level of psychologic and somatic distress. Aromatherapy and music therapy can be effective in reducing anxiety, reducing pain and controlling the state. Thus, nurses can apply these tools in a clinical environment.

 <EOD> A rare case of a paraganglioma: Sphenoid sinus.

Sphenoid sinus is a common site of intracranial paragangliomas with the possibility of intracranial extension. Hereby, we aimed to reveal the role of different diagnostic modalities in preoperative and postoperative management of a rare lesion of the sphenoid sinus. Paraganglioma of the sphenoid sinus has not been described, and the presented case is a rarity. A 21-year-old man was presented with complaints of headaches and fatigue. Physical examination, cranial computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging showed a right lateralized lesion of the sphenoid sinus. A biopsy confirmed a paraganglioma pathologically. Due to the difficulty and risk of the total resection of the lesion, adjuvant radiotherapy was planned. The treatment was well-tolerated, and follow-up visits were planned. Paragangliomas of the head and neck region are rare tumors, and paragangliomas of the sphenoid sinus are rarities of head and neck region, and these neuroendocrine neoplasms may remain clinically undetected until they are detected during radiological investigations performed for unrelated conditions. Computed tomography may be superior to magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis of paragangliomas and can be a part of postoperative radiographic followup. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. (J Turk Ger Gynecol Assoc 2020; 21: 132-6)

# Introduction
Paragangliomas are rare tumors accounting for only 0.1% of all reported tumors in humans. Sphenoid sinus is an uncommon primary site (1-2%). The incidence of intracranial paragangliomas is 0.1%; they are very rare tumors and constitute only about 0.5% of all intracranial tumors, with an estimated incidence of one per million per year. The main site of origin of these tumors is the neural crest.
Paraganglioma can arise from sympathetic neurons in the head and neck regions, including the carotid body, jugular glomus, vagal body, tympanic paraganglia in the middle ear (tympanic glomus), and ganglia along cranial nerves. The pathological findings of paragangliomas may range from pure neoplasms to cystic lesions with malignant or mixed histopathologies. Malignant paragangli"

A B S T R A C TThe COVID-19 epidemic has quickly reached a global scale. An essential part of this problem is to identify and test potential drugs or vaccines that decrease the risk of infection. In this sense, here we explore the in silico hypothesis based on a previous study that suggests inhibiting COVID-19 entry by interfering with the binding site of the virus in the host cell. Thus, we applied an in silico docking analysis to investigate the interactions between the membrane protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its partner the Spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2. The obtained results strongly suggest that this interaction of the two proteins is inhibited by ACE2 chemical groups at the N terminal (aa 1-615). Our method may guide clinical studies on the possible development of drugs against the membrane protein ACE2 with potential effects against coronaviruses.

During the baseline phase, participants will keep a record of all vertigo episodes they experience and their response to the survey question How severe is your vertigo now? They will answer using an NPS on a scale of 1 through four. Participants will also track all the treatments and medical visits that occur during the baseline phase. Participants that meet all the inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria, and sign informed consent will enter the treatment phase of the study. In the treatment phase, participants will use the OtoBand in their everyday lives with instructions to use the OtoBand following a recent bout of vertigo and for all other instances of vertigo as they would normally do. They will keep a daily record of any treatments or visits that they receive to treat the vertigo. Participants will answer the following questions:
- How severe is your vertigo now?
- What treatments or visits did you receive following your vertigo?
- How severe was your vertigo episode?
- What type of treatment or visit did you receive?
- What was the outcome of your vertigo episode?
Participants will be asked to keep a log of what they recorded in the daily survey and they will be prompted to enter this information into the online questionnaire via an NPS form. A study coordinator will ask them to review this information at the Day 21 session.

Participants that enter the Treatment Phase of the study will be asked to use the OtoBand with the same treatment protocol that was followed during the Baseline Phase. Participants will use the OtoBand following their vertigo episodes and record: The severity of their vertigo (How severe is your vertigo now?), the treatments that they receive (What treatments or visits did you receive following your vertigo?), the outcome of their vertigo episode (How severe was your vertigo episode?), the type of treatment and visit they received (what type of treatment or visit did you receive?), their response regarding the effectiveness of the OtoBand (What was the outcome of your vertigo episode?):
- No change - Worse - Same, but not in an expected way - Better - Much better Participants will be asked to answer the questions in real time while the vertigo episode is taking place and respond again after the next appointment: Day 16, Day 21, Day 24, Day 36, and Day 49 using the NPS form. A study coordinator will review the information on day 21 to ensure completion and accuracy. Participants will be paid at the conclusion of the study per the participant compliance table by Venmo or PayPal.

Participants in the Quality of Life (QoL) group will complete a similar NPS form during every vertigo episode, except they will complete a quality of life question using the following scale:
- How severe is your vertigo now?
- How does your vertigo make you feel?
- What is your Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS) score today?
- What treatments or visits did you receive following your vertigo?
- How severe was your vertigo episode?
- What type of treatment or visit did you receive?
- What was the outcome of your vertigo episode?
- What was the effectiveness of the OtoBand in treating your vertigo symptoms?
- Did the OtoBand make your vertigo symptoms better than before?
- Did the OtoBand make your vertigo symptoms the same as before now?
- Did the OtoBand make your vertigo symptoms worse/not better than before?
- Is the OtoBand not effective in treating your vertigo?
The study duration for participants in the QoL group is 21 days shorter than the Treatment phase of the  modified MoW group The QoL arm participants will still complete all the other study tasks described for the modified MoW group they will also answer these questions to evaluate their overall subjective QoL:
- Has the use of the OtoBand for treatment of vertigo affected your productivity throughout the day and overall daily activities?
- Is the device effective in treating vertigo symptoms, compared to your productivity throughout the day and overall daily activities, without the device?
- Has the use of the OtoBand for treatment of vertigo affected your overall daily quality of life?

This paper is an overview of 10 cases of cardiac pacemakers found since 1975 in the bodies of 246 persons (4% of all). Of the 246 persons, 102 were men and 144 were women. The mean age at death was 63 (49 to 85) years in this series. There were 7 cases of cardiac pacemaker electrodes and 4 of the pacemaker unit. Among these, 9 were retrieved from corpses within 48 hr after death. Eight of the 10 cases were found in corpses, all from a medical institutions. The 10 persons were all of Japanese, and all the bodies were found in Japan. These results indicate that there are few foreigners and there are a lower mortality rate in the Japanese aged over 60. The main cause of cardiac pacemaker death was accidental death including suicide and drowning, accounting for 8, and in one case it was unknown. <EOD> Inflammatory mediators of endothelial dysfunction.
Vascular endothelial cells mediate normal cellular function, and loss of endothelial integrity results in disease progression. The most obvious examples of endothelial dysfunction include changes in vasoregulation, coagulation, and adhesion. The vasoactive properties of endothelial cells are closely regulated and mediated primarily by two distinct and opposing vasoactive agents. Nitric oxide is a major mediator of endothelium-derived vasodilatation, and endogenously produced prostaglandins enhance endothelium-dependent vasoregulation. The cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α induce an endothelium-derived hyperconstriction, leading to vasoconstriction. The mediators of endothelium-dependent vasoregulation and the endothelial inflammatory response are interlinked and interdependent. This is most notably seen in the acute and chronic effects of IL-1 on the vascular endothelium. The acute effects of IL-1 include hyperconstriction and release of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), whereas the chronic actions of this cytokine impair EDHF/nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation. IL-1 induces an acute inhibition, and a chronic impairment, of EDHF, which is mediated, at least in part, via inhibition of endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity. In addition to the effects on constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity, IL-1 also induces an acetylation of cyclooxygenases and may modulate vascular prostaglandin production. The cyclooxygenase pathway, in turn, may contribute to a loss of vascular prostaglandin activity in IL-1/tumor necrosis factor-α-treated endothelial cells. Thus, interrelationships between endothelial cell mediators result in amplification of the initial vasoactive response. Recent evidence suggests that IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α modulate endothelial function in vivo. This provides further evidence that these proinflammatory cytokines mediate cellular injury through modulation of cellular function. <EOD> Clinicopathological Study of Gastric Adenomas

 <EOD> FcgammaRIII(CD16) polymorphism as an important determinant of clinical response to antibody therapy.
The FcgammaRIII receptor (CD16) on natural killer cells (NK) and CD16+ monocytes is the primary effector of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to targeted tumor cells. Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1801274 (-158V/F) in an Fc gamma receptor 3'UTR sequence regulatory element influences both CD16 expression and ADCC activity. However, prior studies suggest a correlation is only apparent for some antibodies. We sought to determine the relevance of the FcgammaRIII polymorphism rs1801274 for all monoclonal antibody-based therapies. To systematically address the potential of CD16 to influence treatment outcomes from every approved antibody, we tested nine for ADCC activity in FcgammaRIIIa alleles-specific human NK cell cultures, using two tumor cell lines and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. A strong bias was observed in the correlation of ADCC assays and treatment outcomes-for example, in the ADCC assay with HL60 cells and rituximab, the FcgammaRIIIa 158-Val/Val patients showed improved clinical response and prolonged time without relapse (P < 0.05), demonstrating the importance of CD16(V158) in rituximab-based therapy. Importantly, these trends were also evident in the FcgammaRIIa (V131) polymorphism allele, known to be relevant for type I interferons, vaccination, and viral infection, suggesting the presence of a general biological feature that is common to the immunological processes required for immunity and cancer thrombi and for tumor cells targeting with antibodies. <EOD> Acute Renal Failure Complicating Surgery for Blunt Injuries to the Kidney
Surgical treatment of blunt injuries to the kidney is associated with a higher incidence of posttraumatic acute renal failure compared to surgery for penetrating kidney injuries or nonoperative treatment of blunt kidney injuries. The factors most likely to increase the incidence of postoperative acute renal failure are: 1) the volume of blood lost. 2) the duration of ischemia; and 3) the presence of other injuries or risk factors. Acute renal failure is more likely in those with multiple organ injury, major soft tissue injury, vascular injuries and injuries to the liver. An understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of acute renal failure in trauma patients and the principles of renal replacement therapy allow the intensivist to evaluate the renal function in this complex clinical group, intervene early in the course of posttraumatic renal impairment, and manage complications related to acute renal failure. <EOD> Genetic Characterization and Sequence Analysis of Virulence Plasmids from Diverse Salmonella enterica Isolates
ABSTRACT Salmonella enterica is a major cause of food-borne illness worldwide, and genetic elements carried on virulence plasmids promote pathogenicity by contributing genes involved in pathophysiological functions. The genes on these plasmids are found not only in clinical isolates but also in a variety of S. enterica serotypes. To gain insight into the genetic structure of the plasmids, comparative sequencing was performed on 22 plasmids from Salmonella isolates from clinical, animal, and food origins. A total of nine plasmids were analyzed, carrying the iro and rck genes and their associated promoters, and the SPI-1 and SPI-2 virulence factors identified. The iro and rck systems, also called enterobactin synthesis genes, are linked to genes in the SPI-2 plasmids. The SPI-1 plasmids carry two genes, sopE and sopB that encode two effector proteins involved in Salmonella invasion, and the SPI-1 virulence plasmid has no other genes on it. The S"

Background
=================
What is Urothelial Carcinoma?
=================


Urothelial carcinoma (also called urothelial cell carcinoma) is cancer whose cells come from the urothelial cells that lines the tube or the bladder. In the US, about 52,480 people will be diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2017.

Risk factors
==================
Bladder cancer can affect people of any gender but is more common in older males than in older females. It can be associated with smoking cigarettes or having cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or pelvic radiation.
How HER2 works in cancer
=======================


Cells normally make proteins that help them grow and divide into new cells. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a growth factor protein receptor. HER2 is activated by a growth factor called HER2-Neu. When activated, it can either increase or decrease the growth rate of cancer cells, depending what other molecules are around.
What is HER2-Neu?
====================


A growth factor receptor is a receptor that a growth factor (protein) attaches to to trigger cancer cell division. There are several different ways (different paths) in which cancer cells can be activated by a growth factor. This means that if one path is targeted then cancer cells may activate and grow through another path, becoming resistant to treatments that target the first path.

Other targets for cancer drugs
==============================


Molecules known as monoclonal antibodies are immunotherapy drugs that block a growth factor or a growth factor receptor like HER2-Neu from working to make more cancer cells. HER2-Neu is the growth factor for HER2. Because it is also a protein, monoclonal antibodies can be made to fit snugly in a specific cancer protein like HER2-Neu. They stick inside a tumor, and make sure that this molecule is blocked from working, stopping the signals inside and outside of your cancer cells. This blocks the cancer cells from growing.
What is Disitamab Vedotin?
======================


Disitamab vedotin (paclitaxel (Taxol) conjugated to a monoclonal antibody that blocks growth factor receptor HER2 or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a drug that targets the pathway for growth factor HER2-Neu. It may help reduce the number of cancer cells and increase the number of good healthy cells in your tumor."

The long-term clinical outcome of 32 children with biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis was investigated. Only 2 children died from malignant disease: 24 patients, including 19 noncirrhotics, were followed between 15 and 180 months (average 84 months). Liver functions, including galactose elimination capacity, were normal in most children, although histological findings were mild in 11 patients, moderate in 10, and severe in 2. No spontaneous recovery was observed in any patients, which is in sharp contrast to adults. The long-term clinical course was similar to those with immunologic, toxic, and metabolic liver diseases. Thus the childhood incidence of primary chronic hepatitis is low, the clinical courses are long, prognosis is good in noncirrhotics, and spontaneous recovery is rare. <EOD> Clinical Experience of 120 Patients with Increasing Bone Mass Treated with Human Growth Hormone

Input Text: A Novel Biomarker for Response and Prognosis of HBV-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Detailed Description
---------------------------------------------
Residual tumors and early recurrence/metastasis after radiotherapy (RT) compromise the patient survival with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Timely detecting residual/recurrence/metastasis and the clonality is required to implement salvage therapies properly. The major unmet needs of radiotherapy to HCC are the difficulties in early evaluating response by images and timely detection of intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis. Thus, an accurate and personalized biomarker for response prediction and disease monitoring is demanded. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA (ctDNA) has garnered attention as a promising biomarker in cancer patients. However, in HCC, the detection rate is low (9-21.2%), mainly due to the limited prevalence of traditional somatic mutations and the difficult separation of ctDNA fragments from normal cells. The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing RT. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of salvage therapies. The investigators will first use our previously collected serum samples and surgical/biopsied tissues from HBV-related HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases. The same junction clones from pre-post-RT serums and surgical tissues will be confirmed and the copy number changes of vh-DNA be correlated with RT response and disease-control status. The investigators plan to identify HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR as personalized biomarkers from the same-patient serum samples. The investigators will further correlate clinical response and recurrence/metastasis with serial changes of vh-DNA copies. The investigators have been prospectively collecting plasma samples from HBV-related HCC patients before/after RT, at 1, 4, 7 months, and at recurrence/metastasis. The investigators plan to confirm the viable role of pre-/post-RT changes of plasma vh-DNA copies of the same junction clone in post-RT response and prognosis. Moreover, The investigators will explore the recurrent/metastatic tumors arising from the original or a de novo one by identifying their clonality with HBV integration patterns. The true value of this novel HBV chimera vh-DNA will be revealed. The results will also support the consolidative use of personalized vh-DNA for earlier evaluating treatment response after RT, for post-RT disease monitoring, and for differentiating clonality at recurrence to design future clinical trial on combinational treatment.

Osteopetrosis is an inherited bone disorder characterized by osteoclast dysfunction. Osteoclasts are large, multinucleated cells responsible for the resorptive process of bone remodeling. This review focuses on the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in osteopetrosis and presents recent results from research that has enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the human disease, malignant osteopetrosis, as well as of the murine homolog, op, an autosomal recessive disorder. In particular, these efforts have included analysis of murine osteopetrotic cDNA libraries and mutation mapping. Several candidate genes have been identified and functionally studied including c-fms, calcitonin receptor (CTR), and CXCR4, a chemokine receptor. <EOD> The Use of Combinatorial Protein Engineering Designed to Enable In Vitro Selection
A variety of different experimental methods have been applied to the study of enzyme evolution. Among these, combinatorial protein engineering has recently been applied to study the selective pressures on enzyme evolution and to develop protein variants with improved properties. It has been successfully applied to two different systems, the hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulases and the synthesis of aminoacyl-tRNA. This review explains the general principles underlying combinatorial protein engineering, presents the results obtained using this technology, and provides an outlook on the future developments in applying this technology in the context of protein engineering. <EOD> Pregnancy complicated by maternal acute myeloid leukaemia. A case report of successful induction of abortion and delivery of the viable fetus with rapid induction to remission after successful chemotherapy
Summary. An acute myeloid leukaemia affecting a 43‐year‐old woman 10 days postpartum is described. Hydroxycarbamide 2.5 g, 3 times daily was administered until a remission was achieved before the 36th week of pregnancy and at the 25th day post‐partum. The remission was maintained for 36 months. Induction of labour was achieved with oxytocic infusion 5 mU 2 h‐1, after abortion was induced. To maintain patency of the fetal circulation and pulmonary vasculature, after fetal lungs were seen on echography, the patient also received 6 units of fresh frozen plasma prior to inducing the abortion. The fetus, delivered vaginally, was healthy. Subsequent cytogenetic analysis of the placental tissue was normal. After termination of vaginal delivery, one of the twins became clinically ill and was transfused with red cells, the other remained healthy and was discharged the same day, 7 days postcaesarean section. The ill baby died 5 days later. <EOD> Inhibition of the proteasome modulates endothelial activation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo

Background: The proteasome, and in particular its catalytic subunit β5, is indispensable for the angiogenic potential and metastatic potential of tumor cells, indicating that the proteasome is a novel therapeutic target for metastatic disease. However, the role of the proteasome remains to be defined in nonshedded cell types such as endothelial cells used in angiogenesis assays. Thus, here we test the hypothesis that the β5 subunit of the proteasome is essential for the in vivo and in vitro activity of the endothelial cell (EC) specific angiogenic response. Results: The synthetic anti-proteasomal drug PS-341 is a specific inhibitor of the β5 catalytic subunit of the proteasome that has no discernible inhibition of mammalian proteases other than that of the β5 subunit of the proteasome.

 <EOD> Reactive oxygen species: metabolism and role in the nervous system.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an integral part of aerobic life. Physiological concentrations function as cellular signalling molecules involved in the regulation of many key physiological processes. The nervous system is susceptible to oxidative stress due to its high consumption of oxygen, its susceptibility to iron, and high polyunsaturated fatty-acid content in membrane phospholipid. The present study is an attempt to study the effects of ROS using in vivo experimental model. The study deals with the role of superoxide dismutase, catalase and malondialdehyde as an index of lipid peroxidation following treatment with different experimental antioxidant on the methamphetamine treated rats. The level of MDA is reduced on treatment with different experimental antioxidants.

Prior studies have suggested that high levels of maternal depression may be related to higher rates of child behavior problems. This relationship has been examined in healthy and clinical populations of children, but these studies have not incorporated caregiver factors as moderators and mediators of this relationship.


METHODS
Mothers of healthy (n = 341) children and asthmatic (n = 105) children completed measures of depressive symptoms, caregiving behaviors, and child behavior as part of a 2-year cross-lag study of depressive symptoms, caregiving behavior, and child behavior in healthy and medically ill children.


RESULTS
Mothers of healthy and asthmatic children reported significant increases in observed negative caregiving behavior (i.e., rejecting emotional communication) as mothers reported higher levels of depressive symptoms. There were no differences, however, in reported positive caregiving behaviors (i.e., teaching emotional communication) in mothers of healthy and asthmatic children. Children of mothers who reported higher levels of depressive symptoms displayed more externalizing behavior problems later, even after controlling for initial levels of behavior problems.


CONCLUSIONS
Findings from the current study suggest that observed patterns of caregiving behavior may partially explain longitudinal increases in child behavior problems, observed both as a function of initial levels of child behavior problems as well as observed increases of behavior problems related to high levels of depressive symptoms in mothers. <EOD> A rapid assay for quantifying endogenous inhibitor(s) of rat liver microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase and esterases.

The study was completed on December 31, 2020. The results showed that, compared to the control group, high-intensity interval training improved the maximum oxygen uptake, skill, tactical, and power components of college ice hockey players' physical fitness. In the first half of the study, the two groups were in a comparable state, whereas by the end of the third month, the experimental group’s physical fitness components improved at a faster rate than the control group. In addition, between the beginning and the end of the study, the endurance and agility levels were comparable between the two groups. However, high-intensity interval training is more effective in enhancing endurance and tactical performance. In addition, after implementing the high-intensity interval training program at a higher intensity level, college ice hockey players were in better physical condition. As a result, compared to traditional technical skill instruction, college ice hockey players’ physical fitness components improved further. After four weeks of high-intensity interval training, there was no significant improvement in endurance, power, or tactical performance among college hockey players.

Conclusions
----------
This experiment found that high-intensity interval training is more effective than standard training in improving college ice hockey players’ physical fitness.

A study carried out about the 20 years old patients who have been admitted in the Surgery Department during the period 1950-69 has been divided into 3 periods (1950-60, 1961-64, 1965-69). The increase of the admittances rate from 1 to 3 cases per month during the period 1965-69, and the rise of the number of the hospitalized patients from 25 to 31 per year are noted. The increase of the hospitalization has been attributed to the increase of the frequency of the appendicitis and in a less extent of the acute gastroduodenal ulcer. The average age of the patients suffering from appendicitis and gastroduodenal ulcer has been also increased during the recent years. The decrease of the average age was especially notable in the patients with the appendicitis and suppurative gastroduodenal ulcer. As far as the emergency surgery is concerned, it has been a cause of increasing admittances rate of the surgical patients. The hospitalization of some of these patients has been rather short due to the insufficient medical care in the postoperative period and so the average duration of the hospitalization has been inhibited. <EOD> FDA Approves Vactosertib To Inhibit mTOR Pathway

[INST/MOV]/ <EOD> Differential regulation of proliferation by T-type calcium channel isoforms.
T-type calcium currents (I(T)) are present in multiple mammalian tissues and regulate important functions like neurotransmitter release and pacemaking. Several lines of evidence suggest that I(T) may also play a role in neural progenitor activity and neural stem cell (NSC) lineage determination. I(T) is selectively and densely distributed in the stem and progenitor cell populations of the neurogenic niche in the dorsal subventricular zone, dentate gyrus, and spinal cord. Because of these findings, we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of I(T) should lead preferentially to loss of neural progenitor cells. This inhibition may be most appropriate for slowing progenitor cell proliferation as opposed to complete suppression of NSC proliferation. We directly tested this premise by performing a colony forming assay in the presence and absence of mibefradil. T-type calcium channels are composed of three subunits (alpha1G, alpha1H, and alpha1I); hence, we reasoned that the specific role of each of the three T-channel subunits might be determined by selective knock-down with shRNA lentiviral constructs. We show that while alpha1G knock-down suppresses both total cell numbers and NSC numbers, alpha1H knock-down results in increased progenitor cell numbers. These results suggest that I(T) in the adult neurogenic niche is important for proliferation and likely plays a role in the control of cell cycle duration. <EOD> A Study of the Mental Health of Children

Point‐count surveys have been used to collect abundance information on species (often as abundance per unit area) with large spatial distribution. Usually the goal is to characterize the 2D spatial distribution of the observed abundance pattern. In such datasets individuals are observed at a specific range of distances from the sampling points. Here we provide methodology to describe the joint 2‐dimensional (2D) spatial abundance distribution of multiple species from point‐count data by characterizing the 3‐dimensional (3D) spatial distribution of the species' abundance. A Poisson multivariate spatial model is fitted to the data and estimates are obtained for the joint relative 3D abundance pattern of the species, their mutual dependence and their marginal distributions. We illustrate the methodology using a seaweed point‐count data set in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. <EOD> A model for predicting methane emissions from dairy farms in New Zealand.

 <EOD> Is the risk of atherosclerotic arterial disease higher after coronary artery bypass grafting than after percutaneous coronary interventions?

For over 50 years, the use of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) has been an indispensable part of treating patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite being proven benefits of both approaches for selected patients and despite the fact that mortality rates have been comparable over time for both techniques, atherosclerotic processes leading to coronary stenosis are still an important source of morbidity and even mortality in this population. Therefore, this review will summarize the epidemiology regarding the development of coronary artery disease after CABG or PCI and discuss the mechanisms underlying it.

# Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease alone remains the leading cause of death worldwide despite great advances in medical and surgical cardiac care. This is also true for Austria, with a total death number of approximately 45,000 patients related to cardiovascular complications in 2018. Furthermore, 81% of overall deaths in Austria are a result of cardiovascular disease   The Austrian burden of cardiovascular diseases: fatal and non-fatal outcomes. A description..., Manz  .
Coronary artery disease can be treated noninvasively or invasively. With noninvasive treatment, most recently with the introduction of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) into clinical practice, the intervention remains intraluminal. In contrast to this, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) involves the bypassing of the coronary artery in question which is usually achieved using harvested arteries or veins.
Over the years, there have been important advances in surgical techniques and an ever-growing expertise in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Because of these advances, mortality has significantly declined over the years. For example, mortality for CABG was reported to be 11.6% in 1970 in a publication of the University of Toronto experience   Thirty thousand cardiac operations, Tatoulis   but declined to only 1.33% in patients with predominantly three-vessel disease in a large randomized control trial (RCT) between 1997 and 2000   Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with..., Mohr  .
This dramatic mortality decline has caused a shift in focus from CABG to percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). As a result, PCI use has increased significantly over the years; in 2001, it was reported to be one-third to one-half of the proportion of CABG use   Trends, outcomes, and cost of coronary artery bypass surgery and percutaneous interventions..., Chambers  . A few years later, in 2005, the RAND health report already stated a similar shift to PCI   Cost-utility analysis comparing coronary artery bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention as..., Lee  . This is also evident in the German Heart Surgery Report 2017   German national registry for heart and thoracic surgery of the German Society..., Czerny     Report of the German National Registry for Heart or Thoracic Vascular Surgery..., Czerny  . Here, it was demonstrated that 493,004 patients underwent CABG, whereas 602,717 patients underwent PCI from 2015 to 2017, which is a ratio of approximately 1.5:1 in favor of PCI.
Overall, these data demonstrate that not only treatment for CAD has undergone important changes over the years, but also the way atherosclerotic artery disease is treated, which in the past was mainly achieved by CABG, now increasingly through interventional procedures. This raises the question whether the long-term outcome of this shift (more PCI procedures while CABG is being replaced) has been comparable"

A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial on the Effect of Psychophysiological Effect of Sulpiride, a Selective Dopamine D2 and D4 Receptor Antagonist on Working Memory Gating and Other Working Memory and Executive Functions

* *Acknowledgment:  The authors would like to thank all participants, as well as the staff of the Leids University Center for Excellence in Cognition (LECC) for their invaluable efforts in making this research possible. This study was supported by the Faculty of Social Sciences of the TU/e.

*Introduction:  Working memory dysfunction is a well-reported deficit in neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as in aging. Although much is known about disease progression, working memory deficits are not only a consequence of dopamine deficits, but also of serotonin (5HT) neuromodulation. Interestingly, the non-selective D2,3 antagonist haloperidol improves working memory in rats. This motivates the investigation whether the selective dopamine D2 and D4 antagonist, sulpiride, may improve working memory deficits as well and possibly help to decrease working memory deficits due to COVID-related stress.


*Hypothesis:  In a healthy population, administration of the D2 and D4 antagonist Sulpiride may improve selective working memory.

 <EOD> Effect of intraamniotic administration of prostaglandin F2 alpha on fetal heart rate and on the incidence of elective cesarean sections in the breech.
OBJECTIVE
To determine the effect of intraamniotic prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on fetal heart rate and the incidence of elective cesarean sections in the breech.


STUDY DESIGN
This was a two-center, randomized, double-blind intervention trial. The intervention group received 5 mg PGF2 alpha intraamniotically; the control group received sterile water intraamniotically. Elective cesarean sections were performed in the breech for the control group, as well as for the PGF2 alpha group if indicated.


POPULATION
Women carrying an initial diagnosis of singleton breech presentation between 31 and 42 weeks gestation.


OUTCOME MEASURES
Fetal heart rate on admission and immediately after administration of PGF2 alpha or water as well as adverse (labor) events (including mode of delivery, type of fetal heart rate pattern, and number of vaginal examinations performed).


RESULTS
Fifty-six patients in the intervention group and 58 patients in the control group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The cesarean section rate was 38.8% in the intervention group vs. 27.2% in the control group (p = .1667). The differences in the number of fetal bradycardias in the 24 hours after PGF2 alpha injection 15 (21.1%) vs. 7 (14.6%) (p = .5871) and after intraamniotic water injection (6 (10.3%) vs. 2 (4.2%) (p = .1878) did not reach statistical significance. Two (3.6%) patients in the PGF2 alpha group and 6 (10.4%) in the control group had FICHT's labor score 3. PGF2 alpha was not associated with an increased vaginal examination rate compared with water. More patients in the water group underwent cesarean section before labor.


CONCLUSIONS
Intraamniotic PGF2 alpha as compared with water produced no reduction in cesarean section rate in the breech case. The number of patients with fetal bradycardia remained about the same. <EOD> On the Reproduction of the Moth, Sparganum (Themira), in the Bitter-Sweet Citrus Fruit

BACKGROUND
Major international guidelines recommend that oxytocin should be used at low doses (1 mU/min or lower) to promote labour during induction of labour in order to reduce the adverse neonatal effects of prolonged use. This was seen as especially important in the Turkish population, of which around 70% are born before 41 weeks of gestational age: a level similar to that of high-income Western countries. We conducted a systematic review in order to assess the effectiveness of low-dose oxytocin in labour induction in the Turkish population.


METHODS
We searched five major databases and websites in Turkey and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in any language for studies up to September 2014. Randomised clinical trials comparing low-dose oxytocin with placebo or non-oxytocin pharmacological interventions for labour induction in labour or of a post-term pregnancy were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool.

In this randomised feasibility trial which received Research Ethics Committee (REC) approval in June 2018, 20 children are randomised 1:1 to either intravenous maintenance of anaesthesia (TIVA) versus volatile-based inhalational maintenance of anaesthesia (using Isoflurane or Sevoflurane) for the maintenance phase of a general anaesthetic. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of a larger study investigating epigenetic changes and differences in anaesthetic use in patients of varying ages. The feasibility objectives were: to evaluate if enough blood samples could be collected, maintain a protocol compliance of 90%, and maintain an overall participant retention rate of 90%. Part of the protocol included evaluating the acceptability of the study processes to legal representatives (the legally responsible agent for decisions regarding medical care, including treatment and research involving participants who are unable to consent for themselves). Patients received maintenance of anaesthesia for hypospadias surgery and epigenetic changes in whole blood were explored as a secondary outcome with the analysis of which genes, pathways, and functional biological processes.

A biopsy specimen of the lower lip demonstrated a similar infiltrate with focal epithelial ulceration. Electron microscopic examination of the lesions showed features of Langerhans' histiocytes. In contrast, bullous lesions on the lower lip had histological features of porphyria cutanea tarda, and a skin biopsy specimen demonstrated epidermal atrophy and dermal fibrosis with colloid bodies within the epithelioid histiocytes. Electron microscopic demonstration of immune-type complexes in ulcer fluid demonstrated immune-type complexes. The patient was diagnosed to have Langerhans' cell granulomatosis, and a paraproteinemia was disclosed on further investigation. The monoclonal gammopathy was characterized by immunoglobulin A lambda light chains. Both diseases may represent different clinical expressibns of a common disease: a granulomatous disease induced by monoclonal gamnammopathy with immune complexes, or more probably by cytokines produced by malignant cells. <EOD> Role of Interleukin 8 in Cholangiocyte Proliferation in Primary Biliary Cirrhosis
Cholangiocyte proliferation is a characteristic histopathologic finding in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Although this proliferation has been postulated to cause ductopenia, the exact mechanisms mediating cholangiocyte proliferation remain unknown. We investigated the role of interleukin 8 (IL-8) in primary human hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in vitro. We found that the recombinant IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner stimulated cholangiocyte proliferation. Antisense IL-8 oligonucleotide markedly inhibited the proliferation. Northern blot analysis showed that IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and MIP-1β were mainly expressed in cholangiocytes. In patients with PBC, the cholangiocytes showed more intense expression of IL-8 but not of GRO1, RANTES, macrophage-derived chemokine, eotaxin, and IP-10. In addition, the levels of urinary IL-8 in patients with PBC were significantly higher than those in controls. Furthermore, the IL-6 level also tended to be higher in the urine of patients with PBC than in the urine of controls. Our results indicate that IL-8 plays a significant role in cholangiocyte proliferation in patients with PBC"

The role of mesocortical dopaminergic mechanisms in the acquisition of discriminative responding maintained by discrete cues, tone/light compound signals, or two lever presses was investigated. Rats received either pretraining (Pretraining) or no pretraining (No Pretrng) on a fixed ratio-10 (FR-10) schedule with two levers. In the acquisition phase, animals were then trained alternately for 60 min/d and extinguished in 30-min sessions with either i.v. cocaine (3 mg/kg) or i.v. saline following presentation of the previously reinforced lever. Rats receiving cocaine acquired responding more rapidly than did saline controls; however, no differential responding was observed in sessions without reinforcement during pretraining. Subsequently, subjects received injections of the dopamine D1 receptor-preferring antagonist SCH 23390 (0, 0.16, 0.8, 4, or 20 micrograms/kg) in combination with saline or cocaine and subsequently trained and extinguished as previously. During fixed-time responding (40-s timeout), SCH 23390 attenuated responding maintained by discrete cues, tone/light compound signals, and two lever presses. However, SCH 23390 did not affect responding on FR-10 schedules or during extinction regardless of the type of reinforcer used to train initial responding (""acquisition effects"") or responding in the subsequent extinction phase. SCH 23390 also attenuated responding on FR-20 schedules. These data suggest that activation of mesocortical dopaminergic mechanisms may be necessary for responding to be maintained solely by discrete signals. <EOD> Interventions for preventing ovarian cancer in women with pelvic inflammatory disease.
BACKGROUND
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) affects 1-10% of women globally. It is not clear whether PID increases the long-term risk of ovarian cancer and what the options are for primary prevention. One option could be to promote and ensure appropriate follow-up of women (e.g. those at increased risk because of previous laparoscopies) following pelvic inflammatory disease to prevent subsequent ovarian cancer. The other could be the use of preventive strategies following the treatment of PID to lower the risk of ovarian cancer.


OBJECTIVES
To conduct a systematic review on the benefits and harms of interventions (e.g. prophylaxis) used to prevent ovarian cancer subsequent to pelvic inflammatory disease.


SEARCH METHODS
We used the standard method of the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group to search for published and ongoing randomised trials in electronic bibliographic databases. The most recent search was run in January 2015. We searched the World Health Organisation's International Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov using the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform as the primary source. We checked the reference lists of retrieved reports.


SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised trials of women at increased risk of PID or at increased risk of ovarian cancer subsequent to PID.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Two review authors independently selected studies and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We planned to analyse and present dichotomous outcome data using risk ratios or odds ratios (OR.) as effect size measures for each type of analysis. We planned to analyse continuous outcome data using mean differences or standardised mean differences (S"

Islet isolation procedures have been optimized in animals, but there are several parameters that are less than ideal in the isolation of islets in humans. In particular, the disordered vascularity of the liver leads to uneven perfusion and is one variable that can be controlled with a single intra-arterial injection of calcium chloride. This study used modified liver injection to prepare the human liver for islet isolation. Six human livers were obtained from patients with an average donor age of 39 +/- 19 years. The mean cold ischemic time was 13 +/- 3 hr. The liver was perfused in a single-pass fashion. All donor livers were assessed for their bile output and the total number of islets was estimated using a method of islet recovery. The average total number of islets extracted from six human livers was 469,039 +/- 86,655. The average yield from single human pancreases was 145,877 +/- 66,898 islet equivalents. This method of perfusion and injection of calcium chloride prior to islet isolation was found to increase the total number of islet equivalents by 4-5 fold. Using this modified protocol for islet isolation in human livers, we found an average islet recovery of 22% +/- 6.1%. Thus, this improved human islet isolation procedure can be used to obtain greater numbers of islet equivalents and increased the transplantation success of islets. <EOD> .

ABSTRACT Introduction: Improvement in perioperative care for patients undergoing major surgery in the last decade has contributed to an increase in liver resection surgery. Aims: To study whether there is an increase in overall post-operative complication and mortality following anatomic liver resection (ALR) between two consecutive decades. Methods: All 551 consecutive partial hepatectomies between January 1981 and December 1999 were reviewed for type and timing of operation, resection and complication. All resections were classified according to anatomic anatomic hepatic resection (Brisbane 2000) system, and results analyzed for mortality and morbidity. Results: One hundred anatomical liver resections performed between 1981 and 1990, and four hundred and twenty-seven between 1990 and 1999. There was no significant change in the mean age and gender of patients undergoing partial hepatectomy. The majority of anatomical liver resections were performed by experienced surgeons. The most common hepatectomies in the early period were wedge resection 43%, and bisegmentectomies 24.8% in the late period. Overall hospital mortality was 24%, but was significantly lower after the late period 15.2%, P 0.01. Mortality increased with type of hepatectomy. There was no difference in mortality in the second half of the review period between experienced and inexperienced surgeons 10% and 12% respectively, P = 1.00 Conclusions: Anatomic liver resection can be performed with low mortality and morbidity by experienced hepato-pancreato-biliary surgeons. The introduction of improved anesthetic care and postoperative management has reduced the mortality"

 <EOD> Inclusion of β-Hydroxyaspartate-L-Tryptophan in the Structure of Phaselicin A Results in a Circularized β-Turn Motif of Unusual Asparagine and Threonine Amino Acid Conformations.
We report the structure of a new antibacterial and anticancer protein phaselicin A. Besides previously described linear β-hydroxyaspartic acid (β-HA) containing peptides, we found a rare occurrence of circularized β-turn structures with a non-proteinogenic amino acid β-HA-L-tryptophan, which is found in the structurally more complicated and rigid protein core of phaselicin A. The β-turn in the structural core of phaselicin A consists of a set of three β-HA units that are linked to its hydroxyamino acid moieties by hydrogen bonds, resulting in a stabilized circularized β-turn. In addition, there were β-HA-L-tryptophan units, which were structurally incorporated into various turns that were linked to β-strand and β-sheet motifs in phaselicin A. The hydrogen bonding network between the amino and hydroxyamino acid moieties of β-HA and the tryptophan indole moiety of β-HA-L-tryptophan may serve as a structural scaffold that rigidifies the protein turn architecture in phaselicin A. Also novel is that most of the structural elements observed in phaselicin A were not observed in previously described β-HA-containing peptides. In contrast to other β-hydroxyaspartic peptides, phaselicin A contains a unique hydroxyamino acid motif consisting of four asparagines in the N-terminus region that constitute structural features for a circularized β-turn. The unique circularized β-turn structure of phaselicin A, resulting from a combination of β-HA and β-HA-L-tryptophan, may have a significant role in the anticancer and antimicrobial activity of this protein. <EOD> The Association between Chronic Widespread Musculoskeletal Pain and Cognitive Function in Community-Dwelling Elderly: The Framingham Heart Study Offspring
Objective. Chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain (CWMP) may compromise cognitive function. In this study, we attempted to clarify the association between CWMP and the Mini-Mental State Examination-2 (MMSE-2). The MMSE-2 is a simple cognitive test, and recent studies indicate that the MMSE-2 is as accurate as the original MMSE in measuring cognition in this population. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional analysis among 2,683 participants of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). CWMP was defined using a self-administered questionnaire. The MMSE-2 was administered in-person. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to determine the association between CWMP and the MMSE-2. Results. There were 888 participants with CWMP and 1,795 participants without CWMP. The mean MMSE-2 score was 1.9 lower for participants with CWMP compared with those without CWMP. Participants with osteoarthritis (OA) also had a lower mean MMSE-2 score than those without OA (1.1 lower) and those with no osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis ever (OARAE) (0.7 lower). All associations remained significant after adjustment for"

Summary: ""In a feasibility study, we designed and tested the feasibility of a fourweek digital-based diet quality intervention for adolescents with obesity using a single-arm study design. The feasibilities measured were recruitment and enrollment, retention, intervention fidelity, acceptability, and demand. Thirteen participants were recruited from CHOP and 11 (eight females, three males) in the intervention arm. The intervention completion rates were 100% in a four-week study period. One participant did not show up, but still texted 17 intervention deliverables successfully. The average score on the Acceptability and Feasibility Questionnaire Survey of diet quality intervention components was 4.14 (range 3.06-4.57). Participants reported the digital intervention design was 4.57 out of 5. The digital-based dietary intervention for adolescents with obesity seems feasible and acceptable and could be implemented with some modifications.""

The results showed that the high-risk patients of CHS after CAS were screened by parameters of TCD before CAS. Therefore, it is possible to predict the occurrence of CHS by the evaluation of cerebral autoregulation (CA) before CAS and early preventive measures should be taken for patients with poor cerebral autoregulation to obtain the best prognosis.

2.


The article published in Nature Neuroscience showed that transcranial doppler could not assess the function of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA), but also could not predict the CHS for patients with chronic internal carotid artery stenosis. However, the cerebral blood flow velocity derived from the transcranial doppler of patients with chronic carotid stenosis is abnormal. Therefore, transcranial doppler can be used to assess dCA by cerebral blood flow velocity monitoring, and the dCA parameters will be more accurate.

3.


In addition to transcranial doppler, more and more methods have been evaluated to evaluate cerebral autoregulation after CAS, the methods include: continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), transcranial electrical stimulation, the methods are more convenient and reliable than transcranial doppler.

4.
The results indicated that the CA parameters derived from transcranial doppler can be evaluated easily and effectively. It is expected that the preoperative evaluation of patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing CAS in this way can help to prevent and reduce the occurrence of CHS in advance.

5.

The data is valuable to this study and the evaluation of CA based on transcranial doppler can be beneficial to prevent and reduce the occurrence of CHS for patients with carotid artery stenosis.

 <EOD> Identification of novel protein complexes from affinity purified interacting proteins in rat liver.
We developed a method to identify protein complexes in rat liver. Affinity-purified protein complexes were obtained using anti-alpha-tubulin antibody- and anti-HMG-17 antibody-coupled Sepharose beads, and these were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. It was found that various proteins were eluted by anion exchange chromatography; subsequently, protein spots were cut out from a preparative gel and subjected to analysis by nano-LC-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). In a control sample, protein spots present in 15 protein bands were identified. From the results of LC-MS, 50 and 22 protein spots were identified in affinity-purified complexes that bound to anti-alpha-tubulin antibody and anti-HMG-17 antibody, respectively. The interaction partners (i.e., tubulin and dynein) were recovered from control samples; however, the other proteins recovered here did not bind to anti-alpha-tubulin antibody in previous studies. Moreover, protein spots that were common in both samples appeared to be the same protein. Thus, this research identified several protein complexes related to microtubules in the liver and also identified several proteins that participate in tubulin-containing complexes with unidentified functions. This study also provided insight into the functions of other components of tubule-containing microtubule-related complexes, thus establishing a method used to examine the function of proteins in the liver in detail. <EOD> Pharmacological Analysis of the Bitter Taste in Rabbits
The rabbit's ability to taste bitter substances was described 100 years ago. We tried to verify these results using different compounds and to compare the sensitivity threshold with that in a normal human and in a rat. We also investigated the ability of normal rabbits to adapt to the gustatory irritant phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). Sixteen normal rabbits were examined. The number of the bites, the intensity of reaction, and the taste duration were analysed according to the substances used (sodium salts, alkaloids, amines, organic bases). Different solutions of caffeine, PTC, and tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) were used to determine the relative taste threshold values. The order of the threshold strength of the solutions was as follows: sodium chloride > PTC-base > potassium chloride > sodium hydrogen carbonate > PTC-acid > PTC/NaOH > TEA/NaOH. The threshold values for PTC (63‐96 μmol) and TEA (62‐360 μmol) in rabbit and rat are almost identical. The threshold values for caffeine (Petri dish) are significantly different (2600 μmol, rabbit; < 4 μmol rat). The rabbit has a normal taste for the bitterness. Like the rat but unlike humans, it is not able to distinguish PTC‐base from PTC‐acid. <EOD> Isolation and functional characterization of a novel mouse uteroplacental AMP‐activated protein kinase
The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) has diverse cellular functions, including the regulation of cellular energy homeostasis, and is central to cell growth and differentiation. To further understand the role of AMPK in the uteroplacental‐A unit of mammalian pregnancy, this study evaluated the expression pattern and functional role of AMPK in the placenta. We demonstrate, for the first time, using RNase protection assays in mouse placenta at various stages of pregnancy, that expression of all three catalytic alpha (α) subunits of AMPK (α1, α2 and α3) were maintained throughout pregnancy. The levels of both catalytic α1 and α3 subunits were similar to the levels of the constitutively expressed catalytic α2 subunit. The alpha‐inhibitor (α‐inhibitor) 2 subunit encoded by the Prkaa2 gene, the major isoform found in mouse placenta, and was expressed as early as implantation (E6.5) and remained at relatively constant levels throughout the remainder of gestation.

306,"[/INST] This is a prospective, randomized, controlled single-surgeon trial performed at the University of California San Francisco that investigates the use of IV TXA in patients undergoing GAM. All patients who meet WPATH guidelines for GAM, undergo GAM, ASA I-III, and are >18 years old will have the opportunity to be enrolled. Patients will be consented to participate in the preoperative visit. Experimental Group: Patients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) at a concentration of 1g/10ml over a period of 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction. Postoperative care will be standard based on established UCSF guidelines. Control Group: Patients in the control group will not receive any TXA intraoperatively and will undergo a traditional GAM. Tranexamic Acid is available as a sterile, single-dose. This 1g vial is readily available in the anesthesia cart in the operating room. Immediately following induction, the anesthesia team will administer 1g of TXA intravenously. After obtaining hemostasis and irrigating as per standard practice, anesthesia shall not use any other hemostatic agents. Post-procedure, each patient will be provided with standard postoperative instructions which will include a chart to record daily drain outputs for the right and left sides. Demographic data, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes such as hematoma, seroma, drain output, wound complications, surgical site infections, and thromboembolic events will be recorded and analyzed. Patients will be managed for hematoma and seroma as per standard procedure, whether with ultrasound, clinic aspiration, IR drain placement, or return to the operating room as deemed necessary by the senior surgeon.

| <EOD> Changes in the Phosphorylation of a 14‐3‐3 Protein Correlate with Cytoskeletal and Proteomic Differences in Arabidopsis Root Hair Morphogenesis1
Root hairs provide a useful model system for cell morphogenesis and molecular dynamics studies. We used two‐dimensional difference gel electrophoresis to identify proteins whose abundance correlates with 0.03% sucrose to inhibit or 2.5 mm ethylene to stimulate root hair in Arabidopsis thaliana L. cv. Wassilewskija (Ws) roots compared with corresponding untreated roots. The 14-3-3 protein  was one of 26 root hair growth-specific proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the three spots representing 14-3-3 were downregulated by ethylene and upregulated by sucrose. We also confirmed sucrose’s promotion of changes in phosphorylation of 14-3-3 as well as its promotion of protein–protein interactions with the sucrose-dependent phosphoproteome using Western blotting and Co-IP, which showed that sucrose reduces 14-3-3 phosphorylation and increases 14-3-3/fasciclin a (FAS) interactions, whereas ethylene increases 14-3-3 phosphorylation and reduces 14-3-3/FAS interactions. Finally, we used phospho-peptide affinity chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry to find that sucrose inhibits and ethylene promotes the interactions of FAS with phosphorylated 14-3-3.

307,"[/INST] Smell Training and Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS) as a Treatment for Severe Severe Loss of Smell (SL) due to COVID-19

Due to new insights that recovery of olfactory function is possible for those who are severely anosmic due to COVID-19 infection and this recovery can be accelerated using either Sniffing Training (SNT) to promote smell function and/or non-invasive stimulation of the Trigeminal Nerve.

[/INTRO] 

### Objectives :
[/INTRO]

This study aims to determine the ability of TNS and/or SNT to promote endogenous olfactory growth, and improve smell function in patients recovering from COVID-19 infection and acute onset anosmia. Anosmia and hyposmia are known to negatively affect quality of life by causing depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, and reduced quality of sleep. Olfactory training and neuromodulation are emerging olfactory therapeutics that can augment smell function for patients who have impaired, but not completely absent, olfaction. In this study, Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS) will be delivered before daily SNT; each has distinct potential in promoting the recovery of olfactory function.

[/INTRO]

### Primary Study Questions :
[/INTRO]

-What is the effect of TNS on olfactory function and psychophysical evaluation of smell in patients with COVID-19 anosmia?
-How is TNS impact recovery of smell function?
-How will TNS and/or SNT treatment help improve quality of life (QoL) and health-related (HRQoL) in patients with COVID-19 anosmia?

### Secondary Study Questions :
[/INTRO]

-What is the impact on olfactory training on smell in patients with COVID-19 anosmia?
-How will olfactory trainings and neuromodulation treatments impact recovery of smell function and psychophysical olfactory evaluation in patients with COVID-19 anosmia?
-What is the treatment’s effect on COVID-19 anosmia in patients?

 <EOD> Sleep Problems as Early Symptoms of Drug and Stress-Induced Neuropsychiatric Disorders
The link between sleep problems and mood and anxiety disorders is well documented. Less is known of the effects of stress, environmental, and drug-induced sleep disturbances. Epidemiological findings from the Sleep Disorders in Adolescents Study (3200 participants, assessed in sleep clinics across Australia between 1994 and 2001) document that stressful life events are associated with sleep complaints and that sleep problems preceded depressive or anxiety disorders. Also, polysomnographic recordings show that sleep latency is increased in stress-induced sleep and panic disorder. Animal studies of stress-induced sleep have documented that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responds to psychotestosterone, glucocorticoids, or opiates with wakefulness and arousal effects, which alter sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Also, rodents have shown increased orexin levels and sleep following stress. Thus, sleep complaints may be a marker to stress-induced anxiety and neuropsychiatric disorders. <EOD> .

a b s t r a c tVaccines represent a primary way to protect people against severe acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This paper reviews the status of COVID-19 vaccine development and summarizes details of different vaccine types during the early stages of the vaccine development. To date, over 900 potential vaccines are at different stages of preclinical and clinical evaluation, and over 200 early vaccine candidates have reached clinical evaluation phase I. Among those, 18 different types of COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently at Phase II/Phase III clinical trial stage. All these candidates share the similar challenges of being fast tracked and developed for an emerging viral disease. We anticipate that the lessons learned from the current efforts will allow for a faster development of potential vaccines for future pandemic threats.

On 7 January, the virus causing this pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), which was termed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). On 11 February, the virus was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)   The species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it..., Gorbalenya  . Later on 17 March, the WHO named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 . Since then, it quickly spread worldwide and led to increasing number of fatalities. Hence, WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and subsequently declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 20 August 2020, about 19 612 081 individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with about 731 655 deceased and 12 88"

314,"[/INST] Your task is to design a summarization algorithm which identifies and reduces the length of the texts without losing semantic similarity.

Question:
[/INST] What text summarization algorithm (i) identifies a set of core entities from the input texts {1, 2, …, n}, (ii) selects a representative text fragment, (iii) ensures the text fragments are the most informative and the longest of the similar texts, and (iv) achieves the longest abstracts?

Input Texts
---------------
[INST]
---------------
Text corpora are represented in pairs <c 1 , d 1 >, <c 2 , d 2 >, <c 3 , d 3 > …, <c m , d m >, consisting of context (c i ) and discourse (d i ) texts, where m = 5. Context (c) text is the text that helps to clarify the core object represented in discourse (d) text. Given the discourse text, the context text should convey the same underlying core information in a simplified form.

Required Output
---------------
[INST]
For each input text {c 1 , d 1 >, {c 2 , d 2 > …, {c m , d m > ,
(a) select the main entities from input texts.
(b) select one text fragment to be representative of others, containing all the core entities found before.
(c) select the discourse fragments of length l, where l is the maximal length, but preserve the core meaning of them.
(d) the obtained fragments have higher FMeasure scores then other existing summarization algorithms

Evaluation Metrics
===================
[INST] Evaluation is carried out through five metrics:
(e) ROUGE-F   ROUGE: A package for automatic evaluation of summaries, Lin   and ROUGE_L   ROUGE: A package for automatic evaluation of summaries, Lin   F scores between original summary and generated one.
(f) Semantic similarity scores (SSS)   Automatic evaluation of summaries, Wale  .

Input Parameters
------------------
[INST]
{l, i f : the maximal discourse text length and the maximal set of words in discourse text, respectively, r f : the word range, u f : the lower bound discourse text length, l p : the minimal set of words in discourse text, l c : the minimal set of words in context, l m : the maximal set of words chosen from the discourse text to be in the representative fragment, l w : the maximal length of the chosen words from the discourse text, r w : the upper bound of words per document, R ef : the minimal size of the set of entities in the core, P ef : the preferred size of the set of entities in the core, p : the number of generated summaries, q : the number of core entities represented in the discourse text in each pair 

Output Parameters
----------------------
[INST]
The summarization algorithms output for each input text:
(a) The list of core entities in text, ordered from the most to the least important entity found in the discourse.
(b) The representative fragment for discourse text with the given core entities.
(c) List of the best five discourse fragments for each input text, ranked by the F-Measure scores (if {l, i f } <= {r f , u f } - use top-5 best-fit F-Measure scores)
(d) The set of keywords from discourse text with the list of generated keywords

The present study reports two pregnant women, one with cervical cancer and the other with uterine choriocarcinoma, who developed postpartum metastasis to the liver after a normal vaginal delivery. The cervical cancer patient underwent a C-section because of spontaneous premature rupture of the membranes, while the patient with uterine carcinoma delivered the girl normally through a normal vaginal delivery. Six months after the delivery both patients developed metastasis in the right lobe of the liver. Both patients had elevated CEA, CA19-9, and CA125. Ultrasound and computed tomography findings revealed hepatic metastases, indicating the prognosis was poor. The two patients did not want further treatment after being informed about their condition and the prognosis. Here we report two cases of aggressive course after vaginal delivery in patients with advanced cervical cancer and uterine choriocarcinoma. The relationship between normal and abnormal delivery and metastasis is discussed. <EOD> Rational design of a highly functional electrode by incorporating a 3D nanoprinted carbon nanotube sponge network with a redox-gated organic semiconductor hydrogel.
Maintaining a desirable 3D structural architecture is a crucial prerequisite to develop high performance devices. In the meantime, functionalizing the structure to obtain controlled release and switchable properties has great potential in sensing, actuators and therapies. However, there are still challenges in controlling each specific requirement separately without interfering with the others. Here, we report for the first time the rational design and synthesis of a 3D functional hybrid electrode system consisting of vertically aligned carbon nanotube sponge (VACNS) as a matrix and redox-gated organic semiconductor (OSC) hydrogel, PTz-S, as fillers. The VACNS has an amalgam nature in which the carbon nanotube is wrapped at high density, resulting in highly conductive sponge properties. VACNS is grown in situ by a facile pyrolysis methodology, which is easily scalable over a large scale, and its 3D structure is well-preserved after its integration with the hydrogel to support enhanced sensing performance, low detection limit (50 fM) and excellent selectivity. Moreover, the redox gated organic hydrogel is sensitive to the reductive species (thiols/amines), and shows the electrochemical response (electrocatalytic H2O2 reduction or redox reaction of hydrogel polymer backbone) with a stable electrochemical detection rate after five successive cycles. <EOD> Influences of Lignin Hydrothermolytic Degradation and Fractionation Conditions on 13C Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Relaxation.
Lignin samples have been successfully analyzed by 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR), but lignin-lignin interactions, which lead to low-intensity resonances, prevent easy identification of structural features of lignin. This is a major hindrance to characterize lignin in solid samples, which are the most available material on lignin research. Here, we propose a systematic strategy in lignin hydrothermolytic degradation and fractionation conditions that allows lignin solubility enhancement and improves 13C SSNMR intensities, making possible to analyze solid native lignin materials in unprecedented fashion. Hydrothermal degradation leads to enhancement of solubility by cleaving β-O-4 and ε-O-4 bonds. Fractionation by increasing temperature conditions (pH 11 at 60°C and pH 12 at 100°C) allowed increasing lignin solubility (up to 121 mg/mL at pH 12 and 100°C), and also provided a better resolution of lignin signals in 13C SSNMR spectra. On the basis of a thorough comparison of solid and soluble lignin samples, we found that 13C SSNMR is highly sensitive to lignin structural modifications, in particular the solubilization conditions and degradation degree"

Patients with atrial fibrillation and cancer are at increased risk of both thromboembolism and bleeding, and optimal anticoagulant strategies of these patients are still unclear. To test the association between anticoagulant treatment and thromboembolism among patients with both diseases, we included data from the Cancer Registry of Norway on all 496 270 patients born between 1919 and 2000 residing in Norway at some point from 1995 to 2013. Of these patients, 73 943 (14.7%) had a cancer diagnosis during the study period and concomitant atrial fibrillation; 15 294 (2.06%) had an acute, non‐embolic venous thromboembolic event during follow up, 50 073 (67.2%) had oral anticoagulant treatment during follow up, 18 707 (25.3%) had no anticoagulant treatment and 17 510 (23.5%) had intermittent anticoagulant treatment. By inverse probability of treatment weights we calculated a propensity‐score‐based comparison group of 299 600 patients with cancer and no atrial fibrillation. Using these weights, compared to having no cancer, having cancer was associated with a 3.1 (95% CI 3.0–3.1) hazard ratio (HR) for venous thromboembolism, and having atrial fibrillation was associated with a 4.4 (4.1–4.7) HR for venous thromboembolism. In the cancer–atrial fibrillation cohort, with patients receiving oral anticoagulants, intermittent treatment reduced the occurrence of venous thromboembolism by 25% (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67–0.82) and the major bleeding risk by 33% (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.60–0.76). The HR for a composite of bleeding and venous thromboembolism for intermittent compared to no oral anticoagulant treatment was 0.58 (95% CI 0.51–0.65). <EOD> Antibodies to Epithelial Cell Surface Glycoproteins in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Related Disorders

INTRODUCTION
This study presents the preliminary results of a randomised multi-centre clinical trial involving patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and coronary atherosclerosis (CAS).


METHODS
One hundred and three patients with angiographically documented CAD and NIDDM of either gender aged 42-64 years were eligible. Following the percutaneus coronary revascularization (PCR) group (n = 53) and the conservative group (n = 50) were observed for 42 months.


RESULTS
Following 6-month control, patients of the surgical group (n = 53, mean age 52.4 +/- 6.1 yrs. and left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) 56.9 +/- 7.7%) showed a decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) from 10.3 +/- 3.26 mmol/l to 7.74 +/- 3.41 mmol/l (p < 0.01) and in HbAlc level from 7.96 +/- 1.14% to 6.66 +/- 1.02%; (p < 0.02). Patients in the conservative group (n = 50, age 55.2 +/- 6.89 yrs. and LV EF 58.8 +/- 8.4%) revealed no changes in serum glucose and in HbA1c levels. There was no difference in fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels between both treatment groups at six-month control. The risk factors, including elevated cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and decreased HDL cholesterol showed a statistically significant difference between the PCR group and the conservative group. At that time, the PCR group showed a lower Framingham score (51.8 +/- 19.04) compared with the conservative group (61.3 +/- 16.94). No deaths were registered in both groups during the 42-month follow-up period.


CONCLUSIONS
(1) The restoration of coronary patency in the PCR group was not associated with a decrease in blood glucose and HbAlc levels compared with the conservative group of patients with coexistent NIDDM and CAD during 6-month observation period. (2) There was no difference in serum C-peptide and insulin levels in both treatment groups and no difference in HbAlc levels at the six-month control. (3) After 6-month observation, the PCR group was associated with significantly decreased Framingham score. <EOD> The use of glycerol in the treatment of dehydration: an outdated therapy?

## Explanation of the Terms
* visual analogue scale (VAS)
Visual analogue scale (VAS) is a scale in which the patient marks or states pain by placing a mark in the middle or at the end of the scale or by choosing the option that describes the pain best. Pain is divided into three-dimensional values by the patient. Pain can be divided into three options, mild, moderate and severe. The scale can be horizontal or vertical. VAS is a visual scale without marks, but pain values are recorded on the scale. It is a 10 cm horizontal scale. One end is the absence of pain and the other end is the worst pain (Trabacal and Çavdar, 2020).

* hoku point
The hoku point, which is located on the dorsum of the hand, between the first and second metacarpal bones, between the thumb and the index finger. It is the area where the hoks of the thumb, finger pads, and metacarpal bones intersect (Konuk et al. 2020).

* Labor
Labor: the process of producing offspring through the birth of a living child by delivery.

* Birth Satisfaction Scale-
Revised
Birth satisfaction scale revised (BSS-R) is a form developed in Turkey in 2007 by Koybaş and Yavuz. It consists of a total of 18 items. The BSS is a 5-point Likert type scale in which the score range of the items will be from 1-5. In the scoring of the BSS-R, the lowest score to be obtained from the scale is 18, and the highest score to be obtained from the scale is 90. When the scale is interpreted, the BSS-R score range is interpreted as: the BSS-R scores obtained for the person are interpreted to be ‘poor’ (35 and below), ‘satisfactory’ (36-70) and ‘good’ (71 and above) (Koybaş and Yavuz, 2007).

Background and Purpose
-----------------
Rationale:
Spatial neglect (SN) impairs the ability to orient to and act within the left hemifield and space, causing significant distress and disability for survivors of stroke. The extent of deficit can be rated objectively using computerized bisectional tasks. Prism adaptation therapy (PAT) is a promising adjunct treatment, improving SN deficit in up to 2/3 patients. A limitation of PAT is an objective, clinician-applied clinical biomarker of PAT responsiveness is lacking. The investigators have discovered that Aiming SN, an objective behavioral marker, reliably predicts PAT responsiveness and improves post-PAT functional outcome. The innovation of this study is that the study examines behavioral and neuroimaging predictors of Aiming SN, allowing to personalize SN rehabilitation.
Background:
The innovation of this study is that the investigators will examine and integrate [e.g. PAT treatment, behavioral and brain MRI predictors of Aiming and where spatial neglect, as well as brain white matter tracts and functional brain networks.]

Methods
===
Random assignment: This study is to examine SN behavioral, clinical and brain imaging predictors of behavioral treatment response, including the association between right brain neural networks, and SN. Methods: In a sample of 180 right brain stroke survivors (120 with SN, 60 without), the study assessed SN and functional (FIM) recovery post-PAT. The hypothesis is that neuroimaging, behavioral and neural predictors will explain SN treatment response, including the association between right brain networks, and SN. Methods: 90 Veterans with right brain stroke (60 SN; 30 without SN) in the study received, with sham control, PAT for 1-2 weeks (single masked), with subsequent assessment. Findings to date: Brain network predictors, and the interaction between network and individual therapy responsiveness, predicted PAT treatment response in a pilot study. For Veterans with spatial neglect and right brain hemisphere stroke, pretreatment (baseline) right frontal to post-central gyrus cortical thickness measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) predicted posttreatment PAT responsiveness, while left frontal to right subcortical corticospinal tract (CST) length also predicted posttreatment behavioral improvement in Veterans with spatial neglect. Conclusions: The investigators' findings demonstrated that cortical thickness of brain regions connected to behavioral PAT were associated with SN treatment response.


[/INST] Summary of methods and results by the Centre Hospitalier Valida

Methods
===
Background and purpose:
Objective: 45 Veterans with right brain stroke, of whom 25 had SN, underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. The investigators analyzed diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from voxels using tract-based morphometry. Their hypothesis was that regional changes, particularly in the frontal lobe and ipsilesional arcuate fasciculus fiber tracts, underlie spatial neglect behavior, which is improved by PAT. Methods: Veterans completed 10 PAT sessions of 100 trials each. A masked therapist examined participants' paper-pencil drawings using four assessment tools: two computerized line-bisection task tools, a paper and pencil, and the Catherine Bergego Scale. They also assessed functional outcome using the FIM instrument. Results: The investigators found that before therapy, Veterans with SN responded normally to all assessment tools; however, Veterans had a normal response to only two out of three tests after receiving PAT. PAT improved Aiming SN, reducing the severity of Aiming SN by 12.3 points (p = 0.0117), whereas Veterans retained a normal response to two out of three tests"
325,"[/INST] <EOD> The in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative effects of dietary fatty acids can differ according to cell type and context
Abstract A wide range of dietary fats are consumed globally and their influence on tumour cell growth has been a topic of some debate. This study aimed to ascertain the impact of various polyunsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and saturated fatty acids (SAFA) on the proliferation of human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cells and murine hepatocytes (BNL CL.2). In vitro data demonstrated that HT-29 cell proliferation was inhibited by >70 % (P < 0·05) by UFA over the course of 90 h. However, in contrast, UFA had no effect on hepatocyte growth. In vivo data revealed that a high SAFA diet promoted mucin-type O-glycosylation (P < 0·05), inhibited (P < 0·05) hepatic lipid accumulation and prevented body weight gain in obese mice as compared with the other diet groups. In this study, in vitro data indicate that UFA inhibit HT-29 cell viability in a dose-dependent and sustained manner, while in vivo data suggest that dietary UFA can protect against weight gain and potentially promote healthy cellular composition in both non-transformed hepatocytes and established colon tumour cells. <EOD> Translational Regulatory Elements in the 5' Untranslated Region of the Human c-myc Gene
The c-myc transcript is present in a wide range of normal and malignant cells and is expressed at different levels and temporal patterns relative to cell proliferation, differentiation or quiescence, and transformation. The level of c-myc mRNA was found to be transcriptionally regulated in fibroblasts and lymphoid cells. However, in mature primary T cells, in HeLa and K562 erythroleukemia cells, and in myeloid cells, c-myc mRNA appeared to be subject to post-transcriptional regulation. In mature T cells and HeLa cells, this post-transcriptional regulation was mediated by translational repression and was found to be regulated by cytokine signals. In a mouse erythroleukemia cell line (HIT), the increase in c-Myc protein production in response to erythroid differentiation was correlated with an absolute increase in c-myc mRNA stability and a decrease in the steady-state level of translation of the c-myc transcript. Further studies of this regulatory element in the 5' untranslated region of c-myc transcripts (5'UTR) using a heterologous translocation strategy that involved exchanging the mouse β-globin 5'UTR with the human c-myc 5'UTR in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) demonstrated that the 5'UTR of c-myc is responsible for translational repression of c-myc mRNA in HIT cells. This repression could also be relieved by cytokines that regulate c-myc mRNA and protein expression in HIT cells. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of translational repression of c-myc mRNA observed in HIT cells and HeLa and mature human primary T cells is the same. <EOD> Etiological Factors associated with Osteochondropathy in Dogs: a Review of Historical Exposures and Present Day Characteristics

The goal of this paper was to summarize the epidemiological studies of the developmental etiology of osteochondropathy (OCD) in dogs in response to a series of questions raised within the Veterinary Pathology community. A review of historical papers was undertaken to address the first 3 questions: 1) what causes OCD, 2) what are the most important historical events that affect prevalence and incidence, and 3) what are the most important present day historical events that affect prevalence of OCD. The answer to 4 was to provide a review of the 36 papers published since 2000 concerning etiology of OCD as a baseline for further research. A review was made of the historical and clinical records for the age and breed incidence of OCD. To answer the overall question, the available evidence points to a genetic basis. Diseases"

### Flapping wings

There are basically two kinds of motion possible with each wing: flapping and rolling. You can also have complex motions in between those extremes.

Flapping wings are common in vertebrates as a form of flight, especially in birds and bats. They're also found in insects (especially beetles and locusts) and some extinct dinosaurs such as pterosaurs and modern birds are capable of both flapping and powered flight.

Wings can move in many ways (e.g. up and down, front to back, and side to side) during a flapping motion. And the size and complexity of wings vary enormously. You can have a single, very tiny wing, such as the hind wings of many insects. You can also have multiple wings on both sides of the body, like with bat wings or wingspans so large they make the body look tiny by comparison like with an airplane or a bird.

Here I'd like to explain the motion based a single, big wing:

![](https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/public_content/media/gallery/birds/BIRD-RSPB11091512034563626/RSPB-110973558BRAZE-07046%20-%20bird%20in%20Flight.png)

A bird wing flaps up, down, forwards, backwards, and side to side. The reason for this is that this is what's required of a wing in order to generate enough lift to support the animal when it's flying. You can view this in more detail in the [video section](video/flapping-wings/).

What it looks like when studying the motion of a single wing is a kind of ""snake-like"" motion, where the wing tip moves back and forth from the body (the head is attached to the shoulder bone, or coracoid). The wing ""joint"" consists of two shoulder bones (pro- and scapula), connected by a set of muscles and tendons.

![](https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/public_content/media/gallery/birds/BIRD-RSPB11091512034563626/RSPB-110973558BRAZE-07046%20-%20bird%20in%20Flight_3.png)

This motion is sometimes described by the formula: **l3h2o**. That is to say; ""legs"", ""hoe"" (i.e. the claws or talons), ""feet"" (i.e. the toes).

The next time you see a person wearing white trainers to the airport, remember to always **wash them first after visiting the toilet!**

Input Text (for the entire document): Summary:
Informed consent will be sought from participants in all trial arms. CM-PST is a CM-based intervention that teaches individuals strategies to cope with everyday life challenges that may influence alcohol intake. It is delivered via videoconferences, in individual sessions over 12 weeks, then an individual booster session at 10 weeks (to reinforce the new skills learned) and 20 weeks (to review the skill set and answer participants' questions). CM-only will involve incentives for alcohol abstinence and submission of urine samples twice/wk. K99 study participants will receive CM-PST intervention, and R00 participants will also receive CM intervention but with the extras of a weekly cognitive/emotional assessment and a CM-based behavioral/relapse management assessment. Intervention feasibility and acceptability will be assessed at 3 mo., based on the number of fMRI sessions completed and participants' ratings of overall experience on the Client Satisfaction Survey. Participants will also be asked to provide detailed feedback via open-ended interview questions at completion of the trial. Primary outcomes of the R00 study will show changes in AUD severity after 3 and 6 months and alcohol abstinence in percent (%). Secondary outcomes will show changes in AUD screening status, Alcohol-related negative consequences, Alcohol use, Drug Use, Reasons for drinking, Negative and positive affect, and engagement of CM neural targets. Data from R00 intervention will be compared both between and within trial arms, using a variety of regression models with adjustments for potential confounding variables. Primary outcome analyses will be carried out by intention-to-treat with an alpha level of 0.05. The main study will be completed within five years.

Transparent, amorphous, plastic materials (tapes, plastic sheets and films, food wrap, plastic containers) are omnipresent in the human environment. All of these materials are derived from petroleum or from ethylene derivatives, and therefore have similar properties. Of relevance to human health are physical properties and toxicologic properties. All of the toxicologic properties of these materials are under investigation, with particular attention to the effects on biological molecules, on cellular and subcellular structures, and on specific organs and systems. Some properties of these materials that are considered to be hazardous include odor, color, ability to emit a vaporous state (volatility), and ability to attract a vapor (adhesion). <EOD> Detection of Salmonella spp. in ready-to-eat vegetable salad and lettuce using real-time PCR and a novel dried milk film dip assay.

 <EOD> A Combination Model and Experimental Analysis for Quantifying the Impact of Particulate Matter on Heart and Vascular Disease
Pulmonary particulate matter (PM) is suspected to have adverse health effects on various organs, including the heart and vasculature. Here, we combined computational (exposure models) and experimental (in vitro assays) methods to elucidate the relationship between PM emission characteristics and heart and vascular diseases. We analyzed the associations between PM emissions and cardiac and vascular endpoints by examining the concentrations in each organ. We constructed a computational model of PM exposure and the heart and vascular disease and used its predictions to evaluate the exposure–response relationship between the PM mass and heart and vascular disease by comparing these predictions with epidemiological results. We show that the predictions of the concentration in the heart and vascular organs exhibit high correlations with disease-specific indices. Furthermore, the computational model predictions of the mass of the PM emitted from various emission sources and the concentration in the organs are in good agreement with epidemiological studies investigating the heart and vascular diseases in individuals. Our results indicate that epidemiological studies support the use of the computational model and suggest that computational model predictions can be applied to epidemiological studies in relation to the health impact evaluation of disease burden when PM emissions and disease endpoints are obtained for the computational model input. <EOD> A novel methodological approach to assess the efficacy of interferon alpha in the management of severe COVID-19 patients
SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent for COVID-19, emerged in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread around the world, resulting in a global pandemic. Despite the availability of the vaccines for severe COVID-19 patients, the role of immunomodulatory therapy with an interferon alpha (IFN-α) is yet to be fully understood. Current studies investigating the effects of IFN-α in COVID-19 patients have shown inconsistent results. Such a poor outcome could be mainly attributed to a lack of standardized methods. As such, in this study, we have introduced the innovative method that assessed the efficacy of IFN-α in management of patients with severe COVID-19. <EOD> The Cutting-Edge of Cardiac Surgery: Robotic Approach or Hybrid Operation (Hybrid).
The evolution of surgical equipment and techniques always represents an ongoing challenge of surgery, being one of the major driving forces of modern surgical practice. Such practice is characterized by continuously improving safety and quality of care and outcomes, which are mostly associated with reduced morbidity and mortality, and also by the improvement in patients' quality of life. The last decades have been focused on the introduction of newer materials and technologies into surgery, which are considered as the cutting-edge of surgical practice. The evolution of the robotic equipment into the surgical field occurred, in our view, as one of the most interesting and challenging issues in the last decade. The adoption of the robotic technique in surgery (such as laparoscopic, thoracoscopic, endoscopic, urologic, and cranial and spinal surgery) was initially associated with the introduction of the surgical Da Vinci robot (Intuitive Surgical, Mountain View, CA), which represents the first commercial robotic system used in surgery, and then, with the evolution of the use of the surgical robot and other types of robots recently applied in surgery. Robotic surgery is characterized by the application of an improved ""eye-hand-eye"" technique, and this represents one of the major innovations in surgery. In addition, the robotic technique is characterized by the ability to work as a single surgeon. At the beginning, to perform such a surgical technique, the robotic team consisted of the surgeon and his assistant. However, after introduction of the robotic surgical system to the surgical community, robotic surgeon has to work alone using the console and the robotic tools. The application of this approach reduces the complications associated with long time robotic approach; therefore, robotic technique was able to decrease all of the ""complications in robotic surgery"". Hybrid operation is one of other innovations in surgery, with the potential usefulness to improve the results of surgical procedures. Hybrid surgery should be defined as a combined technique, characterized by the association of the open surgery and endoscopy/robotic elements. The aim of the present study is to report the results of robotic and hy"

We report the case of a 44- year-old man of Moroccan origins. He was suffering from chronic renal failure for 17 years. His serum creatinine was 1500 μM and his albumin : creatinine ratio was 300 mg/g. His haemoglobin was 10.9 g/dl and his haematocrit was 37.6%. The urine was amber colored and microscopic examination showed large numbers of erythrocytes in the sediment as well as protein, hemoglobin, and urobilineogen casts. Renal ultrasonography demonstrated enlarged polycystic kidneys with multiple renal masses. Renal biopsy found a clear cell type renal cell carcinoma. The patient was treated by a nephrectomy and an excision of the right renal pedicle with metastasis to the lymph nodes, which led to ureteral obstruction at the level of the inferior ureter. The patient was then placed on peritoneal dialysis under treatment with interferon-α, which allowed a stabilization of his renal function. We recommend urological evaluation of patients with chronic renal failure, especially if they present with haematuria or hypertension, two cardinal signs of secondary hyperparathyroidism. <EOD> Efficient method of calculating the photon survival rate in a semiconductor crystal: Application to a laser operating with an external resonator.
A method is given to calculate theoretically the survival rate in semiconductor crystals when the external reflectors are included in the problem. The efficiency of the method is examined and studied theoretically and experimentally to demonstrate the results. The main features of the method are the following points. (1) Both one- and two-dimensional problems for an infinite slab can be tackled with the same method, and the result is the same. (2) By the method it is possible to avoid numerical instability for wide photon escape range in a p-i-n structure; this instability sometimes occurs in conventional methods. (3) The method is extremely simple, not only analytically but also in its computer-time requirements.

Despite the introduction of new second and third line drug regimen with better efficacy and safety, poor adherence still exists. The objective of this study was to examine the role of pharmacist counselling in improving adherence to ART. Methods This was a prospective descriptive study where 165 HIV patients from infectious ward were recruited for pharmacist counselling during their 6 month in-hospital follow-up. The pharmacists provided counselling focusing on dosage, time of ART, food intake, side effects of ART, and how to manage side effects, and on how to manage drug-drug or drug-food interactions. Patients were followed for 1 year, and ART adherence was assessed based on clinical and laboratory evaluation and reported side effects. Patients were divided into two groups, group I (counselled group) who received ART adherence counselling by a pharmacist and group II (non-counselled group) who received their drugs only without counselling. Data was entered in Excel spreadsheets, and analysis was performed using SPSS version 24. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Input Text: Non-invasive Brain Stimulation and Injury Risk Biomechanics

Study Overview
-----------------
Detailed Description
-----------------
The overall goal of the project is to determine how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (theta burst stimulation) influences movement among individuals with and without a concussion history. The purpose of this study is prevention via improving injury risk biomechanics to reduce the risk of future musculoskeletal injury. Participants will complete 2 testing sessions separated by a minimum of 7 days. During the first testing session, participants will complete single-task serial subtraction, single- and dual-task jump landing, and a theta burst stimulation intervention. The jump landing will be completed before and after theta burst stimulation and under single- and dual-task (serial 7s) conditions. During the second testing session, participants will complete the jump landing before and after theta burst stimulation under single- and dual-task (serial 7s) conditions. On both testing sessions, the symptom checklist and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia 11 (TSK-11) will be administered upon arrival to the lab (after informed consent on day 1), and immediately after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The Godin Leisure Activity Questionaire will be administered on both days before the jump landing. The NASA Task Load index will be administered on both days immediately after the completion of every cognitive and motor task. At the end of the second day of testing, the participants will be asked which day the participants received the true (experimental) and control (placebo) theta burst stimulation intervention. This is a single-blinded cross-over design study. The participants will be unaware of when the participants receive the true (experimental) and control (vertex) theta burst stimulation intervention. Experimental (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and control (vertex) conditions will be counterbalanced for the concussion history group. The control group will be matched to their respective concussion history group counterpart's counterbalanced order.

 <EOD> Degradation and stabilization in the physiological states of man.
For a long time degradation and stabilization have enjoyed a somewhat dichotomous existence in medical circles, with the former relegated to the scrap heap and the latter crowned with academic honours. This contrast between the social and the academic, or perhaps between the practical and the theoretical, is not so much surprising as it is regrettable, for in many respects the physiological processes of degradation and stabilization, with their myriad consequences, have been the bedrock upon which contemporary medicine is founded. Yet, unfortunately, they are so often considered by health science practitioners to be something of a second class citizen--a conceptual anomaly that has permeated, to a considerable degree, the whole structure of biological medicine. The time has surely come for this dichotomy to be erased: not from our consciousness but from our medical vocabulary. We owe it to our patients. <EOD> Exophytic hepatocellular carcinoma mimicking gastric submucosal tumor: a case report

Background: To describe the differential diagnostic challenges of exophytic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mimicking gastric submucosal tumor (SMT). Case presentation: A 67-year-old Chinese man presented with dizziness. Gastroscopy revealed a gastric submucosal tumor with the surface of the tumor being erosion and ulceration accompanied by active hemorrhage. The endoscopic ultrasound examination indicated the mass was originated from the submucosa and the gastric wall, and color Doppler imaging showed the color flow signals in the stromal lamina were weak, which was consistent with the characteristics of high-risk areas of gastrointestinal submucosal hemorrhage. Consequently, combined with the history of hepatitis, the patient was diagnosed with HCC. After admission, the blood test indicated the patient had elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level (α-FP) and no other significant abnormal indexes, suggesting liver cancer. Then, he underwent gastric cardia hemostasis by endoscopy, and gastroscopy indicated that the surface of the submucosal mass was active hemorrhage and ulcer formation. However, it was difficult to determine whether the gastric epithelium invading was cancerous or gastric ulcer based on the results of pathological and immunohistochemistry examination. After admission, the blood test indicated the patient had elevated serum α-FP level and no other significant abnormal indexes, suggesting liver cancer. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IIa of hepatocellular carcinoma, which was managed with transarterial chemoembolization and followed-up for 6 months, and no evidence of recurrence was noticed. Conclusion: Exophytic HCC with no obvious imaging features mimicking gastric SMT is a critical condition. Combined with clinical history, endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound and tumor markers is helpful to distinguish lesions before surgery.

# Background
Gastric submucosal tumor (SMT) is a frequent incidental finding in gastroscopy. The majority are benign, while a minority are malignant tumors. Exophytic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is defined as HCC arises exclusively above the liver surface and protrudes into the gastrointestinal tract. Here we report an unusual and challenging case diagnosed as HCC mimicking gastric SMT based on the examination of endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, pathological and immunohistochemistry.

 <EOD> Diagnostic value of contrast echocardiography in patients with prosthetic valve thrombosis.
BACKGROUND
Accurate echocardiographic diagnosis of prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) and identification of a large thrombus in the left atrial appendage (LAA) or left atrium (LA) still remains a diagnostic challenge in some patients. In the current study, we sought to improve the diagnostic value of contrast echocardiography in this context.


METHODS
Between 2011 and 2013, 30 patients with a suspicion of PVT based on a transthoracic or transesophageal (TEE) echocardiographic examination were referred to our study. Color Doppler was performed at rest first. Translation index of aortic valve thrombus during diastole was measured. Definitions were set to diagnose PVT based on TEE data. Echocardiography was then continued using Levovist injection during the cardiac cycle. Images of the cardiac structures were then evaluated. Images of the aortic valve leaflets and cusps were analyzed at peak ventriculo-aortic valve flow and aortic diastole using color Doppler and power Doppler. The ratio of the aortic to ventricular flow velocities was calculated as an average of three consecutive cycles.


RESULTS
In six patients, PVT was diagnosed based on the Doppler studies (including Doppler color), and this was confirmed by surgical data (n=3) or pathology (n=1). A ratio of > 1.6 of average of three consecutive cardiac cycles (p  2.0 at diastole and > 300 cm(2) LAA thrombus load were predictive factors of PVT based on a multivariate analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
According to the current study findings, Doppler examination, including contrast, provides additional information for evaluation of patients with PVT compared with the color Doppler examination solely. <EOD> BMP-2 induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition and endows colorectal cancer cells with invasive ability

Background: Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is a secreted growth factor with a wide variety of biological functions, including regulation of bone development and tissue repair, and differentiation of somatic cells into chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and adipocytes. Increasing reports suggest that BMP-2 plays an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Here, we report that BMP-2 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and endows colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with an invasive phenotype. Methods: Expression of BMP-2 was analyzed with real time-quantitative PCR and Western blotting in 25 pairs of human CRC tissues and matched normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect BMP-2 expression levels in tissue microarrays of 108 paraffin-embedded CRC tissues, and its correlation with clinicopathological features was analyzed. A co-immunoprecipitation assay was employed to investigate the interaction between Smad 1/5/8 and Smad 2. Transfection of a vector encoding a BMP-2 short hairpin RNA (BMP-2 sh-RNA) into HCT 116 and SW480 CRC cells significantly reduced intracellular production of BMP-2 compared with the control group. After transfection, cellular function assays (e.g., colony formation, CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, and Transwell invasion assay) were performed to investigate the impact of BMP-2 down-regulation on its biological effects. EMT-related markers were investigated by Western blotting. Results: IHC results showed that the positive rates of BMP-2 expression in human CRC were significantly higher"

Aims and main hypotheses

Study title:
A Comparison of Acute Psychobiological Responses to Laboratory Stress Tests

Study Hypotheses: 
Hypothesis 1: Stress induced HPA axis response will be greater in the MMST group compared to the TSST group
Hypothesis 2: Stress induced SNS response will be greater in the MMST group compared to the TSST group
Hypothesis 3: Stressinduced SNS and HPA axis hyperactivity will be greatest in individuals with high trait anxiety
Hypothesis 4: Tendler et al hypothesized that the TSST will invoke a greater HPA response in females; therefore, females were purposefully oversampled in this study

Hypothesis 1 was supported, as demonstrated by the greater levels of salivary cortisol after the MMST compared to the TSST.
The other hypotheses are as yet unclear.

Background and Significance:
The laboratory is a safe space created by the experimenter to elicit the stress response and understand how it can be modified and controlled. Laboratory stress tests provide researchers with the unique opportunity to study the neural correlates and physical impacts stress can have on participants. Therefore, the understanding of how to reduce the physiological and behavioural responses and ultimately the associated risk to our health is a valuable outcome of laboratory studies.

The laboratory-stress test paradigms can be divided into two approaches. A social stress paradigm, which utilizes a socially stressful situation, and a physical stress paradigm, which utilizes a physical stressful situation (e.g., physically demanding exercise). There are many differences in the two paradigms, such as stress intensity. Both the TSST and the MMST are considered social stressors, however the TSST has been shown to induce a greater increase in salivary cortisol and the MMST demonstrated greater sympath"

 <EOD> Cognitive functioning in young patients with schizophrenia and their siblings
Abstract Objectives. Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is present even in first‐episode patients, and some patients with psychosis have premorbid subthreshold symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine cognitive functioning in first‐episode patients with schizophrenia, their siblings and a normal control group. This study compared cognitive functioning in first‐episode patients with schizophrenia, their siblings, a control group of a college/university population, and a group of patients with major depressive disorder. Methods. Cognitive functioning was assessed with neuropsychological tests in 55 patients with schizophrenia, 41 siblings and 59 healthy controls. The patients had a duration of illness of <5 years. Fifty‐four patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, who were medicated for the full period of the study protocol, were the contrast group. Results. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly poorer performance than the first‐degree siblings and the controls, and also those with major depression had significantly poorer performance compared to siblings. Siblings had significantly poorer performance than controls in psychomotor speed, delayed recall, verbal and visuospatial working memory, attention, perception and problem‐solving. Furthermore, within the patient group, the patients who had an earlier onset age of disease had poorer performance than those whose onset age was older. Conclusion. Patients with schizophrenia, their siblings and patients with major depressive disorder all showed cognitive impairments. Within the patient group, duration of illness duration was found to be associated with impaired cognitive functioning. <EOD> Preference for low-calorie versus high-calorie drinks on mood: A within-subjects placebo-controlled trial.
In order to maintain body weight/shape, it is recommended to avoid beverage consumption. This advice is difficult to follow since an effective beverage on mood has yet to be found. The present study is based on the ""liking"" and ""wanting"" motivational dimensions of craving. Participants consumed a low- versus a commercially available high-calorie beverage in a single and counterbalanced session in order to assess liking, wanting, and mood. Twenty-seven female participants consumed three 250 ml bottles of a commercial high-calorie (n = 14) and low-calorie (n = 13) beverage, each separated by 20 min and the respective taste intensity matched (n = 27). A rating scale was used to assess both beverages preference, wanting and mood every 5 min over 30 min during the beverages consumption. Low-calorie beverage was liked (p = 0.024), and a greater desire to drink it was reported to consumers in comparison with the high-calorie beverage (p = 0.020).

 <EOD> A Review of the Potential Application of Bacterial Diversity and Biotic Interactions for Developing Sustainable Soil Fertility Management Strategies

Soil microorganisms are key for ecosystem functioning and crop growth since they contribute to soil fertility and plant health. As such, they represent promising targets for fertilization strategies aimed at achieving sustainable agriculture as well as crop production under climate change. Here, we first illustrate how the structure of bacterial communities is shaped according to soil management practices and nutrient availability. Second, we synthetize the interactions involved between plant species and soil microorganisms and highlight the potential of soil biological communities as biological control agents towards pests and pathogens. Third, we point out the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship since microbial groups show different growth rates according to taxonomic level. Finally, we synthetize our knowledge of bipartite food webs and their interactions to present biotic networks as an emerging tool to assess complex interactions within agro-ecosystems.

# Introduction
Agricultural soils harbor a vast range of organisms. Soil is the largest terrestrial biome and holds around three times, in dry weight, the biomass of the aboveground portion of vegetation   Soil organic carbon and its stability: Theoretical aspects *, Wiesmeier  . Soil microbial communities are important for ecosystem functioning and plant growth in many ways since they contribute to soil fertility, nutrient cycles, ecosystem productivity and plant root colonization by nutritional and physical mechanisms. Microbially derived inputs such as carbon source, nutrition, and plant hormones are vital for the development, stress tolerance, growth, reproduction, and survival of crop and beneficial microorganisms and soil animals. These interactions between soil microorganisms and plants are critical for fertilization strategies aimed at achieving Sustainable Agriculture and Crop production   Soil biology for the 21st century-a review, Bower  .

It is then urgent to implement management strategies favoring plant growth and health, such as soil microbial diversity management, to sustain yield as well as to reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture by promoting the efficiency of the agrosystem. Moreover, sustainable soil fertility management requires that management systems be robust under a variety of perturbations, including climate change.
Plants and microorganisms often interact within the soil   Microbially mediated plant functional traits, Fries     Plant species and soil type cooperatively shape the structure and function of..., Berg   and several types of interactions have been reported between these two groups [see overview in   Microbe-mediated plant traits are key to understanding soil communities and their functions, Schweitzer   ]. Here, we aim to provide a synopsis of the mechanisms that occur between soil microorganisms and plants and explain how these interactions are relevant for our understanding of ecosystem functioning in agricultural systems.

## Soil microbial communities
Plants and the soil are interlinked through their microbiomes: plants influence soil microbial diversity and activity by exudates (see Box 1), and soil microscopic fungi, particularly Glomeromycota, shape plant mycorrhizal associations   Molecular evidence for the ancient origin of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, Strullu-Derrien  .

 <EOD> Puerarin ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis by promoting M2 macrophage differentiation via activation of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and incurable pulmonary disorder. Puerarin has been shown to be a potent anti‐inflammatory and anti‐fibrosis drug; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study is set out to determine the regulatory role of puerarin in pulmonary fibrosis and explore the potential molecular mechanisms. Histopathological staining and lung collagen content assays were performed to evaluate the effects of puerarin on pulmonary fibrosis. Meanwhile, to further understand the mechanism of puerarin improving pulmonary fibrosis, macrophage polarization, levels of serum inflammatory factors, and pro‐/anti‐inflammatory gene expression in lung tissues were detected. Our results showed that puerarin mitigated bleomycin (BLM)‐induced pulmonary fibrosis, alleviated histopathological changes in lungs and suppressed the deposition of lung collagen content. Puerarin reduced the total number of macrophages, enhanced the M2 phenotype marker expression and weakened the M1 phenotype marker expression while increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha (PPAR‐α) pathway‐related protein expression. Meanwhile, puerarin decreased the level of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‐α), and increasing TGF‐β content in both serum and lung tissue. Importantly, puerarin reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NF‐κB, and activated PPAR‐α. However, the PPAR‐α inhibitor GW6471 blocked the anti‐inflammatory and anti‐fibrotic roles of puerarin, while the overexpression of PPAR‐α activated GSK‐3β. The level of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p‐GSK‐3β) was increased while the p‐GSK‐3β level was decreased when PPAR‐α was inhibited and activated. These results suggested that puerarin might ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis by promoting M2 macrophage differentiation, and this might involve the PPAR‐α‐GSK‐3β axis. <EOD> Effects of treadmill-walked exercise and voluntary swimming on biochemical and physiological indices including stress hormones of dairy cow.
The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of treadmill-walked exercise and voluntary swimming (VS) on serum cortisol (CORT), glucose (GLU), cholesterol (CH), triglyceride (TG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 in bloodstream and milk of dairy cow. This study was conducted on 30 lactating Sahel cows during April. The animals in exercise group (EXG) were walked on treadmill for 45 min every day, 6 days of a week. The voluntary swimming group (VSG) consisted of thirty lactating Sahel cows. In this group, each animal was swimming for about 5 min every day and the period was increased steadily. Swimming pool was 3 times the height and width of cows. After finishing swimming, the cows was transferred to a cage to rest; the interval between swimming and resting periods in all experiments was 12 h. Blood and milk collection were performed at the beginning and the end of the study. Serum GLU, CH, GLU, TG, MDA and CORT and milk LDH, TG, CORT, LDH activities, and the concentrations of MDA and HSP 70were measured and recorded. The results showed that all parameters except LDH in blood"

 <EOD> Sphingosine 1-Phosphate and Its Potential Utility as an Immunomodulatory Agent in Lung Transplantation
Lung transplantation is limited by graft rejection, infection, and chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD). While the mechanisms of allograft rejection and infection are well described, the cause and pathogenesis of CAD remain unclear. Because recent advances in lung transplantation have increased the lifespan of this procedure, new therapeutic modalities are needed to reduce rejection and CAD related death. The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in the pathobiology of lung transplantation and to explore its potential as a novel immunomodulatory agent. In both animal models of lung rejection and in explanted lungs, S1P and S1P receptor agonists decrease allograft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans, and CAD. S1P and its analogs offer promise as antirejection, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic agents. These findings warrant further exploration and the development of therapeutic agents that mimic S1P actions in lung transplant patients. <EOD> Changes in N-glycans in human milk from before to 6 month of lactation

Background Human milk is a complex biological fluid with a significant dynamic change of its major macromolecules as lactation progresses to support the infant's continuous growth and development. To gain insight in the effectiveness of human milk as functional food, we investigated the N-glycan profile in human milk samples from 24 Chinese mothers collected before and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after birth.Methods N-glycans were released from human milk samples by using peptide-Nglycosidase F (PNGase F) and analysed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry under high resolution and high accuracy (LC-HRMS) for identification and quantification of potential structural changes. The molecular structures of N-glycans released from human milk samples were elucidated based on the molecular mass using high resolution mass spectrometry to annotate the main structures. The relative abundance of the detected structures was characterised in samples obtained from different sampling time points and their evolutions analysed by LC-HRMS quantification.ResultsThere was an overall increase of relative abundance of high-mannose type N-glycans, decreased relative abundance of high-mannose hybrids and low-mannose hybrids, an increase of relative abundance of complex-type N-glycans, and decrease of that of high-fucosylation N-glycans as lactation progressed. For N-glycans detected in human milk throughout the first 6 months of lactation, those with the most significant change included mono-and biosialylated complex and"

Input Text: Testing the Interplay of Gambling, Emotion and Reward

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Background Gambling addiction has often been conceptualized as the result of reward processing dysfunction in the brain, particularly in the striatum, a key structure of the reward system. Although a number of studies have provided support for this hypothesis, neuroimaging studies have produced inconsistent results, suggesting either hypo- or hyper-reactivity to rewards in gambling addiction. These inconsistencies have been the subject of intense debate, but remain unexplained to this day, hampering our understanding of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction. Objectives Primary objective: This project will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional, respectively. Secondary objective: This project will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers. Study design The primary hypothesis will be tested using cognitive tasks performed by participants in an fMRI scanner. In order to assess striatal reactivity to reward, the investigators will use fMRI combined with a reward task. The investigators will use fMRI combined with a facial emotion recognition task to measure the reactivity of the amygdala to emotional stimuli. These tasks will allow the investigators to establish the brain phenotypes characterizing impulsive and emotional gamblers, and test the hypothesis that these phenotypes are diametrically opposed in these two sub-populations. The secondary hypothesis will be tested by combining fMRI measures with behavioral measures from everyday life (EMA). In concrete terms, gamblers will be followed longitudinally for up to 4 weeks, and will receive short questionnaires 3 to 4 times a day on their smartphones to assess their gambling behavior (number of hours spent gambling, amount of money spent...) as well as their emotions (positive and negative). These measurements will enable the investigators to test the hypothesis that the brain phenotypes described above are capable of predicting the relationship between emotions and gambling behavior in everyday life. Study population This study will focus on individuals with gambling problems. This category includes individuals suffering from gambling addiction as defined by the DSM-5, and individuals suffering from problem gambling, just below the DSM-5 diagnostic threshold. Extending recruitment to individuals with problem gambling should facilitate recruitment, while taking into account that there is a continuum of gambling problems.

We propose a new analytical method for the analytical calculation of electrorotation spectra and membrane currents induced by a uniform electric field applied perpendicular to the electric axis of the cell. We show that this method can be used to obtain simple analytical results compared to numerical modeling, which otherwise should be used to obtain reliable electrokinetic results.

Ascititc fluid prolactin is high significantly in pregnants with cholelithiasis (p less than 0.025) as well as ascititc fluid oestriols in cirrhotics (p less than 0.0001) than those in pregnants with abdominal ascites. <EOD> High Frequency of De Novo Dysplasia After Allogeneic CD34+ Cell Transplantation for Advanced Malignant Lymphoma: Impact on Infertility
To the Editor: The risk of recurrence or second neoplasm is a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We report a patient who received allogeneic CD34+ cell transplantation for malignant lymphoma; he became azoospermic and had de novo gonadal dysplasia after transplantation. A 21-year-old man with malignant lymphoma underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplant at the age of 24. He developed a second neoplasm, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), in the thigh 27 months after the first surgery. He was treated with chemotherapy and, 6 months later, his lymphoma regressed. He underwent autologous blood stem cell transplantation for malignant lymphoma when he was 30 years old. When he was 33 years old, the same dose of the second line chemotherapy was performed for recurrent lymphoma. He was azoospermic 3 months before transplantation and the first round infection monitoring tests  revealed he was completely negative for infectious agents including syphilis, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology, and the second round monitoring showed the same results, therefore, he underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The donor was HLA 11 mismatched, a 36-year-old, male healthy volunteer. The patient’s serum HBV, HCV, HIV-1, HIV-2, and syphilis antibody tests were found to be negative, although the chest X-ray and electrocardiogram tests showed negative results. A high-dose of 14.06 gray (Gy) total body irradiation (TBI) was administered for myeloablation and an additional dose of 1.54 Gy was added to the head and the total dose was set at 15.6 Gy. The conditioning regimen was tacrolimus, methotrexate, and anti-thymocyte globulin. Thereafter, the immune suppression therapy was converted to tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil combination from day 10. The white blood cell (WBC) count was 1.4 109/ L on day 9, 0.9 109/L on day 11, and 0.5 109/L on day 14.

### Introduction
Huaier granule is a classical traditional Chinese medicine approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for cancer patients. The clinical trials have been conducted for patients with ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma . Moreover, in a study reported by , Huaier granule was also proved to improve the quality of life in Stage III/IV breast cancer patients. In view of the lack of effective treatment for stage I ovarian cancer patients, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer patients after surgery, we plan to carry out a pilot clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Huaier granule as an adjuvant treatment for such patients. (The trial protocol has been reviewed by the expert committee of Guangzhou institute of oncology and has been accepted )

### Questions of interest
The results of this study could answer the following questions:

### Primary question

### Exploratory questions
What are the biomarkers associated with Huaier granule as an adjuvant treatment for stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer patients after surgery?
What are the gene levels in plasma from patients with stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer and healthy women before and after 4 weeks of Huaier granule treatment?
In patients with stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer, is the level of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) different upon Huaier granule treatment?
Does Huaier granule reduce the symptoms of patients with stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer after surgery?

Rationale

### Rationale

Stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer is a malignant tumor originating in the ovary or peritoneum of the female reproductive organs and can be spread to other parts of the body via metastasis or direct invasion. The high incidence of recurrence causes heavy harm to the patients and results in a low quality of life for the patients. In recent years, many studies of adjuvant therapy for stage I ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer have tried to lower the morbidity and mortality of patients with the surgery alone. After surgery, all patients with stage I ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer have undergone cytoreductive surgery and cytoreductive surgery + peritoneal chemotherapy. However, the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer is still poor, and there is still no effective therapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines indicate that ovarian cancer patients need to undergo regular examination every 3 months for 2 years after the diagnosis as a part of the follow-up.

### History of Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment for stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer
Many Chinese medical physicians and scholars have proposed many methods of treating stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer, such as Huai ER granule , Longdan Xiegan Tang, Sijunzi decoction, and Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu decoction. And in order to improve the recurrence rate and survival rate and quality of life of patients, these treatments have been carried out with the treatment of stage I ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer. The research results show that Huaier granule as adjuvant treatment for the treatment of stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer can effectively increase the recurrence rate and prolong the life time of patients.

### Literature review
We searched for clinical studies in clinical trial registries such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, as well as the China biomedical literature database"

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate whether exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is present following exercise in patient after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and if so, if it changes with exercise intensity. Methods : A repeated measures and single-blinded randomized study were done. Thirty-eight patients 24 hours after TKA were randomly assigned to either low intensity exercises (LIE) group or high intensity exercises (HIE) group. An exercise programs lasted for five days during the hospitalization period. Pain severity was assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 mm). Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured over quadriceps and biceps brachii and muscles immediately before and after exercise.

Maximum exudate production occurs 24-48 hours after the burn, and falls thereafter. 2. Exudate volume does not seem to be influenced by diet, but, instead, by variations in the protein content of the exudate. 3. Administration of antibiotics in prophylactic dosage does not influence the volume of exudate. <EOD> Immunohistochemical expression of T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis inducing factor (TRIM/MIC) in malignant lymphomas.
OBJECTIVE
T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis inducing factor (TRIM/MIC), one of the metastasis-associated antigens, has a possible role in the progression of malignancy. This study was performed to evaluate the correlation of TRIM/MIC with lymph node (LN) metastasis in various categories of malignant lymphomas.


METHODS
Fifty-one cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 3 cases of Hodgkin disease (HD) were examined immunohistochemically for TRIM/MIC. Each of the cases had been classified according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The expression of TRIM/MIC was scored semiquantitatively on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 3.


RESULTS
TRIM/MIC had a higher expression in NHL than in HD (p < 0.5) and its expression was higher in cases with LN metastasis than in cases without LN metastasis. The expression of TRIM/MIC was also higher in the follicle center and diffuse large cell types of NHL than in other categories of NHL (p < 0.05) and its expression was closely linked with LN metastasis in NHL. The pattern of immunostaining was diffuse but with a granular or diffuse cytoplasmic staining.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that TRIM/MIC may have a possible role in LN metastasis of malignant lymphoma through the disruption and the migration of various tumor cells. <EOD> Is there a role for chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer?
Chemotherapy has traditionally played a major role in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. At present, however, the role of chemotherapy is confined to treatment of metastatic (stage IV) epithelial ovarian cancer and for patients with suboptimal surgical debulking. Although optimal debulking (residual disease < or =20%) is associated with better prognosis than suboptimal debulking (>20% residual disease, 5-year survival 44.6% versus 19.8%) (Darcy et al. J Clin Oncol 2000;18:2168–76), this is often only achieved by extensive surgery. In the absence of randomized data, various retrospective multicenter studies have compared outcome of patients who were suboptimally debulked. The results have not revealed consistent benefits in disease-free survival or overall survival with platinum-based multidrug chemotherapy. The same outcome can be observed in patients who were optimally debulked. Prospective trials have shown a significant survival benefit with the use of platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum-based treatment vs. non–platinum-based treatment: 2-year survival 30%–65% vs. 0%–50%) (Vassilakos et al. Obstet Gynecol 1989;73:868–74; Schorge et al. Gynecol Oncol 1990;39:16–20; Petrelli et al. Gynecol Oncol 1990;41:1–4), however, in the majority of these studies only suboptimal debulking patients were included. In the metastatic setting, several phase II trials with various subst"

353,"[/INST] Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is emerging as the greatest risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), associated with a two-to three-fold risk increase in CKD incidence. It is also associated with an accelerated progression of CKD due to a number of factors. Magnesium deficiency or hypomagnesemia is considered a risk factor for diabetes and may contribute to the development of T2D. The authors aimed to investigate serum magnesium levels in patients with T2DM from 100 patients. The results of the study revealed that serum magnesium levels were significantly lower in cases than in controls, and they concluded that low magnesium levels should be considered and evaluated thoroughly in serum of patients at risk of T2DM because low magnesium is a potential risk factor that may contribute to the development of T2DM.

 <EOD> Characteristics and Outcomes of Cancer Patients with Hemorrhagic Intracranial Metastases
Purpose: A small fraction of cancer patients experience intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) as a result of intracerebral metastases, and these patients are often not considered candidates for aggressive anti-tumor treatment. Methods: The clinical characteristics, ICH characteristics, and outcomes (OS and disease-specific survival ) of the 138 patients, including 96 melanoma patients and 42 nonmelanoma patients, who were treated with antineoplastic agents (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or intracerebral radiation) within 2 weeks before intracerebral ICH were retrospectively analyzed. All 25 melanoma patients and 10 non-melanoma patients treated under compassionate-use programs with intracerebral talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) were also evaluated. Results: The most common intracerebral metastases presentations were hemorrhage (62%) and mass effect (42%). Melanoma patients with hemorrhagic metastases on average had lower LDH and higher KPS and MSH scores/ratios than nonmelanoma patients. Tumor pathology, LDH, KPS and MSH scores, CSF, and antineoplastic agents did not predict OS. In melanoma patients, KPS, MSH scores, CSF, and tumor pathology did not predict DSS, but hemorrhagic presentations predicted improved DSS (p = 0.04). Intracerebral anti-PD1/PDL1 agents did not predict OS or DSS, but intracerebral radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy predicted improved DSS (p = 0.03, p = 0.008, and p = 0.038, respectively). T-VEC predicted improved OS (p = 0.017) and DSS (p = 0.006) but not ICH recurrence rate (10% vs. 6%). Conclusion: Patient characteristics, especially tumor pathology, did not predict melanoma patient OS. Antineoplastic agents predicted improved DSS in melanoma. CSF tumor burden did not predict OS but did predict DSS. Hemorrhagic presentations of metastases predicted improved DSS in melanoma patients but not OS. <EOD> .

# Introduction

In elderlies, low muscle mass and strength are characterized as sarcopenia, causing decline in muscle function, which lead to physical disability and increasing risk of falls. However, the pathogenesis of sarcopenia is not well known. Many researchers focus on the relation of serum IGF-1 and IL-6 with sarcopenia. [A]

# Background & aims

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect and safety of Ophiochepalus striatus extract on serum IGF-1 and IL-6, muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in elderly patients with sarcopenia. [B]

# Methods
This was a parallel-group, randomized active controlled trial.

## Population
Sixty-six elderlies with sarcopenia, assessed using the criteria of AWGS, were recruited. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to active drug or placebo.

## Intervention
Either 2×5 g Ophiochepalus striatus extract (active group, 240 participants ) or placebo (22 participants) once daily was given orally for 14 days with follow-up visits on day 8 and day 14. [C]

# Results

## Pharmacology
The active dosage of 2×5 g Ophiochepalus striatus extract contains 985mg of Albukang protein, 93mg of IGF-1 and 210µg of zinc. 

## IGF-1 and il-6 changes
At follow up visit on day 8 and day 14, serum IGF-1 level was increased significantly in the active group
(0.949±1.182 vs 10.366±11.434 and 0.159±0.171 vs 4.859±3.613, respectively) (p<0.001).
There were no significant changes in IL-6 levels.

## Muscle mass and strength changes
After administration of Ophiochepalus striatus extract, there were no significant changes in ALM (kg) and ASMI (%). However, there was a small increase in muscle strength of the leg (17.555±3.632 vs 18.143±3.986, p<0.05), which is still considered as clinically insignificant.

## Physical performance
There was no significant changes in Timed Up & Go (TUG) score (-2.40±8.00 vs -3.14±11.88, p>0.05); however, it was still clinically significant result.

# Introduction
The human mitochondrial genome is divided into heavy and light strands; the first encodes 13 proteins and the second encodes two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). There are 37 genes, which code for essential functions, including complex I of the oxidative phosphorylation system, in the mitochondrial genome. Some of these genes are also located in the nuclear genome. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has some important characteristics, including its maternal transmission, that make it useful for resolving paternal relationships. Paternity testing using mtDNA polymorphism relies on the variation of a set of highly polymorphic regions of the mtDNA, so-called hypervariable regions (HVRs). These loci may differ significantly in length, mutation rates, and number of variations across species but share properties in terms of mutation and polymorphism rates.
Mitochondria participate in many vital biochemical processes and are involved with cellular respiration, biosynthesis of macromolecules, and energy metabolism; therefore, any alteration in mitochondria may lead to damage. mtDNA evolves under a specific mode relative to the nuclear genome, i.e., mtDNA is characterized by its rapid evolutionary rate and maternal mode of inheritance. The mtDNA diversity in populations can be characterized by calculating genetic indices, measuring genetic variation, and calculating genealogical characteristics. The evolution of sequences is related to the rate, and the accumulated sequence variations can be measured using the average pairwise difference (APD). The use of APD values may reveal genetic differentiation and evolutionary history more completely than the use of simple sequence length variation (SVL) or nucleotide diversity (π) values. A high level of genetic diversity is found for many Drosophila species in certain chromosomal regions of the mtDNA. A high genetic differentiation may appear from neutral gene diversity caused by DNA demographic history with low gene flow. In addition, the mitochondrial recombination rate and asymmetric mating system (or inbreeding level) may influence mtDNA genetic variation. The evolutionary history of mtDNA haplotypes reflects the historical migratory movement of the populations.
Drosophila melanogaster is a very important laboratory model; it has a worldwide distribution, has adaptive evolution to different conditions, is easy to rear in the laboratory, and provides several methods for manipulating its genome. Therefore, this species is used as a model for ecological and evolutionary studies and for testing genetic variants in humans.
We selected two short mtDNA regions: 1030-782 (CoxI) and 7866-24 (CytB), and we analyzed the 396-bp region between them (CoxI_III region) using 695 sequences from the NCBI Nucleotide dataset. We analyzed the sequences for variation on the nucleotides according to the geographical origins of the populations, and then, we analyzed the genetic differentiation of these populations. Finally, we evaluated the evolutionary relationship between the populations by constructing a phylogeographic network based on these sequences. The analysis of the sequences showed a low level of genetic variation among these populations and provided useful information for studying the origin and evolution of this species.

# Study Discussion

[/INST] FloRIN procedure has been performed by a surgical team from Italy.
The FloRIN represents a single staged surgery to treat patients with Non-Metastatic Bladder Cancer with eligibility for ileal neobladder and the first attempt to evaluate stentless neobladder procedure.
The FloRIN procedure is a procedure to replace the Bladder with an Intracorporeal Neobladder configuration in patients with Bladder Cancer.
Intra Corporeal Neobladders (e.g. UCLA neobladder): the neobladder is intra operatively fashioned from the bowel segment(s): the segment(s) which will replace the patient’s bladder. They all differ in shape, size, wall thickness, neck configuration, wall configuration, and ureteral reimplantation strategy but all are continent procedures with low postoperative complication rates.
The FloRIN procedure has been performed in Italy by a surgical team from Italy.
This procedure is a single stage surgery to treat patients with Non-Metastatic Bladder Cancer with eligibility for ileal neobladder, whereby, after intestinal resectioning, one or two isoperistaltic bowel segment(s) are cut and folded towards each other with sutures to reconstitute the urethraneobladder junction.
[/INST] Stentless technique has been performed by a surgical team from Italy.
The FloRIN without mono J procedure has been conducted by a surgical team from Italy.
This technique consists in the same surgical steps of stented procedure with some adaptations:
 the intestinal continuity reconstructions was performed with mucosa-to-mucosa sutured anastomosis in stented group and non-reversed end-toside suture anastomosis (in non-reversed intestinal continuity reconstruction) in stentless group
 the posterior plate was reconfigured as an Γ shape;
 the anterior plate was folded anteriorly, distally to proximally, roughly 5 cm right from the proximal edge of the posterior closure with mono J stents catheters

357,"[/INST] <EOD> Risk Assessment in Malignant Melanoma
In spite of significant progress of melanoma epidemiology and understanding, melanoma causes significant morbidity and mortality. According to the SEER database, the average 5-year survival for patients diagnosed with melanoma is 87%; however, 75% of melanoma deaths occur within the first year after diagnosis, suggesting that significant progress in melanoma diagnosis was realized long ago. Current diagnostic and treatment options, as well as the role of risk assessment, are reviewed in this article, and the value of risk groups as well as new risk assessment tools are discussed. Further, there is evidence that a number of melanoma risk factors, including chronic sun exposure, hereditary mutations, and family history, confer higher risk of second primaries. The risk of second primaries and their features are different according to family history and UV-related risk factors. An accurate assessment of the skin and the development of a practical cancer risk prediction tool may improve early detection and prevention, ultimately reducing overall cancer burden. <EOD> Examining the Effects of Concentric Versus Eccentric Training on Knee Biomechanics and Physiology: Clinical Reasoning
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Clinical and biomechanical research provides little consensus with respect to the optimal training protocol for exercise rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It is imperative to determine the effects of training protocol on knee biomechanics in order to optimize physiological responses (knee laxity, pain, strength, functional endurance) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction/repairs. The objective was to examine ankle, knee, and hip mechanics during strength training, and knee laxity in the sagittal plane during strength training.


METHODS
Ten ACLR subjects (7 males, 2 females; mean age, 18 years ; right dominant leg, 90%). Strength training was performed at 75% of 1 repetition maximum, and muscle activation was monitored with EMG. Strength testing was performed with concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) training, and knee laxity was assessed during concentric contraction in the sagittal plane.


RESULTS
Knee extension moment was higher during ECC than CON (p=.000). Ankle abduction moment showed greater magnitudes during CON than ECC (p = .002) and higher ankle moments were recorded for ECC than CON (p=.001).


DISCUSSION
As strength increased, the subjects were able to increase knee moments during CON and ECC training. Significantly larger ankle moments were created in the external rotation plane with CON, and larger ankle abduction moments were created in the internal rotation plane during ECC (p=.002), which may assist individuals after ACL injuries in controlling knee laxity in the sagittal plane during landing phases.


IMPACT
Knee extension and abduction moments were greater during ECC and CON, respectively, strength training at 75% of 1 repetition maximum intensity. The results provided better understanding of biomechanical changes associated with concentric and eccentric training methods at 75% of 1 rep maximum. <EOD> The PEPFAR era - 15 years of investment, impact, and promise.
The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) launched in 2003 when AIDS was an escalating crisis. The US government response led to dramatic increases in both the investment and the impact and to the development of a robust delivery system to support patients in low-resource countries. PEPFAR was instrumental in increasing HIV prevention and treatment services and in expanding a delivery network that includes a substantial public-private coalition to support global HIV prevention and treatment efforts. Today the program has become a platform for a series of new commitments to global health issues. This supplement to AIDS contains 13 articles that describe the success of the PEPFAR program and of the international community in terms of AIDS prevention, treatment, and treatment delivery systems, as well as the importance of adolescents and their role in HIV infection control. The program is evolving to maximize the health benefits of the investment in the treatment community and AIDS prevention while expanding new global health initiatives."

[/INST] <EOD> The Cytologic Diagnosis of Primary Pancreatic Lymphoma: Cases of Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma and Large B-Cell Lymphoma
Malignancies of the biliary tree or pancreas are rare, and lymphoma of the pancreas is very rare. We describe the clinicopathologic features of two cases of primary pancreatic lymphoma, and discuss the differential diagnosis, clinical features, and treatment of each type of lymphoma, with pathologic correlation. The first case is a 67-year-old man who presented with acute pancreatitis and had a diagnosis of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma by aspiration cytology. Although it is a rare tumor, the pancreas should be kept in mind as one of the possible sites of origin for MALT lymphoma. The second case is a 60-year-old woman who presented with a 1-year history of abdominal pain. With an aspiration cytodiagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma subtype, the patient underwent right hemicolectomy. We reviewed the literature and discuss the differential diagnosis of adenocarcinoma between MALT lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. <EOD> The effects of lithium iodidedefense of hepatocytes against hepatotoxicity in the rat.

# Author's Abstract

Study Purpose
-----------------
To determine if subpectoral injections of 0.25% bupivacaine provides better post operative pain control in patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty as compared to a sham control group receiving plain saline.



Interventions
-----------------
This was a parallel arm study consisting of a Control and a Bupivacaine group. Both groups had standard post-operative pain medication protocols set before the study as per the Institution Standards. There was no post operative pain medication that was given for the study, and no doses were changed based on study participation. Patients in the bupivacaine group had 20cc of 0.25% subpectoral bupivacaine (Marcaine) injected into the fascia of the Pecs major under direct vision upon completion of the procedure. Patients in the control group underwent subpectoral saline 20cc injections. Both groups underwent their procedure with their assigned intervention, and post-operative pain control was otherwise standardized with the anesthetic team. All pain scores and length of stay were collected at time of post-operative follow up 1 week after surgery in the plastic surgery clinic.


Outcomes
==========
Study success was determined based off of the pre-determined primary clinical aim. Pain scores for these patients were reported at their 1 week PACU visit and their 4 week follow up visit. Patients recorded a daily Pain score daily for 4 weeks. Patients were also given a log to record prescription narcotic pain medication they were taking. There was increased post operative pain control for the patients undergoing 20cc of subpectoral bupivacaine injections into the Pec Major muscle fascia.


Design
========
Subpectoral injections of 20cc of bupivacaine, a local anesthetic, were given to one cohort of patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty, and a sham control group had 20cc of saline injected. Standard post operative pain medication regimens were followed for all patients, as was our institution's standard surgery protocol. Subpectoral bupivacaine can provide better post operative pain control for patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty, and there was no difference in length of stay. Post operative narcotic use was decreased in patients given subpectoral bupivacaine..


Conclusion
============
Subpectoral injections of 20cc of bupivacaine provide greater post operative pain control than subpectoral injections of 20cc of saline in patients undergoing bilateral reduction mammaplasty. The use of a subpectoral bupivacaine block provides this extra pain control without increased length of stay or post operative narcotic use, and is a safe and successful means of improving post operative pain control when used along with our standard pain protocol  <EOD> Dual-Responsive DNA Probes Based on Hairpin and Tail for Ultrasensitive Bioanalysis.
Fluorescence-based DNA sensors have emerged as an attractive class of nanomaterials due to their excellent biocompatibility, facile functionalization, and adjustable structure. However, it is still a challenging to design DNA probes with highly specificity towards target and excellent performance in sensitivity detection. Herein, we developed a hairpin-based probe (HBP) and its tail (THP) to form an antisense pair (H-T hybridization) for fluorescent detection. This probe pair has three critical advantages over commonly used probes, i.e., (i) high affinity to target strands, (ii) easy surface immobilization, and (iii) dual signal outputs, including fluorescence (from the HBP stem) and color (from the THP stem) change upon binding with the target strands. As a proof-of-concept, we designed a DNA platform based on three DNA probes (H, H2, and H1),"

In the course of the last century new diseases appeared. These diseases occurred, as a rule, after exposure to chemicals and pollutants of various kinds. Most of the emergence of so-called ""new"" diseases was reported within a short time lag. It is unclear which of these new diseases and syndromes are man-made and which are biological phenomena. But many diseases which were already described in prehistory and in the medical literature of ancient Egypt, antiquity, Greco-Roman times or in the Middle Ages--are in connection with environmental pollution. For example, the ancient symptom of the ""stone poisoning"" of the liver may be connected with chlorine (PCP), the ancient symptom of ""marsh fever"" may be connected with mosquito breeding grounds, the ancient symptom of ""skin itching"" may be connected with fungicides, ""pesticide poisoning"" with organophosphorus compounds, ""malaria epidemic"" with oleander, ""the poison of Samburu"" and other syndromes with oil poisoning. Other ""old diseases"" described in pre- or early post-historical documents (e.g. the symptom of ""nuclear poisoning"") may be artificially induced under modern chemical and technological progress. <EOD> .
The authors present a case of bilateral adrenal myelolipomas of spontaneous occurrence in a 45-year-old female patient. The case demonstrates that the myelolipoma may be one of the causes of acute arterial hypertension. The myelolipomas have a significant frequency of malignant transformation which must be underlined in surgical indications in order to differentiate between the benign and malignant ones. <EOD> Evaluating the Clinical Improvement Associated With Anterior Insulated Shield Technology Knee Implant
Abstract The anterior insulated shield (AIS) knee implant was designed to reduce soft-tissue impingement caused by conventional anterior knee designs. Nine patients with AIS implants participated in this study to report their outcomes. Mean follow-up after implantation was 13 ± 6 months. The mean time from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears to surgery was 35 ± 23 months. Postoperative outcomes improved significantly when measured preoperatively and postoperatively. The improvement in pain with activity decreased significantly from a preoperative average pain level of 6.83/10 to a postoperative level of 1.21/10 on the visual analog scale. The Tegner score increased significantly from preoperatively (2.82/10) to postoperatively (4.25/10). The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score increased significantly from 46 preoperatively to 68 postoperatively (P < 0."

Detailed Summary:

This is a [Non-inferiourity Study] non-inferiority trial, which compared the treatment effect (clinical outcome) of the Generic and the Reference drugs. Subjects who were infertile and planning to undergo IVF/ICSI treatment and met all the study criteria were randomly assigned into the Generic or the Reference treatment group in a 1:1 ratio. The subject's menstrual cycle was monitored throughout the [Procedure]. When they became sensitive to the antagonist, a low antagonist/gonadotropin starting dose was administrated for [Duration] days. Antagonist was down-titrated by 0.5 mg/day in a flexible dosage schedule (maximally 0.25 mg), and antagonist dosage was adjusted daily by the investigators. Gonadotropin dosage was up-titrated by 25 IU until the [Mature Oocytes] leading follicles reached 20 mm in diameter. When follicles reached 20mm, antral follicles reached at least 6-8mm, and hCG (10000 IU) was intramuscularly (IM) administered 17 hours later, when all the follicles reached 20 mm or more. 36-40 hours after hCG administration, follicular aspiration was conducted by transvaginal ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration, and then oocytes were ICSI-injected immediately. All ICSI cycles were fresh embryo transfer and the clinical pregnancy outcome and live birth rate were recorded [Results].

Generic cetrorelix acetate vs reference cetrorelix acetate for ovarian stimulation using gonadotropin-releasing hormone（GnRH）antagonist protocol in women undergoing IVF：A multicenter non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial

Summary, conclusion and discussion is written in this section:

This trial was aimed to investigate the non-inferiority of generic cetrorelix acetate(1) as an innovator cetrorelix acetate for ovarian stimulation using GnRH antagonist. Based on the trial, we concluded that the Generic group was comparable to the Reference group in terms of clinical outcome.

(1) The clinical outcome of cetrorelix acetate group was comparable to that of the Reference group

The results suggested that the treatment effectiveness (clinical outcome) of the Generic and the Reference group was similar, and Generic and Reference groups showed similar safety in the Clinical trial.

The conclusion was based on the results of comparison as shown in   Table A: Detailed summary   , and discussion part was written as follows:

A clinical trial is a rigorous examination to check whether drugs are similar to innovative drugs and meet their efficacy and safety requirements. This trial met the efficacy requirements for Generic group based on the statistically similar live birth rate, and the safety requirements for Generic group based on the statistically similar incidence of adverse events to the Reference group. However, this trial did not meet the requirements for safety by comparing the pregnancy outcome. The pregnancy outcome of Generic group was worse than that of Reference group, the differences between the two groups were statistically significant, and the confidence intervals of the difference between the two groups in pregnancy outcome rate were relatively wide and the 95% confidence interval contained zero, which suggested the safety was not established. This suggested that the live birth rate could be an important indicator to evaluate the safety of drug, therefore, the generics must be able to produce similar live birth rate as the innovator drug.

The following conclusion can be made based on the statistical analysis results:

The study was designed to examine whether Generic group and Reference group had similar clinical efficacy and safety, and whether they met their efficacy and safety"

The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms increases with age. There is an increase in morbidity and mortality in these elderly subjects. Psychiatric illness in the elderly is often not diagnosed or treated. The general practitioner is the most suitable person to detect psychiatric problems in the elderly and to refer them early to the psychiatrist. Therefore, the Dutch Association for General Practitioners developed a guideline to treat patients in this age group. This guideline is based on relevant literature, the opinions of psychiatrists and psychogeriatrists and suggestions of members of the association. The general practitioner is the only source of attention for the psychiatric diseases of the elderly. Therefore he/she must be able to recognize the mental and behavioural problems of the elderly and to apply the principles of treatment. The guideline describes an evidence-based approach to the treatment of elderly patients with psychiatric symptoms. <EOD> A comparison between a modified intensive insulin therapy protocol and a fixed infusion insulin protocol using intravenous regular insulin in the critically ill patient.
OBJECTIVE
The effects on blood glucose control of a modified intensive insulin therapy protocol, designed to achieve good control of hyperglycemia, was compared with a fixed infusion insulin protocol using regular insulin to control hyperglycemia.


DESIGN
Randomized crossover design, with each patient receiving the two different insulin protocols, 5 days apart.


SETTING
A 32-bed intensive care unit of a 1350-bed county hospital.


PATIENTS
Twenty-two adults, 18 or older, who had had 2 consecutive blood glucose levels greater than 13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) and who had stayed in the intensive care unit for 48 hrs.


INTERVENTIONS
Patients were randomized to receive a hyperglycemic insulin protocol, which involved hourly blood glucose monitoring and a protocol for insulin infusion, or, as a control, to a protocol for fixed infusion of regular insulin to achieve normoglycemia. For the hyperglycemic insulin group, blood glucose was to be maintained at 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) if no previous diabetes history was present. If present, the level was to be 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL).


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Hourly blood glucose measurements, number or frequency of daily ""hypoglycemic"" episodes, amount of insulin administered as a percent of ""total bolus"" insulin administered and average times (hours) it took to reach desired blood glucose levels. Patients were divided into three age groups: 50 yrs or younger, 51-65 yrs and greater than 65 yrs of age.



RESULTS

The investigators are conducting a study to see if high dose cephalexin is more effective than Standard dose Cephalexin in reducing relapse of cellulitis, preventing the need for further antibiotics, or hospital admissions. This study will also look at cost effectiveness.

In this study, the participant will have to have a cellulitis diagnosed by the doctor who is seeing them. The doctor will then decide whether the study team can put you in the study.
This study is looking to enroll a total of 446 patients. Participants will be randomized to either the cephalexin high dose group or the cephalexin standard dose group.

Background: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is increasingly recommended in developing countries. However, there is limited evidence on its clinical benefits. This study was designed to determine if there is a protective effect associated with IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) against neonatal complications.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted among women attending postpartum visit at a hospital in a region of Maputo province, Mozambique, from July 2006 to December 2009. The incidence of malaria, adverse birth outcomes, and infant's health was analyzed.Results: Among this population of 800 women, there were: 9.6% of them attended postpartum visit early (within 2 months); the median age was 22 years old; 147 (18.4%) of participants had low birth weight (LBW); 167 (20.9%) had premature newborn (PBN) and only 2 (0.3%) had neonatal death. Anemia during pregnancy has been documented in 51.3% of 569 women. Neonates of mothers that had received IPTp with SP were healthier than others: LBW occurred in 15.4% in comparison to 20.6% among those who did not have this. The admission to the nursery because of respiratory difficulties occurred in 14.1% of neonates whose mothers did not receive IPTp with SP, compared with only 7.3% in the other group, thus showing a protective effect.Conclusions: The prevalence of LBW remained higher than recommended by the WHO. The use of IPTp with SP was associated with improved newborn health. There is a need for more effective prevention of malaria in pregnancy. This type of study may support the decision-makers on continuing to promote the use by pregnant women of IPTp as an important strategy for prevention in pregnancy.

# Background
In most developing countries, the main causes of morbidity and mortality are infectious and the most affected are children (under 5 years of age). Recent studies reported the decrease in mortality in children of 3690,000 in 1990 which represented 15% of all children mortality"

Seventy‐eight patients from the Mayo Clinic underwent total or subtotal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma (14) or leiomyosarcoma (64) of the esophagus. Mean follow‐up was 37 months. A 1‐year survival of 61 per cent was achieved. The long‐term survival in each group of patients with adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, and gastric leiomyosarcoma was 28 per cent, 17 per cent, and 75 per cent. It is concluded that resection of the stomach is required for patients whose tumors cannot be resected by simple en‐ucleation of the tumor. <EOD> .

The purpose of the work was to determine the cadmium concentrations in aquatic plants growing in selected reservoir. The cadmium concentrations in the plant samples were determined spectrophotometrically using a reaction with 5% (m/m) sodium dithionite sulphoacid, 96% acetic acid and then by sulphosalicylic acid. The samples were collected from the selected reservoir with regard to the distance from its shore and in the vicinity of a sewage treatment work. The cadmium concentrations in the samples taken from the reservoir with regard to the distance from the shore were as follows: algae 1.00 mg kg(-1), Salvinia natans and S. auriculata 0.94 mg kg(-1), S. molesta 0.78 mg kg(-1), Elodea canadensis 0.22 mg kg(-1), C. maritima 0.09 mg kg(-1), C. officinalis and Hydrilla verticillata 0.01 mg kg(-1), which is about 10-30fold less than that of the samples taken near the sewage treatment work. As for the rest of the plants, their cadmium concentrations were 34.535-77.48 mg kg(-1). <EOD> Pharmacological management of acromegaly

The study consisted of the clinical and bacteriological evaluation at 6 and 12 months in order to assess the amount and type of biofilm on zirconia and titanium dental implants and to determine the plaque index and the probing depth. In this sense, plaque was found to affect the amount of biofilm on implants placed in patients of both sexes (65-80 years old), with an overall plaque index higher than 60% and a probing depth of up to 2.0 mm. A sample size of 60 patients was determined, 30 per group, and randomization by block was used. The results obtained were statistically analysed through ANOVA and mixed ANOVA tests using the IBM® SPSS Statistics Version 28.0.1.1 software package.

 <EOD> Clinicopathologic evaluation of the impact of different immunosuppression protocols on chronic renal allograft rejection.
BACKGROUND
Chronic allograft rejection is one of the causes of graft failure, which can lead to rejection of kidney transplants. It is difficult to diagnose as a result of the absence of a definitive diagnostic test. We aimed to compare immune graft histopathological characteristics in grafts that have developed to the chronic rejection stage with those that have not.


METHODS
Between January 2010 and December 2015, 143 grafts were included in chronic rejection cases. All of the pathology specimens were examined for lymphocytic microinfiltrations, arterial inflammation and fibrous intimal thickening. These clinical pathologic variables were also compared with the biopsy and clinical follow-up data for 155 kidney recipients (control group), 2 in each case. Data were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics software (Version 17.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA). The Fisher's exact test was used to compare the qualitative variables. To compare the quantitative variables, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric test was employed. The significance threshold was accepted as 0.05.


RESULTS
There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of male-to-female ratio (65.9% female vs. 56.7% male) and the mean age of the patients at the time of the kidney transplantation (25.7 vs. 26.9, p= 0.118). No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in other features. When the grafts that progressed to the chronic rejection stage were compared according to their immunologic profile, the cases of microinfiltration (p=0.002) and intimal fibrosis (p=0.012) were significantly more in the chronic rejection group.


CONCLUSIONS
A better long-term renal outcome was seen in patients receiving calcineurine inhibitor cyclosporine and cyclosporine neoral; mycophenolate mofetil alone, in contrast, increased the risk of chronic rejection. <EOD> Intrathecal Baclofen in Children: A Single-Center Review of Clinical Experience in the Last Decade and Current Practice in Switzerland.

Purpose of Study
=================
In this study, we're examining the efficacy of aromatherapy for alleviating pain in pediatric patients undergoing extraction of primary molars.

Design:
This is a randomized clinical trial, where the children in the research will be allocated into three groups. A total of 150 patients
are going to be randomly allocated into three groups, one control and two treatment. A randomized clinical trial is
necessary to get the best results on the effects of aromatherapy and a control.


Study Population
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The study population will include children who need extractions of primary molars. This study will be conducted only
on healthy children aged from six to nine years old at the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Faculty of
Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University, with the approval of the Ethics Committee. The patients' guardian's consent will
also be obtained.

Inclusion criteria:
- Children of Saudi origin aged from six to nine years old.
- Children needing extractions of one or more primary molars.
- Children able to cooperate, communicate fluently and show good social and emotional behavior in accordance with
Frankl Behavior rating scale, categories 2, 3 or 4.

Exclusion criteria:
- Children who will refuse to cooperate or suffer from acute medical conditions related to dentistry.
- Children who will be suffering from acute systemic disease or chronic severe medical conditions.
- Children with a history of behavioral disturbances.
- Children having a history of dental trauma.
- Children with a history of dental phobia.
- Children in preschool and kindergarten.
- Children suffering from an allergy to mint oils.

Data Collection Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This study aims to examine the effectiveness of aromatherapy in the reduction of stress for children undergoing a dental extraction
of primary molars. This study will be conducted according to a randomized clinical trial model, and a sample will be selected
from children admitted in Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, FDJAU, with their parents' informed consents. These
patients will be allocated and divided randomly into three groups, one control and two treatment groups. The baseline data will be
recorded before the extraction, including patient's age and gender, grade in preschool or kindergarten, parents' education and
occupation. The children will undergo the extraction procedure and will record the vital signs (blood pressure, heart rates and pulse
rates), the type of anesthetic used and oxygen saturation. Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scales will be used to measure
the pain level of the child before and after extraction, and the dentist will perform the extraction. The time required for inhalation
and recovery time will be assessed. The children will be monitored constantly to evaluate their behavior.
Examples of Assessments at Baseline:
- Baseline vital signs.
- Parents' consent of involvement and their educational level and occupation.
- Patient grade in preschool or kindergarten.
- Child's age and gender.
Examples of Assessments During Dental Extraction:
- Extraction procedure and use of local anesthesia.
- Vital signs: pulse rate and blood pressure at baseline, before the procedure, during the procedure and immediately after the
procedure. Oxygen saturation at baseline, during the procedure and immediately after the procedure.
- Pain level before and immediately after the procedure, as measured using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale. The scale
is used for children aged between six and nine years.
- Dental extraction recovery time.
Examples of Assessments After Dental Extraction:
- Time for inhalation: This will estimate the time required for inhalation by the control group and the treatment group in
using the oil.
- Time for extraction: This will estimate the procedure of the extraction for the control group and the treatment group in using
the oil.
- Dental inhalation recovery time: This will estimate the time required for recovery of the control group and the treatment group
in using the oil.

The rat medial septal region contains two distinct and well‐defined sets of neurones, the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (DBB), that are thought to be interconnected. Histological analyses of the region were performed to resolve the borders between these two structures, to identify other areas and nuclei that may be included with the septal nuclei, and to investigate the topography of individual HDB/DBB neurones. Our studies reveal that only the first set, the HDB, continues to the medial septal nucleus (MS), which is well‐defined and contains a subdivision of dense cellularity (MS dense). <EOD> Membrane fluidity and surface charge of intracellular organelles in human breast cancer correlated to histological tumour grade and ploidy
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with respect to biologic behaviour and response to therapy. An indication of malignancy grade is often obtained from an examination of tissue morphology, and in cancer research the use of immunohistochemical staining has offered further insight into the progression of tumours. Changes in plasma and intracellular membrane fluidity or in surface charge of cancerous cells may play a role in cancer progression. The purpose of the present study was to compare membrane fluidity and surface charge of the three main intracellular organelle membrane components isolated from 22 mild (grade I, II, or II) and seven moderate or severe (grade III, IV, or IVa) human breast carcinomas, to determine whether any differences in membrane physicochemical properties exist between malignant tumour grades and normal controls. Tumour grade was evaluated histologically after removal from the breast, and cytometric analysis (cytogram and image cytometry) of the membrane fluidity and surface charge of rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria was performed. Fluorescence polarisation measured membrane fluidity. Fluorescein isothiocyanate‐labelled dextran measured surface charge. Significant differences were found in membrane fluidity and surface charge between mild and moderate or severe tumour malignant grades. Membrane fluidity was generally decreased. The mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum showed an elevated membrane fluidity compared to the Golgi apparatus. The endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus exhibited an increase in membrane fluidity and in surface charge with the progression of tumour malignant grade. The mitochondrial fluidity increased from normal controls to grade I−II tumours to grade III−IV tumours. An initial increase in surface charge followed by a decrease with the progression of tumour grade was demonstrated for mitochondria. The fluidity and the surface charge of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane also showed a decrease with increasing histologic tumour grade, although they decreased at a much slower rate than did those of the Golgi apparatus membrane. No differences in cell cycle analysis were apparent. The data suggests that intracellular membrane alterations (loss of lipid, and changes in membrane fluidity and surface charge) are an important part of cancer progression. Fluorescence polarisation and image cytometry techniques may thus represent useful diagnostic tools for future tumour marker studies. <EOD> Clinical significance of 123I‐MIBG scintigraphy in the evaluation of neuroblastoma

In conclusion, the results demonstrate the importance of having a clinical neurology with years of experience and with up to date medical knowledge and skills, in order to perform a safe and efficient biopsy of brain tissue. The procedure was performed in a clean and sterile environment, and was done by a neurologist in order to minimize damage on the brain tissue. The sample extracted was sent to the laboratory for the biopsy and was evaluated, revealing certain pathological features that could be useful in understanding the underlying biological processes of the pathology.

### 
We thank the patient for providing us the needed data for the procedure, and the lab for performing the biopsy and its analysis. We acknowledge that the results of this procedure and analysis have limitations since we cannot extrapolate the conclusions to the whole tissue and therefore further studies are needed to elucidate the full pathological processes and biological features of this type of tissue.

Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum and Magnetococcus sp. strain MC-1 are among the few magnetotactic bacteria able to synthesize particles with a high content of iron (up to 60%) but with low crystallinity (maximal size of the grains does not exceed 15 nm). M. magnetotacticum magnetosomes have a cubo-octahedral shape with a size of ∼30 nm, whereas Magnetococcus sp. strain MC-1 magnetosomes are spherical and are composed of needle-shaped grains with a size of 15 nm. The structure of M. magnetotacticum magnetosomes (cubo-octahedron) may result from a combination of several effects such as the small size of the grains and the low grain crystallinity. These are the first magnetosomes with such a structure that have been structurally characterized. Magnetosomes produced by this strain of the magnetotactic bacteria are very useful for studying magnetosome formation and for developing new applications of magnetic particles. <EOD> A prospective study of the association between obesity and psychiatric symptomatology in late adolescence.
BACKGROUND
Adolescent obesity has been associated with a variety of psychiatric symptoms in cross-sectional studies. Although much research has explored the association between body mass index (BMI) and a broad spectrum of psychiatric symptoms, few studies have focused on the independent association between specific psychiatric symptoms and adolescent obesity. An additional limitation of the extant literature is the paucity of research on the bidirectional relationship between BMI and psychiatric symptoms over time.

 <EOD> Evaluation of 3-D ultrasound in the diagnosis of placenta accreta
Objective To compare the accuracy of 2-D transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) and 3-D transvaginal ultrasound (3D-TVU) imaging for the diagnosis of placenta accreta. Materials and methods 75 symptomatic women with an obstetric history of at least one previous cesarean section underwent color Doppler transvaginal ultrasonography. The diagnosis of placenta accreta was based on the assessment of the placenta by TVU (1) at insertion (intramural or non-intramural), (2) by depth of invasion into the myometrium and 3D-TVU images. The histological examination of the placenta served as the gold standard for comparison. Results We confirmed that TVU at insertion and the assessment of placental depth into the myometrium was accurate (AUC: 0.919, p < 0.0001; AUC: 0.841, p = 0.0007). Accuracy of depth of placenta insertion for the different types of accreta was high (accuracy ranged from 0.779 to 0.933 for intra- or extra-myometrial placental implantation (p < 0.05), from 0.695 to 1.000 for placenta increta (p < 0.001), and from 0.954 to 1.000 for placenta percreta (p < 0.001), respectively. With 3D-TVU, we achieved improved accuracy especially for the assessment of depth of placenta insertion (AUC: 0.908, p < 0.0001; in particular for the depth placenta accrete (AUC: 0.865, p < 0.001) and increta (AUC: 1.000, p < 0.0001). 3D-TVU was also superior to TVU for the assessment of the depth of placenta accreta in patients with multiple pregnancies. Conclusion Our results confirm that 2-D and 3-D TVU imaging allow an accurate characterization of the nature and the severity of the disease. While 2-D TVU is considered to be a sufficient tool for characterization and diagnosis of the condition, 3D-TVU could have higher value for assessing placenta accreta in certain clinical situations. In combination, 3D-TVU and 2-D TVU could be complementary tests to pre-operatively decide, which is the most suitable approach for optimal obstetric result. <EOD> Correlation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Level with Tumor Sidedness, Size, and Differentiation in Patients with Colorectal Cancer

Due to the nature of metabolism and the effects of the lactate/ketone body ester supplementation, we will test possible effects caused by a lack of insulin. The insulin-sensitive response to exogenous insulin infusion will be analyzed in this trial.

Summary: Metabolic effects of supplementation with La Ke ester

Summary: Lactate-ketone esters provide a fast and efficient way to boost blood ketones, which can be helpful when fasting, training, and other circumstances as ketosis is induced. Lactate and ketone body ester are combined in the same formulation to increase the metabolic and mental effects of ketosis in a single supplement.
Lactate-ketone ester is a combination of the ketone body ester, D-β-hydroxybutyrate, and lactate for faster and more efficient metabolic and mental effects. The compound is stable and more potent than ingesting one ester alone.

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases cardiac output

Summary: Lactate and ketone body ester are combined in the same formulation to increase the metabolic and mental effects of ketosis in a single supplement. The supplement can help to increase the rate at which the body burns fat for energy, which increases cardiac output (CO) and improves the oxygen (O2) delivery in the bloodstream during exercise.

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases mitochondrial activity

Summary: Exposure to the lactate-ketone ester increases the mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial oxygen consumption.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester is shown to be a potent and fast-acting ketogenic supplement which can help to raise the concentration of ketones in circulation, the endogenous fatty acid oxidation, and improves the oxidation of metabolic fuel.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases the exogenous fatty acid oxidation

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases fatty acid oxidation during endurance exercise, which increases ketone oxidation rate, which may improve the oxidation of total fatty acids.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases muscle strength and muscle size

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester can increase muscle strength and size, but more studies are needed to confirm the findings.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases plasma levels of growth differentiation factor 15 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester can increase growth differentiation factor 15 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration levels.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases appetite

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester can increase appetite and decrease insulin levels.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases energy metabolism

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester may increase energy metabolism, muscle contraction efficiency, and aerobic training efficiency.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases erythrocyte volume fraction concentration levels

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases erythrocyte volume fraction concentration levels.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases fat storage

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester increases fat storage.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester decreases plasma and liver triglyceride concentrations

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester reduces the serum triglyceride concentration, increases the plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and liver triglycerides concentrations.
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester may lower plasma triglyceride levels

Summary: Lactate-ketone ester may lower fat mass
Summary: Lactate-ketone ester may lead to loss of fat mass
Summary:
    Increases the growth factor GDF15 (a protein involved in stress and growth).

A clinical trial is defined clinically when participants receive a medical intervention during a study in addition to the routine clinical care they would ordinarily receive. In clinical trials, people act as their own control in most cases and are not randomised to control groups.
Randomised control trials (RCT) provide one of the best methods for determining causality, but this is based upon a particular population and does not directly correlate to other populations. Therefore, to compare and extrapolate the findings of this trial to other populations and patients, the researchers conduct other types of studies.  This article discusses these other types of studies and the findings associated with them.
Randomised controlled trial design:
- Researchers randomly assign people to receive different treatments or to be exposed to different conditions.
- Researchers track the results and compare those receiving the new treatment in comparison with the treatment.
- The outcomes for both groups are compared - researchers are able to compare data to determine whether or not the treatment is equally as effective.
- This type of research usually follows a long-term goal to gather the most effective and cost-economical treatments.
Randomised controlled trial method:
- People are allocated into a treatment group.
- The researchers analyze the data to determine how well this group of participants responded to the treatment.
Researchers usually conduct randomised controlled trials to test a new treatment for a disease condition or risk factor associated with that condition. Usually, several hundred or thousands of study participants are involved before researchers discover a truly effective treatment.
Observational studies:
- An observational study involves a pre-experiment, clinical trial for the treatment's effectiveness.
- Observational studies allow researchers to track patients with a natural experiment to control outcomes.
- They also track a population - this allows the researchers to monitor the natural experiment effects, which include the environment surrounding the patients and the lifestyle and genetics of the patient.
- The patients typically do not have to follow a strict procedure to participate in an observational study.
For example, researchers usually conduct studies investigating a drug, the effects of a drug, and the adverse effects of a drug.

[INSERT SUMMARY ACTIONS] <EOD> Prognostic factors related to the postoperative course of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer: a study on 73 patients.
The present study deals with prognostic factors in 73 patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma subjected to extended liver resection with hepatic replacement, portal vein resection, or both. The resection ranged from local excision of a few lesions to complete extrahepatic metastasectomy. The majority of patients had a moderately preserved, usually one-sided, liver. The liver metastases were located to the liver parenchyma and the subphrenic and the peritoneal pericaval areas. Patients with synchronous liver metastases seemed to be in some special category of patients compared with those with metachronous liver metastases. In synchronous cases, the disease recurred in the peritoneal cavity in 7 of 18 patients, and liver resection was repeated two or three times in some of these patients. Numerically the highest mortality was found in one-sided resections with a 5-year actuarial survival rate of 34%. The overall postoperative mortality of 29% was mainly attributable to wound infections. <EOD>

Background:The environment that a species experiences during the ontogeny has been shown to influence phenotypic plasticity and may even lead to evolutionary change. In animals, such environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity is most pronounced and best studied in sperm, which show changes in morphology and physiology under different environmental conditions. Most studies on these phenotypic effects have focused on one environment, and so it is still unclear if sperm phenotypes are dependent on specific pre-mating conditions, or if sperm phenotypes are general responses to a given environmental condition, independent of whether these conditions were encountered before or after copulation.Results:Using different pre-and post-mating treatments, we investigated whether environment-dependent phenotypic variation of sperm can be caused by a single maternal effect or requires a two-step environmental response through different pre-mating and post-mating environments. We show that the sperm phenotype is altered after exposure to a pre-mating environment; however, the same sperm phenotype can differ after exposure to an identical environment during the post-mating environment.Conclusion: This leads us to conclude that sperm responses are dependent on maternal, pre-mating phenotypes (single maternal effect), but also on environmental changes during ontogeny (both maternal and post-mating environment).

# Background
As a result of increased human environmental change and population growth, it is becoming more important to study phenotypic responses to environmental variation. Studies on phenotypic plasticity often focus on post-embryonic life stages (e.g. morphology, physiology)   The ontogeny of physiological plasticity: consequences for evolutionary biology, Buchanan     The genetics and evolution of phenotypic plasticity, Scheiner  .
However, the effects of plasticity are most often investigated during larval or adult life stages, and therefore little is known about phenotypic changes in pre-mating environments and the genetic consequences of responses to different pre-mating environments. One developmental stage that is often neglected in studies on plasticity is sperm.

 <EOD> Lidocaine Prevents the Production of TNF-α and Prevents Neutrophil Infiltration and Acute Liver Injury in Streptococcus pneumoniae–Infected Mice
In a mouse model of experimental pneumococcal lung infection, we showed that the preventive administration of lidocaine attenuated lung and liver damage and decreased production of proinflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and TNF receptor-1 (TNFR-1), as well as proinflammatory chemokines, including macrophage inflammatory (MIP)-1&agr;, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, macrophage inflammatory protein-3&agr;, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Our results suggest that lidocaine limits lung and liver damage induced by pneumococcal infection by decreasing the number of circulating neutrophils and limiting necrosis. <EOD> Characterization and properties of a new strain of Escherichia coli with multiple defects in phosphoporine and iron transport and its growth kinetics on minimal media.
The growth kinetics of an Escherichia coli strain, E9515, which was isolated by the use of screening media containing phosphoporine and iron as the sole phosphorous and iron sources, was studied in a microcalorimeter to elucidate its intracellular phosphorus and iron metabolism. The bacterium showed an attenuated growth profile, with respect to growth delay and lag phase, as well as a shorter generation time. This was consistent with the facts that the bacterium was defective in phosphoporine assimilation. The cells did exhibit low level of ATP/ADP ratio as well as a poor phosphorus balance pattern, suggesting the fact that they were defective in intracellular phosphorus metabolism. It is concluded that E9515 was defective in phosphoporine assimilation as well as phosphate exchange, which is the phospho-degradable phosphorus molecule pool, such in the intracell phosphorus metabolism as well as the pool that phosphate of phosphorus pool for the phosphorus transport was defective of defective pool in media (15.

 <EOD> A survey on HIV infection prevalence and awareness in two Chinese industrial areas with different AIDs distribution patterns

Background: China is facing an emerging HIV epidemic with increased infections and spread, mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and injection drug users (IDUs). However, little information is available on the HIV infection and awareness in industrial areas, especially among women. Methods: A cross-sectional survey among 2,831 voluntary clients aged 18 to 59 was conducted in two industrial cities, Xinxiang and Xinzhou in 2008. These two sites represent the low/moderate HIV infection prevalence and high/moderate infection prevalence areas of the country, respectively (average 220/1220 per 100,000 individuals tested in Xinxiang and Xinzhou during 2003-2007). Demographic characteristics, risk behaviors, HIV infection status and knowledge on modes of transmission were collected by a structured questionnaire. Results: The infection and awareness rates among clients were low in both sites (average 0.46% and 63.5% in Xinzhou, and 0.12% and 65.5% in Xinxiang). The prevalence and awareness rates among men were higher than the rates among women (average 0.76% and 76.7% in men, in comparison to 0.09% and 58.9% in women in Xinzhou; 0.26% and 70.4% in men in comparison to 0.04% and 51.5% in women in Xinxiang), in each site with different population structure and distribution patterns of the AIDS risk groups. Heterosexual transmission and unknown ways of transmission were the major routes of HIV infection. Compared to Xinxiang, clients in Xinzhou were younger, more likely to be single or widowed, MSM as risk factor, unemployed, have more unprotected sexual behavior, have limited HIV educational and prevention knowledge; also, more of them could not correctly identify the most appropriate mode of HIV transmission.Conclusions: Although prevalence was still low, HIV infection could still emerge. HIV infection was less likely to be noticed, and sexual transmissions predominated. Prevention efforts were needed to focus on women especially the low-income single or widowed with limited education, to improve awareness of this epidemic.

# Background
AIDS, as an emerging infectious disease, was first reported in China in 1985 with infections spreading rapidly over the years. According to the Fifth National China AIDS Epidemiological Survey, the prevalence of HIV infection among voluntary counseling clients, mostly MSM and IDUs, was already 3.0% nationally, and 7.7% in large cities. By 2007, a total of 491,550 people had been infected with HIV and 84,780 had died due to AIDS in China, accounting for 12 million people worldwide, becoming the second largest after Africa   Global HIV/AIDS prevention: the China experience, Huang  .
The current AIDS epidemic in China has been driven mainly by HIV sexual transmission and IDU, especially among MSM and IDUs, spreading from eastern coastal cities to middle and western areas. The HIV epidemic in China can be further classified into two sub-groups. One sub-group is characterized by a relatively low infection prevalence in general, usually less than 1%, a high density of commercial sex venues and a high density and frequency of sexual contact, especially among MSM, in large cities, mainly in eastern areas   Survey of human immunodeficiency virus infection in three cities on the southeast..., Ding     National estimates of HIV infection among male-to-female transgender persons in China, Chow     HIV trends and factors associated with HIV infection among men who have..., Zhang     The first population-based seroepidemiological study of HIV infection and syphilis among men..., Yang  .

 <EOD> Is the diabetes care provided by the community nurse complementary to that of the physician? The views of people with diabetes.
The role of community nurses in the management of diabetes remains controversial. There is no direct evidence that this service is either cost-effective or improves the quality of life for diabetic patients. In a study interviewing people with diabetes who were attending a community diabetes clinic the majority did not expect the community nurse to provide advice about diet. Although the majority thought that the community nurse should see them more frequently than the general practitioner, the reasons given for this were not related to dietary advice or education but to routine blood test monitoring. There is some evidence that communication between community diabetes clinic staff and general practitioners could be improved; there is a clear need to improve this co-ordination of care. <EOD> The impact of patient race and sexual orientation on perceptions of clinicians who serve rural populations
Abstract Prejudice against rural patients and clinicians who serve them influences the delivery of and access to health care. A telephone survey sample of 306 rural adults recruited from 48 small rural hospitals in the lower Mississippi River Valley was used to investigate the impact of patient race and sexual orientation on perceptions of clinicians in rural practices. The study sample was 59% white, 40% African American; 30% heterosexual; and 70% gay or lesbian. Findings revealed no statistical differences based on patient race and sexual orientation. Overall, the majority of patients—both white and African American and straight and gay or lesbian—would not choose a different doctor or wait longer to see a doctor if they thought the clinician would not care for them because of these demographic factors. <EOD> Gastric volvulus causing abdominal compartment syndrome in adults: a surgical emergency.
Gastric volvulus may cause death if not diagnosed and treated promptly. The mortality of surgical treatment of gastric volvulus ranges between 19 and 83%. Early operation is the only way to decrease the mortality of gastric volvulus. We present two patients with gastric volvulus caused by abdominal adhesions, one of which had simultaneous adrenal tumour excision as well as simple cholecystectomy. One of the adhesive bands caused gastric volvulus and the other one caused stenosis of the duodenal bulb, which has not been reported yet. We would like to remind clinicians on this entity, as abdominal compartment syndrome caused by gastric volvulus requires early exploratory laparotomy and reduction. We would like to emphasise that abdominal compartment syndrome with gastric volvulus can be managed only by early abdominal decompression and reduction. Patients can be managed by simple decompression and reduction during the early phase of the disease. <EOD> Aortic root dilatation in patients surviving a systemic arterial aneurysm.
Of 152 patients after successful repair of an aneurysm of systemic artery only five were older than 50 years. The aneurysm was located in aorta in 109 cases, in iliac arteries in 36, in pulmonary artery in 3 only. All the patients were examined for aortic root dilatation in follow-up between 1959-1986. There was no dilatation of aortic root in case of congenital"

 <EOD> Detection of myeloma cells at the periphery of multiple myeloma tissue biopsies by fluorescence immunohistochemistry.
Recent studies have shown that multiple myeloma (MM) bone marrow contains tumor microenvironments that are composed of multiple interacting cell types, including cancer cells, immune cells, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipocytes. The interactions between the cancer cells and the bone marrow microenvironments are complex. However, detection of malignant myeloma cells in MM tissue biopsy specimens remains difficult. Here, we used a multicolor immunofluorescence staining panel, including a panel of myeloma-associated markers (HLA-DR, CD38, CD138 and CD 19), normal plasma cell markers (CD38, and CD138), a leukocyte common antigen (CD45), and markers of malignant plasma cells (CD19, CD56, CD39, CD82, and CD44, the myeloma cell surface antigen Ki-67, and the cancer stem cell markers CD133 and CD326) to detect myeloma cells in MM tissues. Immunoperoxidase staining with diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as a secondary antibody to detect malignant myeloma plasma cells and CD19(+) B lymphocytes and leukocytes, while immunofluorescence staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used as a secondary antibody to detect other leukocyte common antigen+ cells in MM tissue biopsies. Analysis of clinicopathologic data including serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum immunoglobulin, serum immunofixation electrophoresis, cytology, cytogenetics, FISH, PET/CT, bone radiograph, as well as bone marrow biopsy and immunohistochemistry was done for correlation. The results showed that immunostaining with the immunofluorescent method improved the detection of myeloma cells in MM biopsy specimens. Therefore, it is feasible to enhance the detection of myeloma cells and immune markers in MM tumors and tissues by applying multicolor immunofluorescence staining followed by high-resolution analysis with high-resolution microscopy. A large set of antibodies targeting myeloma-associated and lymphocytic epitopes may be used as part of the antibody panel to enhance visualization of MM neoplasms in tissues. Our studies with a large set of antibodies targeting myelomas-associated markers may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of MM. <EOD> .

[Centre Hospitalier Valida. The placebo effect of manipulative therapy for patients with chronic low-back pain: protocol for a randomized controlled trial. 2014 Aug 14. 2014.


Background: 
* The placebo effect is defined by  as ""the positive treatment effect when administering a placebo to patients""

* According to , the placebo effect can be produced during two types of medical intervention: one based on an active intervention, such as drug intervention, and another not based on active intervention, such as manipulation - physical treatment, surgery, and complementary treatments.

* Based on the results of earlier studies, the mechanisms that are used in the placebo-controlled randomized trials to increase the effects of the interventions are: attention to the symptoms by the patient (attention effects), the belief in the drug effectiveness by the patient (placebo effects), and the improvement in the doctor-patient communication (nocebo effects).

* In a clinical trial that was published in 2012, investigated the effect of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) in patients with chronic low-back pain. The results of the trial showed that SMT was more effective when a positive message was given concerning the treatment before the intervention when compared to a neutral message (the same type of effect was observed when compared to a negative message or when compared to the SMT without a message). The study concluded that the results confirm the importance of contextual factors to the effect of SMT.

* In a clinical trial that was published in 2013, investigated whether SMT was effective in patients with chronic low-back pain when a placebo effect was induced after the treatment by the participants (placebo-induced patients). When compared to the findings of the previous trial, the findings of the study showed that the placebo effect, that was observed when a positive message was given before the intervention, did not have any effect when the positive message was introduced after the intervention (there were also no differences between the neutral information or the negative messages). 

* In a recent meta-analysis,investigated whether a positive belief towards SMT is predictive to the efficacy of SMT in the long-term, and concluded that a positive belief is positively associated with the outcomes of SMT.

Based on these results, the present research protocol aims to study the effects of a positive expectation in the SMT provided to patients with chronic low-back pain.

Clinical Relevance:

1) Although clinicians could produce the placebo effect intentionally, as well as the nocebo effect; non-cognitive-behavioral aspects are considered to be the main source of the placebo effect.
2) The mechanisms used by the clinicians to produce the placebo effect and nocebo were:
&ndash; to avoid any discord related to the diagnosis and treatment provided (when related to a chronic condition)
&ndash; to avoid mentioning any information in relation to a pain originating from a specific cause
&ndash; to avoid mentioning the duration of the proposed intervention

3) The placebo effects produced by the intervention in relation to chronic pain may be divided as:
&ndash; effects produced by the patients to the clinical relationship (personalized therapeutic relationship – patient-clinician interaction)
&ndash; effects produced by the perception of the treatment (perception of the symptoms, perception of the therapist’s intention in relation to the health and the clinical outcomes)
&ndash; effects produced by the therapeutic relationship
&ndash; effects produced by the therapeutic relationship or by the patient's characteristics

4) In a research that was published in 2011, the placebo effect in SMT was considered to be a possible key element to the effectiveness of SMT (a study that was published in 2013 studied a positive belief in SMT to optimize the chronic effect of a placebo-sugly

Human hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a defective virus that requires helper hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA for its replication in infected hepatocytes. This replication involves the formation of replicative forms of HDV RNA and HDV genomic RNA (3.6 kb) that are derived from dimeric and monomeric forms of subgenomic and genome-length HDV RNAs, respectively, which are transcribed in vitro by HDV large antigen. In this study, we identified a single substitution (T894A) in the HDV RNA polymerase (RP) that conferred ability to form replicative forms of HDV RNA and genomic RNA from a monomeric template. The mutated T894 in the active-site domain of large antigen (amino acids 876 to 904) was in contact with one of the two arginine residues (R900 and R902) previously reported to be absolutely essential for RNA synthesis in vitro. Thus, our results indicate that a small difference in active-site domain conformation contributes to RNA replication in vitro. <EOD> Osteoid osteoma of the cervical spine: an unusual location.

Since the first outbreak of COVID-19, about 500 million people have been infected worldwide of whom over 6 million died, making it the most disastrous pandemic in last 100 years.
The outburst of the COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 changed the global health system and public health. To reduce this spread and the severity of infection, the mass vaccination programs worldwide is implemented at an unprecedented pace. So far, at least 10 approved vaccines have been produced worldwide of which the vaccines produced by Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Biontech, Sinopharm, Serum Institute, Sinovac are being used in a vast number of countries. These vaccines have significantly reduced the infection and the severity of SARS-COVID-19 by inducing the immunity, either through humoral (antibody production) or through cell-mediated mechanisms.

Informed Consent Statement
============================

As the research involves a non-pharmacological intervention, it is important that all patients participating in it understand all the processes that will take place in each part of the experiment and what the aim of the research is in order to ensure their collaboration. For that, it is essential to formulate an informed consent which will include adequate content and language. We therefore suggest that the contents are described so that they are understandable to the average person. We are of the opinion that one of the fundamental parts of the content of a consent is a justification of why the research will be carried out. This justification is considered a positive motivating element to carry out the research; in addition, it is considered mandatory by different research commissions. For this reason, we will begin by writing the contents of the information to be included in the informed consent and the justification that could be required for it to be approved by the REB. If the information is not sufficient or the REB requires more information, we suggest you add relevant contents to the informed consent.

Considerations to Write the Informed Consent:

In addition, there is also a section of questions on the nature of this type of study, in which we would like to consider the following:
1. Researchers: who and where they are, what you study, what is the scope and the objective

## Institution: is it an organization in the health area and what kind of institution,
  in the case of a hospital, is it private or public and how many health personnel are included.
  In the case of a university, specify in which faculty it belongs and to which department.
3. Study: name, design and brief description
4. Risks and benefits:
  This section describes the risks and benefits for subjects of this proposed research.
    What are the benefits for them if they participate? (For example, if they participate they can learn about their pain and discomfort and they will help to understand the pain pathophysiology). On the other hand, what are the risks? (For example, pain if you are exposed to an electric stimulus; in some cases, this study can be a little painful and the subject should be aware of this).
    The risks and benefits are analyzed depending on the study and how the study is conducted and we will include them in the consent.
    Example for a behavioral study to evaluate pharmacological pain responses:
    As you know, this study aims to evaluate the role of a molecule that can block pain nerve impulses. The evaluation of pain requires in most cases a nerve stimulation and that the subject feels pain, although some stimulations are almost imperceptible to the person. Also, in many of these tests the body is exposed to a magnetic static field which would not have a harmful effect, but some subjects are sensitive to static magnetic fields and sometimes they can feel uncomfortable. If these sensations are tolerable for you, it is possible a study with slight discomfort and minor risks.
6. Alternatives to the study (If you cannot participate in our study, please tell us why and please let us know what other type of research they would be willing to participate in)

## 7.
Source of funding (indicate if the study is publicly or privately funded and indicate if funding will affect the design, research results, or publication of your study)

Reasons of nonparticipation in the study:
1. If you participate in the study, please indicate your willingness to participate in another study if you are excluded from the study. You must mention the names of the 3 studies that you will consider participating in.

Bing-Neel syndrome (BNS) is a neurological complication characterised by a combination of hemimegalencephaly (HME) and demyelination, usually related to infection with Walderstrom-Raji (iWG) or type V (iMN) lymphomas . The term iWG and iMN was proposed by Patterson et al., to indicate Waldenstrom's and Mott's lymphomas respectively, in patients with underlying systemic Bing-Neel syndrome. iWG and iMN have been renamed to iMZL-W and iMZL-M for 'marginal zone' lymphoma with widespread neurological disease and B-cell lymphomas with mixed phenotype according to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification , and are now classified as anaplastic large cell lymphoma with B-cell immunophenotype. <EOD> Efficacy of Antimycotics in Hydrolyzed Protein Diets on Skin Pigmentation in Golden Syrian Hamster Exposed to UV Radiation
Abstract: Although hamsters skin is more pigmented to UV in hamsters than in rats, the effects of some UV‐absorbing compounds and UV‐absorbing diets on pigmentation are comparable in the two species. The purpose of the present work was to study the effects of different hydrolyzed protein diets and their combination with antimycotics on skin pigmentation. Three groups of hamsters received the diets; first, the control diet (C), in which the protein source was from whole ground corn 69%; second, the F diet, in which the protein source was completely hydrolyzed with Alcalase enzym 900; and third, the F + Z diet with the addition of zinc oxide 2%. The animals in the Z group were fed the C diet and topically received 2 mg/cm 2 of zinc oxide. The fourth group was under UV irradiation every third day for 3 wk to study the capacity of F, F + Z, and Z diets and albaconol (Antibic) to protect the skin against UV radiation. The skin of hamsters fed with C diet showed an important pigmentation after UV exposure compared with Z group. The pigmentation was increased in hamsters fed F and F + Z diets, while the group that received Z showed no alteration of skin color. This data indicates that the diet F + Z improves the skin pigmentation with some advantage compared with F diet and that albaconol also protects the skin from phototoxic effect of UV. <EOD> Effect of the COVID‐19 Pandemic on Surgical Resident Education

This project was exempt by the institutional review board. The study was conducted at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, where 136 eligible surgical residents were enrolled in the ACGME accredited general surgery and 55 were enrolled in the ACGME accredited gastroenterology program. The study was a voluntary, anonymized survey of surgical trainees about their educational experiences related to resident duties and didactic education before and during COVID-19. We compared the responses for the 4 main topics (resident duties, education, technology, and institutional support).Statistical analysis was performed as previously described (2,3). The 2-sample t test was used to compare mean scores and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the frequency distributions in each group. Cohen's d was used to estimate effect sizes. All tests were 2 tailed and were interpreted as significant at a value <.05.To assess the"

Eligible Patients
-----------------------------------------------
Women aged 18 and older who have hypertension and have a diagnosis of uncontrolled blood pressure or borderline hypertension (or who are on an antihypertensive, but not currently well controlled), have a family physician, family medicine resident or other health care provider, and have a smartphone phone with access to the internet. The patient must also live within 50km of community pharmacy.


Inclusion Criteria
----------------------------------------------------------------

Exclusion Criteria
==========================================================
Eligible physicians (FPHCPs) must be actively practising family medicine in a community setting in Ontario, Canada. The physician must have a roster of 50 patients or more at a community pharmacy and has to be affiliated with the pharmacy (currently has a practice/office at or near the pharmacy or they are contracted with the pharmacy to be in-house family physicians). Both the physician and pharmacist should have an adequate internet connection to the pharmacy. The physician will be required to make an appointment available at least two days out of 4 (eg: Monday, Wednesday, or Friday).


Study Procedure
=================
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed through a phone prescreen followed by an in-person screen. Eligible participants will receive their AOBPs in person first or on a future date of their choosing. From a random list of participants eligible, based on criteria outlined within the methods section of the document: half of the population will begin with AOBP at a community pharmacy, and the other half, the Intervention group, will come into the community pharmacy with BP reading from a home blood pressure monitoring device provided by the research team at week-0. Both groups will then continue to complete the 24-week study in the community pharmacy location with all their follow-up AOBPs done in-person and the Home BP readings recorded in the REDCap mobile application. Upon completion of the study, participants from both groups will be offered the opportunity to crossover into the other group's intervention. Both groups will then re-enter the community pharmacy after 28-days to have their AOBPs done at week-20. All patients will be compensated for their AOBP readings and will receive $2.50 for each phone follow-up AOBP. Participants will be contacted weekly via short message service or phone call to help optimize participation (eg attend AOBPs). Pharmacists will be paid $20 per AOBP and $15 per in-person follow-up. Pharmacy participants will contacted weekly via a phone call to optimize their involvement (reimbursement to the pharmacy - eg; $25/week). Participants will be reimbursed for follow-up home BP reading. Study coordinator will be contacted weekly or as required to ensure optimal involvement of the study (eg AOBP patient's contact the participant, contact information on an intervention, this paper to have not been provided to the study and the study.

The following terms were used in the summaries of the three randomly selected studies.


| Terms | Abbreviation | Example | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Summary | Summary | [/INST] | 
| Clinical Trial | CT | [/SRC] | 

Furthermore, the text was simplified to reflect a summary and not an explanation of the original study. This means that the words clinical trial become synonymous with study.

To simplify the results and reduce the number of terms used, the synonyms were separated using the command \&quot|. This is because the summaries are the result of three random selection algorithms which may produce different results. 

In general, for study results, we expect the number of words to be below 50. However, the number is higher than this when there is an increase in the number of terms.

Furthermore, the length of the summaries is around 188 words due to the fact that the summaries contain more than one summary term.

Terms not used in the summaries
===================================
In addition to the number of terms used in the summaries, we would like to evaluate the number of terms that are not used. 

The number of terms in each summaries is shown in table 2. 

Table 2: Number of terms
[/ROW] | Number of Terms |
| --- | --- |
| Summary 1 | 15 |
| Summary 2 | 15 |
| Summary 3 | 19 |
| Total | 49 |

The number of terms we added was 7. 

If all of the terms have a low frequency in the summaries we will know the number of terms that we can add in the synthetic text generation to avoid adding similar terms, such as ‘the participants’, ‘the participants’’, ‘the study’. 

If the frequency is too high, then terms are needed, such as ‘patients’, ‘subjects’.

Terms that are not used are listed in table 3. 

Table 3: Terms not used

| Enrolled | 15 |
| Hospitalized | 13 |
| Allocated | 11 |
| Investigators | 9 |
| Myocardial Infarction | 8 |
| Trial | 6 | 

The analysis is based on 3 trials, so the number of terms not used is low. The number of terms not used is the number of times that these terms do not appear in the summaries of the three random selection algorithms. 



Synthetic Text Generation - Sentences
=============================================
The results from the summaries analysis show that the word length, number of terms, number of terms not used, and the number of terms used in sentence position 1 differ considerably between the three trials.

Due to the large number of terms, we only analyze the summary text. Furthermore, we will use a random selection algorithm to select the trials for use in the synthetic text generation process.

Arteries of the rats receiving ration D, which was supplemented with 0.05% ACA (0.97 g of the substance), showed only slight changes in the elastica region as compared with arteries of rats fed no ACA. In rats fed ration C, supplemented with 0.1% ACA (1.94 g of the substance), the percentage of rats with atherosclerotic changes of the elastica region was five times as high as in rats fed ration D. No changes in the extracellular component or in collagen were found in the elastica region. <EOD> .

Objective: Studies have shown that intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) is effective and safety for adults with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, its efficacy and safety in elderly patients (age≥65 years) are controversial.Methods: This post-hoc subgroup analysis of prospective, randomized, parallel, multicenter clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous TXA in moderate-to-severe TBI patients in China. A total of 732 enrolled TBI patients, including 141 elderly patients with age > 65 years, 114 younger adults with age 18-60 years, and 477 elderly patients with age ≥ 65 years in control group, were included in this study. The primary outcome was measured by the score of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on the first day. Duration of intensive care unit visit, complications of aggressive surgery, hospital stay, and 6-month survival rate were reported as secondary outcomes.Results: The TXA-treated patients in the elderly subgroup had better GCS score than the elderly patients with aggressive surgery (R-statistic coefficient = −0.683; p = 0.0045) than control group on 7th day. And intravenous TXA-treated patients had shorter time in hospital compared with control group (9.0 ± 12.5 VS 10.7 ± 12.6 days, p = 0.0092). Moreover, intravenous TXA-treated patients in the 65-75 subgroup (n = 45) had less aggressive surgery (19% vs. 51.89%,"

 <EOD> Identification of a novel gene within the fragile X syndrome critical region.
To begin to explore the molecular basis of the fragile X syndrome (FXS), we have carried out systematic sequence analysis of the 2.6 kb fragile X locus containing FMRF1  and a 28 kb genomic Pst 1 DNA clone (PX 0302) that was selected because a part of it was able to rescue the fragile X phenotype upon microinjection into mouse eggs (Gibbs et al., 1993). We report the isolation of a novel transcript from the FXS region which contains a potential open reading frame of approximately 70 kilodaltons (GHMK). Two polyadenylation signals are present in the intron and we show that GHMK exhibits a tissue-specific pattern of expression in adult mouse tissues. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of GHMK shows that the predicted protein has a coiled-coil structure characteristic of a cytoskeletal-associated protein. <EOD> Effects of the addition of alfalfa silage to a corn silage-based diet on the ruminal and intestinal fermentation profiles and methane emissions of beef cattle in an in situ approach

Objective: This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary alfalfa silage (AS) addition on the ruminal and intestinal fermentation profile and methane (CH 4 ) emissions.Methods: This experiment was conducted using in situ approach. A total of 4 Simmental steers (286±48.8 kg of body weight [BW]) fitted with a permanent rumen fistula were used in this experiment. The steers were randomly separated (n = 2) and individually fed with a corn silage (CS)-based diet (CONT group) or a CS-based diet mixed with 30% of AS (AS group). Gas samples from the rumen and methane samples from the feces of the cattle were continuously collected in the 28-day periods. Chromium oxide was added as an external marker to characterize fermentations and estimate the dry matter (DM) intake (DMI) and nitrogen (N) balance. At the end of 28 days of feeding, digestibility of nutrients, protozoal numbers, and bacterial diversity were determined.Results:The rumen pH values were similar between the 2 treatments. In comparison with the CONT group, the AS group had a higher concentration of total N (0.12 g/L, P < 0.01), total volatile fatty acids (0.12 g/L, P = 0.02), lower N 2 O emissions (0.00 g/kg DMI, P < 0.01), and CH 4 (0.06 mL/kg DMI, P = 0.01). The CP digestibility (82.19% vs. 83.10%, P < 0.01), fiber digestibility (57.12% vs. 54.74%, P < 0.01), and N balance (35.47 g vs. 33.25 g) were better in the CONT group. AS group had a lower protozoal number (1.75 vs. 13.46, P < 0.01). The ruminal pH value of the AS group was better than that of the CONT group (6.88 vs. 6.80, P < 0.01). The relative abundance of Christensenellaceae R-7 group (14.76% vs. 10.76%, P = 0.04) and Butyrivibrio group (15.70% vs. 12.93%, P = 0.01) were higher in the AS group than that of the CONT group, whereas those of Succinivibrionaceae (0.85% vs. 1.50%, P < 0.01), Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group (10.84% vs. 18"

OBJECTIVE
The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity properties of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) subscale and index scores in patients with mood and substance disorders and their siblings.


METHODS
We administered a standardized psychiatric evaluation, the MMSE, and the Dementia Screening Questionnaire (DSQ) to 538 consecutively enrolled outpatients with a broad range of diagnoses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, as well as schizoaffective disorder, depressive disorder NOS, and a group of patients with substance-induced psychosis or substance-induced mood disorder, and their 508 siblings who were recruited for a study of patients/siblings discordant for psychopathology and cognitive impairment. Subjects were recruited from two psychiatric outpatient clinics, community drug and alcohol treatment programs, and the community at large.


RESULTS
Internal consistency for the MMSE Total and index scores for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder patients was significantly poorer than scores for bipolar disorder patients. Using the DSQ as our criterion, the MMSE failed to achieve a clinically acceptable level of sensitivity in the schizophrenia, mood disorder, and substance disorder groups. The MMSE proved to be only slightly reliable when the clinicians administering the examination were psychiatrists versus certified social workers, psychologists, or nurses. When psychiatrists administered the test, the MMSE Total score and both the orientation and memory indices demonstrated significantly higher reliability than when the test was administered by other providers; however, the MMSE Total score and orientation index demonstrated significantly lower reliability when administered to schizophrenia and major depressive disorder patients by nurses and psychologists rather than psychiatrists. The DSQ was shown to be highly reliable and valid in these three psychiatric groups.


CONCLUSIONS
The MMSE failed to measure cognitive function reliably in our bipolar disorder and schizophrenia patients and also failed as a screening instrument in our substance disorder patients. The MMSE was somewhat more reliable and valid in our mood disorder patients, especially when administered by psychiatrists. The psychometric properties of the MMSE were better in our schizophrenia and mood disorder patients than in our substance-dependent patients, perhaps because the former two populations have somewhat better cognitive reserve than patients with substance-induced psychoses. Thus, some caution should be used when extrapolating results from schizophrenia patients to substance-dependent patients. These data emphasize the need for developing a brief instrument that can be used in conjunction with the more expensive and time-consuming DSQ in psychiatric practice to screen cognitive impairment in patients with mood and substance disorder problems. <EOD> Interlukin-6 Receptor Antagonist Therapy and Its Effects on Glycemic Control

We presented a case of a 46-year-old woman with multiple cerebral aneurysms and cerebral infarctions by cerebral artery dissection. On admission (June 2004), her cerebral angiogram showed right carotid T occlusion at the horizontal port; bilateral middle cerebral artery and bilateral posterior cerebral artery, right cervical and left supraclinoid carotid dissections, right anterior cerebral artery, and basilar artery stenosis with the right posterior cerebral artery occlusion. She suffered from sensory weakness at her left upper limb, dysarthria, and dysmetria. Three days after admission, she suddenly suffered from consciousness disturbance and had left hemiplegia. Head CT showed subacute infarction on right corona radiata. She underwent left carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and cerebral angiogram after CEA showed that the lesion of the right carotid T occlusion disappeared and the basilar taper of the right anterior cerebral artery disappeared. Three months later, she had left hemiparesis and dysarthria and suffered from cerebral infarction again. She had a history of taking prednisolone, but there was no other risk factor for atherosclerosis. We diagnosed the lesion of repeated cerebral ischemia as a complication of chronic inflammation. Thereafter she had many ischemic events, and we performed stent placement into bilateral middle cerebral artery dissections, ballooning dilatation into the bilateral extracranial carotid dissections, and right proximal stenting plus ballooning dilatation into her right basilar artery lesion (September 2008). After these treatments, she had no more ischemic events. Cerebral infarction due to cerebral artery dissection is rare. In our experience, cerebral artery dissection seems to be reversible by intensive therapy, but recurrence of ischemic event is common. We reported one case of cerebral infarction due to cerebral artery dissection, and our experience indicates the importance of diagnosis and aggressive treatment for cerebral artery dissection patients. <EOD> The Influence of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex on Emotional Memory Processing in Depressive Patients: Evidence from Event-Related Potential Studies
Depression is characterized by emotional memory impairment, which might be related to abnormal activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The present study aimed to investigate emotional memory processing deficits to identify differences in the mechanisms underlying ACC impairment in depressive patients and healthy controls. Participants had to memorize the 22 positive, negative, and neutral words and subsequently perform a recognition memory task. The results indicated that depressive patients showed increased correct and false memory of negative words; moreover, depressive patients showed a reduction in the P600 and LPP amplitudes to the negative words when making positive memory judgments and a reduction in N450 amplitudes to negative and neutral words when making negative memory judgments compared with controls. These findings suggest that the processing of emotional memory with ACC in depressive patients is impaired. <EOD> Effects of the beta3-adrenoceptor Agonist, PY 106, on the Cardiovascular System in Normal and Diabetic Rats
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the selective beta3-receptor agonist, PY 106, on the cardiovascular system in normal and diabetic rats, and also the contribution of the heart rate variability method in this respect. Forty-five (45) Wister rats were divided into four groups: control-non diabetics (N, n = 10); control (C, n = 9); streptozotocin diabetics (D, n = 14); and diabetic rats treated with the beta3-receptor agonist, PY 106, for 6 weeks (D-AG, n ="

 <EOD> Enhancement of chlorhexidine substantivity on dentin and enamel by polyhexamethylene biguanide.
PURPOSE
This study evaluated the substantivity effects of polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and benzalkonium chloride (BAC), when applied in different concentrations in association with chlorhexidine on dental hard tissues.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Dentin cavities were prepared in 84 bovine incisors and dentin blocks were obtained from the middle third of the roots in 60 bovine molars. The specimens were exposed to the following associations of compounds: 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX); 1% PHMB + 0.2% CHX; 0.5% PHMB + 0.2% CHX; and 0.2% BAC + 0.2% CHX. A non-treated control group received distilled water only. After treatment application, the specimens were incubated for 60 min. Subsequently, they were tested in four-hour intervals for up to 24 h for microbial counts (CFU) and percentage of viability. The data were analyzed statistically by univariate ANOVA and Tukey tests (p < 0.05).


RESULTS
The chlorhexidine and chlorhexidine + polyhexamethylene biguanide  +benzalkonium chloride (1:8) compounds showed the longest substantivity time of bacterial counts for both enamel (9 h) and dentin (4 h). In the microbiological assessment, the following were observed: (1) for en"

Output Text: Pulmonary Ventilation Function Between Patients With Primary and Recurrent Incisional Hernia: a Cross-sectional Study

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Method Study design and patient population： This study is a single-center cross-sectional study. The main steps of this study are patients search, information review, data record, data verification and statistical analysis. The investigators searched the electronic medical record system from January 2016 to March 2023, using the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Inclusion and exclusion criteria The investigators reviewed the physical examination records of each patient, combined with abdominal CT images, only patients diagnosed with abdominal incisional hernia were included in our study, patients with other types of abdominal external hernia, such as parastomal hernias and umbilical hernias, were excluded. CT imagings of the abdomen and pulmonary function tests were two required items. Patients with incomplete data were excluded, patients with complete data were included in the study and were divided into two groups: primary group and recurrent group depends on whether there is a recurrence. Because primary incisional hernia may turn into recurrence. To reduce error, patients with primary incisional hernia less than one year when the study was started were excluded, the investigators conducted telephone follow-up of patients with primary incisional hernia. Recurrence after repair was the main outcome, patients with follow-up results of non-recurrence were included in the study. Patients who have recurrent require reassessment of pulmonary function, the patients with missing pulmonary function are excluded. The search was carried out by two researchers who extracted data independently and the results were double-checked; Diagnosis is done independently by two experienced surgeons, based on medical history and CT images. If there is disagreement, it will be determined after discussion with a third experienced surgeon. Data Collection The investigators extracted the patient's age, gender, ethnicity, BMI, abdominal CT image, maximum length of abdominal wall defect, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease and pulmonary function test report, pulmonary function test including pulmonary ventilation function and pulmonary diffusion function, pulmonary ventilation function is the main observation index of this study. The fixed threshold method often used in China to grade pulmonary ventilation dysfunction[9], our hospital graded the severity of pulmonary ventilation dysfunction with FEV1 as a percentage of the expected value: Mild: >70%; Moderate: 60% 69%; Moderate to severe: 50% 59%; Severe: 35% 49%; Very severe: <35%. The maximum length of the abdominal wall defect is measured using multi-slice helical CT 3D reconstruction technology, which is performed by a radiologist. Statistical analysis Continuous variables that conform to a normal distribution are tested using an independent sample t-test; Chi-square test and continuous correction chi-square test are used for categorical variables; The grading variables use Wilcoxon's sum test. When P<0.05, the difference was considered statistically significant, and the statistical analysis software used in this study was SPSS Version 20.

Background: The patient receives an invitation letter to participate in this research study. A reminder message will be sent with the phone number of the coordinating investigator (or of this center) to get more information on the study. If the patient agrees with participation in the study, the investigating team or the patient's general practitioner will send the consent form, with all appropriate information about the study. We explain the risks of the patient being exposed to several X-ray tests, the benefits for the patient and the society, the voluntary nature of participation in the study and his right to withdraw from the study process at any time and for any reason. It is specified that the patient is free to answer no (or not all) to the requested information for a proper understanding of the study, without in any case affecting his continuity of treatment in case of exclusion from the study. A copy of the signed consent form will be given to the patient. <EOD> A new approach to understanding how people perceive and evaluate emotions in voice-based dialogues: A qualitative analysis combining the theoretical perspective of ecological psychology
The current study is based on a qualitative analysis incorporating the Ecological Constructivist Theory (ECE) and a case study, specifically designed to investigate the mechanisms used by customers to detect and evaluate emotions in voice-based dialogues. An online survey was disseminated to detect the most important cues for discriminating emotions in automated voice. Then, 100 individuals were interviewed to identify cues and categorize emotional states according to valence and arousal, by combining the ECE and the Perceptual Model of Voice Emotion Recognition (PMVER). Voice-based dialogues were constructed and an experiment was conducted using a within-subjects design. Twenty-eight Spanish native speakers evaluated the emotions in each dialogue. The most frequently reported cues used to detect emotions in conversational agents’ emotion are similar to the ones described by previous research. Findings revealed that voice, intensity, prosodic elements, and tone of speech are useful cues to discriminate emotions and that the participants use cognitive and emotional processes to perceive and evaluate them. Emotion evaluation is complex, involves both cognitive and emotional processes, and is not linear. Voice-based dialogues are expected to be used to enhance user engagement and to allow for a prosocial communication system. <EOD> Roles of the P2X7 receptor in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and its animal model.

In Experiment 1, when mice were presented with two bottles containing different solutions of a saccharin solution, they drank more of the sweeter-tasting solution (0.3 M solution of a saccharin sodium versus 0.1M solution of saccharin sodium). When the sucrose was the stimulus, the mice preferred the stronger sucrose solution. There was no significant difference between the amount of sucrose solution ingested when the two solutions were presented separately and when they were presented simultaneously. In Experiment 2, when animals were presented with a choice between water and a saccharin sodium solution, they preferred the saccharin solution. When sweetness was equated by pairing the 0.1M saccharin sodium solution with the same amount of distilled waters, none of the solutions were preferred over the other. When the 2 solutions were presented together, a greater amount of water was consumed, but the total amount of ingested solution was not significantly different from the individual solutions presented separately. <EOD> .
The authors have made a clinical and psychometric evaluation of 60 people with an acquired alexia and agraphia in conditions without other clinically distinguishable pathology. The analysis of the anamneses and clinical studies permit to distinguish some distinctive features of persons with an alexia and agraphia. These individuals very often have suffered in early years and long-lasting brain trauma. They also very often have psychic disorders and a low intellectual level of speech. The presence or absence of speech disorders depends on the lesion's character and not from the alexic nature of the deficit. A study of the speech abilities showed that speech disturbances are more frequent among persons with a combined alexia and agraphia and among those persons with alexia and agraphia developing in a process of a cerebral tumour. <EOD> The effect of gamma-irradiated collagen on in vitro angiogenesis and the proliferation of chick embryo cells.

The angiogenic activity was evaluated at a dose of 13.4 micrograms and toxicity at doses of 22.8-143.5 micrograms per embryo. The immunogenicity of the collagen preparations was evaluated by comparing the number of anti-collagen antibodies in the plasma of the CAMs between the test and control groups, as measured by the indirect complement fixation test. The data were statistically analyzed using analysis of the variance of two-way contrast to mean. The CAMs containing irradiated rat tail tendon collagen, irradiated human placenta collagen, placental lysate and irradiated human placenta lysate showed a significant reduction in mean angiogenic activity as compared with the CAMs containing the irradiated undenatured type I collagen. Irradiated human placenta lysate showed the highest necrotic index. Radiated irradiated rat tail tendon collagen, irradiated undenatured type I collagen, irradiated human placenta collagen, and placental lysate did not cause significant inhibition of the plasma chick embryo collagen antibody response at any of the concentrations of these preparations.

Abstract: 
The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Endoscopic Diagnosis of Esophagogastric Junctional Adenocarcinoma：A Single Center, Casecontrol, Diagnostic Study：

Background: The incidence of esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (AGC) is on the rise in many low and middle-income countries. The mortality rate for this disease is very high worldwide: AGC is the seventh leading cause of death around the world. The incidence and mortality of this group of diseases should attract more attention and action from people around the world.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in endoscopic diagnosis of esophagogastric adenocarcinoma.

Methods: The study compared an AI model with endoscopic clinicians to evaluate the clinical auxiliary value of AI for endoscopic clinicians.

Results: This study was well designed and implemented, and the data reported was well described. Although it met a number of quality criteria, the study did not consider the quality of endoscopic images, which is a major factor in the diagnosis of esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (AGC), nor the clinician characteristics of endoscopists. The most important clinical question for this study was whether the developed AI model could assist in the clinical diagnosis of esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (AGC), and the study also provided the researcher with an important AI clinical trial summary.

Conclusions: This is a well-designed study, but the quality of endoscopic images considered in the study was low, and only one endoscopist made the diagnosis, which can affect the final results. This problem should be resolved in future studies, to help clinicians judge this question more accurately in future studies.

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Endoscopy, Esophagogastric Adenocarcinoma.

Introduction: [/INST]
The incidence of esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (AGC) is on the rise[1,2]. AGC is the seventh leading cause of death around the world. The incidence and mortality of this group of diseases should attract more attention and action from people around the world[3,4]. One of the reasons for the increase in the incidence of AGC may be the increase in obesity in recent years[5,6]. The incidence of obesity is increasing year by year, with more than 1.9 billion people worldwide being overweight[7,8]. The prevalence of obesity has also increased significantly worldwide[9,10].
Esophagogastric junctional adenocarcinoma (EGJAC) is a subset of esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (AGC). Early in the development of gastric cancer, the tumor is located in the deepest portion of the gland and the submucosa, it can only be detected after abdominal examination. Early diagnosis and treatment of this type of gastric cancer is significantly better than gastric cancer diagnosed in later stages, and the patient's prognosis is also significantly better than the latter[11]. Currently, the detection of gastric cancer mainly adopts gastroscopy, gastroscopy, gastroscopic ultrasound, and endoscopic ultrasound, as well as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other auxiliary examinations. AGC cannot be diagnosed by endoscopy examination. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and other examinations have certain limitations[12,13]. For instance, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) examination of adenocarcinoma will reveal small submucosal tumor-like lesions in patients with early gastric cancer. In addition, EUS can detect a small number of lesions that are not detected by gastroscopy, thereby changing the clinical staging of gastric cancer and the recommended treatment.
Closely related to the early diagnosis of clinical gastric cancer is the role of endoscopy in gastric cancer diagnosis[14]. Many international organizations have issued guidelines on the early diagnosis of gastric cancer by gastroscopy, including the Asia-Pacific Consensus Conference, American Gastroenterological Association, the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and"

There was no obvious difference in the efficacy of FRSW107 between children under 6 years old and children aged 6 to 12 years old. However, at this stage, there is a lack of data on children under the age of 6. 2. FRSW107 had a good safety profile, with the most common adverse reactions being skin allergy (allergic rash), pain at the injection site (swelling and itching), and inhibitor positivity. The incidence of adverse reactions was related to the dose of FRSW107 administered, age, and concomitant or previous exposure to FVIII.


Summary
=================
In this study，we included 30 healthy male volunteers (19 to 55 years old) of Han nationality. All participants were treated with 25 EDs (every 3 days) of aqueous Humate-P subcutaneously after their coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) level had fallen to a 2.5% level. Patients were randomly divided into three groups (10 patients each), whose age was less than 6 y, aged 6 to 12 y and greater than 12 y (≥ 13 y).
Blood FVIII levels were assessed daily until the target level of FVIII concentration was achieved and then every 3 days until the end of treatment. The primary endpoint was the time to hemostasis achievement (TTA): defined as the time interval from the start of FVIII administration to the first objective hemostasis. The secondary endpoints included the dose of FVIII, the time of hemostasis maintenance (TMHC), FVIII levels, ABR, AE and SAEs related to FVIII injections.

# Results

# Efficacy results
All 30 patients in cohort 1 reached the target level of FVIII level (25-49 IU/dL) at their first FVIII injection, and 27 (90.0%) maintained the target level during the first treatment (Q3d). Twenty-eight of 30 patients (93.3%) maintained a target level of FVIII in cohort 2. 

# Safety results
Thirty-four AEs were reported. Forty-five infusion site reactions (ISRs), including itching, pain or swelling at the injection site occurred in 19 subjects (63.3%). Itching and dermatitis at the injection site occurred in 14 patients (51.9%). Twenty-five SAEs occurred during the treatment, which were all non-ISR related.
None of the AEs were related to the study drug,
No patients experienced FVIII-related inhibitory antibodies (BEs-positive), and the number of patients who developed inhibitory antibodies after therapy was 1 in the ≤6 y group (0.6%), and the number was 3 in >6 y group (21.4%)
The ISR rate did not differ statistically between the groups and did not increase with doses.

# Conclusion
Single-dose FRSW107 treatment is a safe and effective in pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A with FVIII < 1%. <EOD> Genital Chlamydia trachomatis Infection and HIV in Women in Kenya: A Population-Based Study in Four Reg"

  SCIENTIFIC_ABSTRACT_IN_DRAFT.pdf: ""The present study therefore seeks to assess differences in feasibility and acceptability of music therapy played live and listening to a recording thereof at the palliative care ward of the University Hospital Zurich. As a secondary objective the investigators aim to extend the limited findings on the putative effect of music therapy in palliative care populations derived from objective measures of human autonomic response to music therapy and a recording thereof, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity and distal body temperature. The proposed risk category of this study is A. Justification for this risk categorization is reflected in the safe and relatively low burden of the study design, which requires the participants to undergo music therapy, complete questionnaires and wear a small wristwatch-like apparatus for a few minutes. Moreover, compared to conventional clinical measurement of human autonomic response, which typically involves skin disinfection and abrading followed by application of adhesive electrodes, the 287-2 wristband by Corsano is comparatively far less invasive and therefore represents diminished burden for the patient during their participation in the study.

Background
----------------------
Anorexia nervosa (AN) refers to fear of gaining weight and persistent behavior to restrict food intake or excessive physical activity to control weight. It is a serious, often life-threatening eating disorder. The prevalence of AN is approximately 0.2%-1.3% in the general population, and the incidence is also increasing year by year. If left untreated, it can cause cardiomyopathy, osteoporosis, growth retardation, endocrinopathy, and other comorbidities, and more seriously, if severe, it can cause starvation osteoporotic death. The treatment of AN is often quite difficult, with a reported low recovery rate of around only 50%, and its etiology remains unclear, but research has identified multiple neural network abnormalities in patients with AN, including the frontal lobe, the limbic system (ventral striatum, hippocampus, amygdala), and various reward brain circuits; the dysfunction of neural networks is closely related to the onset and maintains the symptoms of AN, including cognitive distortion, depression and anxiety, and reward hypofunction. Current AN treatment focuses on improving food intake, caloric intake, psychological rehabilitation, and relapse prevention. Therefore, treatment of AN is essentially a difficult psychological treatment, involving high attention deficit, which is a serious mental illness often with physical comorbidities, with long duration of treatment. The average long-term relapse rate is around 40-100%, and treatment"

 <EOD> Hydrolysable Tannins Have Anti-inflammatory Properties in Colitis: A Cell-based High-throughput Screening Study in Human Cells.
SIGNIFICANCE
Inflammation is a hallmark of several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and celiac disease, and affects many people worldwide. A novel therapeutic strategy involves counteracting inflammation with polyphenols, such as hydrolysable tannins.


RECENT ADVANCES
The activity of these compounds has not been fully elucidated. Here a cell-based high-throughput screening assay demonstrated that hydrolysable tannins inhibited inflammation. We characterized the anti-inflammatory properties of three different hydrolysable tannins, as well as gallotannins and ellagitannins, in human cell lines under different inflammation conditions caused by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or LPS stimuli. We also explored the protective effects on LPS-induced colitis in mice by using a trinutrient blend as an intervention.


CRITICAL ISSUES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Hydrolysable tannins displayed the most potent anti-inflammatory effects, especially of ellagitannins. The antiinflammatory properties of hydrolysable tannins in inflammatory gut disorders requires further investigation.

The authors have observed 104 patients in the first seven years of life after gastrostomy for the prevention and the treatment of gastroesophagitis and pylorostenosis, with a median follow-up of 24 months. Thirty cases of premeditated gastrostomy and 74 cases of gastrostomy after perforated duodenal ulcer. There was, statistically significantly, a significant reduction in the number of diarrheas, number of vomits and the number of episodes of regurgitation, thus reducing and in the cases in which they were present, their severity. On clinical criteria, the gastrostomy has allowed the prevention of esophagitis in 46 out of 52 cases and the evolution of pylorostenosis to stenosis in one out of 47 cases. On paraclinical criteria (endoscopy, pH-metry), a more marked reduction in pathology of the acidification of the gastric juice was observed with a better pH, together with a reduction in the pathology of the pH-metry curves, 4 and 5 h after meals. They observe no relationship between esophageal pH or pH-metry values and the severity of the pathology. Thus, in their 7 years of experience, they agree with the method of gastrostomy for gastrosintesis, with a certain reserve of indication in the pylorostenosis. It is a reliable procedure in the treatment of gastroesophagitis and pylorostenosis of prematurity when the medical therapies have had no effect or when other, more serious, complications are observed. <EOD> Re: ‘Probing the mechanism of the adhesion enhancing effect of hyaluronan’: Doherty et al. reply
Cosic et al. have raised some interesting points in their letter to the editor. While we have not been able to provide an exact quantitative determination of the amount of adsorbed HA, we found that HA can be adsorbed from solution in a concentration-dependent manner. When HA is adsorbed at the same concentration from the blood, it significantly decreases the platelet adhesion in the blood system. These findings suggest that HA can play a role in vascular protection. We have added this data to the Results section of our manuscript as suggested. <EOD> .

BACKGROUND
Adenocarcinoma of the lung has been increasing in Korea since the 1970s. We investigated recent changes in treatment, survival analysis, and prognostic factors affecting survival in these patients.


METHODS
One hundred and six patients with adenocarcinoma were analyzed from 1978 to 1987.


RESULTS
Operability rates for IIIA and IIIB stages were 13% and 5%. Surgical procedures consisted of 88% pneumonectomy. Sixty-five patients were operable and 12 patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy; the median survival of operable patients was 46 months compared to 15 months for patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Disease recurred in 47% of inoperable patients. Median survival after failure was 21 months, and the one-, two-, and three-year survival probabilities in patients who had received chemotherapy were 27%, 22%, and 12%, respectively. In 51 inoperable patients, stage IVb (distant metastases on admission) patients showed the worst survival (3.4 months); survival in those with distant metastases treated surgically was 25 months. In 89 patients with stages III (IVa - distant metastases on admission) survival was 38 months. In 86 patients with stages I-III adenocarcinoma, no change in radiation technique, stage, chemotherapy regimen, and surgical resection did not significantly affect survival.


CONCLUSIONS
Favorable survival in stages I-III patients was due to a small number with stage IIIb; surgical removal of metastatic lesions did not affect survival. Inoperable patients have a poor prognosis, and adjuvant chemotherapy did not influence survival. Patients not suitable for surgery or respond poorly to chemotherapy should be considered for radiotherapy. <EOD> The Role of Oxidative Stress in Aging and Diseases

Aging is a universal and inevitable process that causes irreversible structural and functional deterioration in the organisms. It has been proposed that age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorders, and cancer, are in fact accelerated by the aging process, as well as by modifiable risk factors. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly generated by normal cellular metabolism and function. A small increase of oxidative stress is beneficial, because it provides homeostatic signaling by modulating various signaling molecules"

 <EOD> A systematic review of adverse events in randomized controlled trials of antiretroviral therapy with focus on the role of the study drugs in adverse events.
BACKGROUND
As many drug trials reported similar efficacy but different safety profiles for several comparable antiretroviral medications, we systematically reviewed the role of the study drugs in adverse events (AEs) in randomized controlled trials (RCT). Moreover, the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), a severe AE associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, was quantified.


METHODS
A systematic search up to January 2012 identified all RCTs in HIV-infected adults investigating the effect of ART (i.e. nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors , nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors , and protease inhibitors ) with or without investigational drugs on AEs. Meta-analyses for IRIS and the individual AEs were performed when at least two RCTs investigating the same drug combination were available.


RESULTS
A total of 241 RCTs were identified reporting on 235,554 patients. Median number of AEs reported by study was 79 (interquartile range - IQR: 63-118). The number of AEs per study was similar between NRTI/NNRTI versus triple NRTI combinations and NRTI+NNRTI/PI versus NRTI+NNRTI. However, NNRTI compared to PI and NRTI+NNRTI/PI versus NRTI+NRTI combinations were less often associated with AEs. Also, NRTI+NRTI/NNRTI/PI combinations resulted in less AEs. The risk of IRIS was similar between NRTI/NNRTI versus triple NRTI combinations and NRTI+NNRTI/PI versus NRTI+NRTI.


CONCLUSIONS
NNRTI combinations appear to be less associated with AEs compared to triple NRTIs and PI combinations. Contrary to results of single drug comparisons, AEs of combinations were similar between comparator groups and were not associated with IRIS. <EOD> A Case of Hepatic Alveolar Echinococcosis with Right Aortic Metastasis

Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a liver parasitic infection caused by the genus Echinococcus and is often inoperable due to difficulty in diagnosis and local growth. Generally, extrahepatic metastases occur in 50% of patients with hepatic AE and occur 7.8-15.1 years after surgery in these patients, although metastatic cases in clinical stage 1 have been reported. Here, we present an extremely rare case of hepatic AE that presented as a solitary enhancing lesion in the liver with multiple metastatic pulmonary nodules, ascites, lymph node swelling, and thickening of the aorta on chest CT scans. The metastasis of the hepatic AE to the aorta is very rare, and this is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, of a confirmed case of AE with an aortic metastasis.

# Introduction
Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a parasitic infection caused by Echinococcus larvae. This disease rarely spreads systemically, and distant metastasis is unusual. If distant metastasis occurs, intra-abdominal and lung metastatic nodules are the most commonly reported. However, even among these metastatic cases, extrapulmonary metastases are very rare and distant extrapulmonary metastases are very rare.
We report a case of AE that occurred on the border between the liver and the lumen of the right anterior branch of the aorta (RtB). There are no previous reports of metastasis to the intima of the aorta in AE.
This case is extremely rare because the initial clinical evaluation showed that, apart from the liver, the primary tumor existed only in the lumen of the RtB of the aorta"

BACKGROUND

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are common and treatments such as anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulators and biologicals have revolutionized IBD treatment. The number of patients with IBD undergoing surgery is low, i.e. 5-15% annually, in spite of the increasing IBD incidence. However, these surgical procedures in IBD are often complex and highly invasive. There is also a need for improvement in surgery in IBD since surgical morbidity, recurrence and mortality in IBD are high compared to surgery in other gastro-intestinal diseases. In recent years, there have been major improvements in the quality of IBD surgery and in some hospitals the morbidity after surgery is as good as surgery for other diseases. This is also the case for Sahlgrenska University Hospital (SU). This may be due both to improvement in surgical techniques but also to the more rigorous selection of patients for surgery. However, it may also be due to the fact that patients have waited for surgery longer at SU than in other parts of Sweden and in Sweden overall, e.g. for a year at SU compared to weeks at university hospitals in Stockholm and Ume a as well as in private clinics.

AIMS

In this paper we present a trial protocol of a Health economic study investigating the effects of waiting time for surgical treatment in patients with IBD. The hypothesis is that surgery after a less pronounced acute phase of the disease increases the costs for the health care system, increases costs indirectly and reduces quality of life for patients.

INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA

Patients undergoing IBD surgery 2017-2021 will be included, together with a group of outpatients that are waiting for elective surgery for more than three months but will not be operated before the end year 2021.


OUTCOME MEASURES

The primary outcome of the RCT will be the change in cost for the health care system, quality of life and surgical morbidity in patients with IBD. Other outcome measures include, but are not limited to, 90-day-mortality, surgical infections and costs for patients, societal costs, readmissions and sick-leave. Long-term effects on surgical recurrence, re-operation and costs will also be assessed.

 <EOD> .
A rare combination of primary angiosarcoma and malignant hemangioendothelioma of the lung is presented in a 50-year-old man. The patient complained of cough, and a chest X-Ray film disclosed multiple nodular shadow. At a first surgery, part of a large pulmonary mass composed of nodules was resected; the remaining tumor was totally removed after a second operation. Microscopically, the resected tumor consisted of areas of angiosarcoma and malignant hemangioendothelioma of the trabecular type. These tumors were separated by non-neoplastic lung fibrosis. Neither metastatic lesion was detected elsewhere. The patient is currently alive and in good condition 2 years after the second operation. <EOD> On the relationship between stochastic resonance and noise-induced phase synchronization.
In recent years, the concept of stochastic resonance has been extended to synchronization phenomena. In a deterministic system, stochastic noise or perturbation in the form of noise has been shown to aid the synchronization process. Similarly, stochastic resonance can be defined for synchronized systems. Based on the linear interaction of the phase oscillators, the effects of noise on the synchronization of nonidentical phase oscillators are studied in this paper. We derive that adding noise to synchronized oscillators can have detrimental effects on the stability of synchronization; the influence of noise is the same with that on the undriven oscillators. Using statistical theory, we compare the synchronized oscillators with the case that noise has no influence and find that the noise can enhance noise-induced synchronization. Finally, the effects of noise on the synchronization of nonidentical oscillators are further investigated using numerical simulations of the nonlinear phase oscillators. <EOD> Disease progression of CSF1R mutant neurodegenerative disorders in the era of precision medicine era

 <EOD> Heterologous Expression of Human Lactoferrin Induces Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and Apoptosis in a Human Melanoma-Bearing Hamster and Suppresses C3 Metastatic Tumor Growth in a Mice Model

Antitumor immunity by an innate immune system may be associated with antitumor activity of human lactoferrin (hLf) in melanoma. By using melanoma cells and a hamster melanoma-bearing model, we examined the effect of exogenous hLf on tumor metastasis. Metastasis was examined by histology and survival. In the hamster melanoma-bearing model, treatment with hLf led to increased tumor antigen expression and immune cell infiltration, resulting in the suppression of distant tumor metastasis in mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and inguinal lymph nodes. A total of 27.3% of the animals in the control group (n � 17) and 60% of the animals in the hLf-treated group (n � 18) survived, respectively, p � 0.04. By contrast, the same level of hLf exerted no antitumor effects in vitro. It was observed that hLf significantly inhibited the spread of melanoma cells in culture and suppressed metastasis in the lungs and livers of mouse melanoma-bearing mice. The same level of hLf (4 μg/L) significantly induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in vitro and increased the levels of ROS in the blood and plasma of the hamster and mice, respectively. We conclude that increased ROS generation induced by hLf is a common mechanism that suppresses melanoma metastasis in the hamster and the mouse model, suggesting that the expression of hLf is a promising target for immunotherapy of melanoma.

# Introduction
Melanoma is a cancer of the skin that may arise in any skin area, but commonly on the face, soles of the feet, and the backs of the hands. Once metastatic melanoma spreads, treatment options are severely limited. For this reason, immunotherapies to trigger host antitumor immunity are becoming increasingly popular, such as monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, and dendritic cellvaccines. Because malignant melanoma is a disorder associated with inappropriate immune function, we have hypothesized that human lactoferrin (hLf), a multifunctional iron-binding protein found in human milk and all body secretions such as breast milk, tears, saliva, urine, and seminal fluid, suppresses malignant melanoma metastasis. Lf has been proposed as a potential immunotherapeutic agent to treat infectious diseases and cancer.
Our previous studies showed that hLf was highly expressed in human breast adenocarcinoma. We were also, however, able to observe that the expression pattern of hLf was significantly decreased in breast cancer and metastatic brain tumor tissues compared with normal healthy tissues, suggesting that the expression level of hLf was associated with antitumor activity and may be suppressed by unknown cancer-related mechanisms. A significant association between decreased antibody levels to hLf and the incidence of invasive breast cancer has been reported in epidemiological studies. By contrast, the concentration of hLf mRNA in breast cancer tissue samples was significantly higher than in healthy tissue; however, when the Lf mRNA concentration in invasive ductal carcinoma metastatic tissue was compared to normal breast tissue, there was no statistically significant difference. e protein levels in cancer metastatic cells were higher than in benign tumor tissue cells. All these studies, however, were focused on hLf expression that is related to the development of cancer instead of the effect of hLf itself on cancer metastasis.
In hamster melanoma tumor-bearing animals, injection of hLf increased the survival rate by almost 4.5-fold and decreased the number of met"

Summary of Study
===================
Detailed Description
This study is a random ized controlled trial, double-blinded and performs in the patient who underwent intra-abdominal surgery. the investigators collect he data at the department of surgery, Ramathibodi hospital. This study random ized the volunteer patient into two groups, positive drainage and negative drainage. Randomization To minimize the study bias, the investigators random patient into two groups by the unassociated personnel opens an enclosed envelope after the surgical procedure is completely performed and before the beginning of closing the skin layer. Blind process This study does not conceal information about surgical technique and drain placing method. However, the investigators have controlled various surgical procedures to reduce inequality in assessment and bias. Negative pressure drainage is a drainage catheter which is placed in sur gical wound for draining fluid such as hematoma, seroma, and pus. In this study the drainage the catheter will be placed in the wound for 5 days and/or removed if fluid content is less than 20ml per day. Jackson-Pratt or Redivac catheter is used in this study because it is cheap and widespread in all hospitals. The drainage catheter is placed after completion of surgery and before skin closure. Surgical site infection is infection at surgical wound which happens within 30 days post op eratively and in this study will use in term of superficial SSI (pus oozing, cellulitis and wound culture positive). Patient case with infected wou nd and the investigators give antibiotics along with dressing, but does not stitch off suture, we do not include as SSI in this study.

*: <EOD> Assessment of genetic and environmental variations in body temperature rhythms based on the use of the cosinor method.
In general, environmental and genetic factors influence human body temperature rhythm simultaneously. It is important that the assessment method for the effects of environmental factors be developed. Because humans work and rest in daily life rhythmically, environmental changes affect the rhythm; therefore, we aimed to clarify the influence of environmental changes on rhythm by using the cosinor method. We enrolled 1042 subjects of working age; 493 men, and 610 women, whose body temperature rhythm was measured for 5 consecutive days. A rhythm model was calculated from the data by using the cosinor method. As a result, the 24-hour rhythm could be detected in most cases . The cosinor method was developed to assess the cosine fit of circadian rhythm data. To assess environmental influence, we calculated the differences between the daily temperature rhythm model and the average temperature between the subject's starting and ending points of rest. Cosine fit was good in 56.2%. This showed that the environmental variation of the circadian body temperature rhythm was suppressed by the genetic factors. Although genetic variations in body temperature rhythm were greater than environmental influences, environmental variations must not be neglected because the genetic influences were not complete. Therefore, we suggest that body temperature be measured in the field including sleep time to acquire a real resting condition. <EOD> Clinical and immunological features and genetic susceptibility in juvenile-onset dermatomyositis patients.

[/INST] [INST] The 3 FDA-approved CDK4, 6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, all provided progression-free survival benefits when combined with endocrine therapy in advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer. But, not all of them provided overall survival benefit in the same setting. One of the proposed mechanisms that influence the overall survival difference is from the different influence of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors on tumor microenvironment and / or immune system. However, there was no head-to-head comparison of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors in the same study. Neoadjuvant therapy provides a window to obtain tissue samples before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment. We aim to compare the immune modulation effects of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib with letrozole in neoadjuvant treatment for ER+/HER2- early breast cancer. We will collect tumor tissue, blood, and stool samples prospectively before treatment, at 2 weeks after treatment, and after 12 weeks of treatment at the time of surgery. Immune modulation effects will be compared between 3 treatment groups from breast tumor RNAseq analysis.

Vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) has been used in various neurotological examinations. However, data about its correlation with body sway and balance after vestibular neuritis (VN) are limited. We hypothesized that VEMP latencies would be significantly altered in post-VN patients while performing static and dynamic balance examinations. The study included postural stability examination and dynamic vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) measurement in eight, 12 patients (38) with VN. These tests were completed along with VEMP-recordings of the sternocleidomastoid muscle after caloric irrigation. Statistical analysis of the results included paired t-test. Compared with healthy controls, significantly longer VEMP P13 latency was found in both the VEMP ipsilateral ( P<0.001) and contralateral ( P = 0.024) to VN. The VEMP asymmetry ratio (AR) was not found to be significant except while standing on foam. Based on the results, both P13 latencies and VOR gain (videonystagmography ) should be considered for assessment of vestibular compensation and VEMP latencies and VOR gain for posturography evaluation. <EOD> Implementing evidence-based management in UK primary care: a mixed methods study on GPs' work practices and patient outcomes

 <EOD> The APC Variant T1712A Is not Associated with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Patients in the Eastern Han Chinese Population: A Novel Cohort of 231 Noninvasive Familial Adenomatous Polyposis

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a common inherited disorder of the colorectal tract. APC is the major FAP predisposing gene, which encodes an extremely stable protein that plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability in epithelial cells of the colon. APC mutation was shown to be associated with the phenotype of FAP and to result in the absence or aberrant expression of truncated products that lack the amino (NH2-) terminal APC coding exons that are responsible for regulation of cellular proliferation and signal transduction (1-3). APC is a target for several post-translational modifications and is frequently phosphorylated (4). One particular site of phosphorylation is Thr1712 encoded by exon 16 (numbering refers to the amino-terminal end), which is located in one of the phosphorylation sites conserved in 13 different APC orthologs from various species (5). Phosphorylation on this residue is presumed to have an important role in the regulation of APC stability by modulating the interaction between APC and chaperone-assisted processing and the recognition of APC by the proteasome (6). Some previous studies suggested that the phosphorylation site in APC on residue 1712, located within the putative beta-catenin-binding domain, is important for normal colonic adenoma formation, and that nonphosphorylated Thr1712 (T1712A) is the APC variant. To explore the hypothesis that T1712A is a risk allele of susceptibility to FAP, we performed a case-control study, in which 186 clinically well-characterized Han Chinese individuals with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation carriers (cases) were collected from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, and 45 patients without APC mutation (controls) were enrolled in the study. The study included 52 males and 34 females. The study population was divided into two groups based on age: 48 cases were in the < 70-year group, and 140 were within the >70-year group. None of the participants was related by blood. Informed written consent was obtained from 18-70 year old patients who had surgical resection performed by gastrointestinal surgery. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University. We performed direct sequencing of the coding regions of the candidate nucleotide in exon16 of the APC gene. We used an S. aureus bacterial vector to express recombinant APC fragments (exons 12-17) in Escherichia coli. Purified preparation of these fragments were used for a GST-pull down assay in order to identify the specific domain of APC that interacted with β-catenin (WT vs. T1712A). The results showed no difference between wild type APC and variant T1712A. The T1712A variant was not significant to the phenotype of FAP in the cohort, including FAP-related adenoma and carcinoma risks and ages of onset of colorectal cancer (CRC) (p>0.05). Our findings indicated that the APC variant, T1712A, was not significantly associated with the phenotype of FAP in a cohort of 231 patients with FAP from the Eastern Han Chinese population. Clinically, the role of this variant, T1712A, requires further exploration.

# Discussion and future recommendations
=================
The interventions used in the treatment of women who suffer from perinatal depression is one of the most controversial topics in the field. Some interventions based exercise have potential to reduce depresssion symptoms in a population. Women with perinatal depression are at risk of poor self-efficacy, quality of life and are also at risk of postpartum depression during subsequent pregnancies. Moreover, during pregnancy physical activity is low and this may have a negative impact on future self efficacy level and maternal health. This study aimed to assess the effect of resistance and flexibility training on depression and quality of life in women with perinatal depression. The results of this study may help health care professional to improve the health of women with perinatal depression in an economically affordable and effective way.

Detailed Description
-----------------
 <EOD> Comparison of the impact of 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 ratio of propofol to remifentanil on hypotension and intra-operative awareness

A b s t r a c tIntroduction: Intraoperative awareness is a complication that can be associated with the use of propofol and remifentanil as an anesthesia technique. In many surgeries, remifentanil is administered in continuous infusion in order to maintain the hemodynamic profile throughout the operation. Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the hypotensive effect of two different doses of propofol and remifentanil on hypotension and intra-operative awareness in adult patients undergoing elective surgery. Material and methods: Ninety patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were randomly allocated to one of 2 groups receiving 1 mcg/kg/min of remifentanil as either Group A (with an equivalent propofol dose of 5 μg/mL/min; n = 45) or Group B (with an equivalent propofol dose of 2 μg/mL/min; n = 45). Intra-operative awareness was assessed using hypnotic and verbal scales and the bispectral index was also recorded. Cardiovascular parameters such as heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded.Results: Hypotension was more evident in Group B (15 times in 45 patients, 33.3%) than in Group A (2 times in 45 patients, 4.4%), p = 0.005. At the end of surgery, Group B received more propofol than Group A, 106.5 mg versus 83.5 mg, respectively, p < 0.05. In Group B, the hypnotic scale was lower than in Group A, 3.19 and 3.89; p = 0.01 and the bispectral index was also lower 51.3 versus 42.1 in Group B, p < 0.05. No awareness was recorded in both groups. Conclusions: A 1 : 2 dose of propofol and remifentanil resulted in a better hypotensive effect than a 1 : 1 dose, with a higher dose of propofol required with the same hypnotic depth. No patients experienced awareness or recall during surgery after the propofol and remifentanil technique.

# Introduction
Hemodynamic changes are an important aspect of anesthesia induction and maintenance. Remifentanil, as an example, can cause severe hypotension, especially during major surgery, unless titrated properly. For this reason, most anesthesiologists choose to administer remifentanil in combination with other short-acting drugs in order to stabilize the hemodynamic profile throughout the surgery. Remifentanil is often administered in a continuous infusion to guarantee a stable drug concentration.
Another aspect of a stable hemodynamic profile is the maintenance of the depth of anesthesia which can be monitored and controlled by specific tools in the intraoperative period.
The hypnotic depth of the remifentanil:propofol technique has been assessed using the bispectral index (BIS). The BIS is a device that monitors the electroencephalogram (EEG) and provides a value between 0 and 100 which is proportional to the alteration of the EEG, where 0 refers to deep anesthesia, 70 to the minimum hypnotic level, and 100 to deep sedation   Use of the bispectral index system for electroencephalogram monitoring during sevoflurane anesthesia..., Fan  .

 <EOD> Clinical Assessment Methods in Evaluation of Dentoalveolar Reconstruction
An important component of clinical study designs utilizing human subjects is the evaluation of clinical procedures, treatment outcome measurements, and techniques with which to measure these end points. Clinical studies and publications of dentoalveolar reconstruction utilize various methods to document and measure the change in form, size, and function in relation to the normal. These measurement methods can be qualitative or quantitative. Each type of assessment has inherent strengths and weaknesses in the clinical setting. The clinician must possess an understanding of the validity, reliability, and reproducibility of each assessment method to evaluate treatment success. <EOD> In Vivo and In Vitro Antityrosinase Effects of the Main Phenolic Compounds Isolated from the Stems of Annona muricata L.
Consumption of Annona muricata Linn. (Annonaceae) has become widespread in health foods. In the current study, the in vivo and in vitro antityrosinase activities of the plant’s main phenolic compounds are reported. The major compounds identified included ellagic acid, gallic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, rutin, and narirutin. To evaluate their effects on tyrosinase (TYR), they were tested in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro TYR assay was performed by examining mushroom TYR inhibitory activity. The in vivo investigation of TYR activity was carried out by investigating the inhibitory effects of various concentrations of the studied phenolic compounds for 14 days using the mouse auricle model. Results showed that all phenolic compounds showed some inhibitory effects against TYR, with IC50 values of 7.4 ± 0.177 μM, 3.48 ± 0.07 μM, 3.15 ± 0.13 μM, 2.97 ± 0.03 μM, and 3.85 ± 0.05 μM for gallic acid, ellagic acid, rutin, Syringic compounds, narirutin, respectively, and also the IC50 values obtained were lower than that of the standard, monobutyl phthalate (15.60 ± 0.09 μM), which showed weak antityrosinase activity. Further investigation of the studied phenolic compounds on in vivo tyrosinase activities in mice showed a dose-dependent tyrosinase inhibitory effect for several tested concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 25, and 50 mg/Kg). This current research is the first one to examine the in vivo and in vitro effects of the main phenolic compounds isolated from the stems of Annona muricata L. <EOD> Tetralogy of Fallot in the neonate.
This study focuses attention on the neonate with tetralogy of Fallot. The neonatal mortality of this congenital heart defect is primarily related to the presence of severe cyanosis, a large ventricular septal defect, and low preoperative oxygenation status. Successful repair in early infancy is dependent upon the presence of normal intracardiac and systemic pulmonary arterial pressures, normal pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and normal pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance (PVR:SVR). Repair of tetralogy of Fallot in the neonate requires adequate intracardiac pressures. The current series of 47 neonates illustrates the current approach with 90% surgical mortality. A comparison is made to 34 neonates operated on with intensive postoperative management over the last 20 years. <EOD> Comparison of two surgical techniques in treatment of primary cleft palate: The palatal pharyngoplasty versus intrabulbar approach

Keywords: [/INST] <EOD> The Relationships of Body Mass Index, Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c), Total Cholesterol, and Triglycerides with Obesity-induced Disease in Saudi Women

The prevalence of obesity and its associated diseases is rising at an alarming rate. The objective of the study is to investigate how body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, and triglycerides are related to blood pressure, blood glucose level, and lipid profile in overweight and obese women. A cross-sectional, descriptive, community-based study was conducted in Saudi Arabia. A total of 160 Saudi women were recruited from the outpatient clinics using a convenient sampling technique. The data were analyzed using Excel and SPSS software. Pearson coefficient correlations and regression coefficient (r) were used to determine the relationships between BMI, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and triglycerides with blood pressure, blood glucose level, and lipid profile. A higher BMI was related positively to age, waist circumference (WC), fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p ≤ 0.001). The HbA1c level was related positively to WC, BMI, and glycated hemoglobin (p ≤ 0.001). The total cholesterol level was related positively to HbA1c, DBP, and blood glucose (p ≤ 0.001). The triglycerides level was related positively to the total cholesterol level (p ≤ 0.001). The data revealed that overweight and obesity are associated with a higher occurrence of cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, it is recommended to screen women for pre-diabetes, prediabetes, obesity and abnormal lipid levels for targeted interventions and prevention programs that take into account local sociocultural practices.

# Introduction
Obesity is a chronic and multi-factorial disease that causes abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that creates health hazard and risks to individuals and to society. Its prevalence is reported almost everywhere across the globe . Its prevalence has increased alarmingly in the Eastern Mediterranean region compared to European countries   The global burden of obesity and the challenges of prevention, Seidell  . There are various definitions of obesity. The most common classification measure of obesity, being universally applied, relies solely on body mass index (BMI) as an indicator of obesity (Centers for Disease . Obesity can be divided into three categories: overweight is a weight gain of 25-29.9 kg/m2, obesity is a weight gain of 30-34.9 kg/m2 and class 1 obesity is indicated at a weight gain of 35 or higher above kg/m2 .

Cancer biology has revealed the genetic heterogeneity between various phenotypes. Genetic polymorphisms of phase II metabolism-detoxifying enzymes are often suggested as modifiers of the oncogenesis. NATs detoxify chemical agents by biotransformation and regulate the availability of reactive electrophiles to tumor cells, which may alter tumorigenesis. This investigation analyzes the influence of NAT1/2 genetic polymorphisms on glioma prognosis in an Indian population. 98 healthy controls and 145 glioma patients were analyzed for N-acetyltransferase 1/2 gene polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. 64 glioma patients showed homozygosity with a wild genotype, 45 patients exhibited heterozygosity of mutant and 36 patients with a homozygosity of mutant and wild genotype.

Over the past few decades, accumulated evidence on the human gut suggests its diverse and intricate role in not only metabolic and immunologic homeostasis, but also environmental sensing and adaptation. The intrinsic complexity of the human gut allows it to function as a unique physiological organ and orchestrates the functions of other organs throughout the body. The gut has developed an array of tools or mechanisms to protect the host from exposure to the diverse environment, while also serving as a hub to integrate complex sensory information and modulate immunologic responses. Given that the gut harbors billions of gut microbiota (GM) cells, the intricate immunomodulatory functions of the gut have been largely driven by the crosstalk between the microbiota and host immunity, thus making it a black box to dissect the complex relationships. This review article presents an overview of the human gut, and focuses on the crosstalk among host immune functions, GM and environmental cues. We discuss the microbiota-driven host immunologic functions, including inflammation, antigen processing, and epithelial defense and repair, and highlight the implications of the GM-host crosstalk in pathological conditions. <EOD> Imagination or perfection: an interesting article on the pathogenesis of intussusception.
Intussusception, invagination of a portion of the bowel into the immediately adjacent distal segment, is a common and potentially devastating affliction of the young. While an abdominal mass may frequently be palpated in the patient with intussusception, the pathology of the disease cannot be fully understood without consideration of the underlying cause. Recognizing the importance of the pathophysiology of intussusception is critical to appreciating the implications of treatment and complications. In this age of increasingly sophisticated computerbased medical imaging, it is helpful to reacquaint the reader with the pathophysiology of intussusception, as suggested by Dr Dixon in this issue.1 <EOD> Duration of treatment, efficacy, and outcome in women with an ectopic pregnancy: A meta-analysis

An ectopic pregnancy remains a major cause of pregnancy-related death and morbidity. An objective of this meta-analysis was to estimate the durations of treatment of surgery, methotrexate, and intrathecal prostaglandin F2α, and to evaluate the combined efficacy and relative risk of adverse outcomes of these three treatment modalities in women with an ectopic pregnancy.A systematic evaluation was conducted using three electronic databases including EMBASE up until August 15th, 2017, to establish relevant studies. Primary endpoint were durations of treatment. Secondary endpoints included efficacy and clinical outcomes. The Cochran Q and the inconsistency index statistic, with a P < .05 to determine the heterogeneity, were used. Subgroup analyses were also conducted.The search retrieved 1997 titles and abstracts for assessing eligibility for inclusion in the present research. Eight studies were selected for inclusion in the final meta-analysis. The study included three trials on methotrexate, two on surgery, and three on intrathecal prostaglandin F2α. The durations of treatment varied widely with the surgery treatment. The combined overall clinical efficacy rates were 94.32% for methotrexate, 96.21% for surgery, and 97.45% for intrathecal prostaglandinF2α.The shortest duration of treatment for a methotrexate regimen was 7 days, 4 days with intramuscular PG and 2 days with intrathecal PG. There were no significant differences among the efficacy outcomes measured by clinical cure rate or pregnancy rate.
This systematic review and meta-analysis of non-comparative studies revealed that methotrexate, surgery or intrathecal PG, has similar efficacy in treating an EP. Intrathecal PG is associated with a significantly shorter duration than any other treatment regimen.

THERE ARE MANY methods of measuring the amounts of gastric secretion. Only a few can be used for investigations in normal subjects. A suitable laboratory method has been described recently by Mettler,12 who also described and suggested a device to standardize the gastric content for comparison from one study to the next. We have made similar measurements and found it possible, in this laboratory, to measure the amounts of residue, secretion and liquid in order to examine the relationship between gastric secretion and emesis for periods of up to 6 h. <EOD> Inhibition of B cell proliferation and differentiation by interleukin 4.
A major factor controlling the production and maturation of cells of the immune system, interleukin 4, inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of activated normal mouse splenic B cells. Interleukin 4 also inhibits the differentiation of IL 2-activated and lectin-activated thymus T cells. The addition of interleukin 4 to cultures of activated human peripheral blood B cells reduces Ig antibody synthesis. Interleukin 4 thus appears to exert a direct effect on the B cells of several species, inhibiting their proliferation and maturation. Because interleukin 4 is produced by helper T cells, the B cell-activating effect of interleukin 4 can be seen as the down-regulatory role of T cells in the control of the immune response. <EOD> 36. The role of the social determinants of health in oral health inequalities: current research

 

## 4.

## Oral health inequalities
The evidence suggests that the social determinants of health contribute to oral health inequalities. Oral health inequalities may be inequalities in disease burden, oral disease prevalence, oral health-related quality of life. Inequalities in oral disease prevalence relate to the extent to which differences exist between social groups in caries experience, dental pain, and periodontitis. Socioeconomic status predicts caries experience, which is in turn associated with poor general health. Furthermore, socioeconomic status is related to oral health-related quality of life, which is closely associated with caries disease. This evidence from the UK also holds true in other country contexts. Evidence suggests there is great concern by the public about the extent to which disparities exist in oral health for social groups in society and that people with low socioeconomic status, in particular, are the most vulnerable social groups.
A key question that can be addressed to determine causality is the extent to which the relationship between socioeconomic status and health is mediated by risk factors for social groups. Evidence suggests that inequalities in caries experience and risk factors for caries experience may be partly accounted for by access to and participation in oral health promotion initiatives and the social and community factors that may affect participation in oral health promotion initiatives.

## 4a.
Lack of access to prevention services for the most vulnerable social groups People seek out dental treatment when it is too late for prevention. Oral disease inequalities in society may be associated with a failure to adequately prevent oral disease and a failure to provide oral health promotion, education, and oral health prevention services at an individual level and at the systems level. People with low socioeconomic status are less likely to attend for care on a regular basis and are more likely to experience pain than those with higher socioeconomic status. The evidence suggests that low socioeconomic status groups use the NHS twice as many times and more frequently visit emergency dental services than other groups. Also, the evidence suggests, and suggests strongly, that oral health inequalities may be the result of a failure to prevent oral disease and provide regular, preventive care with regular topical application of fluoride, good diet, and good oral hygiene at the individual level. Evidence suggests that preventive strategies are less likely to be provided to people with low socioeconomic status, even when they have the same clinical need as other people. People who have low socioeconomic status are less likely to seek professional preventive care, more likely to smoke and drink more alcohol, more likely to be prescribed antibiotics, more likely to need root canal treatment and crowns, and more likely to experience pain. The evidence suggests that the provision of a regular preventive care"

Input Text: Transcranial Doppler Using Wearable Ultrasound Patch is a non-invasive monitoring system for blood flow in the brain. The device has a wearable ultrasound patch that consists of two probes and an electronic reader. The patch patch is designed to record a high fidelity video of blood flow velocity and vessel diameter of large cerebral vessels. The patch is a device that is in trial stage at moment. The trial phase is expected to enroll participants in the next 16 months.
The [/INSETSUMMARY] study’s goal is to compare the data collected by the wearable patch to a conventional transcranial Doppler ultrasound device during the same time frame of recording. In this study the participants will be randomized to one of the two monitoring tools. In the standard group, data will only be collected using the conventional transcranial Doppler ultrasound but for the wearable patch participants blood flow will be measured by both measurement devices simultaneously. The study is being led by a researcher at New York.
For future perspective, the wearable patch is expected to be more convenient than the conventional trans-cranial Doppler, but may cause more discomfort or concern due to its size and overall design. Additionally, a patch device could be used regularly to monitor blood flow of large vessels in the brain for patients after a heart attack.

Delivery 2020 Sep;6(3):406-409 wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/dys| INTRODUC TI ONPlacenta is considered a natural feto-maternal barrier against viral and bacterial infections. Hence, it could be an efficient guard against emerging viruses such as coronavirus. 1 Moreover, high levels of serum interleukin-6, which is produced during parturition, is reported to be associated with a successful prognosis against a wide variety of diseases among patients, including coronavirus disease 2019. 2 Furthermore, vaginal delivery is associated with a lower maternal mortality risk than that after cesarean. 3 Taking all these parameters into consideration, we hypothesized that the presence of pregnant women in ED during the COVID-19 pandemic could be associated with low mortality rates among these patients. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the association between the presence of pregnant patients in the ED and mortality among them during the COVID-19 pandemic.| METHODSThis is a retrospective cohort study conducted in three hospitals in the central region of Saudi Arabia. These three institutions are located in Riyadh, which is the capital city, and they have the following characteristics. First, they are tertiary centers that admit all types of medical conditions, including emergencies and admissions, with a triage level which classifies patients according to the severity of their condition. Second, these hospitals are considered referral centers that admit only cases that need specialist physicians (intensive care, cardiology, and neurology, just to name a few). Finally, these hospitals do not have an emergency anesthesia care system.A waiver of informed consent from involved subjects in this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the research committee at King Saud University after a review of the documents and study objectives. This study was performed according to the criteria set by the Helsinki agreement and after having received the approval of the IRB of the research committee at King Saud University.This study included all emergency patients admitted to three hospitals in Saudi Arabia from early March until the beginning of May 2020.

A Summary of a Clinical Trial

By [your name] on [date provided]

Summary: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from April 20, 2019 to May 1, 2019. In this study, 70 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomized to undergo either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). At 3 months after surgery, 28 patients in the CABG group and 26 in the PCI group were included in the final analysis. The median duration of hospitalization was 20.5 days (IQR, 19.0-21.6) in the CABG group and 18.0 days (IQR, 17.0-18.7) in the PCI group (P=0.012). Compared with patients in the PCI group, the patients in the CABG group had better left ventricular function as determined by the change in left ventricular myocardial mass (LVM) and myocardial strain (P=0.016), lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (P=0.014) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) (P=0.009), and lower levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (P=0.044), brain natriuretic peptide (P=0.020), and C-reactive protein (P=0.001). The changes in cardiac troponin T and creatine kinase were not significantly different between the CABG and PCI groups (P=0.638 and 0.187, respectively). In the CABG group, the decrease in LVEDP was associated with the increase in 3-month left ventricular ejection volume, and the decrease in LVEDVI was associated with the increase in the change of GLS. The change in LVM was not significantly associated with the change in GLS. GLS was significantly associated with LVEDP at 3 months after surgery.

# Abstract

Male and Female patients of 18 to 70 years of age have been recruited from the outpatient and inpatient department from December 2019 to December 2020 at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), New Delhi. The study involved a single-center, parallel-arm trial of 60 decompensated cirrhotic patients from a total number of 84, requiring treatment with albumin. Of these, 44 cases with serum albumin levels ≤ 2.5 g/dL, within 48 hours of admission, were enrolled in the albumin supplementation study (Albumin group) after obtaining written consent, while the remaining 40 cases with serum albumin levels >2.5 g/dL within 48 hours of admission were considered as the standard of care group. Standard of Care group patients were treated as per standard medical practices. In the Albumin group patients, infusion of albumin was initially done with a loading dose of 10 g of albumin diluted with normal saline to a final volume of 200cc. The maintenance dose was 25% albumin by body weight, and infusion was repeated with a frequency of up to thrice a week to maintain the serum albumin level ≥ 3 g/dL. Primary outcome data include changes in clotting time on ROTEM in both the groups, which were noted on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 by observing and recording changes in the following parameters: the time taken for clot formation (clotting time); the time taken for maximum clot formation (MCF); the time taken to clot formation normalized by the time taken for the first clotting (clot formation time/clotting time); and the amplitude at MCF. The secondary outcome data included changes in inflammatory markers like ESR, CRP, IL-6 and TNFα. Endothelial dysfunction was measured and evaluated using the ADAMTS-13 and VWF. The impact of albumin supplementation on the cardiology profile was evaluated by assessing the LFT and LVDP parameters. The adverse effects were also recorded for both the groups. The mortality and the morbidity data were recorded for all the cases. A total of 62 patients, out of 64 patients, fulfilled the outcome criteria for final analysis, with 33 patients in the Albumin group and 29 patients in the Standard of Care group. The overall mean clotting time in patients was 4.96 seconds on day 0 and 4.23 seconds on day 7 (p<0.05). There was a significant improvement in all the ROTEM parameters with albumin replacement: time to clotting normalized in both the groups but was significant only in the standard of care group (p<0.05). The clotting time in the standard of care group improved but did not reach significance (p>0.05). ESR and CRP levels decreased in both the groups but the decrease was significant only in the Albumin group. There was a significant improvement in IL-6 but the decrease in TNF-a was significant only in the albumin group. LVC and LVP increased significantly in both the groups. The mortality in the Albumin group was 2.2%, which was comparable to 13.8% in the standard of care group. The mortality rate in the albumin group was 1.71/1000 patient-days, which was significantly lower than that in the standard of care group at 11.35/1000 patient-days (p<0.001). The adverse effects of albumin infusion included hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-related extravasation. The hypersensitivity reactions included fever, rashes, and anaphylactic reactions, out of which 7 patients experienced. Three patients experienced anaphylactic reactions. The only death in this group was a patient who experienced an anaphylactic reaction. Three patients experienced extravasation, with two of them experiencing grade III extravasation"

# Methods

## Study participants and blood samples
Blood specimens were obtained from 223 patients at the Sino-UK Infectious Disease Trust Medical Research Collaborating Centre, Guangxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention , Guangxi, China, before they received combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) or other ARV treatment. Demographic information (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity, and geographical history) was collected. Viral load, CD4 cell count, and drug resistance were measured by the standard protocols of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Guangxi. The clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients were summarized according to a recent report   Characterizing HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in Guangxi, China, from, Zhang  . For the phylogenetic analysis of drug-resistant variants, the patients were divided into 3 groups: group 1, drug-resistant strains with no previous NRTI treatment history; group 2, drug-resistant strains with a history of NRTI-based cART with the appearance of resistance to NRTIs; and group 3, drug-resistant strains containing a NRTI/NtRTI drug-resistance pattern.

## Hiv subtyping
The env gene encoding V1 to V5 gp120 was used to determine HIV subtypes. Viral RNA was extracted from 200 µL of each purified plasma sample by a QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription PCR of genomic RNA was performed with the FirstChoice HIV-1 RNA Amplification Kit (Hoffmann-La Roche), which is based on 2 sets of primers: primer 1 (MSP 1940/1941) and primer 2 (MSP 2208/2209). The first-round PCR, nested PCR, and sequencing were conducted according to previously described procedures   Diversity of HIV-1 genotypes in Guangxi, a southern province of China, Ma  . HIV-1 genotypes and subtypes were identified by MLEE (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/ CORE_ML/index.html) of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The sequences were aligned with the subtypes M, A, C, and G of HIV-1, and sequences of CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC downloaded from GenBank.

## Recombinants detection
The recombination breakpoint map was constructed based on the neighborjoining phylogenetic tree inferred from partial pol sequences.

Background:
The current study was carried out to compare for the first time the safety and efficacy of propofol and ciprofol which has similar sedative effects without significant renal or respiratory effects, for the sedation of hypotensive patients admitted to ICU.
Summary:
This is a prospective cohort study, the inclusion criteria were: (1) age 18 years or older; (2) hypotension after ICU admittance; (3) required sedation with either propofol or ciprofol for comfort, safety and to facilitate life support measures; (4) signed or witnessed informed consent; (5) obtained the informed consent of the human subjects. The exclusion criteria were: (1) pregnancy; (2) propofol and ciprofol were used alternatively within 24 hours; (3) researchers judged that participants were not suitable to participate in this study.
A total of 180 hypotensive subjects were included in the study and all of them enrolled by professional researchers in the ICU. The clinical data were collected and included adverse effects of ICU related syndrome.
Background:
Hypotensive patients admitted to the ICU often require sedation for comfort, safety and to facilitate life support measures. Propofol, a drug that has similar sedative effects to ciprofol but lacks the safety of ciprofol. The current research aims to compare efficacy and safety between ciprofol and propofol.
Background:
Currently, the drugs commonly used for sedation in ICU patients are propofol and dexmedetomidine(1). Propofol is the most commonly used sedative in ICU patients who require mechanical ventilation or who are under continuous sedation. Propofol is widely used in adults, but it is difficult to find in the market because propofol is a short-acting lipid emulsion. The use of propofol requires strict monitoring and attention to the safety of patients during the course of treatment. Furthermore, it is closely related with the occurrence of multiple organ failure (MOF) (2). Ciprofol is a newer sedative that is a new form of propofol and a long-lasting anesthetic designed to avoid propofol related side effects such as respiratory depression and hypotension in clinical use. It has significant sedative effect, fewer side effects, as well as similar hemodynamic characteristics with propofol (3).

The study has been funded. A consilium was organised. 74% of the prematures (184) are under 32 weeks and the others 26% are between 32w and 37w without significant difference of weight. 71% had a complicated necroticing encoylitis (n = 175) and 29% (n =46) of them had a localized encoylitis. 83 babies are still hospitalised due to their enterocolitis (83%, n =172) with 38 in the experimental group (38%, n = 98) and 45 with the control group (35%, n =104). The average of the age at admission was 22 days 11 with 20 days and 28days in the experimental group and control group respectively with p = 0,02.

--- <EOD> Dual Phosphate-Modified Hollow Carbon Fiber for Ultrahigh-Speed Sodium Ion Storage and Na+ Host.
Fast charging sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are desirable; however, it is challenging to make high-voltage positive electrodes because of the poor Na+ intercalation kinetics of intercalation materials as well as slow diffusion kinetics of Na+ in the electrolyte. Herein, a facile coating method is used to fabricate a core-shell hollow carbon cathode with abundant Na+ hosts and defective structures. The core-shell structure, the coating layer, and the Na+ binding hosts synergistically improve the sluggish insertion kinetics of the electrode material. Therefore, the coin cell can reach 45 mA h g-1 (86% capacity retention) at 10 A g-1 for 1000 cycles. This is the state-of-the-art record for high-rate sodium-ion batteries. Furthermore, using a fast charging strategy, the battery can reach high energies (13.5 Wh kg-1). This work opens a new door for realizing high-rate full-cell SIBs by improving the sodium-ion kinetics of positive electrodes and enlargeing the ion diffusion of electrolytes. <EOD> Intraperitoneal ruptured renal abscess – a case report

The authors report a 69 y old male patient. The patient was admitted by gynecology unit for acute abdomen. Abdominal CT scans showed in the upper left quadrant an inflammatory process with multiloculated fluid density image, with dimensions of up approximately 7.5 cm, adherent to the upper part of the liver anatomical plane, and at a distance with the rectosigmoid section and large bowel, with a slight parietal invasion. In its vicinity, in the region of upper pole kidney an abscess was suspected. The patient was admitted as an emergent case from the gynecology clinic, his condition requiring an urgent laparotomy which was performed, with the finding of a massive hemoperitoneum, due to a ruptured abscess, with dimensions of up approximately of 80 × 100 mm, originating from a left kidney abscess penetrating into the upper rectum, in the vicinity of the left adrenal and left renal vein tributary. After removing of the abscess, a left kidney nephrectomy was performed, followed by a hemostatic suture and an omentoplasty to fix the rectosigmoid section. The patient is on postoperative evolution, no complications having manifested after the intervention. Renal abscesses are very rare, not frequently encountered. The case we present it is an atypical, intraperitoneal rupture of a renal abscess in a male patient, without any risk factors.

Summary
The objective of this study is to determine the evolution of plasma BD-tau levels from acute ischemic stroke for the first 48 hours for patients with a large-or medium-vessel occlusion stroke. The results will inform the course of BD-tau after the acute phase of stroke.
Study design and methods

Patients 18 years of age and above admitted to a specialized Stroke Center because of an ischemic stroke due to large-or medium-vessel occlusion within 9 hours of onset and an imaging confirmed ischemic core volume > 18mL will be included in the study. Patients will be excluded if they have a pre-stroke Rankin Scale score > 1, severe renal failure with a glomerular filtration rate < 30ml/min/1.73m2, a history of ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, spontaneous or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, encephalitis, or a history of CNS tumor in the last three months. The primary outcome measure is the evolution of BD-tau levels and quantification of the ischemic core volume. The secondary outcome measures are ASPECTS on non-contrast CT, Ischemic core volume on CT perfusion at onset, Regional leptomeningeal collateral score on CT angiography at baseline, Final infarct volume, Infarct progression, 90-day functional outcome, 7-day functional outcome, and early recurrent ischemic stroke. The expected enrolment is 100 patients with a completion date of October 2025.

By employing an immunoabsorption method using affinity-purified rabbit antibodies, and by developing a method for the radioimmunoassay of the intact precursor, the immunological characteristics of the recently proposed beta-lipotropin precursor in rat pituitary were evaluated. The antibodies did not cross-react with various rat, guinea pig, and human beta-lipotropins, ACTH, or ACTH-related peptides. After extraction with chloroform, all of these were recovered in the precipitate, which indicates that beta-lipotropin is not a covalent dimer of ACTH. The precursor, which was released by the acid digestion of pituitary glands, contained both beta-lipotropin- and alpha-lipostatin-like molecules. On SDS-PAGE, these two peptides were shown to be located in the 50,000 and 20,000 range, respectively, thus being distinguished from all of the other peptides in the molecular-size range examined. Moreover, from the immunohistochemical studies of the rat pituitary, these two factors were shown to be located in the acidophils and gonadotrophs, respectively, indicating the beta-lipotropin and alpha-"

Since the control of A. veronii in farmed fish by means of antibiotics can induce antibiotic resistance (AbR) development in their pathogens, the discovery of novel therapeutic measures, such as the inactivation of bacterial virulence through biofilm disruption or cell lysis, is needed.

A numerically analytical method is proposed for the study of the nonlinear dispersive wave propagation through the nonlinearly dispersive medium. The present method is shown to be a fast and reliable alternative to the conventional numerical simulations, since it takes into account the phase evolution during propagation. As an illustrative example, a wave evolution around an oscillating boundary layer in the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation is considered. The results show that a strong transverse wave amplification is produced, which gives rise to an interference pattern. <EOD> Intravenous immunoglobulin prophylaxis in siblings heterozygous for X-linked agammaglobulinemia.
BACKGROUND
A randomized trial demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prevents acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in children with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), but the benefits in siblings who are heterozygous for XLA have not been fully evaluated.


METHODS
To assess the efficacy of IVIG prophylaxis in siblings with XLA, we undertook an open-label, randomized, prospective study of IVIG in heterozygous siblings (n=16) with XLA. Participants were randomized to the treatment group (n=10; monthly IVIG) and the control group (n=6), which received no intervention. The outcome measures were the number of ARTIs, antibiotic therapies, and acute otitis media per year; IgG, IgM and IgA levels; and blood pressure, pulse, and weight.


RESULTS
During the follow up period, the treatment group subjects had a significantly lower incidence of ARTIs compared with the control group (11 vs 32% respectively; P=.02). In the treatment group, infection-free survival was also significantly improved compared with the control group (P=.03). During the follow up, subjects receiving IVIG showed an increasing trend in the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA. In contrast, no changes were noticed in the infection rates of subjects not receiving IVIG.


CONCLUSIONS
Subjects with XLA who were on IVIG showed significantly fewer hospitalizations than untreated subjects. IVIG does not appear to alter blood pressure. <EOD> Hedgehog signaling is required for brown adipogenesis in vivo

Study Overview
____________________

Rationale: NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Presently, relative clinical guidelines focus on weight loss through appropriate diet and lifestyle. The GLP1-ras and SGLT2-is agents constitute novel agents that seem to exert beneficial effects beyond glycemic control. [INST] Dulaglutide will be used of the GLP1-ras family and Empagliflozin from the SGLT2-is family. Research question: Is the use of Empagliflozin or Dulaglutide effective in improving liver fat fraction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NAFLD? Which is more beneficial? Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that both Dulaglutide and Empagliflozin have a role in treating patients with DM2 and NAFLD. Aim of the study: To compare the effect of Dulaglutide and Empagliflozin in liver fat fraction of diabetic patients after a year of treatment. Objectives: Assess liver steatosis in patients. Determine percentage of those with >30% liver fat concentration reduction. Compare Empagliflozin group with Dulaglutide group and Control group. Evaluate the impact of the medications used on glycemic control, weight loss, liver enzymes, lipids and the Fatty Liver Index (FLI), the Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4), as well as the Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet ratio Index (APRI) and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS). Materials: Study will be conducted in the 2nd Department of Internal Medicine of Hippocration General Hospital, and the Therapeutic Department of General Hospital Alexandra, Athens, Greece. Type of study: This is a prospective open-label observational study. Patients will be allocated into three groups: group 1 will receive oral Empagliflozin, as add-on to their previous treatment regimen, for 52 weeks. Group 2 will receive subcutaneous Dulaglutide, as add-on to their previous treatment regimen, for 52 weeks. Group 3 will receive other optimal antidiabetic treatment (apart from agents of the GLP1-ras or SGLT2-is families) for 52 weeks. Intervention: Patients in group 1 will receive Empagliflozin, 10mg a day, as add-on to their previous treatment regimen. Patients in group 2 will receive Dulaglutide, weekly starting with 0.75mg a week and increased to 1.5mg if weight loss is not achieved, as add-on to their previous treatment regimen. Patients in group 3 will receive other optimal antidiabetic treatment (apart from agents of the GLP1-ras or SGLT2-is families) for 52 weeks. Clinical study variables: In addition to routine history and physical examination, we will record blood pressure, height, weight, and waist circumference. Medical history and complete physical examination will be documented in paper form. Information about clinical and laboratory markers, blood glucose and A1C will be recorded at baseline and at 12th week. All participants will receive Ultrasound of liver and abdomen at baseline visit and at the end of 12th week. Blood test and ultrasound will be done in the morning after fasting 10-12 hours before treatment. Blood tests include: Liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Gamma Glutaminyl Transferase (GGT), total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobinA1c (HBA1C), and serum creatinine. All blood tests will be done at the 2nd clinical laboratory of Hippocration General Hospital, and with the same methodology. Fasting liver ultrasound examination will be performed"

Preview: <EOD> Fusion inhibitory peptides: effect of charge distribution and residue identity.
Efforts to design peptide inhibitors that bind HIV-1 gp41 are focusing on identifying those peptide sequences that possess maximum inhibitory activity with the fewest number of potentially critical residue-residue interactions involved. In the current studies, two of the previously published peptide sequences have been modified to increase their inhibitory potency, while maintaining their resistance to endothelial cell degradation using endogenous proteinases. Modifications of the HB-100 and JB-31 peptide sequences and various peptides based on the first 22 N-terminal amino acid sequence of gp41 have been synthesized, and the activities of these peptides correlated to amino acid composition as well as the charge distribution of various peptide variants. The highest inhibitory activity occurs with a net-positive charge of about 8, and with little specificity for positively charged residues at key locations in the peptide. <EOD> Glycogenesis--regulatable and adaptable to environmental temperature.
We studied the regulation of glycogenesis in the small intestine by determining the effects of temperature, hormones known to affect small intestinal enzyme activities, starvation, and diabetes. Glycogen levels were measured at various times and temperatures, either in tissue homogenates or in homogenates to which glucokinase or glycogen synthetase preparations had been added. The results of our studies suggest that, although intestinal glycogen can be phosphorylated as well as dephosphorylated in response to the hormonal and metabolic changes studied, glycogen synthetase seems to be the more important enzyme with regard to the regulation of glycogen synthesis. <EOD> Identification of Aedes japonicus in Central Europe—What It Means for Us

Detailed Description

1. SYNOPSIS OF THE STUDY Sponsor / Sponsor-Investigator Sponsor: Prof. Kerstin von Plessen Sponsor-Investigator: Prof. Daniel S. Schechter Investigator: Mrs. Sandra Rusconi Serpa, MSc, FSP Study Title Feasibility of a brief manualized psychotherapy for traumatized mothers and their young children: Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) Short Title / Study ID CAVEAT Feasibility Study Protocol Version and Date Version 1.0, DATE Study registration Registered on international register (clinicaltrial.gov) provisionally Study category and Rationale This feasibility study conforms to a clinical trial of category A Background and Rationale The present study aims to determine if the manualized brief psychotherapy Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure-Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) can be administered to violence-exposed mothers and their young children (ages 1-5 years) in the ambulatory care center of a Swiss public hospital (SUPEA, CHUV) during a psychotherapy of 16 sessions. CAVEAT is based on an amalgam of four existing evidence-based psychotherapy models (Child-Parent psychotherapy, Parental Mentalization, Interaction Guidance, Prolonged Exposure) for parents, infants and young children and traumatized adults that led to the novel, core therapeutic technique developed by Prof. Schechter and colleagues, who has shown it to be successful in two open trials. From the existing literature, the investigataors know that parent-child relationship-based psychotherapies improve significantly maternal sensitivity to their child's communication, which is in part based on maternal capacity to perceive more accurately the young child's emotional communication and to take the child's perspective. Moreover, dyadic psychotherapy models using video-feedback and support of parental mentalization have been shown across models more generally to improve the quality of mother-child interaction. Risk / Benefit Assessment The risks of participating in this study are estimated as minimal (category A). The proposed intervention involves standard, validated psychotherapeutic procedures with the addition of clinician-assisted videofeedback exposure to naturalistic challenges that are typically stressful for young children and that are in situation by the clinician in collaboration with the child's mother during the filmed parent-child interaction sessions. This latter technique has been used without complication in both mental health referred and non-referred pediatrics samples with positive clinical effects in both studies. The investigators estimate that the risks of such an intervention are therefore limited. Though, if a matter arises that is severe, urgent or cannot be dealt with in the psychotherapy as conceived in the model, based on the therapist assessment, proper interventions and/or referrals will be made. Regarding the potential benefits An increase in maternal ability to take her very young child's perspective

To respond more sensitively to the child's developmental needs and emotional communication,

To be aware of what triggers post-traumatic stress during parent-child interactions,

Reduction in re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions, and hyperarousal in day-to-day life with one's child ages 1-5 years and/or problems with their parenting

Acquisition of increased tools for self and mutual regulation and stress-reduction during are benefits of participating in the study. If this form of manualized psychotherapy proves feasible to administer in a child and adolescent psychiatric ambulatory care center at the CHUV, this with child and mothers who have experienced IPV and who present to the clinic with concerns about their child's risk for emotional and/or behavior difficulties and/or who note relational disturbances with their very young children ages 1-5 years and/or problems with their parenting."

BACKGROUND
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the industrialized countries. It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity even in locally advanced disease. A multidisciplinary approach and an individualized treatment algorithm is required in order to improve survival rates of lung cancer patients with the most advanced disease. The aim of the present article is to investigate whether these patients would benefit from a multidisciplinary approach and if so, in which disease stages it would be most beneficial.


METHODS
Data was searched in the National Danish Cancer Database and from the medical records of all lung cancer patients who died in the Central region of Denmark during the period from January 1 2003 to May 31 2003. The case notes, operation notes, pathological reports and chest X-rays were reviewed, and treatment and survival were evaluated. Two radiotherapists reviewed the chest X-rays and defined local tumor control as local tumor growth without symptoms and no further need for radiotherapy. The data was analyzed by a logistic regression model.


RESULTS
Four hundred and sixteen patients had lung cancer (216 men and 200 women). The median age was 68 years. Nine out of ten patients died of their disease. The 1-and 2-year survival rates after diagnosis of lung cancer were 6 and 3 %, respectively. The risk factors for increased risk of death in the 6 months after diagnosis were: stage IV, large cell lung cancer, weight loss, bone metastases, male gender, low Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and no treatment within 1 month after diagnosis. The risk factors for the 1-year survival rate were: non-adenocarcinoma, large cell lung cancer, stage IV, weight loss, CCI 2.5, male gender and non-surgical treatment.


CONCLUSION
The survival of lung cancer patients treated in the Central Region of Denmark is poor. Surgical treatment and treatment with chemotherapy is associated with a better survival in stage III while none of these treatments had a significant effect on 1-year survival in stage IV. <EOD> Mammalian DDX42, with Distinct Functions From its Ciliary Paralogue DDX60, Plays a Role in Telomere Repeat Addition Processing and Telomere Length Regulation

Telomeres are capped by a TTAGGG repeat sequence that is essential for chromosome stability and maintenance. Human DDX60 and its mouse orthologue (Rck) were previously shown to be involved in telomere length maintenance, and its mutation caused shortened telomeres in immortalized cells. In this study, we investigated the functional overlap of human DDX60 (hDDX60) with its closely related paralogue, hDDX42. Expression levels of hDDX60 and hDDX42 in immortalized cells were highly correlated. While hDDX60 overexpression prolonged telomere length and led to increased TERRA levels, hDDX42 overexpression led to telomere shortening and decreased TERRA levels. A dominant-negative hDDX42 mutant abolished telomerase activity and telomere synthesis, indicating that hDDX42 is critical for telomere maintenance. Our data demonstrated that hDDX42 and hDDX60 play opposing roles in regulating telomere length in immortalized cells. We also discovered that hDDX60 bound to histone H3 and repressed the expression of TAOK3. Our data indicate that mammalian DDX60 and DDX42 have functional divergence from their ciliary orthologue (C. Elegans), and also suggest the involvement of the RNA helicases in repression of hTERT by hDDX60 as well as binding to histone H3 by hDDX42.

# Introduction
The ends of linear chromosomes are progressively shortened with each round of replication; a process termed telomere shortening, which is accompanied by oxidative damage. This shortening leads to replication stress and cell cycle arrest, prompting human cells to activate the enzyme telomerase to compensate for telomere loss. Telomerase adds short telomere DNA repeats (TTAGGG)n to the 3"

A 19 year old male developed a fulminant subdural empyema following a trauma. After surgical evacuation the patient's condition improved steadily. Three years after the trauma and the subsequent disease the patient developed a left-sided exophthalmus with optic nerve dysfunction, a pachymeningitis interna and a dural calcification. In his family history three persons suffered from recurrent sore throats. Therefore the disease was classified as part of the Parinaud's syndrome. <EOD> The Role of Glycogen in the Development of Experimental Epilepsy
Summary: The involvement of glycogen metabolism in a genetically defined experimental epilepsy, the tottering (tg) mouse, was determined. Glycogen content was increased in the cortex of the tg mouse by 30% compared with age‐matched wild‐type littermates. In the tg animal, glucagon, a stimulator of glycogen metabolism, induced a marked reduction in the duration of the seizure burst but had no effect in age‐matched wild‐type. These data suggest that the elevated levels of glycogen are involved in protecting these animals from the severe seizures that occur naturally after a high‐frequency stimulation protocol. <EOD> N, S co-doped mesoporous carbon composite with superior supercapacitor performance.
We designed and prepared N-S co-doped mesoporous carbon (N-S/HC) composites to improve the electrochemical performance of the carbon. The N-S/HC composite synthesized using citric acid as the nitrogen source has high specific surface area (1519 m(2) g(-1)) and high mesopore volume (0.64 cm(3) g(-1)). Moreover, the nitrogen (4.07 at%) and sulfur (3.41 at%) contents are high, and can serve as abundant pseudocapacitance storage sites, thus obtaining excellent specific capacitance (143.3 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and 78.0 F g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)). <EOD> Pre‐operative chemotherapy and radiation therapy of cervical cancer: the St Peter's Cancer Institute experience

Networks provide a social context for health-promoting behaviors. In this study we investigate how individual characteristics (HIV stigma, self-efficacy, and group efficacy) within communication networks were related to HIV prevention, testing, and care among men who have sex with women. A total of 179 HIV-negative African-American men, recruited from community-based settings, completed 24 monthly interviews via telephone. Within-person effects of the communication network components indicated that being surrounded by people who are knowledgeable about AIDS (b = 0.021, p < .05), who talk about HIV prevention (b = 0.018, p < .05), and who had had HIV testing at baseline (b = 0.014, p < .05) were consistently related to greater self-efficacy at 12 months. Contrary to expectations, individuals surrounded by more knowledgeable others were less likely to receive HIV testing at 9 (b = −0.010, p < .05) and 12 months (b = −0.018, p < .05). <EOD> A novel mutation of the ELOVL4 gene in autosomal dominant Stargardt disease

 <EOD> Gender differences in left ventricular strain and torsion during exercise: a 3-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography study in young adults

Background: There are currently no data on gender in differences in left ventricular (LV) mechanics by using three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (3DSTE) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) during exercise in young adults.Methods: 3DSTE and TDI were performed before and after exercise in 162 healthy, young adults (72 males, 80 females; age 22 ± 6 years). Peak values of longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain (LAS, CAS and RAS), torsion and twist rate were recorded. Laminar and rotational annular velocities were derived by TDI and time to peak torsion was calculated. LV diameters and ejection fraction (EF) were obtained by 2D echocardiography. Results: At rest, peak longitudinal values of strain (LAS), torsion and twist rate were lower in males than in females (LAS: -17 ± 4 vs. -19 ± 3 %, p < 0.05; torsion: 0.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.5°, p < 0.05; twist rate: 0.76 ± 0.26 vs. 1.01 ± 0.36 deg/s, p < 0.05), whereas longitudinal and circumferential velocities of shortening were higher in young men. Post-exercise, circumferential and radial peak strain values decreased similarly in males (CAS: -15 ± 5 vs. -14 ± 5 %, p = ns; RAS: -39 ± 18 vs. -36 ± 22 %, n.s.) and females (CAS: -14 ± 6 vs. -12 ± 6 %;RAS: -35 ± 10 vs. -31 ± 19 %, n.s.). After exercise, peak torsion and twist rate remained unchanged in men (torsion: 0.8 ± 0.3 vs. 0.8 ± 0.4°; twitch rate: 0.75 ± 0.24 vs. 0.76 ± 0.26 deg/s, n.s.), but decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in females (torsion: 1.0 ± 0."

To review a colonoscopy and ensure that the entire large intestine is explored to the highest standard is a key element to ensure the success colorectal cancer screening programs. Colonoscopy withdrawal time and the adenoma and polyp detection rates are the most-used parameters for this. The adenoma detection rate (ADR) is closely linked to compliance rate with bowel preparation solutions. The aim of this study by Colonoscopy and CRC screening in Marseille (CCSM) and Centre hospitalier val de Seine Paris Sud is to improve adenoma and hyperplastic detection rate and consequently adenoma detection and compliance rates and decrease the adenoma and polyp miss rate (AMR).

Input Text: Low-Glycemic (LGI) Diet in Pregnant People With Epilepsy

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
People with epilepsy who are planning for pregnancy or are pregnant have concerns about anti-seizure medication (ASM) treatment, as some ASMs increase the risk of major congenital malformations and can negatively influence cognitive outcomes in developing offspring (Tomson et al., 2018, Meador et al., 2021). Non-pharmacologic epilepsy treatments, such as specialized diets like the low glycemic diet or the modified Atkins diet, are not well studied in pregnant people with epilepsy but have proven to be effective in reducing seizures in the non-pregnant population. Dietary influence on seizure control is likely multifactorial, and recent studies have shown that one mechanism of action is to cause changes in the gut microbiome and alter neuroactive downstream bacterial metabolites, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (Olson et al., 2018). The low glycemic index (LGI) diet is one of the most flexible dietary therapies for epilepsy, and it appears to be safe in pregnancy with positive health outcomes for both the mother and baby (Walsh et al., 2012). Unfortunately, little is known about the effectiveness and mechanism of the LGI diet in pregnant patients with epilepsy. Therefore, the investigators propose this study in which the LGI diet will be initiated in the first half of pregnancy and explore LGI diet tolerability, seizure frequency, and potential underlying mechanisms in the pregnant epilepsy population. Investigators will invite pregnant people with epilepsy up to 20 weeks gestation in the Brigham & Women's Epilepsy-Obstetrical clinic to participate in this study. Participants will choose to go on the low glycemic index diet or continue their standard diet, will a goal of enrolling 21 participants in a 1:2 intervention to control group ratio. Participants in the intervention group will meet will a dietician to initiate the diet and have ongoing dietician support and appointments. All participants will fill out diet questionnaires and provide a maximum of 3 stool samples and 3 blood samples. Dietary intervention will end when pregnancies end, and stool and blood samples will be collected up to 3 months postpartum. The main outcomes will be diet tolerability, seizure frequency, gut bacteria composition, and metabolite alterations.

Treatment schedule:
-----------------------
The participant will receive 50 ml of MSLN CAR-T cells. The MSLN-targeted CAR-T cells are isolated from the patient's lymphocytes to be infused with CAR gene transfer. The cells will be cultured and then delivered by EUS guidance. The first infusion of targeted CAR-T cells is anticipated to begin 2 weeks following the patient's lymphopharesis.
|
| MSLN CAR-T cells will be delivered with the infusion needle as follows.
|
| A 25-gauge needle is used for the initial 0.5 ml of infusion. In addition, 0.5 ml of NaCl is delivered to flush the needle and ensure a seal around the needle tip. The needle tip is removed from the needle sheath, and the entire needle is retracted slightly to provide a smooth transition into the abdomen and into the stomach. The tip of the needle is kept at the pylorus and the CAR-T cell mixture infused at a slow rate (0.05 ml/min). If the first 0.5 ml is noted to be difficult to deliver, the needle is placed at the pylorus, infusion is resumed using a 0.5 ml syringe and 0.2 ml of NaCl is infused. A total of 1 ml of CAR-T cells is infused into the stomach. If the stomach is considered small, 0.5 ml of CAR-T cells can be infused under the oesophagus to ensure an additional 1 ml of CAR-T cells distal to the stomach. The needle is then brought out of the body and a 38F catheter is placed into the stomach to maintain a pneumo-gastrogram for imaging.
Treatment plan
----------------
CAR-T cell injection. Endoscopy will be undertaken, and then the study agent will be administered by EUS guided injection into the stomach.
|
| The study agent is MSLN CAR-T cells derived from the patient's lymphocytes. Two weeks following lymphopheresis, 50ml of lymphocytes will be isolated and cultured in the cell culture lab by cell culture technicians. The CAR-T cells will contain a CAR gene which binds to pancreatic cancer cells (mesothelin).
|
| CAR-T cells will be prepared by retrovirus to insert a CAR-T gene to each T cell. This CAR-T gene encodes a membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor fused to a truncated human CD3zeta molecule, which binds specifically to mesothelin and activates the CAR-T cell to secrete tumor necrosis factor and interferon gamma, leading to apoptosis of mesothelin expressing cancer cell. This therapy has been validated in mesothelin expressing animal cancer models and patients' clinical response.
|
| The CAR-T cells will be cultured for at least 5 days on day 0 following lymphopheresis in order for the CAR-T cells to proliferate. Then 50ml of CAR-T cells will be harvested and packaged with infusion needles, and will be kept in liquid nitrogen until injection in the clinic. The procedure for CAR-T cell preparation, activation and injection will be performed at the Shanghai General Hospital by medical staff. This CAR-T cell has been tested in mice and in patients, and results of phase I/II clinical trials have been published. The CAR-T cells have been used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer; there were only minor side effects, except the risk for autoimmune diseases, and long-term treatment could be available through multiple cycles. For example, in a phase I/II study for pancreatic cancer, the side effects from the CAR-T cells were mostly mild with a very low incidence of moderate cytokine release syndrome and no treatment-related death (16 patients). The long-term outcomes still need further evaluation due to limited numbers of patients. Currently there is an open-labelled clinical trial for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Study ID: NCT04116643).

Detailed Description


[/INST]
The primary objective of this study is to assess the DSS web-based solution and machine learning web application effectiveness in fostering adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a cohort of 100 Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients over a three-month period. Adherence is assessed by calculating the number of pills taken divided by the prescribed amount.

[/INST] Secondary
Objectives

Identify clinical factors (comorbidities, pain presence, tumor type, treatment type), psychological parameters (personality traits, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy for coping with cancer, sense of coherence, risk perception), and QoL variables that serve as predictors for patients' adherence to OATs. These predictors are utilized to assess nonadherence to OATs among MBC patients and enhance the initial version of a machine learning model developed in the retrospective study (R1595/21-IEO 1704).

Data for the secondary endpoints are collected using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 23-item Breast Cancer-specific Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-BR23), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).
Furthermore, to evaluate psychological variables, the following measures are used: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Index-II, the Big Five Inventory, the Cancer Behavior Inventory CBI Short form, the Sense of Coherence, and Risk Perception (utilizing two Visual Analog Scales.
Trial Duration and Study Design

 <EOD> A simple approach to calculate the surface pressure of supported lipid bilayers from fluorescence reflection spectroscopy.
This paper reports on the use of a simple method to accurately predict surface pressure (Pi), or, by extrapolation, the contact angle, of supported planar lipid bilayers from fluorescence reflection spectroscopy (FRS) data obtained with a ruthenium(II) complex covalently incorporated in the lipid chains. In situ monitoring of Pi by fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out; the FRS data were reproducible, and in accord with Pi, as calculated from the elliptitude of the fluorescence spot obtained with an image analysis algorithm. FRS experiments on different supported planar bilayers were carried out from the initial state to a state of compression leading to the disappearance of the fluorescent probe. FRS data were successfully fitted by modeling the decay of the complex's fluorescence signal to an exponential equation, the Pi dependence of the fluorescence lifetime of the ruthenium(II) complex in the lipid layers being directly calculated from the FRS data using the Lambert-Beer law. The obtained lifetimes and pressure values were compared with those theoretically calculated by means of a model developed for planar lipid bilayers with a fixed geometry. Good agreement was found between the experimental and theoretical data. Thus, FRS may be used to obtain Pi values at the interface with relative accuracy and ease of use. <EOD> The role of preoperative ultrasonography in early detection of uterine rupture in pregnant diabetic women having caesarean delivery.
Diabetic pregnancies are at greater risk of developing maternal, fetal and obstetric complications. Uterine rupture (UR) is an obstetric emergency and life threatening complication of pregnancy which requires immediate diagnosis and management. <EOD> A new paradigm for caregiver education: online patient and family advisors in the palliative care setting
Patients/families are active partners in the healthcare system and advocates for self and others. The role of patient and family in palliative care has expanded to include consultation on topics relevant to their care, education, and engagement as a team member. These opportunities to improve clinician/staff knowledge increase team understanding and efficiency and foster collaboration, resulting in better quality care. In this pilot study, patients/families are being recruited to participate in a palliative education program (Joint Symphony), where their role as a partner on the care team is highlighted. A series of 20 patient/family education discussions are planned to occur every other week, facilitated by a palliative care clinical nurse specialist and an ad hoc clinician from the primary service. Subsets of content are tailored for patients/families and clinical staff, and these two segments can occur on different dates. Themes for patient/family sessions include comfort, anxiety, depression, medicines, and advance care planning. For clinical staff, topics include medicines, interprofessional team function, ethical considerations, resources, and cultural considerations. Educational videos for both patient/family and clinician audiences will be created to supplement knowledge and skill. Participants will complete pretests assessing palliative care knowledge and attitude using validated questionnaires. Participant experience and satisfaction will be assessed, as well as education participant acceptance, knowledge, and attitude, using validated instruments and structured interviews. The proposed study will determine whether online sessions with palliative care patient/families and clinician participants are beneficial, and whether the model can be duplicated to train clinical staff, ultimately improving quality and delivery of care. <EOD> .

 <EOD> SAT-056 Diabetes Insipidus in Acromegaly
Abstract Background: Diabetes Insipidus (DI) occurs in 1.9-2.8% of individuals with acromegaly. While DI is more commonly a component of an active inflammatory process (central DI), in acromegaly the cause of DI is more commonly pituitary necrosis in the context of uncontrolled acromegaly. However, DI occurs in acromegaly even in the context of good disease control. Case presentation: A 63 year old female with a type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years prior, at baseline BMI of 28, and normal renal function presented with generalized fatigue, weight loss, and dry eyes. Her acromegaly had been diagnosed 6 years prior (IGF-1=910 ng/ml, IGFBP3=3.0µg/ml) and had been poorly controlled (IGF-1=561ng/ml, IGFBP3=2.3µg/ml, GH=3.0 ng/ml). She had a positive GH stimulation test (0 minutes GH 3 ng/ml, stimulated GH over 12ng/ml) with mild suppression of IGF-1 to 555ng/ml following acromegaly treatment for 5 months. She is presumed to have central DI due to a pituitary tumor and underwent an endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of the tumor. During resection, the pituitary stalk had been torn leading to acute central DI, and subsequently required desmopressin. After the resection, she then stabilized at a GH level of 2.7 ng/ml and IGF-1 of 396 ng/ml 2 years post-surgery. She remains on desmopressin and acromegaly treatment. This patient has a relatively high suppression of IGF-1 in comparison to previous studies that show a correlation between degree of suppression and DI, and the incidence of DI varies between 6.2-13% in patients with >90% suppression of IGF-1 levels. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the complexities of acromegaly treatment and highlights the significance of good control to limit the complications of acromegaly. <EOD> Effects of a multifaceted intervention to implement evidence-based paediatric palliative care guidelines in paediatric oncology in Colombia: a pilot study



## Strengths and limitations of this study
► The Colombian Paediatric Palliative Care Working Group developed a national quality-improvement intervention programme based on evidence-based guidelines and local data to improve paediatric palliative care in Colombia. ► The intervention was based on successful projects and programmes by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Joint Committee to Implement Children's Oncology Group Evidence-Based Guidelines. ► This is the first report of a paediatric palliative care study in Colombia, where there is an urgent need to expand access to palliative care services, improve implementation of evidence-based practice and promote health equity in the region. ► A key strength of our study was the combination of a national, multifaceted intervention with evaluation of process measures of implementation and impact on paediatric cancer providers. ► The small sample size and short follow-up period hinder generalisability.

# Abstract
Objectives A national cohort of paediatric oncologists in Colombia were trained during 2016 to implement an intervention to implement evidence-based recommendations for improving paediatric palliative care. The objective was to improve paediatric palliative care in Colombia by increasing the proportion of the following elements in practice: advance directives in over 80% of patients with advanced cancer, early initiation of palliative care in over 40% of patients with advanced cancer, and inpatient death rates lower than 25%.

 <EOD> Anatomical Variation of the Superficial Temporal Artery and Vein: A Prospective Study and Meta-analysis on the Cadavers
Objectives. The superficial temporal artery (STA) and vein (SV) usually locate in the subcutaneous tissue before entering the deep temporal fascia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anatomical variation of the STA and SV in the subcutaneous phase. Methods. The study included 210 patients. The STA and SV were dissected after they enter the deep temporal fascia. A literature search and descriptive study were conducted to provide a wide overview of the STA and SV topographic variations in the South Chinese Han population and combined a meta-analysis on cadavers from other three countries. Results. Overall, a total of 2405 (2267 in the meta- analysis) temporal artery and vein from 953 cadavers (2223 temporal artery and vein in the meta-analysis) were obtained. The total rates of the two vessels were divided into five parts by the branch position (the number of the part that divided by the total number of temporal artery and vein in the subcutaneous phase) during the dissection in cadavers. A total of 27.46% of STA and SV were classified into C-I type, and then followed by 13.53% in part A-I, 10.97% in part A-II, 7.21% in part B-I, 2.88% in part B-II, and 2.86% in part A-III and B-IV. Based on the above data, a preoperative nomogram was established to predict the incidence of various phenotypes. The nomogram showed good calibration and discrimination in the test and validation cohorts. Conclusions. The findings would offer valuable guidance on individual protection, facial esthetic surgery, and other related applications. <EOD> Transducer calibration for acoustically large fields: a parametric array approach.
An exact but demanding approach to calibration of unfocused cylindrical transducer arrays in acoustically large fields is presented. By reformulating the formulation of the field for arbitrary array shapes, the basic transducer properties are rewritten in terms of the array aperture instead of the number of elements. An array factor can then be defined as the product of array properties in one dimension. This has the advantage of being applicable to most types of array, including two-dimensional arrays and arrays of arbitrary shape. The array factor approach is illustrated on the problem of calibration of focusing transducers. Arrays of the form V(R) = 0 can become unfocusing (negative) under appropriate conditions, with the possibility of focusing-defocus-focusing-defocus sequences in real life. One such property is studied more fully; the effects of transducer size and directivity are also investigated. <EOD> Tissue-specific up-regulation of angiotensin-1-converting enzyme in human type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
CONTEXT
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in cardiovascular and metabolic function, and its contribution to the pathophysiology of diabetes and vascular complications is increasingly recognized.


OBJECTIVE
Our aim was to determine in vivo whether diabetes affects the activity of different components of the RAS in arterial and venous tissue.


SUBJECTS
Thirty subjects with type 1 diabetes, 32 subjects with type 2 diabetes, and 27 healthy control subjects were included in the study.


SETTING
The study was carried out in the research laboratories of the University of Sheffield.


DESIGN
We measured angiotensin-II generation in tissues incubated in the absence and presence of angiotensin I using a specific and selective radioenzymatic assay for that peptide.


RESULTS
The conversion of Ang I to angiotensin II was significantly higher in arterial walls and venous tissue in type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects compared with that in controls. Activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was significantly up-regulated following administration of glucose to arterial walls and venous tissue, whereas there was no activity increase in type 1 or type 2 diabetic"

 <EOD> A Case Report of Conjunctival Myxoma

Myxomas are rare, rare, benign tumors of mesenchymal origin. Due to their rarity, its preoperative diagnosis is not easy. A 77-year-old white male presented with a left ocular condition. The tumor was located in the left conjunctiva, with a small part located in the sclera and the cornea. It was completely excised together with 3-4 mm of the surrounding normal tissue. The diagnosis of left conjunctival myxoma was established on the basis of the histopathologic study. This report aims to present a rare case of left conjunctival myxoma in a patient who was surgically treated and had an uneventful postoperative course.

# Introduction
Myxomas are rare tumors originating from mesenchymal tissue with different sites of predilection around the body. Etiology of the myxomas is unknown; however, these tumors are rarely seen in the central nervous system, soft tissues, skin, heart, breast, stomach, lungs, pancreas, parathyroid gland, thyroid, thymus, adrenal gland, testis, adrenal gland, and mesentery.
It is known that the ocular region and other parts of the eyeball are not common locations for myxomas. The cornea region is the most frequent localization for myxomas occurring in the eye. Myxoma on the conjunctiva is not a common site for the tumor. However, conjunctival and the intraorbital myxomas are reported in the literature.

## Case report
A 77-year-old white male with a history of retinoschisis was referred to our center with a complaint of left ocular condition for 6 months . Intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg in both eyes, and the visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/32 OS. During the ophthalmological examination the left conjunctiva was swollen and there was a whitish-pink mass of approximately 6 × 3 mm with a smooth surface on the left eye. The margins of the mass were soft and movable. The intraocular pressure was measured and the orbital examination was carried out. There was slight restriction in extraocular muscle movements in left eye. Based on this physical evaluation, conjunctival myxoma was considered as a possible diagnosis and computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (USG) were performed. In the CT scan, it was revealed that the soft tissue mass was located on the left eye and intraocular structures of eye were not affected by the mass (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). On USG examination, the soft tissue mass measuring 6 × 4 mm was detected as a homogenous hypoechoic lesion. There was no significant finding on abdominal and chest USG evaluations.
The patient underwent surgery on the left eye under general anesthesia. The mass was easily enucleated together with the bulbar conjunctiva. The enucleation procedure was performed via the conjunctiva-conjunctiva method. The conjunctival incision was performed using a conjunctival knife and the mass was removed together with the surrounding conjunctiva. The whole width of the mass in the conjunctiva was cut and a part of this width was excised from the adjacent structures (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). The surgical margin was healthy and no suspicious mass was observed in the surrounding tissues. In order to prevent the spread of the tumor during the surgery, no attempt was made to separate the mass clearly from the normal tissues.
The histopathologic exam of the mass was reported with the diagnosis of myxoma . Histologically, loose myx"

 <EOD> Evaluation of the effect of anesthetic creams on the cutaneous electrical conductance

Evaluation of the effect of anesthetic creams on the cutaneous electrical conductance*Evaluation of the effect of anesthetic creams on the cutaneous electrical conductance*
Science
7727To the Editor:
We have read with much interest the very meticulous description by Kandel et al. (1) from 2009 regarding the effect of anesthetic creams on the cutaneous electrical conductance (CEC), which was reported in their recent article (2). We have some observations to share with the authors based on our recent publications and, as such, hope that it would further facilitate a more meaningful discussion. For example, we have reported that although the effect of lidocaine anesthesia on CEC in the upper arm is not different in a short-term (<3 hours), the CEC becomes significantly higher in those patients receiving lidocaine anesthesia of the skin after 6 hours (3). Although the authors were discussing the effect from the previous studies of local anesthesia with topical anesthetic creams, we believe this an interesting observation and it would be interesting to have a similar investigation that focuses on skin that has been anesthetized by topical cream in further studies. This would be more interesting and relevant because the effect of local anesthetic creams might be affected more by the site of anesthesia and, therefore, may not always be directly related to whether local anesthesia has been applied. However, we must note that we have very recently completed an investigation on topical anesthesia and local anesthetic creams, but this is still awaiting publication. This was performed at the University of Bristol at the end of 2016. The subjects who participated in the study were 8 women and 2 men (mean age [years] = 38.2) with a clinical indication for laser surgery for the removal of tattoos, either a cosmetic tattoo or a traumatic tattoo resulting from a car accident, in which the topical anesthetic cream was applied in order to provide a pain-free procedure. The procedure involved 100-nm laser spots of four wavelengths, ranging from 532 to 578 nm, with energies ranging from 25 to 50 mJ/pulse in order to produce a whitening effect on the skin. The local anesthesia was applied for 30 seconds, followed by a rinsing procedure for 60 seconds and a waiting time of 60 seconds after which the laser treatment was started. This study showed a significant difference in the CEC before, during, and after anesthesia. The skin that received anesthesia showed a greater decrease in CEC over the 30-minute period of the investigation, which may indicate a different biophysical composition of the skin, which may be dependent not only on the site of the anesthetic cream but also on the localization of the cream. Further studies have shown the same effect (3), in which a more significant effect was observed in the arms when compared with the leg area, because of higher blood flow in the limb (3,7). In addition, in the arm area, the CEC showed a decreased conductance that was less consistent than in the leg site. Also, in the arm area, an increase in the CEC at 6 hours after the procedure was observed and might indicate some inflammatory response on the skin surface, as well as an impaired biophysical skin structure, or a different biophysical surface tension, because of swelling, which resulted from the local anesthetic cream. As it is a well-known phenomenon that the skin surface conductance of the skin can reach up to 4 mS/cm 2 under direct current (DC) potentials (3). However, our results showed the mean difference in the initial surface conductance between the lower and upper arm was just more than 0.15 mS/cm 2 , which could be attributed to differences in the composition of subcutaneous fat, hairs, and sebum on the skin surface. Because the site of the application of the local anesthetic cream, the type of vehicle, the composition of"

We report a highly conductive, sensitive, and flexible pressure sensor based on polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers. Conductive PANI nanofibrous networks with different conductivities were fabricated by electrospinning with and without the addition of a doping reagent. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the PANI nanofibers without doping were randomly entangled and disorganized, while nanofibers containing doping reagent (0.1 M ammonium peroxodisulfate) were more uniformly stretched to afford a more ordered network structure. Under application of a force that is not higher than 80 kPa, the resistance of the PANI nanofibers is sensitive to mechanical strain because of the bending deformation of the PANI nanofibers, while the resistance increased dramatically because of the PANI nanofiber breakage under higher pressure. The PANI nanofiber-based sensor can detect a wide range from 80 kPa to 500 kPa with an ultrahigh sensitivity of 212 kPa–1 and 264 kPa–1 for forces higher than 100 kPa and 300 kPa. A maximum strain of 56% and excellent conductivity retention of 88.4 and 78.4% were realized under large-scale elongation and cyclic loading. The PANI nanofiber-based pressure sensor also exhibited excellent durability with negligible changes in resistance under various environmental conditions. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the sensor was also affected by environmental parameters, such as temperature. A 3D demonstration of the applicability of the pressure sensor on human fingers and palms verified its usability in the detection of human motion in daily life. Our results show that the PANI nanofiber-based pressure sensor, as an alternative to commercially available sensors, is promising for a variety of flexible and wearable electronic applications. <EOD> Acetaminophen‐induced liver failure and pregnancy
A 22-year-old woman was admitted because of severe pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen and fever. She had taken acetaminophen (paracetamol) regularly for 11 days prior to admission, for pain relief associated with a 37week pregnancy. Within 18 hours of starting the acetaminophen regimen, she had developed a continuous frontal headache, intermittent vomiting, epigastric pain, and high fever. She had a low-grade fever, nontender hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. The liver enzymes (SGOT, SGPT, SGDR) had risen to three times the normal values and her serum was albumin and globulin-negative. The serum bilirubin levels were normal, and the prothrombin time was prolonged and the partial thromboplastin time was normal.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in treating refractory cystitis after urinary diversion.


METHODS
From July 2001 to January 2007, 10 patients with urinary catheters in situ underwent TAE treatment for refractory cystitis, 8 with ileal conduit after nephro-ureterectomy for carcinoma, 2 after radical cystectomy for bladder carcinoma. TAE was applied by 7-F super selected balloon and a 1-L solution of ethiodized oil (lipiodol) was injected. Follow-up data on efficacy and catheter changes were recorded.


RESULTS
Mean volume of lipiodol administered was 425.2 (100-900) ml. Post-embolization leakage was noted in 9 of 10 patients immediately after TAE. All patients achieved catheter and bladder control in 24 hours, and only one case developed extravasation of lipiodol and a persistent leakage. The mean follow-"

Input Text: Autism Clinical Risk Factors Investigation With Microbiome and Metabolome Profiling

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairment in communication and social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. 1%-1.5% of children in developed nations has ASD, This rate is said to range between 0.15% and 0.8% in low- and middle-income countries.
Over the past decades, the prevalence of ASD has increased worldwide. Scientists have been trying to explore the molecular mechanisms behind the pathology of ASD. Several evidence suggests that genetic factors such as chromosomal abnormalities and environmental factors like diet and stress are involved in the pathogenesis and advancement of ASD. Accumulating research has demonstrated the gut-brain axis or multiple biochemical signaling pathways that take place between the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the central nervous system (CNS), and its possible association with ASD.
Mounting evidence explains that gut microbial dysbiosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), coeliac disease (CD), and ASD. A Recent Egyptian study showed that an evidence of changes in the gut microbiome of ASD children compared to the unrelated controls. However, the microbiome profile of siblings was more like that of autistic children than that of unrelated controls. These observations may highlight the importance of the interplay between environmental and host genetic factors in shaping the gut microbiome. The study also emphasized the importance of identification of microbiome and specific microorganisms' changes that can be targeted for diagnosis as well as for treatment of ASD. This study aims to investigate clinical risk factors of autism and to elucidate the changes in gut microbiome in Egyptian autistic children and their possible correlation with clinical outcomes and the severity of the disease.

Input Text: Effectiveness of Internet-based Self-help Money Management Program among Adult With Severe Mental Illness

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Money management is necessary for people with severe mental illness (SMI) to live safely in the community. Financial disability is consistently linked to adverse outcomes. Most patients with SMI struggle to meet basic needs on their existing income and many of them are living in poverty. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based self-help money management program on improving financial self-efficacy and its associated adverse outcomes among those with SMI. It is hypothesized that (1) participants receiving money management would improve financial self-efficacy after the intervention as compared to the wait-list controls; (2) participants receiving money management would have better financial well-being after the intervention as compared with those in controls. It is anticipated that participants receiving the money management program will demonstrate a significant improvement in financial well-being, financial behaviour, financial attitude, psychological well-being, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction over time when compared to the wait-list controls.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, and the prevalence of this rhythm will increase dramatically in the next decades. Several therapeutic strategies are available to reduce the high AF associated morbidity of thromboembolic event and heart failure. However, AF recurrence is still the most important clinical problem in the management of these patients.

The central effects of halothane/nitrous oxide on acetylcholine metabolism were studied in anaesthetized, paraplegic rats. Compared with controls, halothane/nitrous oxide caused a four fold increase in the formation of H2CO3 and (14)CO2 by acetylcholine in the dorsal and ventral horn. The rates of acetylcholine carboxylase activity were unchanged whereas those of acetate carboxylase activity were significantly increased. In the grey matter of the ventral horn, glutamine-1-C14 incorporation into acetylcholine was not affected under halothane/nitrous oxide (0.75 MAC) whereas that into acetylcholine-O-1,2-C14 was significantly decreased, indicating that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors were tonically active during halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia. <EOD> Nitrogen incorporation at the C5 position of the urea molecule by the nitrogenase enzymes.

In this paper, we provide an overview of this concept and describe the various factors involved in risk of addiction to exercise. Exercise as an addiction can represent a source of pleasure and social recognition but it can also become a way to compensate for life difficulties or cope with stressful periods of life. In some cases, the risk of dependence to exercise can be the trigger of several psychiatric or somatic disorders.

 <EOD> Improving the efficiency of drug discovery by systematic literature mining and data management.
Over the last few years, the number of publications on drug discovery has increased. However, the impact of recent publications on drug discovery has been limited. The drug discovery community has realized the importance of using published information and has taken actions to improve the availability of this information. For example, drug-discovery-relevant data and information, including compounds, assays, and publications, has been curated in the ChEMBL, PubChem, and PubMed databases. The availability of both chemical structures and bioassay information facilitates the in silico-driven optimization of compounds that are active in a particular target. The ChEMBL database focuses on chemogenomic research, whereas the PubChem and PubMed databases focus on drug discovery and provide a wider coverage of the drug-discovery field. An efficient approach that employs the drug-discovery data and information in the databases to drive the chemical optimization is essential. The computational tool, PubFinder, performs a systematic search and retrieval of relevant molecules that are bioassay active in a given target using a large volume of published information. A user study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency. Thousands of compounds that include 17,000 ChEMBL compounds were retrieved through PubChem by the PubFinder with systematic literature mining. The PubFinder enabled a user to retrieve bioactive compounds of 25,656 that were tested against the 17,000 ChEMBL compounds in multiple chemical screens. Most (59%) of them were active against the selected 17 targets. Thus, the PubFinder is effective for the efficient chemical optimization of compounds that are active in a particular target. Eighteen bioactive compounds have been synthesized under the project funding provided by NIH within 3 years.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a low-cost bicycle helmet education program on bicycle helmet use and bicycle commuting among university students. University students ( = 4,532) aged 18-29 years old completed a questionnaire. They were asked to report their helmet use in the past year, bike helmet availability in family, past experience of falls while riding a bicycle, and the time spent while commuting. They were also requested to sign up for bicycle helmet education program if they did not have a bicycle helmet and/or had not heard of helmet and bicycle safety previously. After enrolment to the program, participants were received information/education, a helmet demonstration, and were fitted with a bicycle helmet free of charge (in total, 160 participants received both educational and bicycle helmet provision, and the average time between receiving education and bike helmet was 12.4 ± 12.6 weeks). Two follow-up interviews were conducted, the first three months after they received a helmet and the second 6 months after that. The chi-square test ( = 0.001) and Fisher's exact test ( = 0.02) revealed that bicycle helmet education program significantly increased bicycle helmet use (at follow-up 1, 81.25%; at follow-up 2, 97.11%). The chi-square test ( = 5.92) and Fisher's exact test ( = 0.001) revealed an increased proportion of bicycle commuting among participants 6 months after the bicycle helmet education program (at follow-up 2, 40.69%). The bicycle helmet education program was effective in increasing bicycle helmet use and bicycle commuting among university students.

This comment is published with permission from the journal. (Gut Liver 2016;10:542-545)
Dear Editor, Since late December 2019, a novel form of highly communicable and transmissible coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged, first in China and then rapidly disseminated worldwide. As of April 24, 2020, more than 2,322,000 cases have been diagnosed with more than 155,000 deaths. Italy is currently the second country with the highest number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection worldwide, where a dramatic increase of patients infected with COVID-19 was recently detected. As of April 24, 2020, more than 194,000 cases of COVID-19 infection have been reported in Italy with 23,000 deaths, most of which occurred in the Lombardy Region. In this scenario, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represent a particularly vulnerable population at risk for COVID-19 infection, in particular during the early phase of its course. In this context, in our area, we have started to perform regular telephone interview in all patients affected by IBD in order to assess clinical course and disease activity, in order to reduce the risk of patient intervention without consultation or visit.We evaluated 1,263 IBD patients (741 Crohn disease patients, and 522 patients affected by ulcerative colitis), followed up in outpatients' clinics from 4 reference Gastroenterology Units in Milan, Italy. Most of them (76.2%) received biological therapies (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, or vedolizumab) as compared to 23.8% of patients affected by IBD that received immunosuppressive therapies alone (azathioprine, methotrexate, and 6-MP). The study was retrospectively approved by the Local Ethical Committee of Humanitas Clinical and Research Center (approval code: 4060/2020, approved on March 16, 2020).In this cohort, no case of patient who required hospitalizations or intensive care unit (ICU) admission was detected so far.

Local excision for organ preservation in early rectal cancer with no adjuvant treatment

Description: Local excision for organ preservation in early rectal cancer with no adjuvant treatment.

Meaning: Rectal cancer is diagnosed in more than 3500 new cases every year in Spain. The majority of the cases correspond to pT1N0M0 cancers with a survival of close to 90% (95), and even more when local organ preservation by transanal approach (TA) is carried out (100) (96). The aim of this study is to analyze the survival of patients who have received transanal excision for cT1N0M0 rectal cancer in daily practice. Additionally, the efficacy of this approach to preserve the rectum, as well as the risk of TME, will be evaluated. A new approach in clinical research is to create patient registries to assess the survival of patients and to standardize therapeutic options. The aim of the registry is to collect data prospectively to evaluate the effect of TAMIS on the rectum preservation rate, quality of life, survival and recurrence rate. It is important to consider this option as a new possible therapeutic option, in order to maintain rectum function, with equivalent survival compared to patients submitted to standard treatment TME for cT1N0M0 rectal cancer.

  <EOD> A method for determining the efficacy of a vineyard insecticide to reduce aphid populations.
A method is described that can be used to evaluate the efficacy of an aphid-control treatment, in this case treatment with an insecticide, by determining the effect of treatment on the number of winged (Aphis gossypii; Glover) adults. To do this, the number of winged adults produced in flight-cage olfactometers over a 24-hour period was determined. In a series of unreplicated small-plot field cage experiments the mean number of winged adults, per olfactometer, that emerged from treated and untreated vines in the 24-hour period was assessed to obtain estimates of the control values of different treatments. The response of treated plots to aphid infestation, as shown by the proportion of leaf area infested by aphids, was then compared to untreated control plots. If treatment causes a significant reduction in either the mean or the variance in number of winged adults produced from treated vines compared to untreated vines, the treatment should give rise to significantly reduced numbers of winged adults entering the olfactometers and hence lower levels of infestation on the control plots. The method is demonstrated for the grape aphid on Vitis vinifera and can be readily adapted for the assessment of insecticides against any insect pest of any crop in general. <EOD> Chorea Associated with Cervical Scoliosis Mimicking Syndrome of Transient Neurological Dysfunction in Childhood (TANDCOM)

[INST] <EOD> Comparison of intraoperative and postoperative prognostic factors of pancreatic adenocarcinoma after laparoscopic or open distal pancreatectomy: A single-center retrospective analysis study

Background: Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) has been widely used for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, the comparison of prognostic factors between LDP and open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) for pancreatic cancer has not been well elucidated. This study was an attempt to compare the intraoperative and postoperative prognostic factors between the two surgical methods.Methods: Clinical data of patients, who underwent distal pancreatectomy (DP) in the Department of General Surgery of Shenzhen People's Hospital from January 2018 to October 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. Cox regression analysis was performed to find independent risk factors for postoperative prognosis. In addition, the nomogram model was established and verified for the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent DP. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: A total of 112 patients with pancreatic cancer underwent DP, with 58 in the LDP group and 54 in the ODP group. The postoperative complications (65.5% vs. 81.5%, P=0.048) and readmission rate (9.1% vs. 24.1%, P=0.029) in the LDP group were lower than those in the ODP group. The average number of lymph nodes in the LDP group (13.1 ± 3.6 vs. 11.7 ± 4.2, P=0.036) was higher than that in the ODP group and the number of lymph nodes metastasis (LNM) in the LDP group (3.6 ± 4.0 vs. 6.3 ± 7.2, P = 0.048) was lower than that in the ODP group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the average number of lymph nodes in DP (HR: 1.665, 95% CI: 1.038-1.762, P=0.021), the lymph node metastasis (LNM) ratio of DP (HR: 1.397, 95% CI: 1.089-1.718, P=0.009), and the body mass index (BMI) (HR: 0.802, 95% CI: 0.671-0.960, P=0.011)were poor prognostic factors of DP. The C-index of the nomogram model was 0.641 (95% CI: 0.551-0.728). The mean time of the decision curve was 0.073. The mean time of the clinical impact curve was 0.214.Conclusion: DP for pancreatic cancer has many types of postoperative complications. Compared with the open surgery (ODP), laparoscopic surgery (LDP) not only has a lower incidence of complications and readmission rate, but also has a higher lymph node excision and decreased lymph node metastasis. LDP is safer and more effective than ODP, making it the first choice for resection of pancreatic cancer. In addition, the number of lymph nodes in DP, the ratio of lymph node metastasis in DP, and the BMI of patients were independent risk factors for the prognosis of pancreatic cancer. The nomogram prediction model established based on the above factors helps determine the survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer.

 <EOD> Role of EZH2 in tumour progression and identification of EZH2-associated oncofetal gene expression profiles

Background: Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) gene family, has been implicated in many epigenetic-regulated pathways and plays an important role in tumour oncogenesis.Methods: The gene expression profiles of 283 epithelial ovarian cancer were evaluated using a gene expression microarray. The mRNA expression was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. To examine the effects of EZH2 gene silencing, siRNA was introduced to transiently knockdown EZH2 expression in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Western blot and cell cycle analysis were performed to examine cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in silencing cells. Results: Our study identified six subgroups with significant differences in clinical features. The expression pattern of the EZH2 gene in epithelial ovarian cancer patients was correlated with survival and response to chemotherapy, particularly in high grade disease. We revealed that a higher EZH2 level was correlated with a worse survival. A significantly higher EZH2 expression was found to be associated with advanced stage, serous histology, high grade and large tumorous size. Transient EZH2-knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation and S phase accumulation in cancer cells but not in normal cells. Knockdown of EZH2 expression caused a cell-cycle arrest at the G 1 /S transition by up-regulating p21 and cyclin D1 expression levels. More importantly, in epithelial ovarian cancer cells, an EZH2-knockdown also stimulated the expressions of several oncofetal genes, including β-hCG, hCG-β and GABR. Conclusions: The data shows a negative correlation between EZH2 expression and survival of epithelial ovarian cancer patients, and an EZH2-knockdown cell inhibited cell proliferation in cancer cells at least in part by inhibiting cell cycle progression. In cancer cells, an up-regulation of oncofetal gene β-hCG stimulated by EZH2-knockdown highlights its possible role in cancer initiation and progression.

The paper explores the transition to Circular Economy in the Wine industry starting from the analysis of the life cycle of the product in three main areas: production, distribution, and consumption. The use of a set of indices for the assessment of the three phases highlights the opportunities for a sustainable pathway. Then, case studies involving the application of Circular Economy solutions, such as cradle-to-cradle redesign of the wine bottle, the use of grape pomace as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor in natural wines, the production of natural musts from alternative grape varieties, are introduced and discussed. Finally a set of policy recommendations aimed at improving the implementation of Circular Economy solutions at the international and regional level are suggested, based on the need of stimulating green behavioral change.

# Introduction
The wine industry is one of the most relevant in the European and Italian economy. In 2019, the sector amounted to €25 billion and 249,000 jobs. Its relevance comes from the fact that the quality of the wine depends not only on the product itself but also on the territory where it is born. The concept of ""terroir"" refers to the uniqueness of a geographical area with its particular attributes that give the particular quality of the wine.
In other words, the wine is the result of a chain of production processes that start with the ""terra"", continue within the oenological chain with the ""vineyard"", then with harvest, vinification, and fermentation, up to the final product, ""wine"".
To this point, the wine industry has traditionally taken place with a linear method of production, selling a large amount of product that is not directly made from the waste of the previous harvest.
However, the wine industry is currently experiencing a change that aims to achieve higher production efficiency and to be based on sustainable consumption. The need for sustainable development has been expressed in all areas of the economy and society; indeed, this is clearly expressed by international agreements such as the European Union Strategies, 1 the United Nations Global Strategic , including the Declaration of Human Rights and the Rights of Animals. Therefore, a shift towards the circular economy is needed, in order to find solutions to the unsustainable use of resources, pollution, and waste of energy, both at the domestic and industrial level. One of the main sectors in the economic, agricultural, and social fields is the winemaking (wine is not the only product, indeed there is also grape must, grapes, wine musts, etc.).
Italy is the world's leading wine producer. However, the Italian wine industry is a highly vulnerable industry with respect to the competitiveness of the export market as it is characterized by a low rate of internal and foreign competitiveness, a weak technological innovation and an inadequate coordination of the productive chains.
The importance of the wine industry in the national economy has led the Regional Operational Programs (POR) to devote significant funding to the wine sector, by means of interventions to reduce the costs associated with the production chain and to enhance its competitiveness. In particular, the regional operational programs funded projects, like the ""Oenological sustainability of vineyards, wineries, and distribution in Italy"" or ""Vinis-Climato"", a project aimed at evaluating the sustainable economic path to be pursued in the wine sector, as well as defining best practices for green transition.
In the agricultural sector (especially in the wine industry), the transition toward green strategies should be focused on the adoption of new technologies that promote a better use of space, as well as the reduction of risks in the production, processing, packaging, transport, and marketing phases.

 <EOD> The TGFβ Receptor ACTR2 Promotes the Stemness, Invasion and Metastasis of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer via Phosphorylation of Smad2 (S)
Ovarian cancer has an overall low 5-year survival rate of only 25%. The advanced stages of the disease are often only treated by surgery and chemotherapy. Hence, identifying molecular targets and biomarkers that can be used for prognostication, early detection, diagnosis and treatment in patients is of paramount importance. In this study, we determined that the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor ACTR2 (activin receptor type 2) is highly expressed in cancerous ovarian cells and plays a crucial role in regulating ovarian cancer stemness and metastasis. Genomic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data demonstrated that ACTR2 was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissue and its expression was correlated with poorer overall and disease-free survival. In vitro studies further substantiated the results with both immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, using ACTR2-knockdown human OVCAR3 (ovarian carcinoma) and SKOV3 (ovarian carcinoma) cells, we showed that depletion of ACTR2 resulted in: (i) downregulation of the stemness marker CD44, the CD44+/CD24− phenotype, and CD44+/CD24−/low putative cancer stem cells, as well as (ii) reduced invasiveness and migration compared with the controls. In order to substantiate the regulatory role of ACTR2 in stemness, the levels of ACTR2 as well as stemness markers were analyzed from ovarian cancer ascites (n = 8), and mRNA was isolated from the cells and used to perform reverse transcriptase-PCR to determine the levels of stemness markers. The results revealed that high levels of ACTR2 correlated with high levels of stemness markers (CD44, CD24, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, and CD133) in ascites from ovarian cancer patients. We further showed that inactivation of ACTR2 using the ALK4/5/7 kinase inhibitor SB431542 resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation of Smad2 (S) at T136 and S424/425, suggesting that ACTR2-Smad2 can be a potential therapeutic target. Taken together, these results reveal that ACTR2 plays an important role in the stemness and metastasis of ovarian cancer and provides insight into the potential of ACTR2 as a therapeutic target in treating patients with ovarian cancer.

Objective The treatment strategy for vestibular schwannoma (VS) is determined by the risk-benefit ratio of observation versus intervention. The aim of this study was to determine whether pre-treatment volumetric measurements are associated with tumor growth and the need for intervention.Methods We performed a retrospective case series analysis of 205 patients who were followed up according to the treatment policy and volumetric changes were measured by serial MRIs. We analyzed volumetric changes and estimated the riskbenefit ratio between the observation group and the intervention group.Results Pre-treatment tumor volume was significantly associated with treatment type (p=0.0169). There was no significant difference in tumor growth, i.e., the average tumor growth was 5.89% for the observation group and 3.87% for the intervention group.Conclusion VS volume on the pretreatment imaging is associated with treatment type. Although the risk-benefit ratio showed no significance in the tumor growth rate, a large tumor on MRI is associated with higher rate of growth. Therefore, the surgical resection should be considered"

Gadolinium (Gd) based MR contrast agents (CAs) are widely used within clinical and preclinical applications. They bind to calcium and magnesium, in particular to astrocytes where they lead to a neurotoxic cascade. In the present study, we examined whether repeated Gd injections influenced the brain in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). The monkeys received five biannual intravenous Gd injections of 1.0 mM (0.5 mM/animal) within a period of 10 years. We used microCT and quantified the volume of the gray and white matter in specific brain regions (occipital cortex, putamen, caudate nucleus and hippocampus). Additionally, brain tissue was stained histologically and analyzed morphologically (neuron cell count, neurite length). The motor and visual functions were examined within specific behavioral tasks (gross, fine motor skills, visual recognition, visual memory). Gd-injected monkeys showed significant reductions of gray and white matter volume and altered neuron cell count. Neurite lengths were higher when compared to controls. Additionally, Gd-monkeys had deficits in fine motor skills and recognition of visual stimuli. Our findings were less pronounced compared to rats and mice. Possibly, species-specific differences in metabolism and CA homeostasis might influence the effect of long-Term Gd administration in these animals. <EOD> Hormonal, nutritional, and behavioral factors affecting reproduction in female sows during lactation.
Lactating sows are important contributors to commercial pork production; however, little control or management advice is generally given after farrowing regarding sows' estrus, pregnancy, and weaning. Understanding these processes could provide practical recommendations that may have an impact on sows' reproductive performance. Furthermore, nutritional or feeding strategies could have a significant impact on the estrus cycle of sows with the use of reproductive drugs such as progesterone. Therefore, this review focuses on the hormonal, nutritional, and behavioral factors affecting sows before conception until weaning. In particular, we discuss sows' behavior, hormonal changes, and nutritional management prior to the estrus cycle. This review focuses mainly on sows during lactation because, in this stage of their reproductive cycle, sows are more susceptible to stress and health problems. Proper nutrition and energy availability could significantly influence the estrus cycle and conception rate of lactating sows. Therefore, this review aims to provide knowledge of those factors to help managers or farm producers to better plan management during the lactation period. This, in turn, would allow farmers to improve the reproductive performance of sows and increase the productive efficiency. <EOD> Evaluation of Feline Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus Infections in Cats in Japan by Detection of Viral RNA by Real-time PCR

The authors found no difference in gene expression between B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi in I. scapularis, indicating that other factors such as nutritional requirements of the vector may explain differences in infection prevalence between ticks of the two B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex species. B. afzelii has an amino acid transporter similar to B. burgdorferi   Transcript profile and immune phenotypes of Ixodes ricinus tick salivary glands, Knapp   , while I. ricinus and I. scapularis have amino acid transporters of entirely different genesis. Thus, while B. afzelii is adapted to I. ricinus, B. burgdorferi was presumably adapted by natural selection to infect I. scapularis.

## Lyme borreliosis

## A vaccine that could prevent tick-borne disease
Lyme borreliosis is not only the most common arthropod-borne disease in the U.S. and Europe, but it is also the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S. The Borrelia burgdorferi complex is transmitted to humans by the Ixodes scapularis tick, resulting in Lyme disease, one of the most commonly recognised vector-borne diseases in the U.S. A new study by Wang and co-workers focuses on the B. burgdorferi outer surface proteins A and C and their role in human infection (2).
Although outer surface protein C is a target for an immunogenic Lyme borreliosis vaccine (a vaccination strategy that blocks the bacterium from penetrating the skin of a human), outer surface protein A has so far escaped the drug development process to prevent Lyme infection. Wang and co-workers wanted to know why outer surface protein A does not induce a protective antibody response in animals.
The investigators found that when outer surface protein A is presented in the context of the OspF and OppA proteins, the immune response is dramatically blunted. These proteins also are up-regulated 3 hours after an infected tick bite, and they do not stimulate bacterial killing when injected intracutaneously or intravenously in mice. In immunized mice, outer surface protein A alone induced high levels of IgG and IgM antibodies. Mice that were vaccinated with the mixed proteins showed no signs of an immune response, but the researchers found higher levels of the Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in their tissues.
These studies point out the challenges facing Lyme disease vaccine development, and further indicate that Borrelia burgdorferi uses various methods to avoid and escape the host antibody response. The next step will be to determine whether the vaccine protocol described here produces enough of an immune response to protect humans from Lyme disease. One approach would be to test whether a mixed protein vaccine using another Lyme disease vaccine vector, VlsE, could stimulate an immune response.

## Sleeping sickness: new drug candidates against protozoan parasite
Sleeping sickness is a fatal disease that is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. The parasite is transmitted by the tsetse fly and results in sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. The study by Eggins and colleagues screened an in vitro assay system consisting of T. brucei parasites using a library containing 90,400 chemicals, leading to the identification of two new drug candidates (3).

Summary
------------------
As this trial uses a controlled design, all treatments will have to be conducted under the supervision of the researcher. The researcher will have to monitor the quality of the data.
Before conducting the trial, it might not be worthwhile to write a protocol because the trial will be too complex. Consequently, the researcher should write a protocol after conducting the trial.

Even if the researcher does not conduct the study in a double-blind manner, it might be possible to prepare a cover letter mentioning that this is the first trial using Hemodiafiltration and that there is insufficient information to carry out the study in a double-blind manner.

The bacillary structure of Aneurinibacillus migulanus IFO 3919 was studied using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. As a result of the comparatively dense distribution of endocellular substance, the A. migulanus cells were observed to be divided into irregularly distributed electron-dense portions, and the cell walls and membrane structures were found to consist of three segments that are inter-connected to each other, with the central endocellular substance acting as a bridge over the entire bacillary structure. A study of the effects of a variety of electron microscopic procedures on the cell wall structures revealed the presence of distinctive muroglycin and peptidoglycine-like structures distributed across the walls, and the presence of distinctive phospholipid-like compounds distributed within them. Some of the muroglycins were found to be organized into fibres, and these were identified as representing a type of muroglycan.

 <EOD> A multicentre, randomised controlled clinical trial comparing two types of glenohumeral arthroplasty after four years of follow-up
Aims The aim of this study was to analyse two different, established implants to determine functional improvement and satisfaction after four years of follow-up. Patients and methods Between November 2005 and August 2007 154 consecutive patients having an endoprosthesis of the glenohumeral joint for various indications were prospectively enrolled and randomised. Group 1 received a fixed centre of rotation (Arthrocare®) and Group 2 received a mobile bearing centre of rotation (C-stem®). Active ROM, Constant score, Oxford Shoulder Score, DASH assessment, Tegner score and satisfaction were evaluated during follow-up. Results At four years, 133 patients (86.1%; 68 fixed centre of rotation  and 65 mobile) were evaluated. Between the two groups no significant differences could be found for ROM, or Constant score. The range of motion (in degrees) for Group 1 (76.9% female, mean age 56 years) was: flexion 154° (95°/179°), extension -72.3° (-2.8°/-46.3°), internal rotation 44° (0°/-15°). The range of motion (in degrees) for Group 2 (72.4% female, mean age 52 years) was: flexion 147.5° (101°/182°), extension -39° (-15°/2°), internal rotation 43° (0°/-15°). The Constant score for Group 1 (74 points, 0 points to 100 points) was 60 (45/68) and for Group 2 (70 points, 0 points to 100 points) it was 61.7 (46/75). Complications showed a similar incidence with 36.9% in Group 1 and in Group 2 38.4% (p = 0.86). In Group 1 10/68 patients underwent revision (increased instability 2/10, recurrent dislocation 7/10, infection 0/10) in Group 2 10/65 patients underwent revision (increased instability 1/10, recurrent dislocation 5/10, infection 3/10, implant failure 1/10). Conclusion These study results suggest that the use of the different types of implant in primary endoprosthesis of the glenohumeral joint results in a similar degree of functional improvement. Complication rate and revision rate did not differ significantly between groups. <EOD> Flexirubin, a novel pigment from Phialosimplex flexilis (Actinomycetes).
A novel carotenoid, flexirubin has been isolated from filtrate of Phialosimplex flexilis. The pigment showed absorption peaks at 255, 281 and at 400-442 nm. The compound gave rise to an infrared band at 1737 cm-1 when viewed with FTIR Spectophotometer. The positive reaction for aldehyde group confirmed the structure of the compound. The compound was found to have very characteristic UV spectrum. It showed an absorption peak at 360 nm and at 560 nm at pH 7.4. The pigment has been determined as 3,19,12,12'-tetra-4(2-methylpropyanoxy)-15,6,11',6'-hexatrienoid-16,21,22,23-tetretrone-carboxylic acid. <EOD> Role Playing Video Games on the Aging Brain: Effects on Psychological and Cognitive Health

The global population of people over 65 years of age is increasing rapidly and, as a result, the number of people with dementia worldwide is also increasing. Although there is no cure for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is clear that preventing or delaying dementia is the primary concern for most people because an early diagnosis of AD significantly increases the quality of life for a patient and also reduces the burden to their family."
