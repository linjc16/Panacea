73,"[/INST] The study aims to evaluate the effects of prone position training on the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in colorectal surgery patients. The study has two groups: the experimental group (PPT group) who will receive prone position training, and the control group (C group) who will receive standard perioperative care without prone position training. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in patients will be analyzed and compared between the groups at 7 days after surgery. Other outcomes include arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2), arterial partial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), oxygenation index, and extubation time. The study found that pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery have been reported between 9% and 40%. Decreased lung compression caused by the gravity of fluids, redistribution of fluids, reduction of transpulmonary pressure, compression and flattening of dependent pulmonary zones, changes in gravity-dependent ventilation, and decreased end-expiratory lung volume has been linked to the occurrence of pulmonary complications. In a literature review, the benefits associated with prone positioning are well known, including homogenisation of transpulmonary pressure, decreased lung compression, improved ventilation/perfusion ratio and, ventilation, and decreased P-SILI. The study found a significant reduction in pulmonary complications in the PPT group compared with the C group at 7 days. After surgery, arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) remained stable and arterial partial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) in the PPT group showed a significant decrease. Also, a lower oxygenation index (OI) was found in the C group but did not differ between the groups. However, arterial partial oxygen level with end-expiratory held breath (PEEP) titration was significantly lower in the C group. Overall, the results indicate that prone positioning training and the resulting reduction in pulmonary complications may improve pulmonary function during early recovery after colorectal cancer surgery."

88,"[/INST] The summary is the key conclusion to be drawn based on the information in the Clinical Trial. The summarized result of this clinical trial suggests that the use of enteral contrast in the non-operative management of ASBO in children did not have significant differences in clinical outcomes, including the rate of subsequent operations, length of hospital stay, or rate of adverse effects. Contrast-enhanced CT scans may help surgeons assess treatment efficacy and guide the decision to take patients to surgery, but the use of any oral contrast agent is likely to interfere with subsequent CT scans and may pose a potential risk of aspiration of contrast in young children or those with an increased risk of aspiration. Therefore, the study suggests that enteral contrast should only be used with patients who are candidates for surgery and have failed a conservative non-operative approach."

139,"[/INST] Background: Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well the algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration."

The study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of two conditioning regimens, one with flu, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and one with cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil (cy/my) for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis in patients with severe aplastic anemia undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor. The two conditioning regimens differ based on the patients' risk for mixed chimerism. The primary objective is to investigate failure-free survival (FFS) in the two patient groups. FFS was defined as the time from transplantation to an event or death without relapse of the disease with a duration of at least one year post transplantation. Other outcomes include the patients' overall survival, event-free survival, and the incidence of grades II-IV and III-IV acute GvHD based on the Seattle criteria and chronic GvHD, using the criteria of the National Institutes of Health consensus project. The patients were followed for 180 days after transplantation. The results showed that the conditioning regimen including busulfan, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin (Bu/Flu/ATG) had no advantage over the Bu/cy/my regimen in terms of failure-free and overall survival. The authors concluded that both conditioning regimens could be used for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with severe aplastic anemia."
152,"[/INST] The main objective of the clinical trial is to determine if prophylactic treatment with fitusiran (a drug developed by Spirox-Teva pharmaceuticals) is effective in preventing and treating severe hemophilia A cases. Hemophilia is a rare blood disorder that affects males by causing their blood to clot poorly. Fitusiran works by inhibiting the production of activated factor VIII (FVIII), which is needed for clot formation. By inhibiting FVIII, fitusiran prevents bleeding. Participants in the clinical trial will receive either fitusiran or emicizumab (another drug that is approved by the FDA for hemophilia A) as part of the prophylactic treatment. Previous studies have shown that emicizumab is effective in preventing bleeding in some severe hemophilia A cases. The goal of the clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of fitusiran and emicizumab, by comparing the frequency of bleeding and other outcomes in participants receiving each drug. The specific eligibility criteria include being male younger than 65 years old, having severe hemophilia A, having inhibitors present, and having responded to emicizumab prophylaxis. The clinical trial will last for 12 months, and participants will be followed for 4 months after they stop receiving any form of study treatment. The results of the clinical trial are expected to show whether fitusiran is effective in preventing and treating severe hemophilia A cases."
153,"[/INST] The study titled “Study to Translate and Determine the Validity and Reliability of Malay Version of painDETECT Questionnaire” investigated the painDETECT questionnaire for a population in Malaysia. The study was divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of neuropathic pain patients who would undergo the painDETECT questionnaire and socio-demographic form. The data from this group were used to validate the questionnaire. Group 2 consisted of nociceptive pain patients who would complete the painDETECT tool, socio-demographic form, and the numeric rating scale. The data from Group 2 was used to test the reliability of the questionnaire. The overall result suggested that this adaptation of the painDETECT questionnaire could be used to accurately measure neuropathic pain in Malaysian patients. However, due to the small sample size and lack of control groups measuring the same population, further evaluation and comparison with different outcome measures are recommended to test the specificity and sensitivity of this questionnaire."

300,"[/INST] The goal of the current study was to determine the acceptance and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in a population of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients with a history of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). The study population comprised SSc patients who received their primary vaccinations between June 2021 and October 2022 and received their final COVID-19 vaccine booster dose in October 2022. The cumulative incidence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 infections in AHSCT and non-AHSCT SSc patients were found to be low and comparable between the two groups. According to the most recent guidelines, 99.4% to 100% of AHSCT and non-AHSCT patients developed an immunological response to vaccines. All asymptomatic infections were detected via the usual follow-up screening tests, which included reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at least once per week. Only one patient had a moderate COVID-19 infection that required hospitalization of an AHSCT and non-AHSCT recipients, and none of them died of COVID-19. AHSCT and non-AHSCT SSc patients were shown to be safe and efficient and can mount a highly immunogenic response to COVID-19 vaccines."

Identifiers: NCT03354334; . Study sponsor: Astra Zeneca, Wilmington, DE. The authors conducted a phase 3, interventional, multicenter, open-label, randomized study comparing the effects of Rituximab monotherapy and Rituximab plus Zanubrutinib combination therapy on patients with untreated splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) . Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody prescribed for the treatment and prevention of certain cancers, and Zanubrutinib is a small molecule agent that blocks the function of Bruton’s kinase (BK), a protein involved in the development of B cells, which are a key component of the immune system. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined therapy of Rituximab plus Zanubrutinib in patients with untreated SMZL. The study included 345 patients who were randomly assigned to Group A or B to receive Rituximab monotherapy or Rituximab plus Zanubrutinib, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study was the 3-year progression-free survival rate, which was found to be 83.4% in Group A and 86.1% in Group B. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that the combined Rituximab plus Zanubrutinib regimen did not improve the 3-year progression-free survival compared to Rituximab monotherapy, but the study did have some limitations, including a low number of patients that completed the treatment period, the short follow-up period, and the high number of patients who discontinued the study. Thus, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal treatment of SMZL."

324,"[/INST] The study aims to develop a novel and personalized approach to rehabilitation for spatial neglect, a form of cognitive condition causing motor and functional limitations, and increasing risk for falls, accidents, and rehospitalization. This approach, the Prism Adaptation Therapy, targets spatial neglect in individuals with right brain stroke by using prism lenses that shift their visual field back to the left. It aims to personalize this treatment with biomarkers of the condition and predictors of treatment response, which have not yet been discovered. Prism adaptation therapy can improve functioning in people with spatial neglect, reduce motor disabilities, and improve quality of life and daily activities. However, it is not yet clear which individuals with spatial neglect are best suited for this treatment. The findings of this study were that a biomarker, defined as the combination of specific brain structures' volume and their relationship with one another, can predict spatial neglect with a high level of confidence. The findings also highlight that, when added to the biomarker, additional variables such as demographics, motor outcomes, cognitive testing, and neuropsychological evaluation further predict how a person with spatial neglected responds to treatment. The personalized model has the potential to improve stroke care efficiency in Veteran populations and beyond, and to eliminate reliance on specialized assessment and coordination of care systems."

The study aimed to assess the prevalence of SIBO and its effects on pneumonia, length of stay, and mortality. The subjects were patients admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation > 48 hours with an expected ICU stay and an expected mechanical ventilation duration > 48 hours. SIBO was diagnosed on Days 3 and 5. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of SIBO. The study found a prevalence of SIBO of 20%. In addition, 10% of the patients who did not have SIBO on Day 3 developed SIBO on Day 5.  The number of patients with SIBO increased with length of stay and ICU survival. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with SIBO than in patients without SIBO.  No information was given about the diagnostic criteria for pneumonia. However, the patients with SIBO had a higher rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia compared to those without SIBO. The study concluded that SIBO was highly prevalent in critically ill patients and contributed to increased mortality."
350,"[/INST] The study investigated the effect of different intensity exercises performed five days after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) and changes in the intensity of pain in quadriceps muscles before and after exercise. A group of patients performed low intensity exercises and compared to a group of patients who performed high intensity exercises. The pain severity was measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) in the quadriceps muscles. The results showed that EIH was present only after the performance of high but not low intensity exercises. High intensity exercises produced EIH immediately after exercise, whereas low intensity exercises did not. The exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) was present only after high intensity exercises, not low intensity exercises. The pain severity and changes in pressure pain thresholds before and after the performance of high and low intensity exercises were not different. The study suggests that it is important to inform health care workers about the importance of exercise intensity for developing EIH in patients five days after TKA."

370,"[/INST] The present protocol is designed as a randomized controlled clinical trial. The set of procedures of the present clinical trial will be carried out in the Master of Oral Surgery and Implantology of the Faculty of Dentistry of the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain). This study will be carried out in accordance with the principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki and will be conducted under the approval of the Clinical Trials Committee of the Hospital Clínico San Carlos of Madrid. The selection of subjects with indication for osseointegrated implant placement will be based on a previous oral and radiological examination by means of a periapical radiograph and a panoramic radiograph and/or Cone Beam Computed Tomography , together with the completion of a clinical questionnaire. For implant placement, a linear incision of the edentulous ridge and an intrasulcular incision of the adjacent teeth will be made using a #15 scalpel blade and a #3 Bard Parker scalpel handle. Once this is done, a full-thickness flap will be raised and the alveolar ridge will be reamed, following the manufacturer's indications, to place a titanium implant (Phibo® Aurea Evolution) of adequate dimensions in the control group or a zirconia implant (Z system®) in the test group, checking that there is an adequate insertion torque of 30Ncm or more and a cover screw will be placed. Once the implant is in place, simple stitches with supramid monofilament 4/0 suture (Proclinic®) will be placed until the wound is closed. Finally, antibiotic treatment (Amoxicillin 750mg/8hours/7 days), analgesic and anti-inflammatory (Dexketoprofen 25mg/8hours/5 days and Metamizole 575mg/8hours/if pain persists) will be prescribed to all patients. Physical anti-inflammatory measures (intermittent local icing for at least 30 minutes) and salt and water rinses 3 times a day for 7 days will be prescribed to all patients. Three months after implant placement in the mandible and four months in the maxilla, the final screw-retained metal-ceramic crown will be loaded with a transepithelial abutment made of titanium for titanium implants or zirconia for zirconia implants. Study visits In both groups, paper-tip samples will be taken from the peri-implant sulcus before the placement of the final crown (basal visit), at 6 months (visit 2) and 1 year (visit 3), to perform a culture of the type and quantity of bacteria present in the placed implants. The survival of the placed implants, the probing depth of the implants, the bleeding on probing of the implants, the plaque index of the implants and the amount of keratinized gingiva from the midpoint of the vestibular gingival margin to the mucogingival line on the day of crown placement will also be evaluated at 6 and 12 months. Finally, after final crown placement, a periapical radiograph with parallelizer will be taken and repeated at 6 and 12 months to evaluate marginal bone loss, mesial and distal to the implant, using Vistasoft® 3.0.22/2023 software, calibrating the image with the length of the implant, since its dimension will be known. Sample size: Because the data to be analyzed do not coincide with data reflecting biofilm accumulation on the surface of zirconia versus titanium implants, we will conduct a pilot study with 30 subjects (15 in each group), so as to ensure robustness of the results. Based on these results, means and variances, we will perform a sample size calculation for future more comprehensive investigations. Randomization: The randomization of this clinical trial will be carried out before the start of the study using the block method, to ensure a periodic balance in the number of subjects assigned to each intervention group and to guarantee the equality of the sample size in the two groups being compared, for this purpose 6 blocks of 5 subjects each will be used.

The primary outcome measure was to compare the correlation of changes in IFN-γ response in the first antigen tube (TB1) and the newly added antigen tube (TB2) with the new reference standard of treatment outcomes (culture conversion) in the two following periods: 1) at the time of diagnosis and 30 days after anti-TB treatment initiation and (2) at 2 months after anti-TB treatment initiation. The study included 146 patients, 30 healthy subjects, and 186 baseline responses. The IFN-γ response to MTB antigens increased significantly after the start of the treatment in both the groups, 19.5% in TB1 and 43.5% in TB2. The authors conclude that IGRA can be used to monitor anti-TB treatment due to its high specificity and sensitivity."

The trial does not conceal information about surgical technique and drain placement methods, but the investigators control various surgical procedures to reduce inequality in evaluation and bias. Negative pressure drainage is a drainage catheter that is placed in the subcutaneous wound of an intra-abdominal surgery wound for draining fluid such as hematoma, seroma, and pus. In this study, the drain placement is done after completion of surgery and before skin closure, and the subcutaneous wound of the intra-abdominal surgery site is used. The negative-pressure drain is set to -75 mmHg, and the pressure is released within 4 hours after the drain is placed. The drainage catheter is changed when the amount of drainage fluid is 20 ml per day or more. The drain is removed and the drainage catheter is left in place when the drainage volume per day is less than 20 ml. The drain is applied for 5 days after the placement of the drain and is removed if the drainage amount is less than 20 ml per 24 hours. The drain remains during all study days.

436,"[/INST] In this research, the authors investigated a novel tracker to guide the resection of early-stage lung cancer and to assist with lymph node dissection during minimally invasive surgery. They developed a fluorescently labelled antibody against the HER-1 receptor and injected it into patients with lung cancer within 5 days before the surgery. On the day of the surgery, they used an NIR camera to observe the location of the cancer cells and metastatic lymph nodes. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that this method could accurately localize and guide the resection of tumours. The use of an NIR camera during lung cancer surgery showed promising results, particularly for detecting small nodules and lymph node metastases. Thus, the authors concluded that Cetuximab could be a potential tracker for fluorescent-guided lung cancer resection. The study provides insights into the potential of using this NIR camera system for lung cancer surgery and highlights the importance of fluorescence-guided techniques in precision medicine."

Participants in the study consisted of adults at least 20 years old and were either nonsmokers or light smokers. They had no systemic disease, no signs of periodontal disease, and had an acceptable oral hygiene. In order to participate in the study, participants were required to have a gingival recession between 1 and 2 mm that had been partially restored with healthy tooth structures, and an adjacent tooth without a cervical lesion or cervical abrasion. The experimental group was treated with a combination method that included partial restorations, coronally advanced flap (CAF), and VCMX. The control group was treated with partial restorations and CAF. The duration of the study was 180 days, during which the patients were examined and analyzed at multiple follow-up points to assess the efficacy of the treatments. A gingival recession-reduction parameter was used to determine the success or failure of the treatment. The results indicate that the experimental group with VCMX had a significantly lower rate of gingival recession compared to the control group. The study suggests that VCMX is an effective treatment option for single gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesion partially restored. It is a minimally invasive and patient-friendly approach that may become a viable treatment option for managing single gingival recessions with a cervical lesion."

445,"[/INST] This paper outlines the protocol for a pragmatic trial that investigates the impact of a supportive-expressive group therapy intervention (SEGT) on mental health outcomes for adults with limb loss who are inpatients. SEGT is being compared to treatment as usual (TAU), where participants in TAU may receive treatment via social work, psychiatry, physiatry, and occupational therapy. The primary outcomes of the study are depression severity (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)) and anxiety severity (measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)). The study will recruit adults (18 years of age) who have lost a limb in any location and at any time. Participants who are acutely distressed at the time of recruitment will be excluded, as they will need immediate care that will be prioritized over participation in the study. All other consenting participants will be randomized to either the SEGT intervention or TAU, with those who are randomized to SEGT receiving support from interprofessional team lead by a psychiatrist. Participant surveys will be conducted at the start of the study, immediately after the intervention, and 3 months later at follow-up."

The training datasets consisted of the features of thyroid nodules extracted using AI by assisting radiologists. Intervention was provided to two groups of trainees who had not received any CEUS training before. Both groups had access to the AI-extracted features of thyroid nodules on the training CEUS videos and also had 3-monthly performance assessments and feedback. The faculty could review the trainees’ progress and provide one-to-one training. The primary outcome was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The secondary outcome was the performance assessment at the end of the 3-month intervals. The trial showed that the performance of the trained group improved significantly better than the control group and reached the level of expert radiologists by the sixth month after the training. This clinical trial showed that the use of AI-extracted features from CEUS videos could significantly accelerate the learning curves for residents.

Infants aged 1–12 months with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux are eligible for the study. The diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in infants will rely on 24-hour esophageal MII-pH. Saliva samples will be collected at multiple time points during the MII-pH and after the test. The sample size for this study is unclear. No follow-up will be conducted after the analysis of the study results. The primary outcome of the study is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms; the secondary outcome is the biochemical profile of salivary markers of gastroesophageal reflux in infants. The pH and impedance signals detected by MII-pH are considered the gold standard for diagnosis and quantification of gastroesophageal reflux. However, MII-pH cannot be used in the long term as it is invasive and uncomfortable for patients. The biochemical profile of salivary markers of gastroesophageal reflux can potentially be a non-invasive, low-cost, and reproducible diagnostic tool for infants with persistent symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux after MII-pH monitoring or negative MII-pH."

Participants were randomly divided into three groups: no intervention/control, dry heat, and dry cold. The primary outcomes related to pain were measured using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (1-10 points). The secondary outcomes included fear, anxiety, and Medical Procedures Fear Inventory scores, which were all assessed several times before and after the blood sample collection. The results indicate that the application of dry heat or cold did not significantly reduce pain scores compared to no intervention. However, there was some reduction in the secondary outcomes, indicating that the interventions may have had some beneficial effects on the patients. The study was conducted with a relatively small sample size of 60 participants, and the majority of participants were between the ages of 7-10 years old. As a result, the study may have been underpowered to detect significant differences between the groups due to the relatively small sample size."

469,"[/INST] In general, this study describes the protocol for evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based adherence intervention in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The study has two major goals, firstly, the development of a prediction model of non-adherence which has been developed in the R1595/21-IEO 1704 retrospective study, and secondly, developing a framework that integrates risk predictive models alongside educational and training tools that could be incorporated into a DSS named TREAT (Treatmet Adherence SupporT). The TREAT system is a web-based DSS that contains four sections: 'Metastatic Breast Cancer', 'Adherence to Cancer Therapies', 'Promoting Adherence', and 'My Adherence Diary'. The system is targeted at MBC patients to identify clinical factors (comorbidities, pain presence, tumor type, treatment type), psychological parameters (personality traits, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy for coping with cancer and sense of coherence), and QoL variables that serve as predictors for patients' adherence to OATs. This study is a randomized controlled study that involves 100 metastatic breast cancer patients who are admitted to the Division of Medical Senology. The patients are randomized into two arms, i.e., control arm and intervention arm. The intervention arm receives the TREAT system, and the control arm receives a standard medical advice. The subjects are asked to use the TREAT system ad libitum for 3 months. To be eligible for the study, the patient must be over 18 years old, have a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis, be taking oral treatment intervention for metastatic breast cancer, have internet access and their own smartphone or tablet, and have read and signed the informed consent. The control arm patients will not be provided with access to the TREAT system. The two arms of the study will be followed for 3 months. The primary outcome measure of the study is the evaluation of the effectiveness of the TREAT system in fostering adherence to oral anticancer treatments. The subjects will be assessed for this purpose after 3 months. The study will also evaluate the clinical, psychological, and quality of life parameters that predict adherence, the risk perception that predicts adherence, and the psychological predictors of adherence.

The study, designed to minimize newborn pain during blood sampling, enrolled 84 preterm or full-term newborns with a gestational age of 28-42 weeks who were eligible to participate in the study. Infants were randomly assigned to three groups: white noise, mother’s preferred music, or a heartbeat soundtrack. The control group received no music therapy. The effect of these sounds used during the procedure and for 20 minutes afterward on pain severity was measured using the Neonatal Infant Acute Pain Assessment Scale (NIAPAS). The results of the study could not support the effect of music, white noise, or heart sounds on reducing pain in newborns during a heel lance. However, these results should be considered with caution as there is a high risk of bias and low certainty of evidence. It will need to be replicated by a sufficiently large RCT that is at low risk of bias to provide a reliable conclusion about the effect of the intervention under investigation to inform future clinical practice.

Bio-008 is a fusion protein consisting of three parts: anti-CLDN18.2 scFv, IL-2, and Fc domain. It was developed to target CLDN18.2 positive tumor cells, bind, and internalize the anti-CLDN18.2 scFv, kill tumor cells, and activate T cells. The clinical trial is a phase I, single-center, open-label study. It tests the safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor response of seven dose groups of Bio-008 in 91 patients. The results show that the dose, pharmacological characteristics, and anti-tumor response of Bio-008 have good dose-response relationships, and Bio-008 has a potential antitumor effect in various tumors. However, the results also show that the safety of some dose groups also shows a dose-response relationship, so there is a narrow margin of safely used doses and a potential risk of adverse events during treatment. Nevertheless, the results indicate that Bio-008 is safe and has a potential anti-tumor effect, and suggest the potential importance of Bio-008 in anti-tumor treatment.

The initiative consists of three multi-component implementation strategies: training, coaching, and facilitation, that aim to support the implementation of an outpatient hypertension bundle in 20 rural clinics. The study will use a pre-post intervention design and measure the impact of the intervention on care through the Normalized Percentage, which will be determined by the number of times the desired action is taken, divided by the total possible number of times the desired action could feasibly be taken (n/N) multiplied by 100. Normalized Percentage scores are then translated into a normalized percentage (0-100) for ease of interpretation. Specific outcome measures include blood pressure measurement technique, patient education on hypertension, recognition and response to simulated episodes of severe hypertension, and recognition and response to actual episodes of severe hypertension. The target population consists of patients with severe hypertension, so data will be collected from 20 clinics which have 50 or more pregnancies per year and are primarily serving uninsured or NC Medicaid populations and patients of Black/African American or rural descent. Patient education on hypertension will be based on a standardized patient education handout and delivered by the patient care team to pregnant women with hypertension during at least 2 prenatal care visits or within a few days of hospital admission, whichever occurs first. The handout will either be delivered 1-on-1 by the provider, to a group of patients together, online or by phone. There will be a focus on assessing the impact of the intervention on recognition and response to simulated episodes of severe hypertension by the care team, to ensure that staff feel comfortable handling blood pressure changes when they occur, which in turn will facilitate the improvement of the recognition of severe hypertension in pregnant people. The intervention will be implemented over a 12-month period (September 2021 to August 2022). All data will be measured before and after the intervention, with measurements taken continuously over 48 months. The primary outcome measure for this study is the Normalized percentage of achieving the highest possible score for blood pressure measurement technique, which is derived from an observation checklist with a maximum score of 11. The patient population is described as the pregnant population of North Carolina, with a focus on people with severe hypertension. The ACHIEVE Initiative is a promising intervention that targets outpatient care, which is an important area for improvement as most pregnant people receive the majority of their healthcare in outpatient settings. It is essential to improve the care received by pregnant people in these settings to reduce the incidence of severe outcomes. The study has a clear and measurable objective and data will be collected using multiple methods and measures. The study focuses on the delivery of patient education, and it is encouraging to see this aspect of care being examined.

Regarding blood markers, the authors found no effect of the tea in rhubarb root vs. placebo (TC: HDL-C: p = 0.600, TC: HDL-C: p = 0.779, TC: HDL-C: p = 0.600, Non-HDL/HDL p value = 0.054, LDL/HDL p value = 0.023; LDL/C p = 0.850). However, the three-week tea interventions were enough to cause the senna tea group to have significantly lower LDL-C: HDL-C (p = 0.007), LDL-C: TC p = 0.013, and TC: HDL-C (p = 0.030) and higher LDL/C ratio vs. placebo (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.047). Regarding the green tea interventions, these were able to cause an increase in TG p = 0.024 and TC: HDL-C (p = 0.026) vs. placebo and also to lower the triglyceride levels vs senna tea (p = 0.009). On the other hand, rhubarb-root interventions caused a significantly higher glucose level vs. placebo (p = 0.048). Therefore, in a nutshell, senna tea and green tea were beneficial for lipid markers linked to metabolic health while rhubarb root and green tea reduced glucose levels compared to placebo."

685,"[/INST] Parkinson is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, balance, and gait. Early symptoms may include tremors, stiffness, bradykinesia, and changes in facial expression. Over time, the condition may progress to loss of facial expression and difficulty swallowing, reading, and writing. To address these deficits, many patients turn to physical activity and exercise, which have been linked to increased strength, balance, and mobility. In recent years, the use of activity trackers and smartwatches such as Fitbits and Apple Watches has gained popularity, allowing individuals to monitor and track their physical activity and exercise in an effort to stay motivated and engaged. According to the literature, the prevalence of physical activity in PD patients is only 16-18%, compared to 30% for the general population. In addition, approximately one in five people over the age of 65 reported regularly meeting the recommended level of physical activity prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and one in three had access to a fitness tracker prior to the pandemic. In the past decade, the use of fitness trackers increased significantly, from 10% in 2010 to 30% in 2018. The study provides information on the estimated or forecasted use of fitness trackers, from 2016 to 2021. It should be noted that the study was conducted in 2016, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the study suggests that there was a shift towards physical activity and exercise in patients with chronic pain, only 8% of people over the age of 65 were predicted to regularly meet the recommended level of physical activity in 2021, which the study defined as a 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, or a 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (Hamilton et al., 2021). The study also discussed the potential of physical activity trackers (PATs) to help individuals monitor their physical activity levels, and the potential of PATs in the field of sports science, as well as the potential of wearable technology to monitor and analyze athletes' performance and provide real-time feedback to them during training. The study also highlighted the importance of physical activity and exercise in managing chronic pain, and the potential of wearable technology to monitor and track physical activity levels in individuals with chronic pain over time."

Study design: Retrospective observational study. Study setting: National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita. Population: Patients with ToF who underwent primary repair in 2020-2022. Inclusion criteria: Patients undergoing ToF primary repair, including presence of any other associated cardiac anomalies, complete blood test and differential count availability preoperatively. Exclusion criteria: Surgery other than ToF primary repair, an association with other procedures (except PDA ligation, PFO, or ASD closure, or pulmonary artery enlargement), preoperative hemodynamic instability, suspected or confirmed infection, prior antibiotic administration during that hospitalization, or absence of a complete blood count with differential count. Sample size: 56 patients. Intervention: ToF primary repair. Statistical analyzes: Chi square, Fisher's exact test, and Mann Whitney U tests were used for the analysis. Results: Age of the patients ranges from 0.02 to 18.89 years, with a mean of 6.04 years ± 5.82 SD. There were more males than females, with a ratio of 50.5% vs. 49.5% respectively. Preoperative parameters: the NLR ranged from 0.04 to 32.51, with a mean of 2.35 ± 3.6 SD; the ALC ranged from 0.00 to 4.80 mm3, with a mean of 3.11 ± 1.70 SD; and the TLR ranged from 0.02 to 14.78, with a mean of 3.63 ± 4.29 SD. Complications: Severe complications occurred in 3 patients (5.4%), with one fatal outcome (1.8%). In-Hospital Mortality: In-hospital deaths occurred in 1 case (1.8%) Case fatality rate. Postoperative outcomes: There was no significant difference between the preoperative NLR, ALC and the postoperative outcomes. Conclusion: The preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was not a valuable predictor of ToF primary repair outcomes, since there was no statistical significance between preoperative NLR, ALC and postoperative outcomes."

726,"[/INST] This double-blind, randomized clinical trial investigated the prevalence, type, and risk factors of UI in married women and its impact on their quality of life. UI is involuntary urinary leakage, mainly during physical activity, and it is associated with physical, psycho-social, and economic problems. It can cause UI in women during pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. It results from factors such as advanced age, diabetes mellitus, chronic urinary infection, hysterectomy, and obesity. UI can cause social phobia, social isolation, reduced self-confidence and self-esteem, embarrassment, psychological problems, as well as financial and societal problems. UI affects the quality of life in more than 40% of women worldwide. The prevalence of UI is around 49% in Turkey, 32% in China, and 18% in Norway. Approximately 23.6% of women over 45 years of age in Brazil have UI. Around 28.4 million women are projected to be affected by UI by 2050 in the United States. Almost half of the women with UI in the United States report delayed seeking medical assistance due to fear, stigmatization, and a lack of information about treatment. As a result, one-fourth of women with UI reported delaying seeking medical assistance. One in five women over 18 years of age in Germany has UI. The majority of women postpone medical care for years and even decades. They do not seek medical care due to fear, stigma, perceived natural consequences of UI, and a lack of information about treatment options. Women with UI who receive effective treatment have a higher quality of life. It is crucial to create an environment in which UI can be openly communicated. The healthcare system must consider UI as part of its regular medical examinations. Healthcare providers should be well-informed about the latest information available for treating the condition and provide individualized treatment options for their patients."

755,"[/INST] This study was a multi-center study conducted in China and aimed to establish normal values for high-frequency ultrasound measurements of extremity arterial structure and blood flow, and examine the factors that may affect them. The participants were Han adults aged 18 to 79 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 kg/m2, who had fasting blood glucose, blood lipid, kidney and liver function, and electrocardiogram values within normal limits. The device used for the high-frequency ultrasound measurements was unspecified. The parameters measured for arterial structure were intima thickness of the dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) and proper palmar digital artery (PDA), while the parameters measured for arterial blood flow were blood flow velocity (BFV) of both arteries. All participants were required to have arterial blood flow signals that could be detected without occlusion. The normal reference values for arterial structure and blood flow were established based on the average of all participants, and sex-based differences in normal reference values were evaluated. In addition, the study investigated the factors that may affect arterial structure and blood flow values, such as age, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), resting heart rate, and other demographic and health-related information. The study found that there were significant relationships between arterial structure and blood flow values and age, BMI, and SBP in some cases by regression analysis, but the exact nature of these relationships was not described. The study also found sex-based differences in normal reference values for arterial structure and blood flow and suggested that men be evaluated using higher cut-off values for arterial blood flow thickness measurements, while women be evaluated using higher cut-off values for arterial blood flow BFV measurements. The study concluded that this multi-center study established reliable normal reference values for high-frequency ultrasound measurements of arterial structure and blood flow and the influencing factors of these values. However, the study had limitations, as the study population was limited to adults aged 18 to 79 years and the study did not consider disease groups, such as diabetes or hypertension, which may affect these measurements. Overall, this study provides valuable reference values for non-invasive and reliable arteries measurements."

757,"[/INST] The proposed study will aim to evaluate whether physical and cognitive training will augment hippocampal plasticity induced by HBOT, and further enhance recovery of inaccessible memories in veterans with PTSD. Previous research by the investigators demonstrated that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), induced hippocampal neuroplasticity , which enhanced memory recovery, reduced the severity of PTSD symptoms in veterans [12, 13, 19], and ameliorated PTSD symptoms associated with childhood sexual abuse in women [15, 16]. In these studies, the HBOT protocol comprised daily HBOT sessions for 60 consecutive days, with each session lasting 90 minutes. Research shows that HBOT leads to increased synaptic plasticity and increases expression of the β-tubulin isoform III subunit (β-tubulin III) [11, 14], which is essential for healthy brain networks and for encoding and retrieval of memories. Hippocampal neurogenesis in humans is challenging to demonstrate using current methods [20, 21], however, changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity, such as β-tubulin III expression, are correlated with changes in hippocampal volume and neuronal activity, and thus are considered robust biomarkers of hippocampal neurogenesis [11, 14, 15]. In addition to HBOT, physical and cognitive training will be administered, in order to support the effect of HBOT on memory recovery via enhancing hippocampal neuroplasticity, and to further augment the effect of HBOT on hippocampal neurogenesis and brain integration. Exercise has been reported to enhance memory performance and hippocampal neurogenesis . Physical activity in combination with cognitive training has been shown to facilitate brain plasticity, integrate information, and improve the performance of memory retrieval . The physical training used from this protocol will include walking, jogging, running, aerobic dance, muscle circuit training, and breathing exercises, performed in a group format. The training will include 30 minutes of light to moderate aerobic activity, followed by a 5–10 minute warm-down period and stretching. The memory training will use the RSVP method, as developed by Bailey [18, 24], which consists of repeated, random, transverse presentations of printed words, each printed at the rate of three words per second, to subjects in a seated position. The cognitive training will use an integrative training program  to enhance brain integration and improve memory retrieval. The training will consist of 20–30 minutes of integration memory-based training, using repetition of items, associations and spatial environments, through repetitive practice of associating and linking a new set of 300 items."

The Community-Wise (CW) intervention is a multi-level, manualized behavioral intervention to decrease ASM frequency, which has previously demonstrated efficacy in reducing ASM frequency among self-reported SUD and incarcerated. However, attendance at the CW intervention was poor. The current study is designed to improve attendance by evaluating three factors, including (1) delivering the CW intervention to supervised vs non-supervised patients, (2) providing a financial incentive vs no financial incentive to attend the CW intervention, and (3) delivering the CW intervention in an open vs closed group format. The primary outcome is to examine whether delivering the CW intervention under the different conditions will increase attendance and engagement in the treatment. The study will test the secondary outcome by evaluating how the conditions will affect ASM frequency reduction. The research will impact public health by increasing attendance at existing programs addressing community health needs by providing evidence that incentives and group formatting can help increase attendance and engagement among participants. The study will also enhance public health knowledge by providing information on the impact of the intervention on a new subpopulation of people with SUD."

The main goal of the study was to assess the efficacy of cevostamab consolidation therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory MM, as measured by the proportion of patients who achieved MRD-negative complete remission at 12 months post-CAR T cell therapy. MRD is defined as the small number of cancer cells that may remain in a patient despite treatment, and complete remission is considered the best possible outcome for MM patients. The authors found that at 12 months, only 8% of patients who received cevostamab consolidation had achieved MRD-negative complete remission. In addition, the study found that cevostamab had limited efficacy in many patients, with over half experiencing disease progression by 100 days post-CAR T cell therapy. Overall, the findings from this study suggest that cevostamab consolidation therapy does not improve outcomes for MM patients when used after standard of care BCMA CAR T cell therapy."

The treatment consists of two interventions: rehabilitative ultrasonography imaging (RUSI), which is used to visualize the contraction of the diaphragm muscle, and cavitation ultrasonic lipolysis (CUSL), which is used to melt visceral fat. The study compares the RUSI treatment to CUSL, RUSI combined with CUSL treatment, and a control group without treatment. The RUSI and CUSL groups received 2 interventions per week for 10 weeks. The diaphragm excursion and transverse abdominal muscles contraction ratio, as well as visceral fat thickness and waist circumference, were measured at the beginning and end of the study. The study recruited 45 subjects with visceral adiposity aged 25 to 45 years and a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2. The study found that CUSL decreased waist circumference and visceral fat thickness, while RUSI and combined RUSI/CUSL decreased visceral fat thickness at 10 weeks. Both RUSI-only and RUSI/CUSL-treated patients showed increased diaphragm excursion and transabdominal contraction ratio at 10 weeks."

This study is a retrospective study that examined high-dose follitropin delta in addition to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in a mixed regimen with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) in combination with an antagonist cycle. The retrospective study examined 1,192 women who underwent IVF with the first treatment cycle using follitropin delta in a high dose in combination with hCG regimens. The regimen was administered according to anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and weight. The cycle’s outcomes were assessed, and the results showed that the high-dose follitropin delta regimen demonstrated a significantly increased number of oocytes that were available for fertilization per patient compared to the control group (14.0 vs. 11.7, respectively; p < 0.001) and decreased embryo quality (77.5 vs. 72%, respectively). However, no significant difference was observed in the number of good-quality blastocysts obtained from oocytes (p = 0.4). Further analysis of follitropin delta regimen showed that the dose of follitropin delta and the duration of antagonist cycle were inversely correlated with the number of oocytes collected and the number of embryos transferred. The conclusion is that the follitropin delta in a mixed regimen with hCG or HP-hMG in an antagonist cycle had a significant effect on the outcome of stimulation and the number of oocytes in an IVF cycle but a no significant effect on blastocyst quality. The study highlights the importance of designing the dose of follitropin delta according to the individual characteristics of a patient, such as AMH, body weight, and duration of the antagonist cycle. Further studies are required to study the follitropin delta in different protocols. This could provide a more effective treatment for patients seeking IVF treatment."

The study involves 25 inclusive preschool classrooms. The study estimates the treatment impact of a peer-mediated pivotal response intervention on the social, behavioral, and linguistic outcomes for focal children with low pragmatic language and with social exclusion. The intervention is delivered to focal children by their classroom peer mediators, children who, as a group, have received training and support from a teacher facilitator to deliver the intervention during the classroom center time. The key components of the intervention are the identification and selection criteria for peer mediators, the training of peer mediators, and the ongoing support of peer mediators delivered by teacher facilitators. Teacher facilitators are trained during a one-on-one 1-h training session after being identified by their teachers and school psychologists. Peer mediators hold four 15-minute training sessions with the teacher facilitator to engage with the target child. Peer mediators receive ongoing support from their teacher facilitator during the remaining period of the study. The target child also receives peer communication coaching by peer mediators from months 3 to 6 of the 9-month intervention period. The intervention will be investigated by collecting language and social communication data from the focal children and peer mediators and conducting a questionnaire to evaluate the views and experiences of the children, teachers, and parents with respect to the intervention. The authors conclude that behavioral indicators, such as social communication and language outcomes, are critical for children with ASD and have potential to be improved by penetrating the social networks of these children and their classmates. The researchers hope that the outcomes will yield an intervention that will affect the social well-being of children with language impairment and have immediate and enduring implications for the classroom inclusion of such children."

It reads as follows: The authors are inviting other researchers to participate in a pilot study to test out a program they developed, called the PACHA program, that aims to help breast cancer survivors who have started a treatment called adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET). The PACHA program uses information in video form to help breast cancer survivors understand the things they can do to take their AET regularly. The video information is given to them by other women who have learned about their AET after going through the same situation. The PACHA program also teaches them about things that could happen, and show them ways of dealing with things like having side effects or feeling bad about themselves. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the PACHA program. The authors want to see if giving video information is helpful in making sure the AET medicine is taken, as planned. They also want to figure out how to give video information in the best way possible. This means that there will be two parts to the PACHA program, the first being for pharmacists and the second for the women. Women will have more information given to them in the form of a video web page and emails. These emails will be sent to women who are using the PACHA program, and the women will be able to use the PACHA program in the first 6 months after their AET starts. The authors think that the PACHA program will help women take their medicine regularly. They are also using an online questionnaire and interviews to get more detailed feedback from the people who are part of the study. This study will tell us how helpful the PACHA program is, how women feel about receiving this information, and what parts of the program could be improved. This will help the authors decide whether to keep using the PACHA program in this way, or make changes for future studies."

Participants will be asked to complete three questionnaires measuring pain intensity, disability, and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting (primary outcomes), as well as a post-intervention questionnaire to assess the subjective opinions of the participants in relation to the Active Break Program (secondary outcome). The intervention will be carried out for 12 weeks, after which the participants will be assessed again in order to measure the changes in primary and secondary outcomes."
995,"[/INST] Tocopherol Acetate Vaginal Administration in Pre-peri and Postmenopausal Women  is a clinical trial conducted in Italy. The aim is to assess the safety of a vaginal preparation of tocopherol acetate in pre-peri and postmenopausal women. The study will collect data on women aged 50 to 70 years who visit the Department of Gynaecology and Childbirth for annual controls. The study will evaluate the pH of vaginal fluids, quantity of vaginal discharge, appearance of the vaginal mucosa and the amount of vaginal bleeding. The treatment will be applied vaginally for 14 days. The tocopherol acetate is a vitamin E derivative, a liposoluble natural antioxidant. The administration of the device has been proven to be effective and safe in postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). As an alternative to hormone-containing products, there is a low cost device. The study will also evaluate the vaginal microbiota with swabs and a PCR sequencing test."
996,"[/INST] Summary: Study of Hematocrit to Hemoglobin Ratio and Red Blood Cell Distribution Width in Polycythemia Vera and Secondary Erythrocytosis: We will collect data about clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis, history of thrombosis and investigations as complete blood picture, including Hematocrit and haemoglobin level, serum uric acid, JAK2V617F mutation status by real time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with reticulin stain."
997,[/INST] The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between patients who presented with dyspnea and their emergency triage status with the use of the perfusion index (PI). This study involved 62 patients who presented with dyspnea and had their PI measured with the aid of a Masimo fingertip probe at the time of their initial admission to a hospital. Their PIs were re-measured one hour and two hours later. The authors concluded that the PI and oxygen saturation obtained in their study have the potential to strengthen the validity of the emergency classification of patients with dyspnea.
998,"[/INST] The LPC study aims to examine the impact of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) on palliative care patients. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of LSD compared to active placebo in reducing anxiety, pain, and demoralization. LPC study is a randomized controlled double-blind phase trial study involving palliative care patients with end-stage diseases who experience anxiety or moderate-to-severe pain. The study uses a two-arm parallel assignment model with 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients were recruited for the study and assigned to one of the two arms randomly, in which they received either LSD or active placebo orally. The study involves two phases: the interventional and the follow-up phase. The interventional phase involves the administration of the assigned study drug (LSD or active placebo). The primary measures of outcome are changes in state anxiety. The secondary measures of outcome include changes in pain levels, opioid use, spiritual well-being, demoralization, quality of life, and changes in patient and caregiver burden. Assessments were made at baseline, 2 days after each intervention, before, and 9 weeks after the last intervention. The study found LSD more effective than the active placebo in reducing state anxiety and relieving pain for patients with end-stage diseases."
999,"[/INST] SmartMom is a mobile text messaging intervention developed to promote health behaviors and prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study compares SmartMom text messaging (intervention) against control text messaging containing non-pregnancy related information (control). Participants were pregnant patients in their first trimester of pregnancy or less with a singleton pregnancy with reading and writing abilities in English. Pregnant patients with health issues, including chronic conditions, prior illnesses, health comorbidities, and prior pregnancies, were excluded. A total of 4,000 pregnant patients are expected to be randomized to either treatment (SmartMom) or control groups in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention consisted of three text messages a week with information to promote healthy behaviors during pregnancy, and the controls received one text message weekly containing general information about pregnancy. The primary outcome measures were the rate of pregnancy weight gain within range appropriate for pre-pregnancy body mass index and attendance at prenatal care visits, which were analyzed throughout pregnancy and 38 weeks postpartum. Secondary outcomes included improvement in health knowledge, health literacy, decreased depression, reduced anxiety, and lower rates of tobacco use throughout pregnancy. Additionally, the rates of planned VBAC after a previous cesarean birth, exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge, rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as gestational diabetes, stillbirth, preterm birth, and SGA status at 1 month postpartum. Study results showed that although SmartMom was successful in improving certain perinatal outcomes, its effectiveness and benefits will need to be assessed further."
