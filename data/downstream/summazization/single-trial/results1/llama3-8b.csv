This clinical trial aims to investigate the psychological factors associated with nociplastic pain (NP) in women with chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia. The study will assess the role of personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences in these conditions. The study will use a cluster analysis approach to identify specific psychological clusters that are associated with each condition.

The study will recruit 150 women with chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia, as well as 50 healthy controls. Participants will complete a series of self-report questionnaires assessing central sensitivity, traumatic experiences, personality traits, defense mechanisms, mental pain, environmental sensitivity, depression, anxiety, and quality of life.

The primary outcomes of the study will be the central sensitivity index, traumatic experiences index, personality traits, defense mechanisms, mental pain, and environmental sensitivity. The secondary outcomes will include the presence and intensity of psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosomatics, physical and psychological quality of life, alexithymic traits, perceived social support, sexual satisfaction, and genital pain.

The study will provide valuable insights into the psychological factors that contribute to NP in women with chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia, and may inform the development of targeted interventions to improve symptom management and quality of life in these women."

This randomized controlled trial compares the pressure ulcer prevention effects of two mattresses with different support surfaces in bedridden patients. The study includes 18-year-old or older patients with a low risk rating on the Braden Scale, a BMI not exceeding 30, and no pressure sores upon admission. Patients are randomly assigned to either a group using a massage mattress with a cube/block system or a group using a standard viscoelastic pressure sore prevention mattress.

The primary outcome measure is the number of patients without pressure ulcers, assessed after four weeks. Patients in both groups undergo daily pressure ulcer assessments and have their pressure sore area calculated in square centimeters. The study aims to determine if the massage mattress with a cube/block system is more effective in preventing pressure ulcers compared to the standard mattress."

The SMILER study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a serious game (SG) as an emerging e-health intervention for young people with neurologic or respiratory disorders, specifically asthma. The study involves 12-17 year olds with controlled asthma, who will be randomly assigned to either a group that receives the SG intervention or a control group that follows the standard treatment plan.

The SG is a running game that uses a 4K projector and Kinect sensor to track the child's movements and adapt the experience based on their motor skills and physiological data. The game includes exercises such as side bending, high jump, side lunge, and squat to help children with asthma maintain an aerobic zone.

The primary outcome measures are the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Skills and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Ita), which will be assessed at 6 months. The secondary outcome measure is the Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA), also assessed at 6 months.

Exclusion criteria include flare-ups requiring oral corticosteroids, recent use of leukotriene receptor antagonists or therapy, respiratory infections, and various medical conditions. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the SG in improving quality of life and asthma management in young people with asthma."

The study ""Cue Effects in Human Addiction: Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer"" aims to investigate the effects of acute and chronic stress on Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer (PIT) in individuals with mild to moderate alcohol use disorder (AUD) and healthy controls. PIT is a process where a previously learned association between a stimulus and a reward influences subsequent behavior. The study consists of three experiments, each with a different design and focus.

Experiment 1 assesses the effects of acute and chronic stress on PIT in AUD individuals and healthy controls. The study uses a 2x2 design, with stress or no stress induction and AUD or healthy control groups. The primary outcome measures include neural PIT effects, behavioral PIT effects, and chronic stress levels.

Experiment 2 explores the relationships between PIT, cognitive control, and substance use disorders. The study uses a 2x3 factorial design, with AUD and non-AUD groups, and daily smokers, non-daily smokers, and non-smokers. The primary outcome measures include interference costs, PIT effects, and associations between PIT effects and substance use disorder symptoms.

Experiment 3 investigates the effects of outcome-specific PIT on behavior and neural activity. The study uses a full PIT paradigm, which includes primary reinforcers and Pavlovian stimuli. The primary outcome measures include behavioral PIT effects, neural PIT effects, and associations between PIT effects and substance use disorder symptoms.

The study also includes secondary outcome measures, such as saliva cortisol concentrations, alcohol consumption after 12 months, and cognitive control measures. The study aims to provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying PIT and its relationship to substance use disorders, as well as the effects of stress on PIT."
