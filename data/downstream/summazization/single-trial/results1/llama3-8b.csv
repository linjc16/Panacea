This is a prospective observational study conducted at nine children's hospitals to evaluate the use of a water-soluble contrast-based protocol to assist in the management of pediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO). The study aimed to detect a 15% difference in operative rate between the contrast and no contrast groups. A total of 314 patients were planned to be enrolled, but the actual number is not specified.

The study included children aged 1-20 years diagnosed with ASBO by an attending pediatric surgeon and underwent a trial of nonoperative management (NOM) on hospital admission. Patients were excluded if they had peritonitis, suspicion of incarcerated or internal hernia, active intra-abdominal malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, or known contrast allergy.

The contrast protocol involved the administration of 30-200ml of enteral contrast followed by X-rays at 8-12 hours and 24 hours after contrast administration. The decision to operate was at the discretion of the attending surgeon. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients who required an operation, and secondary outcomes included total hospital length of stay and adverse events resulting from contrast administration.

The study found that five sites used contrast routinely and four used it selectively at the end of the study. The contrast agent and volume used varied across sites, but the protocol was standardized otherwise. The study did not find a significant difference in operative rate between the contrast and no contrast groups. However, the study suggests that the use of enteral contrast may be associated with a shorter hospital length of stay and fewer complications in patients with ASBO."

The study, ""Influencing Panoramic Imaging Errors With Strips,"" aimed to evaluate the effect of using celluloid matrix tapes and oral tapes as a simple and cheap method for proper positioning of the tongue on reducing the palatoglossal airway shadow error in panoramic imaging. The study included 270 patients, aged 15 years and above, who underwent panoramic radiography. The patients were randomly divided into three groups: a control group, a group using celluloid matrix tapes, and a group using edible strips (fruit leather or chewing gum). The patients in the experimental groups were instructed to place the strips on their tongues before panoramic imaging. The radiographs were assessed by an oral and maxillofacial radiologist to identify and record errors. The primary outcome measure was the effect of using different strips on reducing the palatoglossal air space shadow error. The results showed that the use of celluloid matrix tapes and edible strips significantly reduced the error rate compared to the control group. The study suggests that the use of these strips can be a simple and effective way to improve the quality of panoramic radiographs and reduce diagnostic errors."

Primary outcomes: Change in weight during pregnancy, attendance at prenatal care visits, and rate of pregnancy weight gain.

Secondary outcomes: Changes in health knowledge, health literacy, fear of childbirth, depression, anxiety, and use of tobacco, vaping, alcohol, or cannabis. Additionally, the study assesses rates of planned vaginal birth after cesarean, exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge, and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as gestational diabetes, stillbirth, preterm birth, and small for gestational age status.

The study aims to determine the effectiveness of the SmartMom program in improving pregnancy outcomes and reducing the risk of adverse events, while also evaluating its cost-effectiveness."
