Concurrently with randomized controlled trials, observational studies are conducted. The purpose of these studies is to find out whether an association exists among exposure and disease. It provides evidence for the effectiveness of interventions and/or prognosis.
In the case of the interventions, there are a few prospective studies with enough number of cases and controls. Some of the prospective studies are ongoing and they are provided below. However, no large sufficient data are accumulated up-to-date.
Hence, data accumulated from large scale trials such as Japan and International Study of Acute Pancreatitis are considered to be the largest data set up-to-date. This study has produced several publications up-to-now. 
In the case of mortality studies, retrospective studies are done as this approach is sufficient enough because pancreatitis-associated death is rare.
In this page, large studies summaries and recently published important studies on pancreatic duct stone and suture-tool will be described.

Ongoing retrospective studies


In 2013, The Japan Study of Acute Pancreatitis Research Group (JSAP) conducted a nationwide, prospective, observational, multicenter study entitled as Japan Study of Acute Pancreatitis (JSAP) study.  The aim of the study was to investigate the long term prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis.   This study enrolled 4988 cases and a total of 3824 patients were followed up for a median of 32.3 months to assess morbidity and mortality.
JSAP study identified the following clinical predictions of prognosis:

26,"[/INST] The objective of this Longitudinal CrossOver Clinical Trial is to compare changes in heart rate variability modulation in chronic renal patients while they undergo conventional physical exercise and in a virtual environment during hemodialysis sessions. The main questions it aims to answer are: What are the differences in these changes in heart rate variability modulation between chronic renal patients undergoing such exercise before and during hemodialysis sessions, and those that don't perform the virtual environment exercise but undergo the same type of exercise? Furthermore, we wish to know how the virtual environment influences such changes with respect to the exercise that the patients have been performing before. How does the virtual environment for exercise compare to conventional exercise in improving heart rate variability modulation in chronic renal patients before and during hemodialysis sessions? This group will be compared with another group that also hasn't been practicing any physical activity but has been undergoing the same type of hemodialysis sessions with virtual environment instead of conventional physical exercise."

28,"[/INST] This is a study which performed to assess efficiency of a new modification of the mini-incision approach versus standard incision approach in carpal tunnel release.
Longitudinal mini-incision: This is a surgical technique, as for most surgeries, a longitudinal incision is used, but it is very short incision, just above the proximal flexor crease, and it is created along the medial palmer axis of the ring finger, and then it is extended proximally for 1.5-2 cm.
Conventional incision: This technique is used by surgeons when they use a standard incision for a surgery, in this case for carpal tunnel release, they are using a longitudinal incision that starting between the thenar and hypothenar eminences, along the ring finger axis and it is extended to the proximal wrist crease.
New randomized mini-incision approach versus the standard approach for carpal tunnel release has showed statistically significant benefits in terms of reduction of pain and the rate of recurrences, the efficiency of the surgery and the scar effect.
Carpal tunnel release: A surgical procedure that is used to treat carpal tunnel syndrome, a common condition among adults that leads to tingling and numbness of the hand and fingers.
Carpal tunnel syndrome: A condition of the wrist and hand caused by compression or pressure on the median nerve, usually from swelling or thickening of this nerve because of carpal tunnel release."

37,"[/INST]This is a prospective, randomised, double blind, controlled, clinical study comparing the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided sacral erector spinae plane (SESP) block vs. normal care on intra-operative pain and post-operative analgesia requirements in patients undergoing lumbar microdiscectomy."
38,"[/INST] The investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a practical and inexpensive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain, which shows sensitivity to change in relation to treatment. Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as tightened muscle bands, trigger points, and restricted fascia motion. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose a 2-year project with three stages: (1) development (year 1-2), (2) validation (year 2-3), and (3) clinical translation into the NIH Research Collaboratory for Chronic Low Back Pain Biagnosis and Classification (year 3-5)"

40,"[/INST] The aim of the proposed research is to measure the impact of a new program called (SNLP) developed by a clinical psychologist, a social worker and one education specialist, on the school performance of Lebanese primary school children. The program is based on neurolinguistic and NLP techniques that aim to improve behavior, concentration, and reasoning of children. The secondary aims pertain to children with identified disabilities (ADHD). 

Sample Size: [/INST] We intend to enroll 130 schoolchildren between the ages of 5 and 11 years attending the same school for at least a year. The sample will consist of 130 children, with 71 subjects from each schools (experimental group=28+23+20+9 and control group=28+23+20+9). 

 Eligibility Criteria
[/INST] Schoolchildren aged between 5 and 11 years attending the same school for at least a year. 

 Arms and Interventions [/INST] Intervention/Treatment: Behavioral: Neuro-linguistic program  Intervention:  Neuro-linguistic program developed by three specialists (a clinical psychologist, a social worker, and one education specialist). 4 (45 minutes) sessions for teachers, and 2 for children (total of 6 sessions). 

Primary Outcome Measures 
[/INST] Schoolchildren's strengths and difficulties progression through the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire 
A parent (mother or father or legal guardian) of 130 children will be asked to fill out a survey. The first 25 items in the SDQ comprise 5 scales of 5 items each. It is usually easiest to score all 5 scales before working out the Total Difficulties score. Somewhat True is always scored as 1, but the scoring of Not True and Certainly True varies with each item. For each of the 5 scales, the score can range from 0-10 if all 5 items were completed. Scale scores can be prorated if at least 3 items were completed. Using the comments, a substantial risk of clinically significant problems score on the Total Difficulties Score can be used to identify likely ''cases with mental disorders."

65,"[/INST] The objective of this study is to accurately identify and, importantly, robustly assess the prognostic significance of extranodal extension in head and neck squamous cell cancer. This will be done by (1) defining the clinical scenario amenable to CT and/or MRI imaging for identifying such disease and (2) quantifying the accuracy of radiologists when they are asked to determine whether or not tumours involve regions outside of the main neck node basin -/inst.

Study Rationale
| Term | Description |
| -===========>|=======|
| Aim: to assess the accuracy of radiologists in determining the presence or absence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck cancer (HNC). -/inst. The rationale for this clinical problem is based on observations in the literature to date, which has already identified deficiencies in doctors being able to identify the extent of extranodal extension, and therefore the extent of neck dissection required. This study will measure this, as no standardized validated classification has yet been clearly established. -/inst.
| Study Design: For this question, the study design must be completed. -/inst.
| Rationale: For this question, you must provide a clear rationale and how it relates to the research question. -/inst.

Enrolled PBC and AIH patients in clinical diagnosis and treatment at Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 2021 to December 2023. After enrollment, the demography data of patients, the treatment information of PBC and AIH patients, the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (`UDCA'', 'Ursodiol'), COVID-19 infection and incidence, clinical symptoms, clinical biochemistry, liver imaging, lung imaging, COVID-19 nucleic acid, COVID-19 antibody, and the incidence and treatment information of COVID-19 from January 2022 to pre enrollment were collected. Meanwhile, the corresponding treatment and clinical observation of PBC and AIH were continued, and the occurrence and incidence of COVID-19 infection were observed. For patients with COVID-19 infection during the prospective observation period, COVID-19 infection, onset and treatment were observed, including clinical symptoms, signs, heart, lung imaging, COVID-19, clinical biochemistry, disease degree, virus negative, hospital stay and prognosis. This study is aim to compare the difference of COVID-19 infection rate, disease severity, clinical biochemical indicators, hospital stay and prognosis between UDCA treated and non UDCA treated patients, and to study the impact of UDCA on the occurrence, incidence and prognosis of COVID-19 infection."
73,"[/INST] Study Overview
Preoperative prone position training is a new rehabilitation method, and very few studies have described the effect of this method on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing surgery. However, a number of animal studies have shown that prone positioning can facilitate postoperative ventilation, reduce the pulmonary complications, and shorten the duration of hospital stay.  For laparoscopic colorectal operation, it is well known that abdominal volume compression is a common complication. In previous clinical studies, the lungs compression has been reported in 36.1%~81.5% of patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The purpose of this work is to investigate whether preoperative prone position training can reduce the pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Our main hypothesis is preoperative prone position training can reduce the pulmonary complications after surgery in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Primary outcome is better outcome is a incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The main outcome is better outcome is no pulmonary complications, The primary outcome is unintroduce. The purpose document type and discuss the purpose. The entire document."

Detailed Description
====
The main result of this feasibility study is to verify the non-inferiority of the tecartherapy on the sham comparison group for the improvement of sprint and jumping performances on a young athlete population.
Term / Measure
Non-Inferiority (NI) 
The tecartherapy is not inferior to the sham intervention on the improvement of the sprint and jumping performances of the amateur athletes.
Assay Modality/Outcome
Inferiority Margin (Delta)
Acceptable non-inferiority limits for the sprint performance: Δ3% for 30 meters sprint. 
Non-Inferiority Limit (NI-limit)
The non-inferiority limit will be calculated based on the methodology proposed by O'Brien and Jones (1997) and considering a significance level of alpha = 0.05 and power of 80%.
Sprint performance (30m, in seconds)
The main efficacy parameter is 30 meters sprint which will be measure in 3 different times: 1. before intervention; 2. immediately after intervention (post-intervention) and 3. one-month after intervention (follow-up)
Non-Inferiority Test

The non-inferiority test will be conducted on the change of sprint performance in the tecartherapy arm compared to the sham intervention arm.
Acceptable Confidence Intervals for Sprint Performance
A non-inferiority limit of 3% will be used. The non-inferiority limit is established due to previous studies such as Lameer et al. (2008) and O'Brien and Jones (1997) and will be calculated based on a minimal significant positive effect clinical changes and the associated symptoms in athletes after a 30 minutes of tecartherapy will be compared with a 30 minutes of tecartherapy sham therapy.

Historical controls will be created by matching the study population on the list of women visiting LabOuest microbiology laboratory and on the list of physicians in the study (practice, gender) with women who did not receive selective antibiotic susceptibility testing at LabOuest.
Census data will be used to define the denominator for the creation of the general population controls. 
Rates of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing will be compared with the historical control by chi2 test.
Rates of directed antibiotic de-escalcation will be compared with the historical control by t-test.
A regression analysis will be performed for :
- GP characteristics
- Patient characteristics associated with selective antibiotic susceptibility testing as compared to with a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing
- E. coli antimicrobial susceptibility profiles associated with selective antibiotic susceptibility testing as compared to with a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing

The choice of the time window for broad spectrum antibiotic dispensing will be determined following a pilot and prior to the main study by a statistician.
Statistical analysis will be performed in consultation with the statistical team from DCIR and from the National Healthcare Databank (DRS).

103,"[/INST] Supportive and palliative care play an important role in cancer treatment, and when introduced early can improve quality of life and may even increase median survival rates, as shown in patients with advanced lung cancer. Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) is a popular supportive approach among oncology patients and is on the rise. As a response to this demand, there is an understanding that these approaches need to be integrated into cancer care. In 90% of large comprehensive cancer centers in the US and in many others in Europe and elsewhere, complementary and integrative medicine is being integrated into supportive patient care. In Israel similar trend is observed and 8 integrative oncology services has been established around the country in the majority of oncology centers. Homeopathy is one of the CIM modalities utilized by patients with cancer. It is widely practiced worldwide, especially in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the United States, during the 1990s, sales of homeopathic medicines grew at an annual rate of 20-25%, and in the 2015 US national health statistics report, homeopathy was mentioned as used by over 5 million people. This modality involves detailed interview that emphasizes the unique characteristics of symptoms experienced by patients followed by utilizing highly diluted substance. Dilutions that are above 12c (dilution of 10-24 actually do not have the original material) and this is done in homeopathy. In one prospective observational study that was conducted in Germany with cancer patients in two differently treated cohorts: one cohort with patients under complementary homeopathic treatment, and one cohort with conventionally treated cancer patients. It was observed that the use of homeopathic medicine, as a supportive approach, reflects clinical benefit that is not attributed to homeopathic medicine in a supportive patient care, and integrated oncology approach, with a great summary of the trial data. sales, reflect a great

134,"[/INST] This study is conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of hydroxyurea and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients. Monotherapy of Hydroxyurea was sustained at a daily dosage from 10 to 20 mg/kg for a duration of six months, during which the treatment response was documented. After this initial 6-month period, thalidomide was introduced into the treatment regimen. The details of the drug are as follows: Thalidomide was administered orally at bedtime, with an initial dosage of 2 to 5 mg/kg. An incremental dosage was prescribed to those who showed insufficient response to the initial dosage. The treatment schedule included a 2-week on treatment and drug-free 2-week wash-out period every 4 weeks. Blood transfusions were administered under specific circumstances throughout the combination therapy. Transfusions were initiated if the Hb levels dropped below 7 g/dL or if patients exhibited instability, regardless of their Haemoglobin levels. Patients who were undergoing iron chelation therapy (utilizing deferasirox, deferiprone, and/or deferoxamine) while on HY Chat Doctor.  Liver function was also monitored throughout the study duration. Safety parameters, such as a complete blood count, liver function tests, and the size of the spleen and liver, were documented and kept in record continuously throughout the study duration."

An implant is a small device used in dental surgery to support a bridge, denture, or to act as an abutment for orthodontic attachments. Various implant designs exist but all are made of a threaded titanium post that acts as an anchoring device to hold the abutment and prosthesis or to act as an anchor for a bridge. The implant also has a bone anchoring portion that is inserted into the bone in the jaw, where it fuses with the bone through a process called osseointegration. Osseointegration is the process by which new bone grows in and around the implant essentially fusing it to the bony structural elements of the jaw, giving the implant stability.

142,"[/INST] The purpose of this study is to test new algorithms for detecting pump malfunctions that result in reduced or interrupted insulin delivery. [/METH] Subjects will be recruited who use an insulin pump for a continuous delivery of insulin over the basal-bolus regimen. Subjects will be asked to undergo three study phases over one month period: Preliminary data collection - The subject will wear a CGM sensor for a one-month period during which the pump delivers its basal insulin dose. This allows the pump to learn the patient's baseline rhythm, which will be used during the following sessions. Induction of hyperglycemia - Subjects are asked to visit the clinic for a one-day protocol where pump is suspended (the 'unexplained' hyperglycemia is attributed to the missing insulin delivery). The presence and duration of hyperglycemia are documented and reported by the patient. Retrospective data analysis - Retrospective analysis of the days when hyperglycemia was present recorded in session 2 (duration 6-8 hours). [/COMM]

145,"[/INST] Child/Children A group of individuals who have the common characteristics assigned to them so that cohort studies can be performed. Children are considered a vulnerable population because of (1) their susceptibility to environmental health risks and (2) the potential severity of consequences experienced in the case that a study subject is harmed or dies. Children are further susceptible to harm from interventions due to their size, inexperience, and cognitive immaturity. Confounding by indication: Bias due to the non-random selection of a patient population for an intervention; also called tainted co-relation (i.e. therapy X, when compared to Y, was more effective among patients who were already X-predisposed). Confounding variable: A variable that is present during exposure(s) or time of follow-up that may have a contribution in the causal relationship but it is also differentially associated with the exposure and outcome of interest. The effect of these factors cannot be separated from the exposure-outcome relationship. Dose-response or dose-response curve: A measure of how the exposure to a medical treatment or intervention affects outcomes, such as survival or rate of recurrence. Heterogeneity: Variation between or within treatment groups that is not explainable by demographics such as gender, age, etc. Lack of power : The term used when a study is under-sampled, meaning that the number of subjects enrolled is too small to answer the primary research question. Linkage: The process of obtaining data from an existing database. The process of linking data from one or more database(s) to one or more records in a cohort database.
Population: A group or a statistically identifiable subset of individuals within a group. Subject/Subjects: A person or people who take part in a study. A subject (aka trial subject or research subject) volunteer: A person who takes part in a study of healthy or diseased states, or both, or who receives a medical treatment. The subject is a vulnerable population because of (1) their susceptibility to environmental health risks and (2) the potential severity of consequences experienced in the case that a study subject is harmed or dies.
Outcome variable: The variable that is measured or observed in a study. It is often contrast with explanatory or predictor variables that may influence an outcome variable."

The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a music therapy on anxiety in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary objectives are : To evaluate the impact of the music therapy on the quality of life of localized breast cancer patients. To evaluate the quality of the relationship which the breast cancer patients have with their therapist.

Measures:
State Trait Anxiety Inventory == Measures of State Anxiety - Measures of Trait Anxiety

Clinician rated 11 items, scoring each on 0-2 for a possible total score range of -26 to 56. 20 items, (10 anxiety-related and 10 nonanchors) scoring each on 0-3 for a possible total score range of 20-60.

Quality Of Life Questionnaire: Quality of life is defined as being in accordance with the meaning of life. It includes four topics: physical energy, General mental health, social relationships and future perspective. Each score range from 1 to 4.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale == Measures of anxiety and depression

HADS consists of 14 items, each scored on 5-point scale. Higher scores are indicative of more anxiety or depression.

HADS includes two 7-item scales to measure anxiety and depression. Cronbach α coefficient of .79 for anxiety, and .88 for depression subscales.

Practitioner rated. 

Psychometric evidence for HADS in breast cancer patients: In breast cancer outpatients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. HADS is a psychometric measure of anxiety and depression among women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In a sample of 64 breast cancer patients currently undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the mean total HADS anxiety score was 3.8 (0-21) and 3.0 (0-13) for depression (median 2.8 (0-19), and 2.0 (0-10), respectively).

Wong et al., Br J Cancer. 2001 Oct;85(7):1020-5. Epub 2001 Jan 24. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690210. PubMed PMID: 11157575. Related citations [64] have shown: Cronbach&#39;s alpha values for anxiety and depression were .88 and .81, respectively. All women completed valid and reliable measures. Of the HADS anxiety sub-scale, 10 items loaded on the anxiety factor, and the other 3 items loaded on the depression factor. Of the HADS depression sub-scale, 3 items loaded on the depression factor and 4 items on the anxiety factor. The total scores were based on the sum of all 14 items.

In conclusion, these data indicate that the HAD has adequate internal consistency in breast cancer outpatients receiving adjuvant therapy. In terms of factor analysis, two three-factor solutions for the anxiety sub-scale and a three-factor (neuroticism/anxiety, depressed affectivity and an unexpected double-factor depression-anxiety) factor analysis for the depression sub-scale can both explain the data; however, a two-factor (anxiety and depression) solution may also provide a reasonable theoretical fit. As both the Anxiety and Depression subscales are suitable for clinical use, both solutions should be considered to be valid measurement models.

Covariance structure for the HAD sub-scales: The correlation matrix for the four- item anxiety sub-scale was 0.73, 0.84, 0.80, and 0.82. The correlation matrix for the five-item sub-scale was 0.82, 0.84, 0.74, 0.87, and 0.84. The correlation matrix for the four-item depression sub-scale was 0.49, 0.46, 0.57, and 0.6"

161,"[/INST] (Text Redacted)  The main finding of this study is the following: A new technique of subtotal cholecystectomy called  coconut technique  can be introduced in cases that are potentially complicated by acute cholecystitis. We recently developed a simple but effective laparoscopic technique to approach and ligate the cystic duct in cases of difficult acute cholecystitis. Three to four centimeters of the inflamed gallbladder wall was then cut using an electrocautery hook. An incision was made in a safe zone at the junction of the infundibulum and the body of the gallbladder. The separation between the outer layer and inner layer was searched. This clear identification of the confluence between the cystic duct and the body of the gallbladder represents the way to determine if the procedure was safely completed using the current technique. After successful identification, the cystic duct was clipped. The inflamed posterior wall remained attached to the gallbladder bed of the liver."

The summary should address the rationale for the study, the study hypothesis(es), the general study design, the specific study intervention(s), and the anticipated importance of the study results for rehabilitation research and clinical practice.

Hypothesis: This proposal seeks to test the effectiveness of a novel electronic clinical decision support tool, the Physical Therapy Frequency Clinical Decision Support Tool (PT-PENCIL), for facilitating discharge home from the hospital. Specifically, we hypothesize that use of the PT-PENCIL will increase the proportion of patients discharged home relative to the proportion discharged home with the current standard of care, that the increase will be statistically significant, and that it will be cost-effective. In addition, we will use the PT-PENCIL as a ""quasi-active control"" in an implementation trial of strategies to facilitate a hospital-wide culture of value-based care, and thus the PT-PENCIL will be active at two different time points during the trial.
Objectives: The broad objectives of this investigation are to develop and implement the PT-PENCIL and then to test its effectiveness in improving the proportion of patients who are discharged to home rather than to a facility. We will also analyze the effectiveness of the PT-PENCIL in facilitating a value-based hospital culture, and additionally assess the reach, adoption, appropriateness, and feasibility of the PT-PENCIL.
Methods: The specific aims are as follows:

Aim 1: Analyze the effect of using the PT-PENCIL on the proportion of patients discharged home.
Aim 2: Assess the reach, adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the PT-PENCIL.
Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the PT-PENCIL in facilitating a value-based hospital culture. Aim 4: Evaluate the effectiveness of the PT-PENCIL in facilitating an evidence-based clinical practice in physical therapy.
Aim 5: Evaluate the effectiveness of the PT-PENCIL in facilitating future randomized trial in order to improve the care delivery bundle clinical decision support tool, 28 day time, and home, as a PT-PENClinical decision.

188,"[/INST] A randomized controlled trial is designed to determine the effect of stabilization on archery performance. In order to measure the effect of stabilization, cervical and lumbar stabilization will be measured for the athlete before and after the application of stabilization techniques. The athlete’s scapular dyskinesis type, amount and muscle contraction will also be measured before and after the application of stabilization techniques. The sports performance of the athlete before and after the application of stabilization techniques will also be measured by the athlete’s shooting score for 72 arrows.

214,"[/INST] This is a clinical study of 68Ga-NOTA-H006 in the positron emission tomography and computed tomography imaging methodology for malignant tumors. 68Ga-NOTA-H006 is a chelating agent for positron emission tomography. H006 is intended as a diagnostic agent for tumor imaging and for other diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In a previous PhaseOne trial (10C006), we have shown that 68Ga-H006 is a promising agent to image a wide range of malignancies including soft tissue (Sarcoma), lung cancer (Non-small cell, small cell and others), gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and bone cancer. To further improve the imaging quality of 68Ga-NOTA-H006, the current PhaseTwo trial will focus on optimizing the imaging parameters by using different injection doses and scan times. The PET/CT scan methodology will also be optimized. In addition, as 68Ga-NOTA-H006 is taken up by cells at varying rates, preliminary dosimetry will be developed for tumor patients. [/INST]"

Rationale for Study

This is a research study to address whether direct-from-blood bacterial testing affects antibiotic administration and patient outcomes at the point of care.  

General study design considerations

Study approach:
Pragmatic (versus explanatory): The goal of this study is to maximize internal validity by minimizing differences in the characteristics of patients receiving intervention vs. those receiving control treatment. In a pragmatic clinical trial, treatment is implemented as it would be in practice; control vs. intervention groups are not required to be similar at baseline.
Blinding
There will be no blinding. 
Sample size
The sample size will be determined after discussions with the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.
Detailed sample size revised 4/8/2015 to 1240 Participants: ""384 participants will be randomized, resulting in 920 total""
Primary outcome measure / metric
Time from randomization to last dose of vancomycin
Time from randomization to last dose of vancomycin
Time from randomization to last dose of anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotic
Time from admission to start of anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotic
Measurement frequency (interval, duration, etc.)
Daily or weekly, until 14 days
Confounding factors / variables considered/ controlled for
Baseline patient characteristics
Pre-morbid illnesses
Respiratory status
Hour of blood culture taken, site of site of blood culture taken, blood culture bottle / tube type and sample size
Laboratory test results
Anti-pseudomonal antibiotics used by the clinician
Adherence to clinical guidelines at the time of enrollement
Randomization
Allocation concealment
No blinding
Blinded endpoint assessment
Unblinding
Acceptance criteria
After review by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
Other considerations
No plans for interim analyses: There may be a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, and there may be interim analyses done in accordance with a protocol if agreed upon by the investigator, the Study Chair or the DSMB, and the Sponsor
Statistical considerations
Analysis plan
Time-to-event analysis, intention-to-treat
Statistical plan may be adjusted if a benefit is observed in a pre-specified subgroup
Our previous analyses have indicated that baseline characteristics, age, and admission creatinine will not be associated with variation in time to administration of the last dose of vancomycin. We are proposing to include these variables in our final model with an interaction term and an associated P value cutoff of .2 to enter final analyses.
Follow-up rate
Follow-up rate/data quality
Interim analyses
Interim analyses are planned for futility before 30% of patients are enrolled and every quarter thereafter. There may be additional interim analysis if there is evidence of a concern for safety or futility. A futility interim analysis will lead to the study being terminated. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will make recommendations to the Trial Steering Committee and study sponsor for whether to halt the trial if the results of a futility analysis suggest it is warranted.
Plans for sharing of research resources
Sharing of research resources: Other projects / studies may use the same primary outcome measure and / or laboratory tests."

The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the prevalence of persistent COVID-19 in a cohort of adult Punta Arenas and Magallanes. For this we will include patients between 18 and 100 years of age who have had at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test since July 2022. The prevalence of persistent COVID-19 diagnosis in this region will be determined by clinical evaluation of the patient. In addition, we will perform sociodemographic data questionnaire, psychology profiles (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, WAIS, standard laboratory assessment (full blood count and standard laboratory parameters), inflammatory biomarkers cytokines, immunophenotyping and other flow cytometry studies as well as functional assessment of the musculoskeletal system. The results of these tests will be analyzed so that we can determine if there is an association between persistent COVID-19 and the immune response, systemic and musculoskeletal impairment in patients."

279,"[/INST] The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of the Otoband against a sham device, in providing temporary relief of vertigo. Participants in each group will be randomized (like flipping a coin or rolling dice) to receive either the Otoband or sham device. The Otoband is a neck worn device designed to decrease the symptoms of vertigo by mechanically breaking abnormal movements of the semi-circular canal of the ear that contribute to vertigo, by mimicking the same movements of the otolith organs that occur in the semi-circular canals of the ear when we move our heads. The number of episodes of moderate or worse vertigo, along with changes in quality of life and other outcomes will be measured.

302,"[/INST]The treatment was randomly assigned is group-based intervention of 12 weeks, twice a week (60 min/time). At the end of 12 weeks, a secondary aim was to assess the impact of continued intervention by sending a monthly letter to each participant.
[/INST]

The participants were asked to fill in a baseline questionnaire 1, after 12 weeks in intervention (test 2) and after 12 months (test 3). Quality of life (SF-36) was assessed by postal self-reported questionnaire.


Experimental group: 132 (95% 96-158)
Age: mean 66.6 (SD 1.4)
Time before menopause: 42.0 (4.8)
Median years of Education: 8 (IQR 6-12)
Number of years since menopause: 7.1 (6.3)
Mean BMI: 28.1 (SD 5.2)
Range 19-64.5
Income: The income distribution ranged by quartile from 1 to 4. In this study 25% were in the first quartile, 25% were in second quartile, 25% were in third quartile and 25% were in fourth quartile.
Intervention: In order to randomize participants the local investigator opened randomization envelopes that contained cards that corresponded to the group allocation on a pre printed schedule. It was done in sequentially numbered opaque manila sealed and sealed opaque envelopes. The treatments were provided by the local pharmacy department (after checking that they were in date) and supplied by Hospital Vallda or manufacturers supply chain service. The interventions were stored in an area accessible only to the study staff. Allocation concealment was preserved until the interventions were ready for use. The intervention package contained the exercise manual (Otago Exercise Program) and diaries for the participants to use each week where they were asked to record session attendance and number of sessions . Each participant was also given an engraved metal token to be retained during the intervention period. The tokens were serially numbered and supplied by the independent funder, for accounting and costing purposes, so the participants were identified to the research team as allocated to group by the investigator from the serial number and the unique number was matched with a randomization number on the basis of a pre-prepared spreadsheet to ensure concealment.
Active treatment group took part in the Otago exercise program delivered by a physiotherapist twice a week for 12 weeks on non-consecutive days of the week with the treatment sessions supervised by the physiotherapist. Participants performed all the exercises in 2 supervised sessions, lasting 30 minutes and was done by a supervised, 30 minutes long by a supervised by an physiotherapist trained physiotherapist. supervised exercise program physiotherapist. The participants were instructed to perform the exercise were to be administered by an exercise to performed twice a day prior to the community-based on the basis of the following the study purpose- Purpose statement to be 3- Exercise information.

Study Overview

Detailed Study Overview
== Hypothesis == 
The investigators propose to test the following hypothesis:
There are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity. These brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive and emotional gamblers.

Conclusion
**Conclusion**: The investigators hope to be able to demonstrate that these two alternative brain phenotypes predicted by the proposed model are associated with the gambling behavior, in both populations, as well as in the ecological momentary assessments (EMA)

Rationale
In their Introduction, the investigators wrote (BP [BN] or [BR]

A repeated measures and single-blinded randomized study was done. Methods. Thirty-eight patients 24 hours after Total Knee Arthroplasty were randomly assigned to either low intensity exercises (LIE) group or high intensity exercises (HIE) group. An exercise programs lasted for five days during the hospitalization period. Pain severity was assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 mm). Pressure pain thresholds were measured over quadriceps and biceps brachii and muscles immediately before and after exercise.

354,"[/INST] The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy and safety of the drug called opiochepalus striatus extract (Sibeliv) for the treatment of people with a condition called sarcopenia. People with sarcopenia experience a loss of muscle mass and a decrease in strength that results in a loss of independence with activities of daily living. The trial plans to verify the treatment drug with a placebo. Participants will receive the drug for 14 days or a placebo. The efficacy will be measured by checking the levels of the hormone called IGF-1 in the blood before treatment, on day 14, and two weeks after final drug administration. The safety and adverse effects will be also investigated."

The Study is designed to evaluate the health literacy of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The health literacy of the children are evaluated with the developed health literacy scale, then the children receive diabetes education through this board game. The health literacy scale for acute complications of type 1 diabetes for children will be tested for it’s validity and reliability. Then children will be followed up at 1 and 3 months after they finish this education.
What was the rationale for conducting the study?
The investigator wanted to know about the health literacy of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. This is because it is an important factor for prevention of the diabetes related complications. So an educational game was developed to improve the health literacy of the children. Then the investigator wants to test the validity and reliability of this game to ensure that it really improves the children’s health literacy. Furthermore, they will follow up the children after this education to see whether it reduced the diabetes related complications."

377,"[/INST] The trial design is a single group assignment. The symptomatic group will consist of patients who are referred with left leg swelling. Patients will undergo a diagnostic vascular ultrasound scan assessing the diameter of the left common iliac vein. The trial will assess inter- and intra-operator reliability, as well as test reliability. The control group will consist of patients recruited alongside the symptomatic group. This group, along with the general vascular ultrasound population, will not undergo the leg swelling symptom assessment. The trial duration is up to 6 months, with the primary outcome being measurement of the diameter of the left common iliac vein at baseline and 6 months."
378,"[/INST] The purpose of the study is to analyze the effects of visual training on the health-related quality of life of patients with symptomatic convergence insufficiency. In this study, 80 subjects who fulfilled all the inclusion criteria will be randomly divided into an experimental group (n=40) and a control group(n=40). The experimental subjects will receive visual training; the control subjects will not. The shortForm 6D and EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire will be used to identify outcomes. This study is designed to be enrolled in Wuhan and Hengyang city, China."

The primary objective is to determine whether ICG can be used effectively as a blue dye substitute to find and map sentinel lymph nodes in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer. The secondary objectives are to assess the feasibility of using ICG as a blue dye substitute for detecting sentinel lymph nodes in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer and to assess whether there are any differences in detection rates using ICG vs blue dye for sentinel lymph node mapping in a pilot trial with 20 patients.

Sample: [Detailed] The investigators will adopt a repeated measures analysis, collecting raw Wellbeing Index scores from the same subjects at three discrete time points: Baseline (i.e. before genetic analysis), 3 weeks after genetic results are received and at 3 months after baseline. The investigators will also assess the internal consistency of the Wellbeing Index by performing a Cronbach's alpha test at the three time points.
[Detailed] For the secondary outcomes regarding perception of DNA testing, the investigators will assess changes over time via a questionnaire with a Likert Scale from Strongly against to Strongly for.
Assessments/Measures: [Detailed] The primary outcome is assessed via repeated measures (Repeated-measures Analysis of Variance Scores). The secondary outcome is assessed via repeated measures, with the questionnaire being the only measure assessed within this arm.
[Detailed] The investigators will note any changes in gender distribution for the control arm and provide justification as to why there is only one treatment arm within the study.
Statistical Analysis: [Detailed] Depending on the distributions of the different outcome variables, the investigator will assess the internal consistency of the Wellbeing Index by performing a Cronbach's alpha test. Briefly, the investigators will assess the summary scores from the Wellbeing Index at different time points, with the mean Wellbeing Index from 0 (lowest Wellbeing) to 25 (highest Wellbeing) for each subject. The investigators will then assess (using RM-ANOVA) all data to determine differences are used in clinical care (MANOVA analysis) with all data with one dependent measures of well-being before well-being.

Note: Multiple randomized controlled clinical trials are demonstrating the beneficial effects of semaglutide on intracranial blood flow and reduced bloodbrain barrier permeability for reduction of stroke in patients with type-2 diabetes. Our preliminary data have shown that intracranial blood flow and bloodbrain permeability is reduced in non-diabetics and in type-2 diabetes and that semaglutide can improve the condition that is known to increase stroke risk. This study proposal will serve as a base for conducting the clinical trial demonstrating the beneficial effects of semaglutide for subjects with type-2 diabetes on intracranial blood flow and hence stroke risk as demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled clinical trials."

While the purpose is to provide a brief summary of the study, some information outside of the study's hypothesis, aims, and outcomes may be included if it helps understand the summary. The summary should be a structured paragraph that has the following headings: Objectives, Rationale, Design, and Participants and Interventions (if including sample size information).

Example:
===Objectives===
The primary objective of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of moderate alcohol consumption after an acute myocardial infarction.

Design
A total of 220 patients will be randomized to the moderate alcohol consumption or abstinence groups.

Participants and Interventions
Study groups will include those who were admitted and stabilized for an acute myocardial infarction within the past 365 days. After giving willing and written informed consent, patients are randomized to either 1 standard alcoholic beverage a day or abstinence for 12 months. All assigned participants will undergo serial echocardiography assessments through 12 months.

Rationale
While many believe that a moderate alcohol intake can have a positive health impact, the data on the use after acute myocardial infarction is limited. This work will recruit participants as soon as their MI has been stabilized and allow them to receive alcohol or maintain abstinence for 12 months. A total of 220 patients will be randomized to each arm and undergo serial echocardiography, with an aim of determining the safety and efficacy for the heart of a moderate alcohol consumption after an acute myocardial infarction."

This key study will be shared through the Open Science Framework and the plain text summary will aid in it's understanding.

Input Text:  The experimental and active comparator arms are labeled in the table above. The lactulose arm is labelled as such due to it's role as an inactive comparator. The table above displays the important aspects of the measurement schedule.  The trial group will employ a single center, block randomization and a single blinded design.  Measurements of effective colonic preparation will be done at 5 minutes after the end of the colonoscopy. The incidence, duration and severity of adverse effects are all important to measure. Adverse effects will be systematically monitored at two hours after having the bowel preparation. Taste will be measured via a 5 point scale. A number of liver function tests will be performed at two hours after the study."

Study Overview
[NEW Paragraph]
This study is an observational study to describe the characteristics and outcomes of US patients who have been treated with CAR T19-directed CLT for B-cell lymphoma. HISTORY OF HIV: Patients with a diagnosis of HIV who received an autologous CAR infusion for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and high grade B cell lymphoma, or primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma are eligible for this study. Patients with HIV disease who have previously received allogeneic CAR therapy are not eligible for this study. PROCEDURE / INVESTIGATIONAL PROCESS: The investigational product used for this study is autologous non-expanded lymphocytes that have been engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that targets CD19 to facilitate the destruction of cancer cells. All patients who receive the investigational product will be monitored for up to 12 months. Patients will undergo clinical assessment and laboratory testing at baseline, before the leukapheresis procedure, and at multiple time points after the procedure. Blood samples will be collected at specific time points following the infusion to assess for potential side effects of the procedure, including cytokine release syndrome. For the safety of the patient, serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB/EC within 24 hours. Some adverse events, as determined by the investigator, will also be reported to the IRB/EC outside of the 24-hour period. OTHER PROCEDURES OR INVESTIGATIONAL PROCEDURES: The intervention is the use of CD19-directed CAR T lymphocyte therapy for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. All patients will receive the investigational product at the same dose and administration route as approved by the FDA and in accordance with the FDA's specific recommendations for the treatment of patients with lymphoma. All patients will be provided with a copy of the Protocol and information sheet detailing the investigational procedures. PARTICIPANT MANAGEMENT: Eligible participants will undergoes management, which may include but is not limited to: Blood and Marrow Transplantation, as well as other lymphoma, autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection, storage facility, and the study the lymphocytes, as well-describe a stem cell product title and the patient level 1- A clear cell therapy and both lymph+ learn the product information (Document title, the document.

526,"[/INST]This is a retrospective analysis of the electronic patients’ notes to identify if higher doses of TXA are associated with a lower incidence of post-operative delirium after cardiac surgery. Potential confounding factors will be taken into account with multiple regression analysis. Delirium will be a clinical diagnosis recorded at the time of discharge in the medical notes with the International Delirium Screening Instrument (IDSI).
Hypothesis: [/INST]We hypothesise that higher doses of TXA will be associated with a lower incidence of post-operative delirium.
Potential Pitfalls / Limitations
- Retrospective analysis will limit definitive results
- Small sample size

This study is an ambispective cohort study. The information collected in the retrospective part mainly included demographic data, comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic data, times of hospitalization and patients' contact information. The above data were derived from electronic medical records. After informed consent, prospective follow-up was initiated primarily by telephone interviews and web-based questionnaires, or by in-person assessments at hospital return visits. Enrolled patients will be followed up at 6-month intervals after the first follow-up to assess psychiatric diagnosis, social function, and quality of life. The researchers are senior psychiatrists, all of whom received training on the use of questionnaires and inter-investigator consistency before the follow-up. Cox Proportional Hazard Model is used to analyze the influencing factors of remission of BPD, and Generalized Estimating Equation Model is used to analyze the influencing factors of the patients' social function and quality of life."

Given the nature of the therapeutic hypotheses and the results of previous studies, the sponsor intends to submit a Clinical Study Report to the French Authorities to obtain a Marketing Authorization. The research plan includes the following objectives: 1. To evaluate the safety and the efficacy of MENOSYM ® (olanzapine and tramadol) in the treatment of acute distress in male patients up to the age of 50 presenting with emotional disturbances related to spermatogenesis disorders or semen cryosurgery. 2. To assess the potential risk factors of a treatment with MENOSYM ®. 3. To assess whether patients aged over 50 years respond and tolerate as well as young patients. 4. To study the factors influencing the efficacy of the medication: age, sociodemographics, psychological characteristics (e.g., anxiety, depression). 5. To compare the characteristics of the patients and the dropouts and the characteristics of the patients completing the treatment. 6. To estimate the adherence rate to the treatment, defined as the percentage of patients who took at least 80% of the prescribed pills or the duration of treatment. 7. To compare the impact of the treatment on the patient's sexual life. 8. To evaluate the quality of the patients' life. 9. To compare the safety profiles of the two treatment arms. 10. To assess the risk factors of adverse events: in particular, in the case of weight gain, metabolic disorders. 11. To determine whether MENOSYM ® has an effect beyond the one of the placebo. 12. To determine whether male patients treated with MENOSYM ® and treated for emotional disturbances related to spermatogenesis disorders or semen cryosurgery are able to undergo a vasectomy and to reach an agreement with their partner. In the case of a treatment with MENOSYM ®, is it possible to identify a period after the treatment to undergo a vasectomy? The research plan also entails: 13. The socio-demographic characteristics. 14. The psychological characteristics of the patients: quality of life, mental health. 15. The medical characteristics: medical history, vital signs. 16. Therapeutic drug monitoring to assess the adherence to the treatment. 17. The risk factors of premature discontinuation of the treatment, intolerance. 18. To evaluate the acceptability of the treatment and the adherence to the treatment. 19. Safety data: adverse events. 20. To assess the relapse rate.   21. To determine whether this treatment can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. To identify the factors associated with a good acceptability of the treatment and the factors associated with a low medication adherence. 23. To study the factors influencing the rate of adverse events in the different subgroups (dropouts, completers), in particular in relation to age. 24. To describe the main characteristics of the treatment failures (placebo effect). 25. To collect detailed treatment data in a specialized center (clinical and demographic data, psychological characteristics, adverse events). 26. To collect a comprehensive summary of the patient medical data, the patient therapy. 27.

567,"[/INST] Transglutaminase is an enzyme overexpressed in gastrointestinal mucosa of patients with coeliac disease. Intestinal anti-transglutaminase antibodies represent a valuable tool in the diagnosis of both the classical and atypical forms of the disease. Their detection is based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. In the present proposal a rapid and optimized protocol for the detection of these autoantibodies using enzymatic spot testing is put forward. It is based on a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay but avoids a prolonged incubation step and the need for a washing step. Antibodies detected are eluted and quantified from mechanically-lysed intestinal tissue, which is easily obtained during the endoscopic examination with the use of a standard biopsy instrument.

 The Prevalence of the Linburg-Comstock Variation 

Study Overview 
Details
Five hundred male and female patients over the age of 35 will be recruited to participate through convenience sampling. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of patients with a diagnosis of thumb CMC arthritis. There is no control group due to the recruitment of one patient population. Once enrolled, commitment of the participants will consist of one time during their regular office visit. The patients will be asked by the recruiting physicians to perform a clinical examination looking for the LCV, which will take a total of five seconds. This is a self-test and not part of a regular clinical examination. Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria will be consented during office clinic visit with Dr. Michael Mulligan, Dr. Richard Uhl, Dr. Patrick Marinello, Dr. Andrew Morse, Dr. George Zanaros, Dr. Whipple and Dr. David Quinn. The descriptive study will collect demographic data, and dichotomous data indicating whether a patient has the variation or not, and if the variation is present in one hand or both hands. The study will take place at the Bone and Joint Center at 1365 Washington Avenue, Albany New York, and satellite offices in Guilderland, Clifton Park, Malta, Saratoga, Schenectady and Catskill. Data will be collected for up to two years. There are no risks to patients enrolled in the study, as the test involves asking the patient to simply bend the tip of their thumb. Documentation of the variation is not usually noted in the chart. Therefore, the physicians involved in the study will be asked to include the findings of the variation in their documentation. The patients will be informed during clinical examination if they have a LCV. There is no compensation to participants for enrolling in the study."

Title: [PROT] Protocol Title
[ELI2] What is the disease or condition the research is studying?
==== Research Design and Methods ====
[RES2] Brief summary of how the research studies will be conducted.  Protocols should include a subsection detailing any prospective studies.
This is a prospective study of the diagnostic performance of indocyanine green microangiography (ICG) in comparison with conventional angiography for studying tissue perfusion in severe frostbite patients undergoing thrombolysis.
Recent technological advances in the use of indocyanine green (ICG) have revolutionized intraoperative and bedside assessment of perfusion as have the advances in angiography. Frozen tissue is assessed both in the operating room using conventional angiography and then at the bedside using ICG to determine if blood flow has been restored and thrombolysis can be discontinued. In patients with frostbite, assessment of blood flow is critical to prevent amputation of the affected extremity. This prospective study will be the first to compare these two modalities in the same patient to assess the diagnostic performance of ICG. Hypothesis: these two imaging modalities will be concordant at demonstrating the ischemic tissue present in severe frostbite.
==== Study Population ====
[RES3] Participants to be studied, including inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Frostbite patients in Regions Hospital Emergency Department and Regions Hospital Regions Ambulatory Surgery Center presenting for thrombolysis undergoing both indocyanine green and conventional angiography.
To be determined by study director following Institutional Review Board approval.

Previous work by the same group showed that postoperative recovery is slower in those patients treated with usual supportive care, possibly associated with early adipose tissue infiltration and systemic inflammation. The aim of the present clinical trial is to test the potential anti-inflammatory effects of ONS in a preoperative nutritional strategy in order to confirm previous preclinical findings in a clinical setting."

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that usually affects the terminal ileum and the gut loops. Mesenteric bacterial translocation has been associated with Crohn's disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the involvement of gut bacterial translocation and innate immunity in the early postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.
This is a longitudinal study that will include Crohn's disease patients undergoing ileorectal anastomosis. A prospective cohort of healthy subjects matched for age and sex will be used as control. Patients eligible for the study will be included after a surgical procedure (ileocecectomy or ileostomy) for treatment of Crohn's disease with anastomosis and stenosis of the intestinal lumen. Controls subjects will be selected from patients with abdominal surgery other than ileocecectomy or ileostomy (such as mastectomy or colectomy) submitted to ileocecectomy or ileostomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis for other reasons.
This study will compare the gut bacterial translocation of patients with early postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease with the bacterial translocation of a group of healthy subject submitted to ileocecectomy or ileostomy for other reasons. Moreover, the innate immunity parameters will also be investigated to detect whether there is association between the innate immunity markers and the gut bacterial composition."

Procedures
Local anesthesia and general anesthesia was done in all groups.
Used technique: All groups received intravenous (IV) premedication with (Atracurium 0.5 mg / kg IV) then peripheral nerve stimulation at M.B.E. Nielsen square with current intensity at 50 mA for 5 minutes. All patients received intraoperative fentanyl citrate (2 micro gram/kg IV) and intercostal nerve stimulation.
Used solutions in groups (groups were 12 patients in each group)
Group1 (ESPB): 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 10 ml + 2ml normal saline.
Group2 (TPVB): 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 10 ml + 2ml normal saline.
Group3 (QLB): 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 10 ml + 2ml saline.
Postoperative morphine consumption
Each patient were followed up for 24 hours postoperative in PACU.
Mean consumption of total dose of morphine to achieve a satisfactory postoperative visual analog score (VAS) in all group.
Outcome measures: Mean total dose of postoperative morphine to achieve a satisfactory postoperative visual analog score (VAS) in all group.
Statistical analysis was used: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) post hoc testing (Bonferroni).
Confidence interval was set at 95% (95% CI).
P value was set at <0.05.
Discussion
Results: There was a statistically significant difference among all groups in terms of total dose of postoperative morphine to achieve a satisfactory postoperative visual analog score (p=0.001) * when compared to group1 for both ESPB and TPVB.
There was no statistically significant difference between (ESPB vs TPVB) p= 0.876, and (ESPB vs QLB) p= 0.736, (TPVB vs QLB) p= 0.001.
Conclusion

My note
So here you have what was typed up by one of my classmates for one of his assignments. It was given to him as an example and it was also supposed to be a simple summary only and did not need to be edited or proofread. It should only be a summary. The actual assignment in its entirety should be submitted, not a summary of it, in case you wanted to look at that. Please contact your professor if you want anything else. Otherwise enjoy :)"

641,"[/INST] This is a prospective cohort study investigating the change of gastric volumes in pre- and postoperative periods due to adenotonsillectomy in right lateral decubitus position in pediatric patients. Gastric volumes are going to be calculated with ultrasound. 
Patients: [Dx?] Patients undergoing elective adenotonsillectomy.
Interventions: [Dx?] None. Experimental group: gastric assessment of gastric volume with ultrasound. 
Outcomes: [Dx?] The primary outcome is going to be the gastric volume (ml/kg) in pre- and postoperative periods. The cross sectional area (preoperative), and the presence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting are also going to be measured. Secondary outcomes are the gastric volumes, and others are going to be measured with ultrasound. 
Rationale: [Dx?] Gastric volumes may increase after tonsillectomy, this might result in pulmonary aspiration. This study aims to investigate this by measuring the gastric volumes with ultrasound."

Our study aims to determine the speech and swallowing problems in patients after cleft palate surgery and the relation of MRI findings to speech and swallowing difficulties. Our study involves performing a pre- and post-operative clinical examination, MRI of the soft palate, tonsillar and pharyngeal areas and speech and swallowing therapy of 16 months duration (60 sessions). The speech therapist will be part of the treatment team, the same speech therapist will be working with all the patients for consistency. The therapy protocol will be based on Miller techniques and neuromuscular electrical stimulation. The patient who completes the protocol successfully will be asked to undergo a MRI, post-operatively, to be compared with the pre-operative one.

713,"[/INST]  The objective of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of Remote Ischemic conditioning in slowing disability progression in Primary Progressive MS; an effect which has been shown with ischemic preconditioning in other neurological and vascular conditions. This is a phase II open-label, single-center, single-arm futility trial. 
Safety
The study will follow the Simon-2-stage MiniMax design for futility studies.  An interim analysis will be conducted after the completion of 15 patients enrolling at which point it will be determined whether it is in the best interest of the study patients to continue to 30, or to stop accrual early at 15. 
Sample Size/Statistical Analysis
The sample size for this study is calculated to be 15 patients to have 80% power to detect a difference of 20% in the T25FW at 6 months using an alpha of 0.05. This sample size calculation is based on the assumptions that the pooled SD for T25FW for PPMS patients is 920 ms, a dropout rate of 20%, and a beta error rate of 0.20. This study plans to enroll 15 patients although, in consideration of potential dropouts, the calculated actual number of patients to be enrolled is 18.  
Time Frame
The Timed 25-foot walk (average of 2 trials) will be taken at 12 months.
Primary Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure in this study will be the worsening of disability, defined  as an increase by 20% or more in the timed 25-foot walk (average of two trials) at 12 months follow-up.  The Timed 25-foot walk (average of two trials) will be taken at 12 months follow-up.

This design provides the opportunity to use the medical records as the primary source, and the secondary source can be blood sample test if the medical records do not contain complete data. The sample size has not been defined; however, as this study is observational, the sample size requirements are lower as this is not an interventional study.


Procedure: ToF primary repair
This procedure is done to correct the shunt lesion in tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy with a large VSD. This is a standard heart surgery that involves opening and ligation of PDA and VSD, pulmonary and aortic valve reconstruction and root remodeling. There are no established guidelines to measure any possible prognostic predictors.

Redo surgery was defined as additional or corrective surgery after the initial primary ToF repair within the same hospital admission.
Mortality postoperative Intracoronary and postoperative peripheral blood transfusion Volume of blood loss and volume of crystalloid and blood product administered.

   pre-treatment prior to intra-uterine device placement.  Subjects will 
   apply the lidocaine or a saline placebo to the end of a standard tampon 
   with a plastic applicator and then place the tampon 1 hour prior to the 
   procedure. The tampon will be removed as the subject prepares for the 
   procedure. The procedure team will measure the procedure time as well as 
   the subject and provider impressions of the procedure. This data will be

758,"[/INST] The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of microscopic infiltration of macrophages by performing 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT in patients with suspected or confirmed cardiac sarcoidosis. This is the first proof of concept study using macrophage-specific PET/CT ligand in cardiac sarcoidosis patients.
The study has been powered to detect a 30% increase in the proportion of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis positive for macrophage infiltration on 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT for the primary outcome. The study has also been powered to detect a 25% relative increase in the incidence of severe adverse cardiac events in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis. Secondary objectives include verification of cardiac sarcoidosis, comparison of cardiac sarcoidosis to acute lymphocytic myocarditis, and evaluation of the proportion of patients with coronary artery involvement.
Macrophage PET/CT imaging will involve an intravenous injection of 64Cu-DOTATATE followed by PET/CT imaging. It is recommended that patients have no food and/or fluid restriction and no dietary restrictions or other restrictions (e.g. 64Cu-DOTATATE if the patient has had any 18F-FDG PET/CT scan."

A new approach to the role of sleep duration and timing in the risk of stroke
=================
Context, Background and Purpose:
Stroke is an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Although the factors that increase the risk for stroke such as smoking, alcohol, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and family history are well-known, the exact cause of stroke is unknown.  Short sleep duration and irregular sleep timing are associated with increased risk of stroke.  Short sleep duration is defined as sleeping less than 6 hours per day, while irregular sleep timing refers to getting up early or skipping sleep in the 24-hour period.

Method: This is a prospective study that followed 133,942 participants for almost 21 years. They were enrolled at 40 years old and without history of stroke, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. Participants were given questionnaires and their sleep duration and sleep timing was recorded. In order to keep data more objective, they were asked to wear sleeping watches to monitor their sleep duration. For the analysis, data from the last 24 hours were collected. Based on the reported 24-hour sleep, sleep duration was then calculated.
Observations: Results showed that those who slept less than 6 hours or had irregular sleep timing in the 24-hour period had an increased risk of stroke, even when adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, consumption of alcohol, and sleep hours at the beginning of the study. 
Conclusion: Based on the provided data, those who get too little sleep or with irregular sleep timing had a 50% increased chance of stroke. This was true even when just looking at the last 24-hour sleep. Although much more research needs to be done before there are clear guidelines about sleep timing, the authors urge that more attention should be paid to sleep duration and irregular sleep timing to decrease the risk of stroke."

799,"[/INST] Stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), is sudden brain dysfunction caused by disturbance in blood flow to the brain (yleminin.org).
Early symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, difficulty understanding speech, difficulty seeing, facial weakness or numbness, dizziness, difficulty swallowing, and severe headache (American Stroke Association).  About 80 percent of strokes occur in the anterior circulation: in the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and internal carotid artery.  When blood flow is blocked in this area, a person will experience a motor or sensory symptom on the opposite side of the lesion. The part of the body supplied by the blocked vessel begins to deteriorate. If blood flow is not restored, tissue death occurs in this area. This type of stroke is referred to as flaccid or indifferent.  
A few patients have reported transient sensorium immediately after an anterior circulation stroke. This is commonly known as hypoesthesia of the contralateral side (Mannucci). It is characterized by numbness, tingling, or strange sensations on the opposite side of the lesion. In most instances, this symptom resolve in the first few days or goes unnoticed. However, in one study (Biscani), 4.8% (45/944) of patients reported hypoesthesia for months after an anterior circulation ischemic stroke.
Anterior circulation strokes are known to produce a contralateral loss of proprioception and vibratory sense.  Proprioception refers to the awareness of parts of the body and surroundings location (Mayer). A stroke that involves the cerebrospinal tract causes loss of vibratory sense.  
In one study, 10-40% (8-24/212) of the patients experienced postural instability (Stability of Gait and Walking)."

Eligibility and exclusion criteria will be explained in the inclusion and exclusion criteria section.
The primary outcome is absence of complications during and after operation. All patients will be assessed using the EQ-5D-5L. The secondary outcomes include subjective and objective functional outcomes. Quality of life will be assessed using the EQ-5D-5L. Time to complete bone healing, costs, and cost effectiveness will also be assessed.
Study flow will be explained in the protocol section [CONSORT 2010 Statement].
All randomized patients will be included and will be followed-up for at least one year. Baseline characteristics will be described using appropriate statistics. Continuous variables will be described with mean and standard deviation or median and IQR as appropriate. Categorical variables will be described using frequencies and percentages. Missing data will be treated using appropriate imputation methods after consultation with an expert statistician. Comparisons between groups will be made with the use of the Chi-square or Student's t-test, as appropriate. Categorical variables will be compared using the Chi-square test, and continuous variables will be compared using the Student's t-test.
Data analysis will be completed at the end of the recruitment period. The main recruitment period will be for one year. A follow-up period of one year will be used to assess long-term effectiveness. A final follow-up period of one year will be used to assess complications and patient reported outcomes.
Sample size calculations will be performed using G*Power software. A two-group comparison will be made between patients receiving bone grafts and patients not receiving bone grafts using a 0.05 significance level and a power of 80%. A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare proportions, and Student-Newman-Keuls method for multiple comparisons. Continuous variables will be compared using the Student's t-test.
Study reports will be prepared for submission to local ethics committees, and publication to high-impact peer-reviewed journals."

821,"[/INST]  The effect of climate change on the health of humans and ecosystems has been and will continue to be devastating. Healthcare systems are very major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and by reducing these emissions, healthcare providers can play a major role in decreasing the severity of global warming. Within the field of respirology, choice of inhaler is a very low-hanging fruit to decrease the impact of a healthcare system on climate change. Metered dose inhalers contain potent greenhouse gases and have been shown to have a significantly larger carbon footprint than dry powder inhalers. This study will be looking to see if patients are willing to change their inhalers from a metered dose inhaler to a dry powder inhaler to decrease the climate impact of their healthcare and what factors influence their decision."

847,"[/INST] Heart Failure Prediction model
This is a study protocol to develop and validate a prediction model for heart failure from primary care in the UK. This is a national cohort study, the UK Primary Care Research Database (PCRD) and Action on Heart Failure Database (CPRD-AURUM).
This is an observational study that combines de identified primary care data (CPRD-GOLD), linked using unique identifying numbers to hospital admissions and secondary care case register data (CPRD-AURUM). The study involves data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD-GOLD). For the observational study of heart failure, data linkage (the UKAHF) will add a cohort of people with an index date of first entry to the UKCRD between 1 January 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2007.
The study period is a retrospective cohort study. The exposure variable for each study subject will be the date and time of each encounter. A person-level record will be defined as each encounter record per person. There will be a window of five years on either side of the index date i.e. up to 6 years either side of index date for any new heart failure cases identified in the national care records. For a subject with missing data on both index date and follow up dates a subject will be dropped from the study. We will follow subjects up until first hospitalisation or death or the last updated date before 31 December 2022
The data will be de-identified. All data will be anonymized so that no data from the linked files can be linked back to each other or to the individual patient. The data will be linked through a unique study identifier known as a Study identification code which is a combination of a date (year), a site code and a subject number."

879,"[/INST] Study Overview
The study is a randomized controlled trial comparing effects of Empowered Relief delivered by nurses who have been trained in Empowered Relief versus a Wait-List Control.

[/INST] Detailed Description
Design:  This study will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial comparing effects of Empowered Relief (ER) when delivered by ER trained nurses (n=170) with a Wait-List Control (WLC). The secondary aims of feasibility and acceptability will use qualitative descriptive methods. Participants: Participants (N=170) will be aged 18 years or older, have pain more than half the time, be able to attend a one-time web-based class and complete web-based surveys, and be able to speak and understand English. Exclusion criteria include previous participation in Empowered Relief, cognitive impairment, non-English speaking, or psychological factors that would preclude comprehension of material or full participation in the study as determined by the investigators. Procedures: Twenty Empowered Relief training will be provided to nurses who are members of the ASPMN. The nurses will be recruited through ASPMN related channels and trained via a one-two day live, webinar style instructor training facilitated by Stanford Pain Relief Innovations Lab. ASPMN nurses who are interested in trainer positions will be invited to apply to become a trainer. Trainer requirements include being an ASPMN member, ability to fluently complete instructor training and deliver the ER program in English, commitment to deliver 1-3 live, online, 2-hour ER programs for patient participants, and willingness to complete post-program surveys after each session they deliver reporting on number of participants and any barriers encountered. Randomization will occur after screening and eligibility of participants to ensure that those randomized to ER continue to receive usual care for 2 months while those randomized to WLC will receive ER after 2 months, at which time they will be offered the same ER class that the ER participants received at baseline. Measures: Changes in Catastrophizing will be measured using surveys assessed at baseline, then every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Self-report is used to measure catastrophizing. Pain intensity will be measured using a 0-10 Pain Scale and will be assessed at baseline, then every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Measures of feasibility and acceptability will be obtained both from the research team as well as patient participants using qualitative methods (interviews and surveys). Number of participants lost to follow-up will also be tracked throughout the study.

880,"[/INST] The overall aim of this study is to clarify the pain rating challenges and patterns experienced by health care providers and patients. Our secondary aim is to compare these challenges and patterns across groups. (This is an introductory paragraph that forms the overview of the whole study.)
Detailed Description: [/DD] This study explores the mental effort health care providers and patients experience when choosing and understanding numeric pain intensity ratings. It explores the ability to choose a pain intensity rating according to the Numerical Rating Scale, which is zero to ten, where zero indicates no pain and ten indicates worst pain imaginable. It also explores the certainty of the individual's numeric pain intensity rating choice, which is a rating from one to ten. Secondary aspects include the ability to reproduce the same numeric pain intensity rating choice from one measurement to another, and differences among ratings of the same intensity. To do so, a fictional pain scenario will be presented and numeric pain intensity ratings assigned. Confidence and accuracy in these ratings will be measured.
Additionally, the study explores the importance of decreasing mental effort in choosing and understanding numeric pain intensity ratings. This is to measure the extent to which mental effort should be avoided when choosing or understanding pain intensity ratings. It also measures the extent to which mental effort should be avoided when choosing and understanding pain intensity patterns.
To do so, numeric pain intensity ratings will be presented together with mental effort measures. Confidence in the accuracy of the intensity ratings will also be measured.
The study also explores pain intensity ratings in the presence of medication, which is very common. Numeric pain intensity ratings taken before and after medication will be compared.
Eligibility: All nurses currently employed as licensed nurses and all patients currently under health care for a painful musculoskeletal condition will be eligible for participation.

Study Rationale
-----------------
This project is motivated by the potential for this smart bracelet to have important positive effects for people with Parkinson's. As it stands, the technology is not widely used because the cost is an issue (the bracelets are of great benefit to the wearer, but since they are reusable, are not financially attractive to buy. The Heel2Toe bracelet has a limited lifetime, so the cost may be justified in the long run.) The rationale behind the stepped-wedge design is that the technology is difficult to train people on and so a group of participants should be trained and studied, and then once most of them have used the technology for 3 months, another group should be trained and studied. In fact, if the technology shows efficacy, it is the hope of Valida to eventually manufacture the bracelets here in our factory."

950,"[/INST] This is a multicenter clinical trial with a quasi-experimental design.   The first step consists of assessing the sleep quality in sequential patients admitted to the ICU and characterizing the disruptive elements. After this period, the second step will involve sensitizing and training the multidisciplinary team about the importance of sleep for critically ill patients and providing training for the implementation of a multifaceted protocol of interventions to promote sleep quality improvement. Once the multidisciplinary protocol is implemented, the sleep quality of the patients and the clinical impact of this protocol will be reevaluated."

971,"[/INST]Study Background and Aims The purpose of this study is to test the effect of an activity wristband-based intermittent teaching unit in Physical Education on students' physical activity habits and psychological determinants and health-related outcomes. Methods/Design A multicentric, randomized controlled, parallel, superiority-type, blinded, controlled study will be conducted in 180 low-achieving students (90 intermittent group and 90 control group), aged between 12 and 15 years, distributed in 9 classes per group (cluster randomization), of three second-grade compulsory schools. The intermittent group will carry out an intermittent teaching unit during school Physical Education classes for eight weeks. This intermittent unit is based on the use of activity wristbands (Actigraph GT3 AM), which allow class-by-class monitoring of the class activity. The control group will not receive any specific intervention. The main outcomes to be assessed are: a) change in students' physical activity habits assessed during after-school time using the Physician-based Assessment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE) questionnaire at an intra-individual level; b) changes in the autonomous and controlled motivations toward physical education and physical activities using the Revised PLOC-R questionnaire at an inter-individual level; c) changes in students' self-determined motivation toward physical Education using the Spanish version of the Revised PLOC-R and students' perceived autonomy in Physical Education lessons using the Spanish version of the Multi-Dimensional Perceived Autonomy Support in Physical Education (MD-PASS-PA) questionnaire; d) changes in students' perceived autonomy in Physical Education and physical activity using the Spanish version of the MD-PASS-PA scale, and the Spanish version of the PEPSSU in Physical Education and physical activity using the Spanish version of the MD-PASS-PA scale, e) changes in students' perceived autonomy in Physical Education and physical activity using the Spanish version of the MD-PASS-PA scale, and in Physical Education and of the dependent variable group's level related to the main outcomes on the main variable dependent variable dependent on the student outcome variable name of the name description of the main outcome.

[/PASEO] Intermediate: To relate serum amyloid A concentrations (at the time of diagnosis) to concentrations of biomarkers of granulomatous inflammation, interstitial lung disease and pulmonary function. [/PASEO]

 Study Population
=================
The study population consists of all patients newly diagnosed with intrathoracic sarcoidosis, fulfilling the European Respiratory Society/ World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous disease (ERS/WASOG) criteria.

Patients with nodular or fibrotic lung diseases as well as non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) are excluded.

[PASEO] For our entire intrathoracic sarcoidosis cohort, the following will be determined for serum amyloid A (SAA) at the time of diagnosis:

Serum SAA concentration, expressed in micrograms/millilitre (μg/ml).

Percentage of patients with SAA levels below the lower limit of the normal range.

The correlation of SAA concentration to the Scadding stage of the disease.
[/PASEO] Serum amyloid A concentrations at diagnosis will be determined separately in different categories of Scadding stage (0-4):

Serum SAA concentration, expressed in μg/ml.

Percentage of patients with SAA concentrations below the lower limit of the normal range.

The correlation of SAA concentration to the extent of HRCT findings, expressed in percentage of the pulmonary parenchyma involved (0%, 0-33%, 33-66%, 66-100%). [/PASEO]
[/PASEO] For each category of the Scadding stage, the following will be determined in intrathoracic sarcoidosis patients:

Serum SAA concentration. The cut-off point for the upper limit of the normal range will be set at the 75th percentile value for SAA concentration in a control group. [/PASEO] Correlation of SAA concentration and biomarkers of granulomatous inflammation: the following parameters will be determined:

Concentration of serum CCL18. The cut-off point for the upper limit of the normal range will be set at the 75th percentile value for CCL18 concentration in a control group.

Concentration of serum CXCL9. The cut-off point for the upper limit of the normal range will be set at the 75th percentile value for CXCL9 concentration in a control group). ANOVA

Rationale for Masking Scheme

| Groups not masked | Groups masked |
| All study staff | all assessment for treatment groups |
| All assessment and study staff | |
| Staff that will do the interventions | |

Timing of masking
| Unmasking commences when | Investigators are unmasked when the first results are expected to be sent or published to a public or private health authority, for example to an ethics committee. If possible, a date is established so that investigations are unmasked no later than when the date has passed.
| Interim unmasking | Investigators may unmask at their will, for example because of overwhelming indications.

987,"[/INST] The proposed observational, multi-centre study aims to compare EEG derived from the Dreem headband in individuals suspected of narcolepsy to the standard, ICSD-3 protocol in order to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the Dreem headband in diagnosing narcolepsy amongst young people. Participants will be assessed using the Dreem headband for one week, and undergo in-patient clinical testing at a second site to obtain a formal diagnosis of narcolepsy. This study will allow us to address whether EEG derived from an external, non-invasive device provides a useful and accurate diagnostic test for narcolepsy."
