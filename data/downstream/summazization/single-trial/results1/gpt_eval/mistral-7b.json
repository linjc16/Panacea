        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management.

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

        "summary": "In intensive care unit, dyspnea, the distressing and fearful awareness of breathing, is frequent and harmful. To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients.

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine",

Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",

During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",

The primary objective of the study is to characterize how the metabolic aMRI parameter k\u1d62\u2092*V differs in tumor versus normal brain, with secondary objectives including evaluating the utility of aMRI to differentially assess the metabolically active tumor periphery and necrotic core regions compared to \u00b9\u2078FDG PET's SUVmax. Post-gadolinium (Gd) T1 MRI will be used to distinguish the contrast-enhancing ring region indicating the metabolically active tumor periphery from the less viable and/or necrotic tumor core. The exploratory objective is to compare how the aMRI metabolic parameter k\u1d62\u2092*V within disease lesions change with different disease types, their disease stage, and their treatment status. Patients receive \u00b9\u2078FDG IV and gadoterate meglumine IV during the scanning period which takes 45-60 minutes and includes contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography. The study measures primary and secondary outcomes, including the mean values of k\u1d62\u2092*V of the entire tumor region and the mean value of k\u1d62\u2092*V in the tumor periphery and core regions. The study evaluates the efficacy of aMRI in metabolically distinguishing regions and evaluates its correlation with the co-registered \u00b9\u2078FDG PET data.

To do this, the tracheal cannula is first unblocked, so that patients no longer breathe in and out through the cannula, but (at least partially) passing the cannula by the natural route.

This constellation of symptoms suggests the suspicion of tracheal stenosis, so in the next step a tracheoscopy is performed to confirm or exclude tracheal stenosis. In case of symptomatic tracheal stenosis and at least 30-50% stenosis of the trachea (clinical symptoms can be expected from a 30-50% stenosis) then appropriate therapy (here: cryotherapy, other techniques only in exceptional cases) is planned.

Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO.

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores.

        "summary": "Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common genetic predisposition syndrome for colorectal cancer (CRC), responsible for around 2-4% of cancers. It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in this specific population. To this end, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing CAD EYE with CE in patients with LS.",

Boerl (Thymelaeaceae). Proliverenol possesses a hepatoprotective activity via anti-inflammation, DNA repairing, and the antiapoptosis properties. Pre-clinical study of Proliverenol showed that it exerted the hepatoprotective activity through increasing cell survival via: 1) up-regulation of DNA repair enzyme; 2) down-regulation of NF-kB, TNF\u03b1 and caspase-8 expressions, to prevent ALT leakage in HepG2 cells. Proliverenol repressed ALT expression, which could also be significantly important as possible alternative mechanism for increased blood transaminase activities.

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment. Thus, the role of pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for five days in volunteers undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (BVR) will be investigated in order to verify the vascular expression of SPhk1, transcriptome and vascular proteome remodeling, as well as S1P content in HDL.",

At present, there are 66 million patients with moderate to severe OSA in China, and the current diagnosis and treatment of OSA is mainly completed in the sleep center of the hospital, which is time-consuming and laborious, resulting in the delayed diagnosis and treatment of a large number of patients, making about 80% of potential OSA patients have not been diagnosed and treated in time. With the development of the Internet technologies, telemedicine has been increasingly applied to the diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic diseases with its advantages of convenience, interactivity, efficiency, sharing, coherence and breaking through the limitations of time and space. Our center has initially built a remote diagnosis and treatment management model for OSA. Compared with the traditional medical model, the medical and health economic analysis shows that the OSA diagnosis and treatment model based on telemedicine is more cost-effective, but its clinical efficacy needs to be further verified. Hypertension is a common complication in OSA patients, and continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) has a significant hypertensive effect in the treatment of OSA. However, whether clinical management based on remote diagnosis and treatment mode can achieve the same therapeutic effect as traditional face-to-face diagnosis and treatment mode in improving ambulate blood pressure in OSA patients needs to be further clarified. This study will compare the improvement of ambulatory blood pressure management in patients with hypertension under the new telemedicine mode and the traditional medical mode through a single-center randomized controlled trial, so as to optimize the diagnosis and treatment process of OSA patients with hypertension, establish a more convenient and efficient remote diagnosis and treatment mode with reliable clinical outcome, and provide a theoretical basis for subsequent multi-center research and promotion",

The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",

        "summary": "Despite progress in chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still the only curative procedure for some hematological malignancies. The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old. The co-transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) at the time of transplantation has previously shown a double interest in GvHD immunomodulation and hematopoiesis support. Pre-clinical studies (in mice) have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from Wharton's Jelly reduce the incidence of GvHD when the infusions are weekly repeated. We propose a phase I clinical trial to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a weekly infusion of WJ-MSC administered as GvHD prophylaxis and as a support for a faster hematological reconstitution after haplo-identical allo-SCT.",

The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment.

        "summary": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health threat in China. At present, a functional cure, also known as clinical cure or sustained Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, is recommended as the ideal endpoint of HBV treatment. However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection. In this study, a large multicenter prospective study will be performed to explore the safety and efficacy of a novel combination strategy involving immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 antibody) and IFN\u03b1 in CHB patients, observe the HBsAg loss rate in NA-treated CHB patients receiving this combination strategy, evaluate the potential of breaking immune tolerance by this strategy, and further assess its efficacy to further improve the clinical cure rate on the basis of New Switch Study. Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients.

Causes of poor sperm DNA integrity include unhealthy lifestyles such as smoking and exposure to gonadotoxins, as well as, obesity, varicoceles, infections, advanced paternal age and systemic disorders. An increase in DNA fragmentation in sperm has been linked to lower fertilisation rate, poorer quality embryos, lower pregnancy rate, and high miscarriages rate.\nThe best way for sperm selection and processing in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) should be noninvasive and cost-effective. It should also make it possible to identify high-quality spermatozoa and produce more favorable results in terms of pregnancy and live birth rates.7 Meanwhile, the microfluidic sperm separation technology is a less expensive and less invasive alternative.

The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period.

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators also hypothesize that the CBT-informed intervention will be more effective than the attitudinal inoculation intervention for increasing COVID-19 vaccination among participants with symptoms of anxiety or depression.",

        "summary": "Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by cardiac abnormalities compromising the ability of the heart to provide a blood supply adequate to the metabolic needs of peripheral tissues. ADHF is characterized by systemic and pulmonary fluid retention, with weight gain, peripheral edema, needing diuretic therapy. Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide. The researchers will perform a spontaneous, prospective, randomized trial aiming at investigating the effect of combined furosemide-induced diuresis and automated matched dehydration, compared with standard furosemide administration in ADHF patients with fluid overload.",

The study consists of two arms: no intervention (control group) and Furosemide infusion with matched dehydration using the RenalGuard device. \n\nThe primary outcome measure is daily serum creatinine measurement for assessment of acute kidney injury occurrence, while the secondary outcome measure is daily weight decrease during study treatment. \n\nThe study is designed as a randomized study with a parallel assignment model and an open label masking. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the no intervention (control group) or the experimental RenalGuard group. In the RenalGuard group, patients will receive an intravenous loading dose of 40 mg of furosemide and continuous infusion of furosemide based on baseline eGFR. An additional bolus of 40 mg of furosemide will be administered, and the infusion rate will be adjusted according to the same protocol as the control group. The venous peripheral cannula will be connected with the extracorporeal circuit of the RenalGuard System for fluid infusion.

Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent.

In India, the burden due to schizophrenia is further exacerbated by low access to effective psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting recovery, rehabilitation, and community tenure, as well as inadequate attention to managing co-occurring chronic medical conditions that result in significantly reduced life expectancy among those living with schizophrenia compared to the general population. A major driver of these alarming gaps in access to care for persons with schizophrenia in India is the limited capacity within primary care settings aimed at addressing the complex co-occurring mental health, physical health, and functional needs of this patient population. There now exists strong evidence demonstrating that community programs delivered in primary care and leveraging psychosocial interventions combined with linkage to specialty psychiatric services are effective for supporting treatment and recovery of schizophrenia in low-resource settings. We will leverage our existing collaboration and robust research infrastructure in both rural and urban settings in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, India to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate whether the use of a digital platform offers added clinical benefit and can support integration of this task shared care for schizophrenia into routine primary care settings.

        "summary": "Approximately 65, 000 hip fractures occur in the United Kingdom (UK) each year, and more than 99% are repaired by surgery. Roughly half of patients receive spinal anaesthesia, where a small amount (usually less than half a teaspoonful) of local anaesthetic is injected into the lower back, around the nerves that go to and from the hip.\nLow blood pressure is very common during surgery (at least > 30%, depending on definition), and appears to be linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery.\nThere are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. National guidelines recommend that lower doses are given, but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately or often enough.\nThe Anaesthesia Sprint Audit of Practice (ASAP) 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.5 mls of spinal anaesthesia is given, and the investigator has been using this amount in Brighton since 2011. Recently, the investigator has reported a way of transferring vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (e.g. in Coroner's investigations: approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery).\nHowever, analyzing such observational data should also allow the investigator to describe accurately how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (e.g. the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, the investigator hopes to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery, potentially improving people's survival and recovery after hip fracture.",

The etiology of recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) can be divided into mechanical obstructive factors (e.g. cholelithiasis, cholestasis), metabolic abnormality and toxic substance factors (e.g. hyperlipidemia and alcoholism), and other or idiopathic factors. At present, the diagnosis and treatment of RAP remains highly challenging. Early identification and intervention on risk factors of recurrence will be effective in reducing incidence and improving prognosis.\nContrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) can not only provide more imaging information and further assess the severity of acute pancreatitis, but also aid in the differentiation of other diseases associated with acute abdominal pain. In addition, radiomics based on raw radiographic data has become a research hotspot in recent years. The purpose of this study is to establish and validate a deep learning model based on high concentration iopromide-enhanced abdominal CT images which is designed to predict the recurrence of pancreatitis in patients with first episode of pancreatitis within the 1-year follow-up period.",

The model's sensitivity and specificity will be calculated, and a multivariate logistic regression model including both clinical features and radiomics features will be established. The primary endpoint is the sensitivity and specificity of the model to predict the recurrence within 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The study is designed as an observational study, with the routine enhanced pancreatic CT protocol at all selected sites similar or equivalent to that used in the PI site.

According to Park and Folkman's (1997) Meaning-Making Model, the process of meaning making functions as a coping mechanism. It helps individuals adapt challenging experiences into their lives, ultimately assisting in their psychological adjustment to stressful situations. Based on this theoretical model, principles from meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), literature reviews, interviews with breast cancer patients, and expert consultation, an 8-week online individual psychological intervention was developed. It was aimed at facilitating the finding of new meanings in the experience of breast cancer and promoting psychological well-being. It includes psycho-educational, cognitive, existential, and behavioral components explicitly focusing on the meaning-making process. This intervention is called the Meaning Centered Coping Program (MCCP).

        "summary": "Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism can have multiple causes; most patients suffer from primary autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma, or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease occur. Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",

        "summary": "After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma.",

Parents of these infants report lower self-efficacy and worse mental health when compared to parents of term infants. There is an urgent need to use effective ways to improve parental self-efficacy and associated parent psychosocial and infant health outcomes.

        "summary": "The proposed project seeks to achieve four objectives that will, collectively, evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP-1) -a model for a home visitation and case management program for parents who used substances during pregnancy. First, the proposed project aims to estimate the causal impact of PCAP-1 on preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. Second, the project will estimate PCAP-1's effectiveness in achieving other program goals: parent recovery, parent's connection with needed comprehensive community resources, and preventing future children from being exposed to drugs and alcohol prenatally. Third, the project intends to estimate any cost savings from the perspective of the state. Finally, causal evidence of program effectiveness across the prior three objectives would enable PCAP-1 to be rated according to strength of evidence on relevant federal registries (i.e., FFPSA and HOMEVEE). All four objectives will be pursued by leveraging an ongoing randomized control trial (RCT) of PCAP with substantial backing from public and private partners, including the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OK's Title IV-E agency). This quasi-experimental project will recruit 40 new participants to receive PCAP-1 services and will use data on participants from the existing trial for the control group. This extension of the original RCT is efficient and highly feasible, drawing upon and adapting an existing evaluation framework and protocol. This design will facilitate an unbiased estimation of one-year program effectiveness while also enabling a comparison of the differential effectiveness of PCAP-1 and the original three-year PCAP model as a secondary benefit. Moreover, given that the population PCAP serves are disproportionately poor and low-income and PCAP is designed to be culturally competent and relevant, PCAP-1 harbors the potential to address inequities in child welfare outcomes, substance use disorder treatment services, and child and family well- being by improving outcomes for these families. With a strong backing by state agencies and community partners, the evaluation of PCAP-1 will contribute to a knowledge gap in the field for in-home program models serving a highly vulnerable population with high rates of child welfare involvement and use of foster care.",

As medical research and technology have advanced more and more children in the PICU are surviving, however in turn incurring new and persistent impairments across physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains of health. This phenomenon is often referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments not only impact the patient but parents have also been found to have poor emotional health outcomes following discharge from the PICU.\nConsistently, parents/caregivers of children admitted to the PICU report their primary concerns to be 1) the overwhelming physical environment of the PICU, 2) uncertainty about the child's survivorship and outcomes, 3) relationships and communication with staff, and 4) feeling helpless. Additionally, research has shown that caregiver-perceived stress during the child's hospitalization positively predicts post-traumatic stress three months after discharge for parents/caregivers (Nelson et al., 2019), which may translate into higher risk and duration of post-traumatic stress in their children. Therefore, providing an in-hospital outlet such as a PICU Journal for patients and families to express their subjective experiences may help bridge the gap between perception and reality as a means of buffering against post-traumatic responses. Conceptually, a semi-structured journal intervention may integrate the therapeutic aspects of journaling while also providing pertinent information and serving as an advocacy and communication tool. Prior research has demonstrated the use of a PICU Journal is feasible for implementation and has been well-received by families of children in the PICU (Herrup et al., 2019).\nTherefore, the aims of this mixed-method study are to 1) examine the relationship between this journaling intervention and the perceived stress, care engagement, symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and the development of PICS in parents of children hospitalized in the PICU, and 2) examine the relationship between parent participation in this intervention and the development of PICS-p in children, and 3) assess the feasibility of this intervention from key stakeholders.",

Depending on the extent of the cleft palate, the degree of functional loss varies, but both eating, hearing, speech, bite and appearance can be affected.\nPatients treated for isolated or combined cleft palate may suffer from velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), which means difficulties in closing the passage between the oral and nasal cavities during speech. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is associated with hypernasality, audible nasal air leakage and weak articulation, which might lead to difficulties with communication and social stigmatization.\nThe most common form of speech-improving surgery is a posterior based velopharyngeal flap, creating a bridge between the palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall to more easily compensate for the abnormal airflow through the nose during speech. However, surgical management of VPI is challenging, with variable success rates reported in the literature. In a retrospectively based questionnaire study on patients who underwent surgical treatment of VPI, 30% experienced only a small speech improvement or no improvement at all. In addition, postoperative speech impairment have also been reported, as well as perioperative bleeding and postoperative sleep apnea. Thus, selecting the patients who benefit most from speech-improving surgery is therefore of great importance.\nThe aim with the current study is evaluation of speech function through patient- and parent-response outcome measurements following surgical treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency in children with isolated or combined cleft palate.",

        "summary": "Hysterectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide, with more than 400,000 hysterectomies performed annually in the United States. As a consequence, even uncommon complications can affect large numbers of patients. Among potentially life-threatening events, vaginal cuff dehiscence complicates 0.14-1.38% of procedures, and any vaginal cuff complications (dehiscence, hematoma, bleeding, infection) are estimated to affect 4.7-9.8% of patients. In this scenario, any preventive strategy can provide clinically relevant benefits. Regarding colporrhaphy, only the adoption of a laparoscopic approach instead of a vaginal approach is supported by high-quality evidence. Our group demonstrated that the laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff after total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces the incidence of vaginal cuff complications.\nAmong other potentially effective interventions, the use of barbed sutures was associated with a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence than the standard suture. In a recent meta-analysis, the use of barbed sutures has been associated with a pooled incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence of 0.4% versus 2% after a traditional vaginal suture. However, this evidence is limited because most pooled studies were retrospective, and only two were randomized controlled trials. Moreover, these two randomized controlled trials had a very small sample size and were not powered to detect clinically relevant differences. On that basis, despite the promising utility of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the choice of the type of suture is not evidence-based but still guided by personal opinions, as well as by the preference and habits of the operators.\nTherefore, this study aims to investigate whether the laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure with barbed suture determines a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence and complications than conventional sutures after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

Vision is an important and defining element of laparoscopy and significantly affects the outcome of an operation in regard to time, mistakes and precision. Several new imaging systems have become available for laparoscopic surgery, including three-dimensional (3D) high-definition (HD), and two-dimensional (2D) ultra-high-resolution (4K) monitors. In experimental and clinical settings, several studies have been published in recent years suggesting that 3D systems present a number of potential benefits for surgeons and patients compared to the conventional 2D systems. The 3D HD system significantly reduces operation time and blood loss, and additionally shortens hospital stay. However, the performance of 3D systems against the new, ultra-high-definition 4K systems is barely known and highly controversial. There is a paucity of studies comparing these two imaging systems in clinical settings.

Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing quick access to transactions, providing ease of use and sometimes as a status indicator, can pose a risk of addiction when used uncontrolled. Since young people are more intertwined with technology and use smartphones more, they are at greater risk of addiction and the problems that addiction can cause. Poor sleep quality is an important problem that can occur with smartphone addiction and negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Smartphone addiction and the problems it causes are an important public health problem that threatens the whole society, especially young people. In solving this problem, it is among the duties of nurses to teach individuals healthy lifestyle behaviors instead of problematic behaviors. A road map is needed to facilitate the behavior change process. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is widely used today to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which targets interventions appropriate to the individual's stage of change, is used as a guide that facilitates behavioral change. TTM is a model that contributes to change, accelerates it, and supports individuals considering change. In addition to TTM, another method that is more frequently used and contributes to change, especially in addicted individuals, is the motivational interviewing method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and aims to reveal the individual's internal motivation. It is thought that the university years, which are an important period in terms of developing and maintaining health-protective and preventive behaviors, will both increase students' health responsibility and protect them from health-threatening behaviors with the healthy lifestyle behaviors acquired during this period.

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide and second leading cause of cancer death. Most CRCs arise from a polyp, developing through two major precursor lesion pathways: the traditional adenoma-carcinoma pathway, and the serrated neoplasia pathway. This provides opportunities to prevent cancer by removing its precursor lesions. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of precancerous polyps with colonoscopy and detection of early-stage CRC, which has been demonstrated to reduce CRC incidence and mortality effectively, making CRC one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer.\nCurrent guidelines in China recommend starting CRC screening uniformly at age 50 in average-risk individuals. However, a one-fits-all approach to determining CRC screening starting age may be not conducive to personalized screening, especially in the developing countries with scarce health resources. The incidence of early-onset CRC (CRC diagnosed before the age of 50) has shown a continuous increasing trend worldwide, spurring the US Preventive Services Task Force to recommend initiating average-risk CRC screening at age 45 instead of 50. Furthermore, different populations may benefit from even earlier screening, and CRC incidence may differ on the basis of population characteristics and CRC risk factors. For individuals younger than 50 years old, earlier screening based on risk factors may address this concern.\nPrevious studies have recommended earlier starting age of CRC screening combined with risk factors such as but not limited to sex, age, family history, lifestyle and comorbidity. Some upper gastrointestinal diseases have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasms, which may be related to the destruction of gastric acid barrier function and long-term use of pump proton inhibitors. Compared with colonoscopy examination, individuals were more willing to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination for gastric cancer screening, especially among the younger, potentially utilizing the EGD to guide earlier colonoscopies for patients at increased risk.

        "summary": "Under normal conditions, pain arises as a consequence of the activation of nociceptive afferents (small fibers) by an external stimulus with sufficient intensity to potentially cause tissue damage. This peripheral activation is processed as perception of pain by the central nervous system. In order to reliably evaluate the state of the nociceptive system in both clinical and experimental settings, standardized tests are essential. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a set of tests used to measure the intensity of a stimulus that produces a specific sensory perception in a subject. For example, if we gradually apply pressure, the point where the sensation changes from pressure to pain is called the pressure pain threshold. This type of test can be performed with different types of stimuli, including hot and cold stimuli or mechanical stimuli. Although these tests have been shown as reliable in healthy volunteers and pain patients, they are subjective in their nature, since they are based on a conscious evaluation of tested subjects. Likewise, these measures show substantial variability due to differences in the application of the tests by individual examinators. In short, even though the method is quantitative, its methodological characteristics make it subjective and dependent on both the operator and the subject under study. Moreover, contrasting results have been recently found regarding the measurement variability when repeating the QST at intervals of days. Thus, it is essential to investigate and develop new QST alternatives to obtain objective markers that may potentially contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind chronic pain conditions.",

        "summary": "In a society with increased life expectancy, the economic, social and personal burden of dementia increases. Dementia is often caused by a combination of neurovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Impaired brain clearance is suggested to be closely related to dementia development, as waste products (e.g. amyloid beta) accumulate in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the most common neurovascular disease that even contributes to about 45% of dementia pathophysiology in patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMH) are the key brain MRI manifestation of cerebral SVD. There is evidence that the currently known and MRI-visible WMH are landmarks of an already progressed stage of the underlying pathology. The pathophysiology of WMH has been attributed to multiple underlying mechanisms, such as hypoperfusion, defective cerebrovascular reactivity and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, different anatomical locations and different types of WMH are related to different underlying pathological changes. Using ultra-high field 7T MR imaging techniques WMH lesions can be detected with a higher sensitivity and resolution than on 3T MRI. The hypothesis is that different pathological mechanisms of cerebral SVD lead to variations in WMH shape. Moreover, the brain clearance ('glymphatic') system of the brain appears to be tightly connected to dementia pathology. Thus, novel markers of glymphatic activity could aid to describe and understand the pathology.",

        "summary": "Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation is one of the most common genetic mutations associated with tumor development in various human cancers, including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Previous studies have shown that KRAS mutations are present in approximately 70% of pancreatic cancer patients, 35% of colorectal cancer patients, 20% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and 15% of cervical cancer patients. Patients with KRAS mutations generally have a shorter overall survival and increased resistance to treatment compared to wild-type tumors. KRAS mutations have been known for decades, but they have been considered undruggable as effective therapies targeting them were lacking.\nPreclinical studies focusing on colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have suggested that colorectal cancer cell lines exhibit a stronger response to EGFR signaling and activation of multiple RTKs (Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) than non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. As a result, they show poorer responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors, leading to the development of initial and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition. Based on this hypothesis, a phase 1-2 clinical trial, known as the KRYSTAL-1 study, was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The study demonstrated that the objective response rate was 19% with adagrasib monotherapy and 46% with the combination of adagrasib and cetuximab (an EGFR inhibitor), indicating that the addition of an EGFR inhibitor can overcome resistance. Building on this hypothesis, a phase 3 trial is currently underway for KRAS G12C inhibition plus EGFR blockade in metastatic colorectal cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04793958, NCT05198934).\nIn this study, the aim is to investigate the efficacy of sotorasib (KRAS G12C inhibitor) plus panitumumab (EGFR inhibitor) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C mutations, who have failed standard treatments.",

        "summary": "Gingival recessions (GR) are often associated with non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL), resulting, thus, in a combined defect. This mucogingival condition has a different treatment prognosis when compared with a GR without wearing surface associated and frequently requires a surgical-restorative approach to achieve better esthetics and functional results. A limited number of clinical studies assessed different multidisciplinary protocols for the management of single combined defects and there is evidence that the use of dental materials does not harm the periodontal tissues and does not influence the root coverage obtained by means of subepithelial connective tissue graft (CTG). Although the association between coronally advanced flap (CAF) and CTG provides more predictable and stable outcomes in the long term, its use is related to some drawbacks. Different biomaterials have been developed to overcome these limitations as a possible alternative to autogenous graft. However, despite its potential, there is a lack of studies evaluating its use in treating this type of condition. Thus, this study aims to assess from a clinical and esthetics point of view and patient-centered outcomes, the use of a new collagen matrix (Geistlich Fibro-Gide\u00ae) associated with CAF for the management of single combined defects. For such purpose, 50 patients with single RT1 gingival recessions associated with NCCL will be enrolled and randomly allocated to one of the following groups: control group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap for root coverage (PR+CAF) and test group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap associated with volume stable collagen matrix (PR+CAF+VCMX). The two groups will be compared regarding the clinical parameters, among which bleeding on probing (BOP), biofilm accumulation (IP), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession reduction (RecRed), and the percentage of combined defect coverage (%CDC). Patient-reported outcomes such as post-surgery pain and discomfort, time to recover, the decrease of dentin hypersensitive, and aesthetics will be gathered.

The morbidity is high, both digestive and neurological. ECUN can lead to complications at short-term (death, intestinal stenosis) and at long-term (neuro-cognitive disorders). The challenge of preserving the neurological development is a major issue. It involves control of inflammation. This inflammation causes neurological lesions and is responsible for a disorder of the long-term neurocognitive development.\nAt Robert-Debr\u00e9 and Trousseau, the management of newborns with ECUN is focused on the control of this inflammation. A laparoscopy is performed first. The carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflated into the abdomen during a laparoscopy is thought to have an anti-inflammatory effect according to several experimental and clinical studies. A preliminary retrospective study at Robert-Debr\u00e9 showed a decrease in postoperative inflammation (decrease in C reactive protein at Day2 and Day 7 post-op) as well as a decrease in morbimortality (decrease in the rate of stoma and reoperation) in children who had a laparoscopic first operation compared to those who had a laparotomy alone.

Living with acquired blindness not only lowers the quality of life of these individuals, but also strains society's limited resources for assistance, care and rehabilitation. However, to date, there is no effective treatment for man patients who are visually handicapped as a result of degeneration or damage to the inner layers of the retina, the optic nerve or the visual pathways. Therefore, there are compelling reasons to pursue the development of a cortical visual prosthesis capable of restoring some useful sight in these profoundly blind patients.\nHowever, the quality of current prosthetic vision is still rudimentary. A major outstanding challenge is translating electrode stimulation into a code that the brain can understand. Interactions between the device electronics and the retinal neurophysiology lead to distortions that can severely limit the quality of the generated visual experience. Rather than aiming to one day restore natural vision (which may remain elusive until the neural code of vision is fully understood), one might be better off thinking about how to create practical and useful artificial vision now.\nThe goal of this work is to address fundamental questions that will allow the development of a Smart Bionic Eye, a device that relies on AI-powered scene understanding to augment the visual scene (similar to the Microsoft HoloLens), tailored to specific real-world tasks that are known to diminish the quality of life of people who are blind (e.g., face recognition, outdoor navigation, reading, self-care).",

Activated during periods of stress and therefore during the illness, even the attachment system is mobilized and must be considered to allow more understanding of the illness experience. The attachment style can be seen here as an individual dimension that plays a role in the emotional regulation and resilience of patients. It is also particularly solicited during the remission phase, a complex and singular period of cancer disease that confronts patients with an ambivalence of hope and fear. The fear of recurrence is a concern that the cancer may return or progress in the same organ or in another part of the body. This is a determining factor in the occurrence of anxiety-depressive disorders. Finally, several studies have shown a strong association between depression/anxiety and Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) after treatment, especially during the remission phase.\nACEs leave physiological and epigenetic impact that can nowadays be easily evaluated, thus providing additional evidence between adversity, physiological and epigenetic vulnerability and the ability to adapt to life's challenges such as cancer. Life history changes are mediated by changes in cellular mechanisms affecting genome expression. It is currently widely demonstrated that ACEs increases epigenetic modifications.\nThe interest of this project is therefore to highlight the psychological consequences related to the occurrence of cancer in the developmental history (in terms of adversities) of patients who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, taking into account the patients' previous attachments, resilience, fear of recurrence and perceived fatigue in order to consider their interactions and their effects on their psychological health and ultimately on their quality of life.",

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a cancer of grave prognosis, with only about 10% of patients alive at 5 years after diagnosis. Primary surgical resection is feasible in about 10-15% of patients with an early-stage disease. Another 30-35% of patients have locally advanced disease with invasion into major vasculature but without detectable metastases. Surgery offers a chance of cure. The introduction of adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy has improved prognosis after surgery.\nIn the management of patients with PDAC, the role of neoadjuvant therapy is less certain. Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer can in theory control early systemic spread and improve rate of having no macroscopic or microscopic residual tumor (R0 resection). In the The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC-5) study, neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy did not increase rate of resection who had borderline-resectable disease but appears to improve overall survival (OS).\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may represent a new paradigm in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a 40 kDa membrane protein not expressed in normal cells, but highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells, such as mesothelioma, lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer. MSLN is expressed about 80% of PDAC.\nThere are several immunotherapies targeting MSLN for PDAC treatment, including antibody-based drugs (monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins), vaccines, and CAR-T cell therapy.\nThe safety of CAR-T cells targeting MSLN in the treatment of cancers has also been verified in several clinical trials on lung cancers (NCT01583686, NCT02414269, NCT01355965). Professor Li Peng's group at the Chinese Academy of Science designed third generation CAR-T cells targeting MSLN and validated their use in both human PDAC cell lines, animal models, and in 4 patients with advanced malignancies. In a 42-year-old man with metastatic PDAC, the MSLN targeted CAR-T treatment led to complete response follow several hepatic artery infusion and intravenous infusion. These early cases confirmed the safety of these MSLN targeted CAR-T cells.\nIn the current proposed feasibility study, the researcher hypothesise that Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided injection of MSLN targeted CAR-T cells into PDAC can induce a tumor response, improve rate of R0 resection and translate into better patient survival.",

As inheritance of early studies, a value of 50-60 mmHg has been historically accepted as the gold standard MAP. However, in the last decades, the CPB management has remarkably changed, thanks to the evolution of technology and the availability of new biomaterials. Therefore, as already highlighted by the latest European Guidelines, the current management of CPB can no longer refer to those pioneering studies. To date, only few single-centre studies have compared different strategies of MAP management during CPB, but with contradictory findings and without achieving a real consensus. Therefore, what should be the ideal strategy of MAP management during CPB is still on debate. This trial will be the first multicentre, randomized, controlled study to compare three different strategies of MAP management during the CPB.\nMethods: We described herein the methodology of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing three different approaches to MAP targeting during CPB in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery: the historically accepted standard MAP (50-60 mmHg), the high MAP (70-80 mmHg) and the patient-tailored MAP (comparable to the patient's preoperative MAP). It is the aim of the study to find the most suitable management in order to obtain the most adequate perfusion of end-organs during cardiac surgery. For this purpose, the primary endpoint will be the peak of serum lactate (Lmax) released during CPB, as index of tissue hypoxia.

        "summary": "Alcohol use is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions (see ICD-10) and in France, alcohol is the first cause of hospitalization. Binge drinking (BD) has emerged as a major public health issue among student populations and is associated with negative consequences and social, cognitive and brain alterations. More than half of French university students have reported BD in the past month and are at increased risk of several alcohol-related consequences such as memory and sleep impairments, and reduced quality of life. BD is also a major risk factor in the development of alcohol addiction, with individual and environmental factors playing a role that is still poorly understood. Moreover, most students and young adults are reluctant to seek interventions when it is provided by health care professionals (only 4-5%) and have poor insight with regard to their alcohol use patterns / habits. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing effective prevention and intervention programs to reduce alcohol drinking in students. Recent studies have demonstrated that new types of technology-delivered interventions are promising tools for addressing unhealthy alcohol use. For example, an uncontrolled trial pilot study using a smartphone application-delivered intervention produced a reduction in both number of drinks per week and BD from baseline to 3-month follow-up. A recent review also showed significant outcomes of a mobile health intervention for self-control of unhealthy alcohol use. The investigators hypothesize that a timeline follow-back and personalized feedback based on the use of a mobile application can reduce excessive alcohol intake at 3-months. This study will provide scientific knowledge about BD in students, but also regarding a new type of intervention that could be effective for prevention in non-treatment seeking individuals and reducing the severity of health problems associated with excessive alcohol intake.",

Surgery for early stage rectal cancer can be either a radical surgery (RS) or a local excision (LE).\nA radical surgery removes the rectum including the tumor and the lymph nodes through which it spreads, improving survival but with a possible impact in the patients quality of life (QoL). A local excision only removes the tumor and a safety margin of healthy rectum. This has the potential to avoid the possible complications and QoL decrease.

Some epidemiological studies report that infants experience an average of 7.5-14 painful procedures per day per infant during the first 14 days of their hospitalization.\nThe most significant problem encountered in understanding pain in infants is the lack of verbal expression of pain. Newborns express their pain with nonverbal behavioral expressions. Therefore, any pain assessment is based on the ability to recognize the pain symptoms of others. The pain experienced may cause physiological imbalances and abnormalities in brain development and stress response in infants in the short and long term. It can negatively affect family-infant communication, as well as cause emotional and psychosomatic problems later in life.\nToday, music therapy has positive effects on reducing stress, reducing pain, oxygen saturation level, and peak heart rate values in providing individualized developmental care of the infant in neonatal intensive care units. Heart sound, babies hear the mother's heart sound the most during the intrauterine period in the womb. Therefore, when babies hear the sound, they are familiar with in the womb, they will feel safe and a sense of relaxation will occur in the baby. Several studies have proven that playing heartbeat sounds to newborn babies can positively affect their physiological indicators, feeding, length of hospital stay and pain outcomes. The current literature shows that the presence of rhythmic sound can positively affect the neurobehavioral development of the infant and reduce pain. Rhythmic sounds have healing/positive effects on newborns; listening to white noise reduces preterms' pain scores, stabilizes vital signs, and plays an active role in preterms' sleep-wake period.\nIn line with all this information, this study was carried out as a randomized controlled experimental study in order to determine the effects of music played during heel spear application, white noise and heart sound in infants.",

Intrauterine retention of trophoblastic debris is not an uncommon phenomenon. These retentions may initially be asymptomatic but are often responsible for persistent metrorrhagia and endometritis.

        "summary": "Insomnia is a highly common, chronic disorder that is distressful for the patient but also for caregivers and can give rise to a heavy burden on the healthcare team. Sleeping aids like benzodiazepines and other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) have been widely used to help treat insomnia. However, sleeping aids are also known to cause adverse drug reactions such as drowsiness and dizziness, that increases the risk of falls, driving impairment, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and upon discontinuation may cause paradoxical rebound insomnia, delirium, and nightmares all of which exacerbate the initial insomnia. All of the negative aspects of sleeping aid use are exaggerated for older, frail adults.\nSome patients experience an early (young-age) onset dementia with a substantial component of insomnia. Due to the many risks associated with traditional sleeping aids they are often inappropriate in adults living with cognitive impairment and/or frailty. Lemborexant comes from a new class of medications for insomnia. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their receptors orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX2R), which is thought to suppress wake drive. Unlike other traditional sleeping aids, lemborexant has not shown to be significantly associated with driving impairment, rebound insomnia, or dependence/withdrawal symptoms. Also, in clinical trials it only rarely causes the types of adverse events associated with benzodiazepines and other traditional sedatives and is less often associated with discontinuations due to adverse events.\nWhile lemborexant is available on the Canadian market it is unclear how this medication will be tolerated by patients living with an early onset dementia.

Post-operative delirium is a devastating complication, leading to longer ICU and hospital stay, increased incidence of discharge to nursing facility and poorer long-term cognitive outcome.\nDespite the impact this complication has on individuals, their families and healthcare resources, little is known about the causes and potential preventative measures.\nIt is thought that systemic inflammation compromising the integrity of the blood brain barrier is an important contributing factor. Recent data suggests that antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid (TXA) might be able to lessen the inflammation of the nervous system caused by surgery and CPB through the inhibition of plasmin production, thereby stabilising the blood brain barrier. Worldwide, the use of TXA has become standard of care in cardiac surgery and other types of surgery with a high risk of bleeding. It has been shown to reduce bleeding by 25% and significantly reduce the rate of transfusion in cardiac and noncardiac surgery.\nAt Royal Papworth hospital it is routine practice to administer 2g of TXA before commencing CPB irrespective of patients' body weight. We are hypothesising that there is a weight-based effect of TXA on neurological outcomes after cardiac surgery, showing a signal that a higher dose per kg bodyweight will lead to less delirium measured with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score (RASS). We intend to analyse 4 years' worth of patient data (05/2018 - 08/2022)\u037e the necessary information is routinely collected on using the hospital anaesthetic and ICU record.",

The study measures the Richmond Agitation Sedation Score up to 48 hours after surgery as the primary outcome, and 30-day mortality as a secondary outcome. The summary explains that the statistical methods and interdependence of primary and secondary outcome measures are yet to be determined, and that it might not be possible to design a prospective randomized controlled trial similar to the TRIGS-D study in cardiac surgery.

        "summary": "Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction Surgery (NOSES), which involves obtaining specimens from the abdominal cavity without any incisions, has attracted much attention in recent years, and it has been widely popularized in the treatment of rectal cancer because of its postoperative non-incision, advantages of less trauma, quicker recovery, and postoperative aesthetics. Anastomotic fistula is a serious complication of rectal cancer surgery. For patients at high risk of anastomotic fistula, prophylactic ileostomy is often performed intraoperatively to divert feces and protect the anastomosis. For such patients, rectal anterior resection surgery with specimen extraction via stoma (NOSES with specimen extraction via stoma) is usually performed, borrowing a prophylactic stoma incision to retrieve the specimen, and also realizing the absence of additional abdominal incision. However, this procedure is prone to stoma infection and has a high complication rate (20-40%), which limits the popularization of NOSES surgery and is an urgent clinical problem. Our center has proposed a new stoma closure method (Dumpling Suture Method), which reduces the size of the incision by folding the suture to achieve the effect of hiding the skin incision and reduce stoma infection. In our previous study, 17 cases of the new procedure were completed in our center, and 25 patients with stoma closure by the traditional method were included in the same period for control purposes. After six months of follow-up, we found that the dumpling suture method significantly reduced the incidence of stoma complications compared with the traditional suture method (5.8% vs. 36%), and no additional adverse effects were observed. This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical study planned to recruit 66 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the trial and control groups. The primary endpoint is stoma complication rate at 30 days postoperatively. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dumpling suture method  compared with the traditional stoma suture in reducing postoperative stoma complications through a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial, which is of great significance for the improvement of the rectal NOSES procedure and the reduction of the incidence of stoma complications.",

A recent meta-analysis found that, on average, 31% of patients with PD-MCI converted to PDD within seven years; however, 24% of patients with PD-MCI reverted back to normal cognitive function. Consequently, the false positive rate for predicting PDD among patients with PD-MCI is high, and better predictive markers to define patients at high risk for PDD development are urgently needed. Therefore, a combination of different markers, including clinical, genetic, and other biomarker data, are proposed to increase ability to predict cognitive worsening and dementia. Based on data of the first follow-up of this cohort results indicated that presence of both mild cognitive instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairment and PD-MCI dramatically increases the risk for PDD (PubMed ID: 36240089).

        "summary": "Specific language and learning disorders (SLLD) affect around 5-10% of school-aged children, or 1-2 child(ren) per class. SLLDs correspond to the impairment of a specific cognitive function and are divided into 5 categories: dyslexia, dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (DSM-5). In recent years, real progress has been made in their clinical diagnosis and management, thanks to a better description of these disorders in the DSM-5 and the advent of rehabilitative treatments (neuropsychology, speech therapy, occupational therapy, orthoptics, etc.). SLLD can occur in a sporadic or familial context (sibling involvement, a symptomatic parent, other relatives who may mimic dominant inheritance with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance).\nIt has long been suspected that SLLD is secondary to multifactorial inheritance, with a combination of frequent genetic variations and environmental factors. In France, in the absence of an obvious syndromic diagnosis, the current strategy is to prescribe array CGH, combined in girls with a search for fragile X syndrome (in boys, this syndrome leads to systematic intellectual disability, which does not justify its study in SLLD). A few genes have been described as being specifically involved in a small proportion of SLLD, most often with de novo variations or inherited from a symptomatic parent. There are no distinctive clinical features to guide targeted sequencing of these genes. Moreover, our recent experience shows that genes implicated in intellectual disability may also be involved in SLLD. Very few studies have been published in the literature evaluating the value of exome sequencing in SLLD. Only two studies have been identified, involving 10 and 43 patients with specific SLLD.\nIn view of the roll-out of the French Genomic Medicine Plan (PFMG 2025), it is important to set up a study aimed at assessing the value of genome-wide sequencing in the etiological work-up for SLLD.\nParticipation in the study consists of:\nan inclusion visit, where an additional blood sample will be taken during the baseline work-up\na results visit (4 months after the inclusion visit)\nOptional qualitative study: semi-structured interview 1 year after the inclusion visit proposed to 20 patients or families with a positive result and to 10 patients with a negative result.",

There is an increase in the incidence and severity of ROP development in direct proportion to the decrease in birth week and birth weight. While ROP is a problem below 32 weeks of gestation in developed countries, it is reported to develop severely up to 34 weeks of gestation in developing countries. In a multicenter study conducted by the Turkish Neonatology Society in our country, the frequency of ROP in very low birth weight preterm infants was found to be 42%, and the frequency of advanced ROP was 11%. The incidence of ROP in babies with a gestational age of 33-35 weeks was 6.1%, and advanced ROP was 6 per thousand. The frequency of ROP was found to be 10.3% in babies with a birth weight of 1500-2000 grams, and severe ROP was reported in 19 of these babies. ROP examination is a procedure that causes pain, deterioration in comfort and physiological changes in preterm newborns. After this examination, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and a decrease in oxygen saturation are observed. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (non-pharmacological) methods are used to reduce the pain and increase the comfort level of the premature newborn. As a pharmacological method, there is no other routine method used to reduce pain other than the administration of local anesthetic drops before the examination.

Long COVID can affects any type of patient and has polymorphic and fluctuating symptoms over time.\nThe Reunion Island is a French overseas department located in the Indian Ocean accounting more than 860,000 inhabitants. It has recorded since March 11, 2020, nearly 491,825 cases of COVID-19 and 961 deaths of hospitalized patients. Reunion's population is multi-ethnic and younger than the metropolitan France's one. It also has a higher prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, two serious form factors of COVID-19. This specific context makes this island a particular study site for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Long COVID.\nIn addition, some studies have confirmed the involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the symptomatology of Long COVID and demonstrated that patients with a Long COVID present a dysfunction of their ANS which is objectified by a reduced Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The regulation of heart rate by the ANS is strongly favored by respiration. A regular slow and deep breathing training helps to adjust the baroreflex, which connect heart rate, breathing and blood pressure. The result of this training is an induced state called cardiac coherence (CC).\nThe investigator therefore hypothesize that respiratory training to CC could re-educate the ANS and durably improve the symptomatology of patients with Long COVID.",

Ibrutinib has also been found to be effective in mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia and marginal zone lymphoma. However, ibrutinib treatment is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), with an estimated 2-year AF rate of 16% in patients treated with ibrutinib during a median follow-up of 28 months. In most studies, AF was identified by reports as a treatment-related adverse event, and systematic screening for AF was not performed. As AF is often paroxysmal, the more intensive the screening, the higher the incidence. In a prospective cohort study of 53 patients treated with ibrutinib for CLL, patients were monitored by pulse palpation and ECG every 3 months. The cumulative incidence rate of ibrutinib-associated AF was 23% at 12 months and 38% at 2 years. The management of ibrutinib-associated AF is challenging due to difficulties in balancing the benefits of anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of stroke and the bleeding risk associated with ibrutinib. AF is a frequent reason for discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy, and can result in significant morbidity.\nIn addition to this arrhythmogenic effect, ibrutinib is also significantly associated with the onset or worsening of arterial hypertension. Finally, an increased risk of serious ventricular rhythm disorders has also been suggested by pharmacovigilance databases, but not yet confirmed by prospective clinical studies.\nThe study proposes a comprehensive cardiovascular approach, at baseline and during follow-up of patients on Ibrutinib, using innovative markers to anticipate patients most at risk of developing these cardiovascular effects, but also to detect them as early as possible in order to avoid the complications they may generate.",

        "summary": "The project aims at implementing a more pro-active surveillance of potential transmission of influenza viruses to humans (zoonotic transmission). Clinical surveillance of influenza in humans and avian species is well organized and has been operating for decades, but currently there is no pro-active systematic surveillance of potential transmission of animal (avian or swine) influenza viruses to humans, only follow-up of people showing clinical symptoms. People working with potentially infected animals have the highest risk. Moreover, they can represent the first steps in a pandemic: if the virus adapts to humans, infected workers could potentially spread the virus to other people.\nCurrently, highly pathogenic clade2.3.4.4b H5 avian influenza viruses are continuously circulating in wild birds in Belgium and the number of introduction in poultry farms has raised, increasing the contact opportunities with high viral concentrations. Several reports of suspected human infection have been made by different countries. In addition, the virus was detected in sick non-human mammals. The large circulation in wild birds thus represents an increase risk of spill-over to mammalian species, including humans, (by contact directly with wild birds, or via outbreaks in poultry). This increased opportunity for accidental spillover to new host species increases the chances for the avian virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.\nLikewise, there have also been an increased number of human cases of swine influenza reported by several European countries. A pro-active surveillance aiming at also detecting asymptomatic infections would allow an early detection of transmission that could help to prevent a new pandemic.\nAs a piloting approach during this specific project, some dedicated sentinel networks among at-risk workers will be initiated: people in poultry farms involved with the management of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza; people working at bird (or more generally wild life) rehabilitation centres or poultry farms; veterinarians working in pig farms/slaughterhouses.",

The first group, Avian Influenza Outbreak Farms, includes people involved in outbreak management and asks participants to perform nasopharyngeal swabbing every 2 days during 2 weeks after outbreak detection.

        "summary": "Pes planus is a foot deformity characterized by a low medial longitudinal arch. It is more common in young adults. With low arch, tension occurs in the plantar fascia. Fascia and soft tissue loading may lead to different musculoskeletal problems such as plantar fasciitis, medial tibial stress syndrome, patellofemoral disorders and back pain. In addition, pes planus can affect individuals' activities of daily living, productivity in occupational settings, and injury risk and performance in sports.\nTreatment of pes planus includes strengthening, stretching, taping and orthotics for the foot muscles. Among these applications, strengthening of the foot core muscles is one of the most common and effective methods. By strengthening the foot core muscles, it is aimed to reduce the effect of the kinetic chain. Pes planus is a postural deformity that affects the kinetic and fascial chain, but the treatment program is usually planned regionally. With fascial continuity and fascial conduction, the tension on the plantar fascia in pes planus affects the gastro-soleus, peroneus longus and brevis, hamstring muscles, iliotibial band and thoracolumbar fascia. Stretching of the plantar fascia, which is included in current treatment programs, has only a local effect and thus cannot prevent fascial chain involvement. Myofascial release, one of the methods used to reduce the tension in the fascia, has been used frequently in recent years. Myofascial release is performed with methods such as manual, foam roller and instrument assisted release. Foam roller (cylinder foam) is a practical myofascial release method that can be self-applied by the individual.\nIn addition to strengthening the intrinsic muscles of the foot in individuals with pes planus, it has been reported that fascial chain involvement should also be taken into consideration due to the tension in the plantar fascia with low arch.

Duodenoscopes used for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), in order to treat different biliary and pancreatic disorders, have been recently linked to infections transmission following the procedures. Given their reusability and their complex design of the tip with a moving metallic component, named the elevator, these instruments must be reprocessed through high level disinfection (HLD) in order to prevent the spread of nosocomial infections. Even strict adherence to all HLD procedures results in a residual level of potentially infectious microbes. In fact, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) postmarket surveillance communication reported duodenoscope culture results demonstrating contamination rates of up to 3.6% for low and moderate-concern organisms and up to 5.4% for high-concern organisms in reprocessed conventional duodenoscopes. As a consequence, at least 20 outbreaks of duodenoscope-transmitted multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) infections occurred between 2012 and 2015, despite reported compliance with duodenoscope reprocessing guidelines. The increasing concern that currents practices of reprocessing reusable duodenoscopes is insufficient, has led the FDA to released recommendation suggesting to develope a newly designed duodenoscopes. On one hand, a way is to generate duodenoscope with disposable components, such as a one-use end cap, which can be removed and allow access to the components of the elevator and other areas of the duodenoscope for reprocessing.

Due to the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, PD patients experience difficulties with motor learning and more specifically with the consolidation of motor memory. Recent work showed that intensive writing training improved writing skills in PD. Although consolidation effects were present, difficulties with retention were also still apparent. Besides impacting writing, manual dexterity deficits in PD can also affect the use of touchscreens. Researchers from our lab demonstrated that impairments were most pronounced in multi-direction sliding motions, indicating the need for training of these motor skills. Our lab demonstrated the classic difficulties with retention in PD after one session of training of a swipe and slide pattern on a tablet (SSP-task) as single task (ST), although immediate gains were demonstrated. Therefore, in this study the investigators will examine whether a two-week home-based training program of a tablet-based SSP-training program will lead to immediate and consolidated improvements that are retained in time. This program will combine ST and dual task (DT) training to provide variation during the training period, but also to increase the cognitive challenge during learning, thereby stimulation consolidation of learning.

In this context, joint fluid aspiration (JFA) is indicated to document a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) or to bring to light arguments for implant failure. Nevertheless, opinions differ on its indication for microbiological identification. Some teams perform it systematically when faced with a prosthesis dysfunction. Others, only in the presence of suggestive signs of PJI. Finally, others never perform it.\nBased on clinical, radiological and biological (CRP) signs, at the preoperative stage and before JFA, we classify our patients into 3 groups: supposedly septic (chronic joint infection), supposedly aseptic (implant failure) or intermediate (Unknown). This last group, often encountered in consultation, poses a diagnosis problem more than the others.\nIn our experience, JFA is an essential diagnosis tool in these 3 groups of patients. It helps to choose the surgical strategy. In addition, the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid as the alpha defensin, the leucocyte esterase and the CRP could provide an additional argument to investigate the infectious origin or not, in particular in difficult cases.\nIn summary, the disagreement on the usefulness of JFA in case of PJI suspicion and any other prosthetic dysfunction, the lack of data on large prospective studies and our questioning about the contribution of JFA in the aseptic and intermediate group of patients, motivated us to set up this study to evaluate the interest of the JFA for the preoperative diagnosis, as well as that of the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid.",

It is the main cause of morbidity and disability in the world with, among other things, an increase in cardio-metabolic risk and a reduction in life expectancy, regardless of suicide risk. MDD is the most expensive medical condition: 10-20 billion \u20ac/year in France. This cost is mainly attributable to the functional consequences of the disease, highlighting the medico-economic challenge represented by the optimization of the organization of care.\nIn France, more than 80% of MDD patients are enrolled in non-psychiatric care pathways, mainly primary care or MSO hospital care (medicine, surgery, obstetrics). Unfortunately, less than half of patients benefit from treatment at an appropriate dosage or duration, thus exposing them to the risks of relapse, recurrence and chronic evolution. It is necessary to optimize this management, in particular by improving secondary prevention, which consists of maintaining treatment in the months following symptomatic remission.\nSeveral support programs (monitoring with assessment of symptomatology) have shown their effectiveness on depressive symptomatology with a favorable medico-economic report, in particular by allowing maintenance of antidepressant treatment. None of these studies have been conducted on French care pathways.\nInvestigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine management (added to usual care) in non-psychiatric care pathways on the evolution of depressive symptomatology for MDD patients.

        "summary": "Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols were developed to standardize perioperative practice in colon surgery to reduce morbidity, improve recovery, and shorten length of stay (LOS). Better protocol adherence translates into fewer readmissions and complications, and better 5-year survival. Preoperative elements, especially nutrition and immunonutrition, are topics that need further development to become the standard of care. It has been widely reported that the prevalence of malnutrition reaches 40% in cancer patients at the time of diagnosis. Impaired nutritional status at the time of surgery and cancer-induced inflammation, along with postoperative inflammatory responses to major surgery, increase the risk of postoperative complications, along with a decrease in perceived quality of life.\nImmunonutrition can modulate inflammation and reduce postoperative infections and shorten length of stay by counteracting the immune response induced by cancer. Adipose tissue has been shown to be a relevant source of inflammatory mediators, which may play a role in the promotion of tumor cachexia.\nThe present study is a multicenter randomized control study (RCT) designed to evaluate the effect of preoperative immunonutrition in patients with colorectal cancer eligible for elective minimally invasive procedures, evaluating in particular surgical site infection and length of hospital stay.

Several barriers for successful implementation of CDSS have been identified: over-alerting, lack of specificity of rules, and physician interruption during prescription. The effectiveness of CDSS could be increased in two ways. Firstly, by creating rules that are more specific to a given adverse drug reaction: the current study focuses on acute renal failure and hyperkalemia (two serious and frequent ADR in older hospitalized patients). Secondly, by involving the pharmacist in the review of the alerts so that he/she can transmit, if deemed necessary, a pharmaceutical recommendation to the clinician.

        "summary": "Mesenteric fat can be invaded by gut bacteria through a process called bacterial translocation, which is the invasion of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to extraintestinal sites (mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney, bloodstream, etc.). In Crohn's disease (CD), bacterial translocation could increase the disproportionate inflammatory response already present and contribute to disease progression by stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune-cell infiltration in the mesentery. Several mechanisms may promote bacterial translocation, such as bacterial overgrowth, disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier and alterations in the immune system.\nIleocecal surgical resection is required in some patients with complicated or refractory CD. Unfortunately, post-surgical disease recurrence happens in up to 40% of cases, probably defining a subgroup of CD patients with a particular aggressive form of the disease. The complete microbiome (in gastrointestinal and extraintestinal sites) in CD patients that develop early post-surgical recurrence, as well as the association to innate immunity alterations, has not yet been studied.\nThe primary aim of the study is to explore the bacterial microbiome of CD patients and its association with early post-surgical recurrence and clinical or genetic variables related to innate immunity. To achieve this, the bacterial DNA present in mesenteric fat and ileal tissue (inflamed and non-inflamed) from surgical resection samples as well as blood samples from CD patients will be studied. Genetic polymorphisms, relevant clinical data and disease recurrence will also be evaluated.\nThe investigators hypothesize that bacterial translocation to the mesentery fat near the inflamed intestine is one of the mechanisms for perpetuation and chronicity of inflammation and therefore post-surgical recurrence in CD. The investigators expect to find a distinctive bacterial profile (in quantity and quality) in the mesenteric fat of patients with early post-surgical recurrence and/or with genetic variants that cause alterations in innate immunity.\nThe study of the microbiome in CD could help to identify the patients with a more aggressive disease form that will probably present early post-surgical recurrence, and could raise the possibility of microbial modulation as therapy for CD.",

Melanomas at high risk of metastasis can be identified by gene expression profiling. The investigators aim to treat these high risk melanomas to prevent future metastasis. Statin drugs, like atorvastatin, have been used to treat high cholesterol for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events, but not for preventing melanoma metastasis. Statins could prevent melanoma metastasis through decreasing tumor cell migration, decreasing tumor cell adhesion, and increasing immune system response. Statins are also efficient inhibitors of new lymphatic vessels formation.

We hypothesize that both of these difficulties reflect disrupted communication between a deep brain structure, the thalamus, and the brain's outer layer, the cortex. This communication is mediated by the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Due to its small size and location deep in the brain, we cannot assess TRN function without invasive techniques. Fortunately, sleep spindles, a specific brain rhythm provide a noninvasive read-out of TRN function. In Aim 1 we will examine whether reduced sleep spindles are related to worse sleep quality, impaired selective attention during wake, and sensory sensitivities in children with autism.

The pathophysiology of sepsis is based on an inappropriate host response to infection. Certain medical devices with higher adsorption capacity make it possible to limit this inappropriate response and could thus improve the hemodynamics of patients in septic or vasoplegic shock. The preliminary experience of the investigators from clinical data of vasopressor withdrawal in pediatric patients treated with oXiris shows a 50% reduction in the vasopressor score, Vaso Inotropic Score (VIS), for 40% of patients within 24 hours following the start of treatment. Similar results were found in adult patients treated for severe COVID-19 or vasoplegic shock by the other centers participating in the study.\nCytokine purification is an important physiological effect of purification membranes. However, this may not fully explain the rapid hemodynamic improvement of patients treated with an oXiris membrane.\nThe role of angiotensin metabolites (Ang 1-5, 1-7, 1-9) in the systemic vascular tone of patients has been recently discussed. The administration of angiotensin 2 in vasoplegic shock in adults helps correct hypotension. In the group of patients with increased renin, this treatment was associated with a reduction in mortality. Indeed, increased renin associated with dysfunction of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) leads to an accumulation of Angiotensin 1 which degrades to Ang 1-7.\nThe hypothesis f the investigators is that the concentration of Ang 1 and Ang 1-7 is elevated in cases of vasoplegic shock and that the clearance of these vasodilator peptides by blood purification is associated with clinical improvement.",

After six months, complementary foods should be started, and the baby should continue to be breastfed for two years or more. On the other hand, between 2015-2020, the rates of infants aged 0-6 months fed with breast milk alone are approximately 44% worldwide.\nThere are many factors that affect the time of initiation of breastfeeding and the duration of breastfeeding. Some of those; maternal education, mode of delivery, birth weight and socio-economic status. Another influential factor is paternal support. Fathers may want to be involved in breastfeeding education and support their spouses in this process. However, the reasons such as not taking part in the trainings and not being asked direct questions about breastfeeding may cause fathers to feel excluded in this process.

        "summary": "Covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen patients during or shortly after surgery, and may result in long-term disability. Fortunately, stroke that occurs during non-cardiac surgery is most commonly caused by inadequate blood flow to the brain and is, therefore, preventable if it can be detected early. Current clinical tools used to monitor the brain during surgery do not have the accuracy nor the spatial coverage - they only monitor one small region of the brain. In this study, the investigators plan to apply a cutting-edge optical device, tr-fNIRS, to monitor the whole brain during shoulder surgery. The primary aim is to determine any regional differences in cerebral oxygenation (ScO2) and cerebral autoregulation (CA)between brain regions during surgery and especially during various physiological challenges, such as hypotension. The investigators hypothesize that certain brain regions are more likely to develop cerebral desaturation and impaired CA, and are more prone to brain injury than the frontal lobe region which is the traditional monitoring site. The investigators also hypothesize that cerebral desaturation (or hypoxic injury) events correlate with adverse postoperative neurological outcomes such as covert stroke, overt stroke and/or postoperative delirium.",

        "summary": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a frequent pathology in intensive care (around 10% of patients admitted to intensive care and almost a quarter of patients on mechanical ventilation) and a serious one, with a hospital mortality rate of 40%. The main measures that have an effect on mortality in ARDS involve adjustments to the ventilator, known as protective ventilation. In the most severe patients, adjuvant measures such as prone positioning and the use of curarisation in the initial phase of the disease can improve survival. All these measures have been included in the latest national and international recommendations. However, a vast observational study carried out in 50 countries revealed low compliance with these recommendations. More than a third of patients did not receive protective ventilation, and the majority did not receive prone positioning when this was indicated. During weaning from artificial ventilation, it has been widely demonstrated that replacing clinician judgement with the implementation of paramedical care protocols improved weaning and significantly reduced the duration of artificial ventilation. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a paramedical care protocol for ventilation in the acute phase of ARDS improves compliance with recommendations and thus reduces mortality and the duration of artificial ventilation. However, implementation of such a protocol requires operational training for all the nurses in the participating departments. Simulation appears to be the training method of choice, as it is a teaching technique that enables technical and non-technical skills to be passed on with good retention of what has been learnt, as well as assessing what has been learnt. To make it possible to train several dozen nurses within a tight timescale, a partially dematerialized simulation model incorporating innovative e-learning tools will be developed.",

Secondary objectives include evaluation of the rates of favorable pathologic response, major wound complications, local control, acute toxicity, and 1-year late toxicity will be assessed. Exploratory objectives include evaluation of the impact of preoperative 5-day HFRT on access to care, the socio-demographic profile of the trial participants will be compared to that of extremity STS patients seen within Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) and recommended preoperative conventional fractionation radiotherapy (CFRT) in the 3 years prior to the study opening. The retention rate for radiotherapy at HCC in patients meeting trial criteria during the prior 3 years will be compared with the retention rate for radiotherapy during the study period. An exploratory analysis will measure serum SFRP2 pre- and post- radiotherapy to assess changes in response to preoperative 5-day HFRT. Changes in serum SFRP2 will be evaluated for association with a favorable pathologic response to determine the potential of serum SFRP2 as a predictive biomarker. Patient satisfaction with the decision to participate in a trial of preoperative 5-day HFRT will be assessed.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] The current standard approach to the management of extremity soft tissue sarcoma involves a combination of radiotherapy and limb preserving surgery. Currently, guidelines recommend preoperative conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) given at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx, which involves 5-6 weeks of daily treatments. The study aims to evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, efficacy, and potential improvement in access to care associated with preoperative hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) in extremity STS. This study will utilize a 30Gy/5fx preoperative regimen as it has an estimated EQD2 of 50 Gy (based on a \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio=4) and therefore would be expected to closely parallel the biologic effect of CFRT. The study will also evaluate the level of SFRP2 before and after 5-day preoperative HFRT to assess the effect of radiotherapy on SFRP2 expression and its potential use as a predictive biomarker for favorable pathologic response. The study is designed as a single group assignment trial. The primary outcome measure is the feasibility of 5-day HFRT, defined as the proportion of eligible patients who elect to participate in the trial.

In the initial laboratory and cross-sectional and pilot intervention research, the investigators have been testing two formats of 5-minute, twice-daily, strength exercise- and tai-chi-snacking, which has been shown to be acceptable and feasible to implement in older adults. This protocol presents initial efficacy for evoking improved physical function in people aged 65 years or more. The investigators' remote study demonstrated that remote assessment and delivery of 4-week exercise and tai-chi snacking interventions were acceptable and feasible. However, qualitative feedback indicated that exercise programmes may be more acceptable and interesting with simpler tai-chi movements and exercise snacking programme with upper body movements. Nevertheless, the investigators only recruited healthy older adults, doing short-term interventions in previous studies. This study aims to test the effectiveness of progressive S&B interventions over a sustained period in pre-frail older adults.",

        "summary": "Lumbosacral spine surgeries are commonly performed under GA. Perioperative pain following spine surgeries not only contributes to significant morbidities but also hampers early mobilization. Perioperative opioids, though relieve pain but hampers consciousness, increase PONV and delays mobilization. Caudal analgesia can be effectively given preemptively to alleviate pain and facilitate early mobilization. Caudal epidural block places the needle through the sacral hiatus into the epidural space to deliver medications. It can be performed as ultrasound guided procedure with very high successful rates. Single shot caudal block with local anesthetic provides analgesia for 2-4 hours but this can be further prolonged by adding adjuvants like opioids, steroids, ketamine, alpha 2 agonists, adrenaline etc. Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic agent which is less lipophilic, less cardiac and central nervous system toxicity with similar duration of analgesia, has lesser motor blockade and facilitates earlier mobilization than bupivacaine. Dexamethasone is a highly potent, long acting glucocorticoid. Caudal dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of the ropivacaine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pre-emptive caudal epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief in lumbosacral surgeries and to compare the effect of adding dexamethasone to ropivacaine with respect to quality of analgesia, duration of analgesia, hemodynamic effects and associated side effects.",

Several epidemiological studies have shown an association of SUI with Low Back Pain (LBP) demonstrating, moreover, that the presence of one condition may predispose the patient to the onset of the other. Concerning the LBP, the clinical practice guidelines provided recommendations for physical rehabilitative treatment. Different techniques and physical exercises have been developed and it is difficult at the date to affirm the superiority of one approach as compared to another. Moreover, the crucial role plays by the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) both as an integral part of trunk and lumbo-pelvic stability and in maintenance of urinary continence, lead the pelvic floor muscles disfunction to be associated both with SUI and LBP, making the PFM rehabilitation a useful approach in both the conditions.

        "summary": "The brain is a highly active organ that requires a large blood flow to function properly. Normally, blood flow is tightly linked to the brain's energy demands. However, during surgery, anesthesia can affect this relationship in different ways. Some types of anesthesia can decrease blood flow to the brain, while others can increase it. Anesthesiologists need to be careful to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain during surgery, especially when blood pressure drops. Drugs may be used to increase blood pressure, but some of these drugs can also affect blood flow to the brain. It is still unclear how to best maintain blood flow to the brain during surgery and how different types of anesthesia and drugs affect this process.\nThe study aims to assess the clinical utility of a new technique that uses light-based neuromonitoring to measure changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism. The investigators will recruit 80 adult patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia and randomize them into one of four groups to evaluate the effects of different anesthetic agents and vasopressors on brain hemodynamics and metabolism. The study will include patients over 18 years of age with no history of neurological conditions, substance abuse, or contraindications to cerebral oximetry devices or specific anesthetic agents. The patients will receive standard anesthesia care and be monitored with our light-based neuromonitoring system. This study aims to demonstrate the device's ability to detect changes in cerebral hemodynamic parameters related to anesthesia induction and systemic hypotension.

        "summary": "Shaft fractures account for 20% of humeral fractures and 3% of all adult fractures in France, with an estimated incidence of 13 to 20/100,000 people. Men aged 21 to 30 years and women aged 60 to 80 years are particularly affected. Intramedullary nailing is among the standard treatments for humeral shaft fractures (when surgery is required). Once inserted, the nail is locked in order to limit stress on the fractured bone, as well as possible secondary rotational displacements or malunion. Bipolar interlocking (BI) is typically performed on both sides (proximal and distal) of the fracture site. This procedure is performed under radiological control, exposing the patient and care team to radiation (during the entire procedure). The objective of the treatment is to obtain consolidation of the fracture within 12 months, and to limit the occurrence of irreversible complications such as malunion or nonunion (2-10% at 12 months post-surgery). The unipolar interlocking (UI) technique has recently been introduced. In this technique, locking is performed only on the proximal side of the fracture site. By avoiding the distal approach, potential complications such as radial nerve damage, with the risk of irreversible paralysis (3.8-14.2% in studies of the BI technique in this indication) or the risk of infection on the distal side can be avoided. It also reduces operative time, and consequently the radiation received by patients and caregivers. However, the UI may be poorly positioned, resulting in malunion that requires revision surgery.\nDespite the absence of recommendations due to the lack of existing data, several teams use the UI in routine care. In this context, a descriptive cohort of 121 patients operated on at the Dijon University Hospital5 showed similar rates of consolidation between the 2 techniques (93.8% for UI versus 95.2% for BI, p=0.64), functional scores, and complications, as well as a significant 29% decrease in operating time in the UI group (mean + SD: 63.1\u00b121.3 min versus 88.0\u00b130.1 min for VB, p<0.01).

Unfortunately, the vast majority of hepatocellular carcinoma patients suffer from advanced unresectable or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Currently targeted therapy alone, or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist, is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.\nOn the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that radiation therapy (external or internal) with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce or even augment abscopal effect in which the tumours away from the radiation field also show significant tumour shrinkage. The underlying mechanism of eliciting abscopal effect includes the increased antigen presentation by the myeloid cells within the tumour stroma leading to enhanced tumour cell killing. Previous case reports showed that radiation therapy alone can induce abscopal effect in mice and human models. However, a robust and concrete evidence of abscopal effect with combinational immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation or external radiation therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still lacking.\nThis study investigates the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation as first-line treatment for previously untreated metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.",

        "summary": "Peri-implantitis is defined as the pathological condition around dental implants characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and progressive bone loss, eventually leading to implant loss. Peri-implantitis is thought to be a disease analogous to periodontitis with a prevalence reaching 22%. Though peri-implantitis is readily recognized as a part of modern dentistry, the exact etiology or an effective treatment regimen hasn't been established yet. Thus, contemporary research is orientating toward acknowledging the aetiologic and risk factors of the disease and of course establishing prognostic markers for disease prevention. Microbiota residing in the subgingival plaque are considered the main etiologic factor of the disease, however, current literature has not concluded on the exact microbial composition of peri-implant lesions. In addition, genetic predisposition has been recognized as a risk factor for disease initiation and progression and several observational studies have addressed the potential association between various gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of peri-implantitis. Lastly, to establish effective preventive measures, several biomarkers have been evaluated as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease progression.\nObjectives:\nTo identify the relationship of peri-implantitis with Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and MMP-8 gene polymorphisms. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the production of prostaglandins (PGs) which are an important inflammatory mediator participating in the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. In addition, PGE2 expression in the peri-implant crevicular fluid will be assessed.\nTo characterize the microbiota associated with peri-implantitis lesions, using novel identification techniques enabling the identification of specific opportunistic bacteria associated with the disease.\nTo test the diagnostic accuracy of a modern chairside test, using metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), an enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease, as a biomarker of disease progression.",

The most important factor for survival for many cancer types is the presence of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes (metastasis). Lymph node metastases in patients with head and neck cancer reduce the 5-year survival by half. Sometimes, the disease is too small to be found on clinical and imaging exams before surgery. 111In-panitumumab is in a class of medications called radioimmunoconjugates. It is composed of a radioactive substance (indium In 111) linked to a monoclonal antibody (panitumumab). Panitumumab binds to EGFR receptors, a receptor that is over-expressed on the surface of many tumor cells and plays a role in tumor cell growth. Once 111In-panitumumab binds to tumor cells, it is able to be seen using an imaging technique called single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). SPECT/CT can be used to make detailed pictures of the inside of the body and to visualize areas where the radioactive drug has been taken up by the cells.

Moreover, these actions are often taken after failures, in a non-anticipated and non-consensual manner.\nIn order to assess the risk of DIVA, F.Van Loon et al developed in 2016, and then modified in 2018, a DIVA Scale (the A-DIVA Scale) which allows a rapid scoring upstream of peripheral venous catheter placement to classify patients according to the risk of DIVA.\nComposed of five items (non-palpable and non-visible vein, diameter < 3mm, history of DIVA, operator experience) worth one point each, the score allows three categories to be established: low risk, moderate risk, high risk. The study showed that the proportion of first puncture failures increased with the risk of the patients (defined according to the categorized score).\nThe use of a tool such as the A-DIVA Scale is of interest if it allows the definition of actions to be taken in relation to the risk it identifies. In view of this, it appears essential to optimize the management of peripheral venous catheters, particularly for patients with DIVAs. The aim of this study is to develop a graduate and specific response to the issue of multiple punctures. Our project is to create and evaluate a specific algorithm, consisting of a risk assessment (the A-DIVA Scale) and a co-construct decision-making tree (the A-DIVA Tool). Built on the basis of objective clinical data collection and adapted to the possibilities and competencies, this new tool would bring real benefits to the patient in terms of safety (reduction of risks) and comfort (reduction of pain and duration of management), as well as a medico-economic benefit for the institutions. To date, such an algorithm does not exist and its beneficial effects have not been evaluated.",

Surgery is the primary treatment for PTC, and occult lymph node metastasis is not uncommon (20%-80%).The lymph node metastasis of PTC is mostly along the lymphatic drainage path station by station, and most of the first metastasis is to the central lymph node. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association recommendation, prophylactic central lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with primary T3-4 or cN1b without central lymph node involvement. However, PTC with primary site T1-2, no external invasion and cN0 could not be dissected by central lymph node.Previous studies have suggested that prophylactic dissection should be performed to improve disease-specific survival, reduce local recurrence, improve recurrence risk and treatment response assessment, and help RAI decision making. Although routine prophylactic central lymph node dissection may detect occult lymph node metastasis, the need for further dissection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid gland may lead to an increased incidence of complications, while its effect on reducing the risk of recurrence and improving prognosis is unclear, and the impact on long-term outcomes may be small.Previous retrospective studies in our institution have shown that routine central neck dissection does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence. This study was designed to evaluate the benefits and risks of prophylactic central lymph node dissection in cT1b-T2N0 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.

The name of this type of radiotherapy is Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) or participants may see it referred to as Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR). The study is a two-stage single arm Phase II study open to those Centres that use the RayPilot HypoCath tumour tracking system (Micropos Medical). This commercially available system was not available at the time of the original PACE-B study. The system acts like a Global Positioning Device (GPS) to continuously track the prostate position during radiotherapy. If the prostate moves more than 2mm (about 0.08 in) from its intended position during the treatment, then the radiotherapy team are alerted, and the treatment halted until the prostate moves back into the correct position. The ability to understand exactly where the prostate is throughout the treatment ensures the intended dose hits the cancer and does not accidentally increase the dose to the nearby bladder and rectum. The system is a modification of a standard urinary catheter which sits within the bladder with the GPS placed within the wall of the catheter as it passes through the prostate.

        "summary": "INTRODUCTION A variety of bone grafts and substitutes are available for filling bone defects in the distal radius after corrective osteotomy, but the harvesting of bone from the iliac crest is the gold standard as it allows easy access to corticocancellous bone of a desirable quality and quantity. The idea behind bone grafting is to provide optimal bone formation and structural stability, which is crucial for bone healing. However, the harvesting and use of bone from the iliac crest potentially comes with the risk of complications such as delayed union of the osteotomy defect; size mismatch between the graft and the osteotomy defect; longer operation time; donor site morbidity including nerve, arterial, and ureteral injury; herniation of abdominal contents; sacroiliac joint instability; pelvic fractures; hematoma and infection. As these disadvantages of bone grafting can have a major impact on patients' everyday lives, research is needed on whether bone grafting is genuinely necessary during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation of the distal radius\nOBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to investigate whether harvested bone graft from the iliac crest necessary is during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation in patients with malunited distal radius fractures.\nSTUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study.

Moreover, due to the lack of early diagnostic marker, most patients with HCC are often diagnosed in an advanced stage with poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further understand the possible aetiological factors and surgical treatment methods to improve the prognosis of patients with HCC. Liver transplantation is an ideal choice for patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC, which can significantly improve the postoperative survival rate.

        "summary": "Abnormal lipid metabolism is a common complication after organ transplantation, with pathological changes in lipid parameters occurring in approximately 60-80% of cardiac transplant recipients receiving triple immunotherapy with cyclosporine, imid azathioprine, and methylprednisolone. With the significant increase in long-term survival and increasing age of transplant patients, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, such as those caused by dyslipidemia, have become a major cause of transplant organ failure and recipient death. However, the causes of dyslipidemia after organ transplantation, as well as the effects and mechanisms of dyslipidemia on transplant rejection, are unknown.\nPrevious studies have found that 1. increased lipid levels occur in recipients after heart transplantation; 2. during rejection, hepatic PCSK9 expression is increased in recipients; 3. a high-fat environment increases the immunoreactivity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is suggested that PCSK9-lipid disorder-immune cell interactions may be associated with the development of transplant rejection.\nIn this project, we propose to (1) establish a long-term follow-up system for postoperative cardiac transplantation patients in our department to track the characteristics of lipid changes in transplantation patients, to clarify the link between dyslipidemia and rejection, and to provide a strong evidence-based medical basis for the management of lipids during the perioperative period and in the postoperative period; (2) expand the dimensions of lipid-related assays under the support of the above system, and to incorporate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic research methods to elucidate transplantation rejection in a multidimensional manner. (ii) Expanding the dimensions of lipid-related assays to include transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies to elucidate the relationship between PCSK9 and dyslipidemia in transplant patients; (iii) Adopting single-cell sequencing technology to deeply reveal the potential mechanism by which changes in lipids affect T-cell-mediated rejection of cardiac transplants.

On the other hand, a few patients require surgical intervention. Surgery is indicated for those not responding to conservative management, those with grade III, and grade IV hemorrhoids.\nSurgical treatment is the only curative method for hemorrhoidal disease and indicated for advanced and complicated disease. The most radical operations with the best results are the Milligan-Morgan and Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy .\nHowever, the major concern of hemorrhoidectomy is the post-operative pain that occurs in 20-40 % of patients and it is considered the main cause of refusing surgery. The cause of postoperative pain is multifactorial, including the type of anesthesia , hemorrhoidectomy technique. and spasm of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) that becomes exposed after hemorrhoidectomy. The spasm of the IAS is considered the target to relieve pain post operatively. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is widely used as an adjunct to relieve pain post hemorrhoidectomy as it release the spasm of the sphincter and subsequently relieve pain. However, this procedure is not accepted by many surgeons due to its recorded complications as bleeding and mild degree of fecal incontinence, so its role following hemorrhoidectomy is still controversial.\nOn the other hand, the spasm of the anal sphincter can be abolished by injection of the botulinum toxin which acts on the acetylcholine receptor and consequently temporary muscle paralysis occurs that is followed by decreased pain and wound healing.\nOur hypothesis is botulinum toxin relaxes the internal sphincter, so prevent its spasm and so reducing the pain and promoting wound healing more rapidly.",

Among people with disabilities, women with disabilities (WWD) have higher unmet healthcare needs than women without disabilities.\nCancer is an important public health problem and cause of death all over the world. Among the most common cancers in women; breast, uterine corpus, ovarian and cervix cancers are seen to be prominent, respectively. It is known that with regular examinations and screenings, early diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer increases the chance of treatment.\nInternational studies show that women face barriers and difficulties in accessing reproductive health and cancer screening services. In studies, it was stated that especially women with disabilities living in rural areas had lower mammography and Pap-smear tests compared to women without disabilities. In recent years, the Health Belief Model has been used frequently to examine the effect of health beliefs on cancer screening behaviors in women and to increase screening rates. The model explains the beliefs and attitudes that affect individuals' behaviors. According to the model; If a person has a desire to prevent illness or a belief in recovery, he recommends taking a specific health action to prevent illness as a positive behavior. It was emphasized that nurses have important roles and responsibilities in the protection and development of health, and that they can identify individuals with disabilities who are considered fragile, and provide health education and counseling to these groups. It is thought that the disabled-friendly accessible health care practices under the guidance of the Health Belief Model will bring the preventive health care behavior of women with disabilities to the desired level.\nDisabled women experience inequalities in benefiting from routine health services and health screening services in special areas such as reproductive health and protection from women's cancers.

        "summary": "Rationale: Osteoarthritis (OA) is mainly characterized by cartilage degeneration. In knee OA, measuring the distance between the tibia and femur, known as the joint space width (JSW), is an often-used method to quantify the progression of the disease or the effectiveness of treatments, because it is an indirect measure of cartilage degeneration. However, JSW is often measured while the patient is standing (weight-bearing) with slightly flexed knees, with a flexion angle of around 7-10 degrees, while direct cartilage thickness measurements are usually performed while the patient is lying down (non-weight-bearing) with an extended leg [1]. Because of this difference in positioning, it is difficult to compare different JSW and cartilage thickness measures, as it is not clear what happens with the JSW distribution in the joint when a patient changes position between weight-bearing/non-weight-bearing and flexion/extension. In this study, we aim to identify the changes that occur in the knee of OA patients under the influence of weight-bearing and/or flexion, to enable comparing joint space measures from different positions. In this research we want to use MRI as a three-dimensional imaging technique because there is no radiation involved..\nObjective: To evaluate how the 3D knee joint space distribution in knee OA patients changes under the influence of weight-bearing (upright) and flexion MRI scanning.\nStudy design: Explorative cross-sectional study.

The optimal selection of the potency and duration of antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in HBR patients is still a matter of debate. Multiple strategies to reduce bleeding during secondary prevention, such as reducing the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, using single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor, or de-escalating to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor, have been proposed. De-escalation to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor is particularly attractive because it maintains efficient pharmacological inhibition of multiple platelet pathways while potentially reducing bleeding through less aggressive activity. Yet, there has been no study comparing the effects of different de-escalation strategies with the standard potent P2Y12 inhibitors in HBR patients. The aim of the DESC-HBR study is to assess the impact of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor to clopidogrel 75mg, prasugrel 5mg or ticagrelor 60mg bid in HBR patients, in comparison with full-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitors, on the proportion of patients with optimal platelet reactivity (OPR).

FASD is completely preventable if women do not drink during pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol use frequently co-occurs with other substance use, especially tobacco and cannabis. The adverse effect on birth outcomes by alcohol and tobacco use together is worse than either substance alone. Recent evidence from animal models shows that prenatal exposure to both cannabinoids and alcohol potentiate the likelihood of alcohol-induced birth defects.\nData from Cape Metropole, SA, showed that all women who reported prenatal alcohol use also tested positive for tobacco use, with 25% also reporting cannabis use. Alcohol use while breastfeeding also occurs at a relatively high rate in SA. Despite tremendous health benefits from breastfeeding,maternal alcohol use while breastfeeding significantly compromises infant development. Contingency management (CM) has been efficacious in reducing prenatal cocaine, alcohol, and tobacco use in the United States (U.S.). The Women's Health CoOp (WHC) is an evidence-based brief intervention addressing women-focused syndemic issues and resulting disparities associated with substance and alcohol use.

        "summary": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a disorder that affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Nasal congestion is one of the most general and bothersome symptoms in rhinitis, which affects the quality of life (QOL). Current medications are undesirable due to their side-effects. Acupuncture for AR in general can be considered as safe and can be seen as a potential remedial blueprint for nasal congestion. Evidence supported that acupuncture is clinically used for signs and symptoms of nose disorders, such as nasal congestion, with effectiveness, but whether acupuncture has immediate, post-treatment and long-term effects on nasal congestion in AR is not verified by strictly designed clinical study. The ANCAR trial uses a standard treatment protocol with a fixed set of acupuncture points - to be as scientific as possible from Western medical viewpoint - to open the nose and affect underlying energetic imbalance and immunity at the same time, to maintain its nose opening effect. This novel acupuncture treatment protocol can be seen as a solid and profound approach from which every AR patient may benefit.",

This procedure is called primary percutaneous coronary intervention (or primary PCI for short).\nAn angiogram is a routine procedure that involves insertion of fine plastic tube (catheter) into either the groin or wrist under local anaesthetic. The tube is passed into the artery in the heart and X-ray pictures are taken to find out if the arteries are blocked. Blocked arteries can usually be opened by passing a small balloon into the artery, via the fine plastic tube followed by placement of a stent (a fine metal coil) into the artery to prevent it from blocking again.\nAlthough this treatment is very successful, it can result in damage to the heart muscle when the artery is opened. Cooling the entire body has been shown to reduce heart muscle damage during heart attacks in some patients but not in others; however, it is uncomfortable due to the shivering, expensive and can result in delays in opening the blocked artery.\nThe investigators are conducting a series of research studies to find out if cooling the heart muscle directly through the catheter being used for the normal primary angioplasty treatment using room temperature may be effective in preserving heart muscle, without the shortcomings of entire body cooling.\nThe investigators have already published an initial series of ten cases in which this treatment appeared to be feasible without causing significant clinical problems.\nThe present study is a pilot study designed to assess the rate of patient recruitment and feasibility of this new treatment while exploring some detailed outcomes measuring the restoration of blood flow within the coronary artery at the end of the procedure.\nUltimately if the present pilot study is successful, the investigators plan to go on to undertake a much larger randomised outcome study to determine definitively whether this treatment can help reduce heart attack size.",

Women with a history of depression have a 20 fold higher risk of PDA at subsequent pregnancies. The adverse outcomes extend beyond maternal well-being to long-term deficits in children and families. The gut-brain axis is a newly recognized key player in mental health disorders. Specifically, the microbial composition of the gut along with their metabolites are directly involved in disease onset and course. Recent clinical studies have identified diet as the most powerful environmental factor in manipulating gut microbiome. Given vulnerability and resistance of pregnant women to pharmacotherapy, particularly in those with a predisposition to mood disorders, as well as pregnant women's high motivation and commitment to improving gestational diet, a dietary/supplemental intervention to 'optimize' gut microbiome, is a favored approach in disease management. The study investigators aim to exploit microbial responsiveness to diet together with this maternal motivation, to alter the risk and severity of a universal public health concern that has dire and long-term consequences for new moms and their children.\nThe investigators of this trial, will first study the challenges in pursuing a study aimed at changing the microbiome of pregnant women with a history of mood disorders.

Although SCLC is relatively sensitive to chemotherapy, it is highly susceptible to recurrence. The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the clinical practice of oncology, and the newly released results of the ASTRUM-005 study have led to the incorporation of Serplulimab into the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC. Although immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is currently the most promising regimen, due to the limited understanding of genetic alterations and the marked genetic heterogeneity of SCLC, treatment responsiveness varies greatly. Thus, there is an urgent need to find molecular biomarkers that can effectively predict prognosis and further suggest the effectiveness of this new treatment mode.\nMinimal residual disease (MRD) refers to the presence of tumor cells disseminated from the primary lesion to distant organs in patients who lack any clinical or radiological signs of metastasis or residual tumor cells left behind after local therapy that eventually lead to local recurrence. These years, the development of real-time, high-sensitivity liquid biopsy assays have enabled the identification of MRD in individual patients with cancer. Multiple studies have demonstrated that detection of MRD dynamics following definitive therapy for solid cancers is strongly prognostic and has extremely high positive predictive value for risk of recurrence and treatment efficacy.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the predictive value of MRD dynamics on disease prognosis before and after the first-line treatment of Serplulimab in combination with chemotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC.",

This can result in feeding intolerance, which is expressed by abdominal distension, regurgitation or vomiting, irregular transit and abdominal discomfort. This feeding intolerance influences the length of hospitalization and can lead to necrotising enterocolitis, a major complication.\nIn the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Clermont-Ferrand hospital center, abdominal massages have been performed by physiotherapists for several years in order to improve the condition of the digestive system. However, the indication for abdominal massage is very dependent on the caregivers in charge of the newborn and the evaluation of the abdominal condition remains subjective with a great variability between examiners. Thus, some newborns will receive massage multiple times a day while others will not.\nDevelopmental care is essential for these premature infants, especially to avoid over-stimulation. It is important not to add care, such as massage, if it is not needed.

The transplantation replaces the recipient's original hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with donor-derived HSCs, thereby reconstructing the donor's hematopoietic and immune functions to achieve disease cure.\nPoor graft function (PGF) following transplantation, which refers to inadequate engraftment of the transplanted hematopoietic stem cells, is one of the major factors limiting the effectiveness of allo-HSCT. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), identified within the bone marrow stroma, are a type of non-hematopoietic multipotent stem cells. Several studies, including previous research by our research team, suggest that MSCs can improve the bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment by secreting various cytokines. This leads to the promotion of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, enhancement of hematopoietic function, and support for hematopoiesis as well as direct or indirect promotion of vascular regeneration in damaged tissues and organs.\nTherefore, exploring the efficacy of umbilical cord-derived MSCs in treating poor graft function after allo-HSCT, observing the recovery of blood parameters in patients with poor engraftment, monitoring transplantation-related complications and immune reconstitution, and conducting preliminary investigations into the underlying mechanisms can contribute to the exploration of new clinical techniques for the treatment of PGF following allo-HSCT.",

After an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread from China to almost all over the world, it nearly affected all countries. In spite of its typical presentation in the form of fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and pneumonia, other GIT manifestations were reported. We found some of COVID-19 survivors who had complained from anal fissure problem. The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of acute anal fissure among COVID-19 patients, its possible risk factors and outcome.\nMethods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study which was conducted over three months from the start of September 2020 to the end of November 2020 at Mansoura university isolation hospital, on COVID-19 patients' who were diagnosed with anal fissure. Those who survived and were discharged home safely were telephone called to pick up whether they suffered from any symptoms of anal pain, difficulty in defecation suggesting anal fissure, in order to identify their outcomes, the risk factors for anal fissure development and how they were managed.\nResults A total of 176 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were categorized into two groups. The first group included patients who developed anal fissure (n=65) and the 2nd group included patients who did not develop anal fissure (n=111). No significant difference was noted in demographic data apart from the age which was younger in the fissure group. The incidence of anal fissure was 36.9% of total population. The majority of patients' anal fissure problem resolved spontaneously after patients improved from the COVID symptoms without receiving any treatment (43.1%).\nConclusion Anal fissure is quite common problem after COVID-19. Young and middle age patients are more vulnerable to develop anal fissure after COVID-19 infection.",

        "summary": "Palatal-tissue harvesting is a routinely performed procedure in periodontal plastic surgery. Subepithelial connective tissue graft (sCTG) is considered the gold standard in root coverage. However, over the years, several materials have been attempted to accelerate wound healing and to decrease the post-operative patient discomfort and pain, which are considered the most common disadvantages of tissue harvesting from the palate. Reharvesting from the same region could be necessary in some complicated gingical recessions. For this reason, patients may face long treatment times due to recovery periods of the palate between surgeries.\nPlatelet-rich fibrin (PRF) which has 3-dimensional fibrin matrix structure contributes to regeneration of surgical wounds by releasing growth factors for 10-14 days and showing angiogenic properties.\nIn medicine and dentistry, ultrasonography (USG) method can be used to measure tissue thickness, vascularization, elasticity and blood flow. USG, as a non-invasive method, can provide objective data in evaluating the effects of surgical techniques and biomaterials used on soft tissue healing dynamics and tissue perfusion.\nThe investigators hypothesised that leukocyte rich PRF (L-PRF) application to the palatal area after sCTG harvesting could increase palatal tissue thickness and vascularity throughout 3-month follow-up period compared to the controls. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of the L-PRF membrane on soft tissue donor site healing after harvesting sCTG in terms of wound healing dynamics using USG method.",

It is one of the most significant causes of orofacial pain, along with dental pain. In TMD syndrome, the cause of pain is often due to overloading of the masticatory muscles rather than primary changes in the joints themselves.\nNowadays, doctors who treat patients with TMD have no doubt that one of the very important etiological factors of this condition is psycho-emotional disorders (excessive nervous excitability, anxiety, depression), which has been confirmed by numerous authors of studies on this subject [4-11].\nThe etiology of TMD is complex and multifactorial. Numerous factors may also contribute to the development of the disorder. An important factor affecting the state of masticatory function is an increase in stress levels (psycho-emotional tension). Structures such as the hypothalamus, reticular formation and limbic system have a decisive influence on the emotional state of each patient The activity of the limbic system, which governs the emotions of adults, and the additional connections of the gamma loops to the masticatory muscles, determine that increased emotional tension translates into a significant increase in the contractile activity of the masticatory muscles.\nTMD and functional disorder of the masticatory muscles are the most common complaint of the patients, seeking treatment in dental office. The two main symptoms of TMD problems are pain and dysfunction. Myalgia -the most common cause is an increased level of muscle use. It is related to vasocontraction of relevant arteries and accumulation of metabolic waste product in the muscles.

        "summary": "Allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis affect more than 25% of the world population and are the leading cause of illness in children. The complex interplay between genetic, environmental and immunological risk factors results in the manifestation of allergic diseases . The pathological presentation of allergic disease involves the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in a multifaceted response in specific target tissues such as the airways . This response results in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to target tissues and the production of specific IgE antibodies, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators [11], [12]. It is well established that allergic inflammation triggers neuronal dysfunction, which activates specific inflammatory mechanisms, potentially leading to structural changes in the diseased tissue . Neurotrophins are a family of structurally related proteins initially discovered to be involved in regulating neuronal development and now known to govern both peripheral and central nerve growth.\nBDNF is a secretory protein belonging to the neurotrophin family and is involved in a range of neural processes during human development [19], [20]. In the early stages of development BDNF is essential for neurogenesis, survival and maturation of neuronal pathways. In the adult, alongside neurotransmitters, hormones and other neurotrophins, BDNF maintains synaptic plasticity, dendritic growth and the consolidation of long-term memory. The biological effect of BDNF is mediated via its binding to the trkB receptor. The activation of these receptors on eosinophils may be important in regulating the inflammatory cascade leading to allergic disease [15], [24]. Neurotrophin mediated activation of bronchial eosinophils might therefore play a role in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation in allergic asthma .\nThe BDNF gene is located on chromosome 11p13 and is alternatively spliced resulting in several different transcripts [26]. Genetic polymorphisms in BDNF have been associated with allergic phenotypes such atopic dermatitis [27] and asthma [28], [29], [30], [31] in different populations. The functional polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met) has been shown to regulate intracellular trafficking and affect the secretion of BDNF [32]. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that is expressed in the glandular, nasal epithelium, and peripheral nerves in the nasal mucosa, has been shown to induce biochemical and structural changes in nerves that can lead to hyper-responsiveness [33], [34], [35] The biological effects of neurotrophins are mediated by binding either to the high-affinity tyrosine kinase (trk) receptors or to the low-affinity receptors known as pan-neurotrophin receptor p-75.",

Up to 10% of community dwelling older adults have depressive symptoms in Europe. Older adults are also subject to chronic illnesses which further exacerbate psychological symptoms. Furthermore, normal aging is associated with decline in cognitive functioning. Given the prevalence of mental health problems and cognitive difficulties in older adults, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) could be helpful in this population. Accordingly, a growing number of studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions in the elderly have beneficial effects on psychological health (decrease in depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and increase in general mood and positive affect) and cognition (enhanced attention, executive functions).\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique which can be useful to study the neurophysiological correlates of mindfulness, and give neurobiological evidence of its beneficial effect in the elderly. Studies that examined spectral power outcomes between mindfulness and control state showed (i) increased alpha and theta power, as a marker of internally-directed attention processing and executive functioning and (ii) a shift towards left-sided anterior alpha activation, a pattern associated previously with positive emotions.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate short and long-term cognitive, psychological, and physiological effects of a standard 8-week MBI in healthy older adults.

        "summary": "There is increasing awareness of the importance of providing mental health services and support that promote a recovery-oriented and human rights-based approach. A mental health service system that is guided by a rehabilitation and recovery perspective places emphasis on treating the consequences of the illness rather than just the illness per se, and on empowering people to regain control of their identity and life, and to have hope for the future. Within this philosophy, mental health policies in several countries advocate for the introduction of peer workers in mental health services, people with lived experience of mental health issues and recovery, who are employed to use their lived experience to support those who access mental health services. However, more effectiveness and implementation research is needed. Evidence also suggests that the period following hospital discharge is of high risk of treatment dropout for people with serious mental illness, thus interrupting their recovery process. Therefore, this vulnerable population may particularly benefit from more targeted interventions during this transitional period.\nThe research project will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and implementation of the Critical Time Intervention-Peer Support model, a recovery-oriented based model for people with serious mental illness discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities in Portugal. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in three psychiatric services in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and their catchment areas. People with diagnoses of psychotic disorders discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities will be recruited and randomly divided into CTI-PS intervention or usual care. Those allocated to the intervention group will additionally receive CTI-PS rather than usual care alone over a 9-month period. Outcomes at baseline, 9- and 18-months will be analyzed by multilevel models, considering the observations clustered within sites. Longitudinal analyses will be used to examine trends over time of the outcomes of interest.\nThe implementation of the CTI-PS model will introduce a novel approach to community mental health care that has not yet been tried in Portugal. This study aims to explore to what extent this intervention can be effective and implemented in countries with the characteristics of Portugal. Additionally, the proposed research aims to contribute to the global knowledge about peer interventions by investigating whether the CTI model maintains its effectiveness using peers.",

        "summary": "This study proposes to assess the usability of the Neutrocheck device and test kit amongst healthy volunteers and healthcare professionals (HCPs).\nNeutrocheck is a portable, single-use diagnostic test intended to aid the diagnosis of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic sepsis using a finger prick blood sample.\nNeutropenia is when the number of infection-fighting neutrophil cells in the blood are lower than normal. It can be caused by treatments such as chemotherapy or by certain medical conditions. Neutropenic sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency that occurs when patients with neutropenia develop an infection. There is currently no way to test for neutropenic sepsis outside of hospitals. Neutrocheck is being developed for use as a self-test by patients at home alongside remote consultation with a HCP or at point-of-care by a HCP. This will allow rapid identification of patients requiring urgent intravenous antibiotics and medical assessment. In cases where Neutrocheck has eliminated the possibility of neutropenic sepsis, patients can avoid unnecessary and stressful hospital visits and valuable hospital resources will be saved.\nParticipants in this study will be invited to use the Neutrocheck test kit in a setting similar to a home environment to carry out a test, whilst being observed by a study moderator.\nThe Neutrocheck devices used in the study will be for investigational use only. This study will not be testing the accuracy of the Neutrocheck result, rather if Neutrocheck can be used safely and in a user-friendly way. Results will not be considered valid. Planned study duration is 2 months.

        "summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that often results in motor and/or cognitive impairment. Epidemiologically, the onset occurs between the ages of 20 and 40, with a peak around the age of 30.\nMS is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of signs and symptoms, both in terms of the neurological systems involved and the degree of impairment and severity. The most common symptoms include, among others, difficulty walking and lack of balance. The lack of stability and coordination reduces independence and mobility, predisposing people with MS to accidental falls and compromising mobility in daily life. Another symptom that characterises MS is cognitive impairment, which mainly alters information processing speed and short- and long-term memory. MS-related cognitive impairment is detectable at every stage of the disease. Very often, people with MS have co-existing cognitive and motor deficits, which add to the complexity of managing MS. In order to address this condition, a treatment strategy that combines cognitive and motor rehabilitation needs to be identified. Despite the increasing availability of effective drug therapies that may impact on balance, rehabilitation is a very important means to counteract the progression of disability and improve physical function, affecting social participation and improving quality of life. In recent years, rehabilitation makes use of various robotic devices, which are based on repeatable, intense and motivating exercises, integrated with an enriched virtual environment, capable of improving the quality of movement. In light of the literature, which mainly focuses on robotic therapy for walking, this pilot study aims to evaluate the effects of a specific robotic treatment for balance in MS patients.\nThe primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT) on static balance.\nThe secondary objective is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT)\non dynamic balance and walking (assessed with clinical and instrumental scales)\non fatigue and cognitive performance in terms of sustained attention, dual-task cost and cognitive-motor interference;\non quality of life.",

The basic profile in the Emergency ward always has these two parameters. The algorithm automatically identifies patients with a predicted probability of TMA >90% (6); if this criterion is associated with a platelet count<100 x 109/L, an automated warning to the hematologist on-call is issued with an SMS, and the patient enters the TMA diagnostic process defined in the diagnostic and treatment pathways (Percorso Diagnostico e Terapeutico Assistensiale, PDTA). The on-duty hematologist urgently evaluates the patient for whom a warning has been issued, relating with the clinician(s) of the ward in which the patient is located. If the suspicion of TMA is confirmed, the diagnostic procedures outlined in the PDTA are performed, with the immediate execution of 2nd level tests.

Although most verrucae will disappear spontaneously, many patients do seek treatment. Current wart treatments do not target the cause of the lesion directly, resulting in variable treatment efficacies and high wart recurrence rates. AV2 is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, that is capable of deactivating HPV. It is however not able to destruct the already infected cells, which raises the need for an additional ablative treatment i.e. salicylic acid (SA). Implementation of AV2-Salicylic acid (AV2-SA) combination therapy would ensure permanent lesion clearance by on the one hand inactivation of HPV by AV2, and on the other hand elimination of the lesion by SA treatment. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of AV2-SA treatment versus standard SA treatment, by comparing cure and recurrence rates of cutaneous warts between the two treatment groups (at 12 weeks and six months after randomization). The second aim is to assess the safety and tolerability of AV2-SA therapy. The third aim is to identify subgroups of cutaneous warts that have favorable response to treatment, by comparing cure rates in an HPV genotype-specific manner. This randomized controlled trial will enroll 260 participants with cutaneous warts who will either receive the AV2-SA combination therapy or SA control treatment.

The coordinated development of the embryo and the uterine endometrium requires close communication between the maternal tissue and the embryo. In in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo transfer generally takes place between the 2nd (D2) and the 6th (D6) day following oocyte fertilization. Recent studies have shown the advantages of sequential transfer (transfer of an embryo on D2/D3 followed by the transfer of another embryo on D5/D6), with higher implantation and clinical pregnancy rate, fewer miscarriages, more live births, and yet no increase in multiple pregnancies. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommendations continue to prioritize the transfer of a single embryo for all patients aged under 38. To improve pregnancy rates for patients having a single embryo transferred, the study investigators wish to carry out on blank transfer, based on the principle of sequential transfer. The study investigators hypothesize that a culture medium, placed in the uterus before the time of embryo transfer, will modify immune tolerance.

MN can be fabricated from a variety of materials, preferably biocompatible polymers. Maltose, a natural carbohydrate, is a safe and biocompatible product that can be fabricated into MNs that are biodegradable and soluble within several minutes. Besides, local anaesthetic agents such as lignocaine can be impregnated within the MN matrix, facilitating its transdermal delivery more efficiently which results in enhanced efficacy.

        "summary": "The most recent evidence showed that the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019, National Institutes of Health) pandemic caused an increase in low back pain (LBP) prevalence and intensity among young people. This may be explained by the prolonged sitting time, next to reduced level of physical activity. Young people spend most of their time in a sitting position while studying (in school class, during homework) and using electronic devices (using the computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablets, or watching TV), and now using e-learning methods. E-learning, and thus prolonged sitting, is a topic that returned to higher education at the beginning of the 2022-2023 academic year because of the current energy crisis. Re-education on sitting posture is a common aspect of LBP management. Physiotherapists recommend many different sitting positions to prevent and treat the negative effects of prolonged sitting. However, there is debate regarding what is an optimal sitting posture. Studies showed that sitting posture with the backrest on the chair induced minimal changes in lumbar lordosis and significantly lesser pain compared to other types of the chair. Even though the sitting posture will be followed by proper ergonomic principles, every position (lordotic or kyphotic) maintained for a prolonged time leads to discomfort and soft tissue symptoms. Studies showed that body perceived discomfort scores increased over time during sitting and after 30 min of sitting is significantly greater than those at baseline. Currently, breaks are recommended for mitigating the adverse of prolonged sitting, but more evidence is needed to verify effectiveness of breaks. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of active break on reduce LBP and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young people with LBP. Optimal combination of sitting and breaks will help to develop ergonomic recommendations for young people. Main research outcomes - exercise protocol and intervention - will be developed to match the needs of young people with LBP and the possibilities of the environment, in order to reduce LBP and musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting, and consequently, maintain health and quality of life.
