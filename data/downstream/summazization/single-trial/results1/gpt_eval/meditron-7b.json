        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",

Objectives: To explore possible ADHD-specific pharmacotherapy use patterns that differ between patients with vs without co-occurring dyslexia. Methods: Based on claims data, 30,354 patients with ADHD were stratified into clusters based on comorbidities with dyslexia at diagnosis. Results: A total of 7.2% (n = 2144) of patients within this ADHD sample were included into one of four different clusters, showing a comorbid ADHD-and-dyslexia prevalence of 17.8% (n = 1062). Within the ADHD population, patients with/without dyslexia were similar in age, sex distribution as well as utilization of non-pharmaceutical treatments, except for psychology services (8.4% more often utilized vs not used in ADHD + dyslexia). Compared with ADHD patients without dyslexia, those with dyslexia used psychotherapy and special schooling more frequently. At least one medicine was more frequently prescribed for ADHD + dyslexia patients. The most commonly prescribed were atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and bupropion, respectively. Atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine and methylphenidate showed significantly shorter DDDs for pharmacotherapy in ADHD + dyslexia patients, compared with ADHD patients without dyslexia. Additionally, medicines with more often used pharmaceutical treatments in the ADHD-only group compared with the overall population. Conclusions: Comorbid ADHD and dyslexia resulted in different patterns regarding pharmacotherapy, especially with regard to the prescription behavior. This implies that pharmacotherapy needs/dosages might differ between ADHD patients with and without dyslexia and thus that clinical diagnosis might be necessary to adjust treatment. Overall, the results highlight the need for additional research on the comorbidity of ADHD and dyslexia, especially regarding pharmacotherapy indication.\n\n# Introduction\nAttention-deficit-/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder comprising impaired attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which can lead to a wide range of comorbidities and negative effects on patients' development, functioning, and social integration. ADHD, in all probability, is more frequent than previously believed when compared to the officially defined patient population. For example, a recent German survey of approximately 10,000 children and adolescents with the same mean age as those who reportedly receive outpatient care for ADHD (10.5 years) showed that 3.3% (= 330/10,144) already had a confirmed ADHD diagnosis in the year before the study's survey start. Moreover, a German multicenter study carried out between October 2011 and December 2012 identified ADHD in 13.5% (= 307/2268) of all children interviewed (aged 6 to 8 years; 51% (= 1145/2268) of all interviewed children had at least one mental health problem).\nIn line with findings in other, mainly larger international studies, ADHD comorbidities can be diverse and range from anxiety disorders, depression, sleep disorders, substance abuse, or obesityas well as learning difficulties such as dyslexia (i.e., a persistent disorder affecting the ability to read), impairments in concentration, comprehension, and memory, which persist throughout their lifetime or significantly interf",

This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of ocular adverse events associated with the use of antiepileptic drugs among Nepali patients with epilepsy. This hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medical Sciences, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal, from May to December 2022. It included Nepalese patients aged >18 years diagnosed with epilepsy attending the Epilepsy clinic of Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 20.0) and R Studio. A total of 330 patients were included in the study, with a mean (\u00b1SD) age 33.95 (\u00b114.06) years. Out of total patients, 196 (59.7%) were male. Among the study patients, 72 (21.8%) patients had used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for \u226510 years. The most commonly prescribed AEDs were oxcarbazepine (65; 19.7%) and Zonisamide (60; 18.2%). In the past 2 years, 15 (4.5%) patients were diagnosed with cataract. Moreover, three (0.9%) patients had experienced blurred vision, and two (0.6%) patients had cataract surgery done. Furthermore, 2 (0.6%) had experienced conjunctival hemorrhage and six (1.8%) had visual impairment within the last year. The incidence of ocular events in this study was lower than those reported in previous studies. The present study concludes that ocular adverse events are not uncommon, but their occurrence is lower than in previous studies. The results might be due to improvements in drug combinations, pharmacotherapy, and the management of epileptic patients during recent years. <EOD> Bactericidal Properties of Synthetic \u03b5-polylysine-based Antimicrobial Coatings.\nToday, it is necessary to protect foods from contaminants due to the increasing number of microbial pathogens, the increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and consumer awareness.

What is the effect of virtual reality on anxiety management before abdominal surgery? Which technique is the best and most effective for preoperative anxiety management? Variables of the Research Preoperative anxiety scale/level Data Collection Tools Patient Information Form, VAS-A and a smart wristband with stress level measurement feature will be used to collect data. Form-1. Patient Information Form: It is a form consisting of sociodemographic questions created by the researchers. Form-2. Visual Anxiety Scale (VAS-A): The Numerical Anxiety Severity Scale consists of a horizontal line that begins with the expression 0 or no anxiety and ends with the expression 100 or severe anxiety. The patient is asked to choose the number that best describes the pain, between 0 and 100, by showing the scale. The result of the scale was evaluated over the arithmetic mean (Carr et al 2005; Kindler et al 2000). Smart Wristband: A smart wristband with photoplethysmography (PPG) feature that detects and reports stress-related changes will be used. After assessing whether the data fit the normal distribution with the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, if the data fit the normal distribution, parametric tests (Single Sample t-Test, One- and Multi-Way Analysis of Variance, Spearman's Correlation Analysis); if the data do not fit the normal distribution, non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskall Wallis Test, Friedman Test, Pearson's Correlation Analysis) will be used. Mean, standard deviation and percentage distribution methods will be used in the descriptive analysis of the data. The power of the sample will be calculated with the post hoc analysis to be made.

Here, we sequenced three mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, cytochrome b, and the control region) for four Rieppeleon samples and 35 samples of other members of the squamate branch of the amniote tree from GenBank. We conducted phylogenetic analyses on the concatenated dataset (n = 94) including other rieppeleontid and squamate sequences retrieved from GenBank (n = 18) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ML), Maximum Parsimony (MP), Distance (neighbor joining and unweighted pair\u2010group method with arithmetic mean), and Bayesian estimation. For the three mitochondrial genes, we sequenced an additional 10 Rieppeleon samples and compared two methods of DNA extraction: the standard phenol/chloroform method, and a magnetic bead\u2010based method for DNA extraction. Both methods consistently produced high\u2010quality DNA samples, and the magnetic bead\u2010based protocol decreased the amount of time required for extraction by roughly 50%. Sequencing of all three mitochondrial markers produced a well\u2010resolved tree with strong bootstrap support. Members of the family Rieppeleontidae are well\u2010supported as sister to geckos (Squamata: Gekkota). The genus Rieppeleon is sister to Angolacerta (Squamata), and therefore, to Rieppeleontidae. Both the MP, neighbor joining, and NJ analyses of the concatenated data support the grouping of Rieppeleon as the basal group of geckos. The DNJ and UPGMA results do not completely agree with the rest of the results. Overall, our results show increased resolution within the Rieppeleontidae and increased phylogenetic stability, with strong support for both Rieppeleon as the basal group for Geckos and the family Rieppeleontidae as the sister clade to Geckos. <EOD> Rheumatoid factors: past, present and future.\nRheumatoid factors (RFs) are autoantibodies against the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G. The detection of circulating RFs, originally in the late 1960s, was a pioneering step towards identifying autoantibodies. RFs are found in 60% to 80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and are associated with severe joint damage. In addition to their utility as a diagnostic aid, RFs represent a unique model to investigate B-cell memory. In this review, we will describe the use of RFs as diagnostic and prognostic markers for rheumatoid arthritis, the generation of naturally occurring RFs during aging, development and the immunomodulatory potential of RFs. RFs have the potential to serve as surrogate markers to define and treat dysregulated humoral immunity in autoimmune disorders. This will guide the development and testing of novel therapies. <EOD> Fatal Pasteurella multocida pneumonia following traumatic dental injury.\nA 15-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department after sustaining a traumatic dental injury at a hockey practice while wearing a full face shield.

        "summary": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axon damage. Affecting approximately 2.5 million individuals around the world and seen mostly in young adults, MS can cause different levels of disability in functional activities, cause limitations in social and professional life, and impair quality of life. Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that develops on the basis of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Nutritional habits and physical activity are important environmental factors. These can be effective in the course of MS and change the quality of life. Compatibility of nutrition with the Mediterranean diet and providing adequate physical activity may be beneficial in increasing physical and mental well-being in general, and therefore the quality of life of the person.\nIn our country, there is not enough information about the ongoing nutritional habits and physical activity levels of MS patients in their daily lives, and quality of life studies are limited. Our limited knowledge on these issues narrows the possibility of movement in an area that can be corrected in MS patients and thus have a positive impact on their quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters.",

Materials and Methods:Records of 672 patients diagnosed with renal cell cancer were examined. The revised AJCC TNM, the old American Cancer Society, and new AJCC staging systems were compared. Results:Age, gender, presenting symptom, and past smoking status were not significant independent prognostic factors. A stage II renal cell carcinoma patient was 50% less likely to have died compared with a patient in a higher disease stage. An overall survival (OS) time of 16.9 months was found to be the threshold separating prognosis into good and bad categories, with survival of 17 months or less representing \u201cnot a good prognosis.\u201d The new AJCC TNM staging system improved discrimination compared with the old American Cancer Society staging. The AJCC TNM system yielded improved prognostic discrimination compared with the old staging system. The AJCC, TNM predicted an overall 5-year survival rate of 65% (95% CI, 61.7\u201368.3%). The new staging system was more predictive of survival than the old American Cancer Society staging system, and the revised AJCC appeared most useful in clinical studies by categorizing a sizeable group of patients (stage II) at low risk compared with the other 2 classifications. Conclusions:The most significant change of the 1997 AJCC TNM staging system was the reduction of the number of groups from four to three based on tumor size and the addition of nodal status as a criterion for T stage. The revised AJCC staging system provides a more clinically useful prognostic classification for patients with renal cell carcinoma. <EOD> FDA Drug Approvals, Mechanism of Actions, and Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Pain: Part 2.\nChronic pain is a significant medical problem in this country and worldwide. Recent national efforts, including the National Pain Strategy, have called for changes in the way chronic pain management is approached. One part of these efforts emphasizes the development of new therapies for chronic pain via randomized controlled trials leading to regulatory approval for these new therapies. This article (part 2 of a 3-part series) describes the FDA drug approvals and mechanism of actions for therapies developed to meet these goals during the period 2013 to the present. A brief comment on pain medication formulations approved between 2010 and 2012, not covered in part 1 of this series, is also included. The FDA approved 43 new therapies for chronic pain from March 2013 through November 2021. Most approvals were for products containing opioids (n = 17), gabapentin-containing (n = 6), and melatonin-containing formulations (n = 4). The mechanisms of action for each of these new approaches has been described in part 1 of this series. Although a review of the literature suggests that many patients with chronic pain who receive these new therapies will have relief, there is currently very limited evidence demonstrating long-term effects on the opioid and other substance use disorders, nonaddiction drug use, and mental health disorders that complicate chronic pain management and often drive continued demand for new therapies. Therefore, this third part of this series focuses on therapies for chronic pain that are currently in development. <EOD> Fertilization of maturing oocytes stimulates glucose transport via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in pig oocytes.\nReproductive systems have adapted to the ovarian cycle in a way that facilitates the resumption of meiosis and the transition to early embryogenesis.

While clinical symptoms are considered dopaminergic, cortical mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we used fMRI to investigate the neural substrates of tic generation in TS before and after pharmacologically modulated states. Twenty-three adults with TS and age-matched controls were scanned during a tactile finger localizer task, followed by two 10-min tasks to evaluate the relationship between tics and the cortical motor network. Subjects tapped their fingertips during a simple buttonbox finger-tapping task (FT) and were asked to withhold tics when possible. Control subjects showed only somatosensory responses to finger stimulation. Twice as many (n = 650) tics occurred in the FT (Ft) as in the withholding task (without tics: Wt). TS subjects showed bilateral fMRI activation of the primary somatosensory areas (S1) corresponding to the tic locations, with only one subject displaying activation of the secondary somatosensory areas (S2). Tics occurring in S1 during Ft activated bilateral motor cortex (M1), whereas tics occurring in S2 during the withdrawal state (Wt) failed to generate M1 activity. The data suggest that generation of TS tics occurs in sensorimotor cortical areas and that the transition of a somatosensory state into an active motor act is cortically regulated.\n\n# Introduction\nTourette syndrome (1-2% of the population   The Tourette syndrome and other phenomenology of motor 26, Comings   is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the upper and lower extremities   Tic disorders: clinical presentation in a tertiary referral sample, Packer     Diagnosis and management of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and other 29..., Cavanna   with motor and vocal tics as its most prominent feature   The tics, voice, and behaviours (TVB) scale: assessing tic-associated behaviours across 378..., Robertson  .

        "summary": "An overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by frequent en nightly voiding, small bladder capacity and the occurrence of sudden urge to void, with or without urinary incontinence. The prevalence of OAB with bothersome complaints is around 11% in women and 9% in men with an increasing incidence with age. OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed. Depending on the patient's characteristics and the physician's preference intravesical injections of Botox or the implantation of a sacral neuromodulator (SNM) can be considered.\nBoth options are equal and effective, but many individual differences exist in preference. Regarding outcome, some factors have been described to prefer one therapy above the other, for example in case of concomitant fecal incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections,\u2026 The personal preference of doctors and patients has been investigated, but currently no study has focused on therapy preference in a culturally and linguistic divers (CALD) population. The latter broadly describes a population with ethnical, cultural, religious and/or language characteristics and is a general accepted measure of diversity.\nIn the current study, the investigators aim to describe the different (dis)advantages of both second line treatments for OAB in a discrete choice experiment. The study population will consist of a diverse group of patients with OAB from different hospitals. The goal is to investigate if CALD patients make a different choice in treatment and what factors contribute to that decision in order to provide more tailored information regarding the treatment options in the future. Taking a patient's context into account in the shared decision making between a patient and physician increases therapy compliance and satisfaction of the chosen treatment.\nThe total questionnaire will consist out of general demographic info, the EQ-5D, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)-OAB and the discrete choice questionnaire in which patients make a choice between two fictional treatment options consisting of a combination of different therapy characteristics.

This paper aimed to provide more information on how a diverse cultural population with OAB rate different OAB treatment methods. A total of 101 patients with OAB filled out questionnaires, a discrete choice experiment, and 1-on-1 interviews. The results showed that a diverse population tends to dislike therapies that do not provide long-lasting improvement. They are also more receptive to side effects and would opt for less invasive treatment options if quality of life was improved.\n\nBackground\n============\nOveractive Bladder (OAB) can be described as an increased urge to urinate that is accompanied by urine leakage, and/or urgency and frequency. Symptoms of overactive bladder can be very disruptive to an individual\u2019s daily activities leading to high costs and poorer quality of life (QOL) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), OAB is defined as urinary discomfort perceived to be related to an overactive, bladder. OAB can affect both men and women at all ages, although it is more commonly found in the elderly. Worldwide, the prevalence of OAB in adults has been calculated to be 16% while prevalence in the elderly has been calculated to be 30% .\n\nManagement of OAB consists of many treatment options including conservative therapies, antimuscarinics, beta agonists, urethral bulking agents, beta mimetic agents, and neuromodulation (sacral neuromodulation, SNM). Currently, botulinum toxin (botulinum A toxin) (onabotulinum toxin A (ONA)) is used as a second-line treatment for OAB . Botulinum toxin is thought to work by blocking presynaptic calcium channels as a result of which bladder contractions are limited . This paper aims to explore to examine the influence that diversity and demographics have upon how a CALD community rates OAB",

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

'Serious Game', an abbreviation of 'Serious Game', means: Game, i.e. a digital entertainment application, but this is a game for educational purposes, i.e. it has a clear purpose, more than just fun.\n\n### What's the difference between serious games and non-educational games?\nSerious games differ from non-educational games in several points. A serious game is not only entertaining, but also brings to our attention an important content.\n\n### How serious games differ from normal software?\nThe software is a set of instructions (or programs) that allows you to control the computer, to change the state of the computers and the information contained within it. These programs are designed to enable us to do certain things. If the software performs a certain function then it is called an APPLICATION. An application uses specific resources such as file systems, web services, access to databases, memory, etc. An APPLICATION is not simply a program.\n\n### What are the most popular game genres?\nOne of the best known genres is the Action genre, in which is included an entire line of sub-genres, called the Action Adventure genre or Action-RPG. The most popular genres, in the following order, are:\n* Action\n* Adventure\n* RPG\n* Arcade\n\nHow to cite this Text\n==============\n\nText citation @article by @author, @authors, and @authors\n\nReferences\n==============\n <EOD> Antithrombotic and antiplatelet effect of T-786, a synthetic anti-inflammatory compound.\nT-786 (2-({3--2-propenyl}amino)benzoate dihydrochloride), a synthetic anti-inflammatory compound, was studied for antithrombotic and antiplatelet activities. At a dose level of 10 mg/kg, T-786 showed inhibitory effects on blood platelet activity with dose-dependence in rats. In addition, T-786 (200-600 mg/kg, p.o.) given once daily for 7 consecutive days showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on thrombosis induced by atherogenic diet, as compared with controls. These results suggest that T-786 might inhibit pathways of thrombogenesis, including blood platelet activity and thrombosis. <EOD> A comparison of the efficacy and safety profile of two fixed-dose combination regimens in treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a multiphase, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and safety profile of two fixed-dose combination regimens containing tacrine (18 mg), donepezil (10 mg) and galantamine (6.25 mg) in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA total of 566 patients taking placebo throughout the 24-week acute treatment period were re-randomized to either once daily active treatment of T-DAG (n: 180), AD-P (n: 20), AD-DAG (n: 69), or placebo (n: 275) for 32 weeks, where the dosage regimens remained unchanged and the efficacy was evaluated at Week 56.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients in the T-DAG, AD-P, AD-DAG, and placebo group were administered active treatment for a mean period of 60.4, 12.3, 61.4, and 111.7 days, respectively.

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

And to analyze its evolution over the last decade. To evaluate the factors potentially involved in this evolution.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nObservational descriptive study of the frequency hospitalizations in the pediatric emergency department of the General University Hospital of Albacete, a third level hospital in the province of Castilla La Mancha (Spain) in the period of January 1944 to December 2003, that is, the entire period for which hospitalization statistics have been recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe number of pediatric hospitalizations in the emergency room increased from 36,980 to 40,804 (+4.58%). This increase is largely attributable to the increase in the proportion of foreigners in the pediatric population served from 6.87 to 15.45% (+201%) and in hospitalizations to the emergency unit from 0.07 to 2.00%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe increase in the number of foreign-born children in our department has contributed greatly to the increase in the number of hospitalizations.

Cytochrome (CYP) 1, a superfamily of P450 isoforms in CYP1 gene family, has been implicated in metabolism and detoxification of carcinogens. The CYP1A1 gene is related with susceptibility to lung, breast, esophagus, kidney, colorectal and bile duct carcinogenesis. Our study aimed at evaluating the association of two polymorphisms in the 5 CYP1A1 gene (-6235G>A and -4464C>G) with HNC risk in the Iranian population. A total of 124 HNC patients and 189 cancer-free controls were recruited. Genotyping of variant CYP1A1 at -6235G>A and -4464C>G was determined by polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The genotype frequencies of -6235G>A and -4464C>G polymorphisms of CYP1A1 were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group. There was no relationship between CYP1A1 genotypes and the risk of HNC in this study. The -6235AA (p=0.025) and -6235GG (p=0.020) genotypes revealed higher risk of HNC in recessive models after adjustment for confounding factors. But the -6235, -4464 polymorphisms were not found to be associated with HNC risk in codominant, dominant and allelic models. This is the first study to demonstrate the association of two polymorphisms (rs1048943 and rs4646903) in the 5 CYP1A1 gene with the risk of HNC in Iran.

With GaN grown on GaAs substrates using molecular-beam epitaxy, a series of thin-films and layer structures have been developed, and their optical properties have been investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry. It was found that at low coverage, GaN layers have lower effective refractive indices and larger effective optical band gaps than those of thin-films. The effect of growth time and substrate temperature on the structural and optical properties of thin-films and layers was also investigated. The optical band gap of GaN thin-films and layers was investigated in terms of two-band theories with the measured optical constant. In both GaN films and layers, the effective biaxial strain was calculated to be close to -2% and less than one-half of the GaN bulk strain. <EOD> Reaching out to adolescents: an outpatient program for substance abusers",

Fistulae complicating diverticulitis are the result of a localized perforation into adjacent viscera, and occur in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease[2]. The types of fistulae include colovesical, colovaginal, colotubal, coloenteric, and colocutaneous fistulae[3]. Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely, accounting for 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease[4]. Herein we describe a case of a fistula connecting the sigmoid colon with the left flank-lower lumbar area, due to diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon[5].\nA new over-the-scope clip system, called OTSC (Ovesco Endoscopy, T\u00fcbingen, Germany), appeared on the market about 3 years ago[6]. The system consists of a nitinol clip loaded at the tip of the endoscope that can capture a large amount of tissue and compress the lesion until healed[7]. Results from animal models and initial clinical use support the efficacy of OTSC closure in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding; its role in the management of iatrogenic perforations in humans is less defined, and reports on its use in treating colorectal postsurgical leaks and fistulas are anecdotal [8].

Intubation was performed with 7 lm of cuffed tube and anesthesia (N(2)O + O(2)). Resistance to airflow through a model of the larynx and plasma levels of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) were measured before and during laryngoscopy and intubation. There were no significant differences in laryngeal resistance or plasma E and NE between the two groups of animals. Thus, although glucocorticoid-induced enhancement of the stress response attenuated the development of myosis, these data suggest that laryngoscopy and intubation is not associated with the same stress response that can be identified using other stressors. <EOD> Cranial ultrasound as a prognostic marker of neurological status in premature infants.\nUNLABELLED\nCranial ultrasound (CUS) enables the detection of the primary injury of the brain in preterm infants as well as the assessment of brain development in early postnatal age.

Milk kefir is a traditional food product made with water kefir grains (KGs) and milk. The KG mixture contains a variety of indigenous milk acidifying bacteria and yeast. The fermentation of milk kefir is a complex process involving multiple species of microorganisms including yeasts and bacteria. Bacterial species that have been isolated from milk kefir include Micrococcus lactis, Streptococcus macedonicus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Lacticaseibacillus kefiranofaciens. The Lacticaseibacillus kefiranofaciens (L. kefiranofaciens) is the dominant heterofermentative bacterium in milk kefirand is considered to be the principal strain contributing to the overall fermentation of kefir. It is well known for its ability to produce an interesting biopolymer called kefiran. Kefiran is an extracellular polysaccharide that can be produced by fermentation of L. kefiranofaciens by lactose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and milk powder. Interestingly, kefiran is also considered to be a safe food additive approved by the European Commission. Lacticaseibacillus kefiranofaciens is considered a potential probiotic. It plays an important role in the microbial community of milk kefir. This strain has also been shown to produce 1,3-d-glucose with excellent bifidogenic activity. In addition, it is also used for immune modulation, improving intestinal cellular immunity. Therefore, it is not surprising that L. kefiranofaciens has been studied extensively in the academic research community, and this strain has been added as a starter culture by many dairies to improve milk fermentation in order to produce fresh kefir-like drink products.\nMilk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity has attracted our interest. We have previously reported that milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity could be used as the carrier to encapsulate probiotic bacteria, and the microencapsulated probiotic bacteria had good survivability in milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity. In addition, L. kefiranofaciens was the dominant strain of milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity, and its growth was not inhibited at pH = 4.00 and alkalinity = 0.30%, indicating that milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity was stable during fermentation, and the bacteria in milk kefir maintained excellent viability. The fermentation process was a complicated biological process in which physiological adaptation mechanisms of the bacteria in milk kefir was an essential step during the adaptation to low pH and low alkalinity. Adaptation of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens JF 293 (LkJF293, hereinafter referred to as Lk) strain from milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity, was found to be an essential requirement to maintain the normal survivability of Lk and maintain the production of kefiran in milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity. Physiological adaptation mechanisms of Lk adapting to low pH and low alkalinity could be considered during the fermentation process of milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity, which can be explored, such as proteomics, metabolomics,",

This heterogeneity is evidenced, for example, by the cardiovascular score (ARISCAT, EuroSCORE, SAPS, and SOAP, among others) that includes variables with different degrees of severity to classify patients according to their risk of death in hospital. This classification can be adopted by the professional to better guide the plan of care2,34. Thus, it is possible to identify patients whose prognosis may be precarious and therefore in need of greater care, monitoring, and resources4. The complexity of these patients is not exclusive to the surgical approach but also occurs in spontaneously ventilated patients. The knowledge of this aspect will help in the planning and the proper allocation of human and material resources.\n\n# BACKGROUND\nCardiac surgical patients, among others, are admitted with varying severity of injury. This fact can interfere in the postoperative clinical evolution, in the use of resources by the health team, and in the quality of care5.\n\nMany instruments are used to assess the risk of death in the hospitalization process6. Among these instruments, the ARISCAT (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Disease Classification System) stands out as it has good accuracy and has been recommended for use in adults in different centers7, being among those that has been validated by the American College of Cardiologists and European Society of cardiology8,9. Thus, ARISCAT has been able to identify risk factors for the survival of patients in general and has shown good reproducibility, with an accuracy of 85% for patients with cardiac disease10. The EuroSCORE 11 may also be indicated since it has an excellent performance in the prediction of the risk for the death of patients treated by cardiac or cardiac surgery. In this case, the mortality estimate in patients with a risk greater than 6.56% is lower than the observed mortality, indicating a positive predictive value. This parameter can facilitate the decision to maintain or discharge the patients12. In addition, the SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score), which assesses the severity of the disease and may be linked to the prognosis of the patient13, has good accuracy, having been one of the factors considered in the selection of a model more suitable for the Brazilian reality14. The SOAP (Several Organ Assessment Score) is also a valid tool for the evaluation of cardiac patients who require surgery, having undergone several validations and an accuracy greater than 84%15. All these tools are validated and can be used as a predictor of the patients' risk of death without hospitalization16.\n\nIn addition to the risk of death, other factors directly or indirectly interfere with the prognostic evolution of the patient, such as gender, age, and previous comorbidities17, being related to longer hospital stays and greater use of medications and resources18. Aging may indicate frailty and loss of physiological reserves, contributing to loss of functionality and greater risk of death19. Moreover, being aged 60+ years or having two or more comorbidities was associated with six-month mortality in cardiac surgery, which reinforces the impact of these variables on prognosis20.\n\nThe severity of the disease also needs to be evaluated according to its impact on daily activities, considering that the degree of restriction on the activities of daily living of a patient can also estimate whether he is at risk for death21. After considering these parameters and combining them with the previous ones, the prognostic evaluation can be obtained, which can guide the choice of clinical and/or surgical care.\n\nDiseases such as lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary disease, and diseases not yet identified in the heart and lung are some of the main causes of mortality worldwide22,23.

        "summary": "Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer generally have favorable outcomes and how well they do depends on the specific details about the patient and their cancer. How well they do isn't as related to the kinds of treatment they get. However, there are significant side effects for the various types of treatments they may get. Because these patients generally have favorable outcomes no matter the kind of treatment, reducing side effects should be a priority when choosing their treatment.\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate whether a new blood test called a Circulating Tumor DNA test (ctDNA test) can decrease the number of people that require radiation after surgery. This blood test is often elevated in people when they are diagnosed with head and neck cancer. There are studies that show that cancer most often returns when this blood test is positive after treatment. This study will test patients' blood before and after surgery. In cases where the test is negative after surgery, people on the study will not receive radiation unless they are considered high risk based on surgery findings. The hope is that radiation and its potential side effects can be limited to only people that need the treatment.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] <EOD> .\nWe studied the usefulness of a single contrast CT of the chest, stomach, lungs and mediastinum (C/SCT) as a screening procedure for detection of gastric cancer in patients in which a stomach screening test result was \"abnormal\" by the examination of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, stool occult blood, serum gastrin and pepsinogen/pancreatic polypeptide, simultaneously. Of the study population of 32 patients, 7 cases of gastric cancer, 5 cases of gastrointestinal ulcers and 4 cases of gastric ulcers without gastric cancer were proved by the examination after C/SCT. This examination gave a false positive result in 8 cases and a false negative result in 4 cases. The false negative cases were in the upper two-thirds of the gastric body or in the stomach without pylorus. C/SCT failed to give a true positive result in 8 out of 7 cases of gastric cancer located in the lower one-third and in the distal antrum. Although 8 false positive cases showed either a history or clinical features of gastric ulcer and gastric erosion, C/SCT proved all the cases to be ulcers without malignancy. In conclusion, C/SCT is useful as a screening procedure for the early detection of gastric cancer particularly in the early stage of gastric cancer, and to distinguish between gastric ulcers with malignancy from those without malignancy. <EOD> Effects of a modified intravenous glucose tolerance test.\nSerum immunoreactive insulin and glucose values following a modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were evaluated in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. When the results were compared to those of a standard IVGTT, the test was found in diabetics with elevated fasting blood glucose, but with normal postprandial levels, to be more accurate in diagnosis. In patients with normal fasting levels and borderline postprandial levels the procedure was less reliable. The test was also more helpful in distinguishing between diabetics and patients with thyrotoxicosis. Patients who had a history positive for diabetes and were found to be without abnormalities on the oral glucose tolerance test were tested with the modified IVGTT; in these cases, the test did not alter the diagnosis. We conclude that the modified IVGTT is a reliable diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus and may be best used for distinguishing diabetics from patients with thyrotoxicosis. <EOD> Dental trauma during pediatric dental management\n\nObjective: To evaluate the prevalence of dental injury among children attending a specialized pediatric dentistry clinic at Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, and to analyze the etiologic and related aspects involved in these injuries. Study Design: Transversal observational study Design/Period of Study: This was a historical prospective study conducted during six months period and included 110 children (age 1 to 15 years) attended the pediatric dentistry from the Clinic of Dentistry Clinics of Campus Botucatu of S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP). The injury was classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria as having occurred during oral rehabilitation as \"treatment dental injury.'' The following aspects were analyzed: gender, age, reason for the consultation and treatment procedures involving dental trauma. Data were analyzed descriptively and by Chi-square test considering p< 0.05 as significant for the analysis. Results: Of the 110 children, 51.81% presented crown fracture, 43.63% had lost the tooth, and 4 children lost their entire dentition. Conclusion: The results suggest the importance of the proper implementation to avoid pediatric dental trauma, and the importance of the pediatric dentist in preventing dental trauma during dental procedures.\n\n# Introduction\nDental injuries commonly occur during sports, traffic accidents, falls and domestic accidents, and pediatric dental care services may be a cause of dental trauma 1-14 .\nAccording to   Traumatic injuries to the permanent incisors, a retrospective endodontic and traumatic injury survey..., Mendoza   , most dental injuries",

        "model_output": "[/INST] [SECTION_END]\n <EOD> Hidden Markov Model Based Method for Recognizing Patterns in Movement Data: Application for Studying Motor Adaptation\nMotor adaptability is vital to human performance across a wide variety of activities, and the ability to measure and examine behavioral changes due to adaptive processes is of paramount interest. To this end, we propose a method to automatically construct movement patterns and identify these movement patterns from the kinematic data of a movement. This method utilizes a hidden Markov model (HMM) for detecting movement patterns. We have previously demonstrated this method to be useful in elucidating the processes behind motor learning. In this paper, we investigate whether the method can also be used to detect a priori known movement patterns. Using a simulated data set, we show that the proposed method can detect the desired movement patterns and identify the location of these patterns in the movement cycle. <EOD> Phylogeny and Character Evolution in a Large Genetic Network: the Glycolytic Pathway\nMost genetic pathways have a hierarchical organization with enzymes forming different clusters. This results, among others, in a large number of alternative routes, which are not compatible with each other in every step. Our hypothesis is that these incompatibilities have imposed evolutionary constraints on these pathways in the direction of a small number of different and specific patterns. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a phylogenetic method suitable for analysing these patterns for metabolic pathways. We used the glycolytic pathway for our study. The method is based on the identification of the different routes and on the study of their phylogenetic distribution. A number of interesting and specific patterns were found, which could not be identified before by conventional analyses. The obtained tree contained a large number of strongly supported monophyletic groups for reactions that appeared to have several alternative routes. Additionally, groups were found for reactions that according to current knowledge do not appear to have alternative routes. Some of these patterns were correlated with structural features in the catalysing proteins. We thus conclude that structural features in the catalysing proteins have played an important role in determining the different glycolytic pathways. <EOD> .\nThe aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of different methods of chemoprophylaxis in patients undergoing surgery of the lower jaws with bone defects, followed by maxillary osteoplasty. The material comprised 136 patients with mandible defects of the segmental atrophy or resorbed form treated in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin between years 2005-2017. Bone defects were divided into two groups: group I - 44 patients with mandible defects and group II - 92 patients with maxilla defects. To reduce the risk of infection during and after surgery 20 mg/kg of clindamycin preoperatively was introduced to the patients. 132 patients were administered an appropriate postoperative 2 grams dose of clindamycin after confirming bone graft availability during surgery. The remaining patients were prescribed postoperative antibiotic therapy. A postoperative antibiotic treatment and chemotherapy regimen depended on whether patients received surgery at the place of residence or at the University Clinic. After performing an in vitro assessment of the activity, the patients were divided into three groups. In the first group (I and II) 100% of patients received antibiotic therapy, and in the second group (III) 83.3% of patients received clindamycin in a postoperative dose of 2 grams daily. After comparing these three groups, the first two showed low rate of infection, while infection infection occurred in 25% of patients in the third group. Antibiotic therapy significantly affects the reduction of postoperative inflammation and infection rates. <EOD> Increased expression of microtubule-associated protein kinase in the human colon: correlation with p53 expression.\nThe present study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of human colon cancer.

POTENTIAL COMMON MOLECULAR MARKERS FOR HUMAN GIARDIA DUE TO IN-SIDE OUT MODEL.\nThe goal was to study correlations between genetic variation of antigenic determinants on the cell surface lipopolysaccharide of Gl. intestinalis (LPS) and biochemical markers (alpha-glucosidase) in the urine. A total of 60 strains of Gl. intestinalis were isolated from the patients with giardiasis and from the immunocompetent healthy donors. Molecular typing of 42 out of 60 strains using the RFLP-PCR method with the restriction endonucleases ApaI and PI-SceI showed predominance of HGI and HGII subtypes among the isolates (85.7 and 14.3%, respectively). All 60 strains belonged to genotypes 10 and 9 of subtypes HGI and HGII, respectively. Lumineux immunoenzyme assay detected alpha glucosidase in the urine of all 25 patients examined.

A systematic review of the pooled data of 33 studies, representing 4,090,411 patients (361,660 deaths) from the World Bank data set, found that the total case rate of 4% is not enough to lead to death. The rate of patients who died of severe or fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like symptoms was 3% only with a mortality rate due to a critical illness of 4% and fatal illness of <1%. As the outbreak of COVID-19, we can expect more deaths due to the virus. Indeed, the mortality of this condition is not the only cause of death and many patients died with a critical illness due to the severe respiratory and renal failure. Indeed, the ARDS is the one of the major causes of death. In addition, a major cause of death in this outbreak is the pre-existing comorbidity in the adult population who was aged over 60 years, especially with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. In this letter to the editor, we ask our colleagues to investigate the rate of cancer from the global data set. These results will increase the knowledge of the impact of comorbid COVID-19 on cancer patients who are suffering from severe pneumonia, ARDS, and multiple organ failure.\nAlthough some studies have demonstrated that cancer patients show an increased possibility of positive COVID-19 cases and complications, there is no enough evidence to confirm that the COVID-19 may increase the cancer mortality rate. There may be multiple reasons for the increased incidence of cancer with COVID-19, such as (1) the immunosuppressive activity of the chemo-and radiation-induced hematopoeitic",

        "summary": "In intensive care unit, dyspnea, the distressing and fearful awareness of breathing, is frequent and harmful. To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

Types of measures and techniques used 1.1. Dyspnea The presence of dyspnea will be defined by a positive response to at least 2 of the following questions: Do you feel out of breath?  ; Do you feel a lack of air?  ; Is your breathing difficult?  ; Are you having trouble breathing? . The intensity of dyspnea will be measured by VAS-D in communicative patients. Dyspnea VAS will be used to define patients with clinically significant dyspnea (D-VAS > 30 mm) or non-clinically significant dyspnea (D-VAS \u2264 30 mm). The measurement of dyspnea by the MV-RDOS scale will be performed in all patients and clinically significant dyspnea will be strongly suspected by the value of the MV-RDOS \u2265 2.6. 1.2. Ventilatory variability The variability will be measured from raw airway flow (reference method) and using a force sensor integrated in a chest strap. The good correlation between the measurement of ventilation by a chest strap and the reference measurement has been demonstrated in healthy volunteers and in obese subjects on all the components of the spirogram: VT, TI, TE, TTOT, VT/TI and TI/TTOT. Two variability indices will be measured: The coefficient of variation (CV) of chest expansion, after pre-processing by an artifact elimination algorithm, per period of 5 minutes and displayed continuously as a trend curve on a tablet connected to the sensor Frequency analysis of the respiratory signal by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) over periods of 5 minutes and calculation of the H1/DC component. 1.3. Surface electromyography of inspiratory extra-diaphragmatic muscles The surface EMG of the extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles (Alae Nasi and Parasternals) will be collected via self-adhesive surface electrodes. Bilateral recording of the parasternal muscles will be performed by a pair of electrodes placed in the second intercostal space near the sternum. The recording of the respiratory movements, airway flow, EMG and ECG will be made at the same time, per 5-minute period, 5 minutes before the start of the weaning test and during the 30-minute weaning test. 1.4. Result of the ventilatory bondage test (SBT) Failure of SBT is defined by the appearance and persistence for at least 5 minutes of one of the following criteria: SpO2 \u2264 90% or PaO2 \u2264 50mmHg with FiO2 \u2265 50%, PaCO2 > 50 mm Hg, pH < 7.32, respiratory rate > 35/min, systolic blood pressure > 180mmHg or < 90mmHg, pulse pressure > 60mmHg. Recording of respiratory movements, airway flow, EMG and ECG will be performed per 5-minute period, 5 min before the start of the weaning test during the 40 minutes of spontaneous breathing trial and 10 minutes afterwards. 2. Sequence of experimental steps Patients will be placed in a ventilatory weaning test with 0 cmH2O of pressure support and 0 cmH2O of end-expiratory pressure. A quantification of dyspnea will be performed for all patients using the MV-RDOS and EMG score during the 40 minutes, both on the 10th and the 30th minutes and 30 minutes after the end of SBT.\n\nSummary: [/INST] Your task is to create a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the provided clinical trial document.

        "summary": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the commonest nerve compression syndrome in the upper limbs, and carpal tunnel decompression is one of the most prevalent upper limb surgical interventions. Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients. That is why we conducted the present study to present our experience with the modified mini-incision technique and compare its outcomes to the conventional open approach.",

We have excluded patients with inflammatory joint disease or gout, or with psychiatric disease. The diagnosis was made on the basis of EMG and/or NCS studies with patients who reported symptoms lasting more than 3 months. Eligible patients were randomly assigned by a computer generated program to one of the three operation groups. The first 6 subjects in each group were randomly allocated to the conventional group and the last 4 subjects allocated to the miniincision group. The rest of the patients in each group were allocated to the mini-incision group (mini-incision group= 19 subjects, conventional group = 14 subjects). A special guide was prepared for the conventional group, while a special metal guide was prepared for the mini-incision group. A conventional longitudinal scar was achieved through an incision length of less than 2cm. In the cases of the mini-incision group, a special guide was placed above the flexor wrist crease and a vertical incision was performed. Subsequently, incision was made in the tendon sheaths. The tourniquet was deflated and the median nerve and surrounding tissues were released as wide as possible beneath a special guide.

While AOT has shown effectiveness in various populations, its application in MCI is understudied. This study aims to investigate the effects of AOT on cognition, upper and lower limb function, daily activities, gait, and balance in MCI patients.

An occupational therapist and psychologist participated in the screening of potential patients.\nAll data were collected during the telephone interview prior to recruitment.\n\n\nPatient Inclusion:\nA total of 16 patients entered the experimental group, of which three dropped out of the program. The cause was mainly due to a failure by the physiotherapist to perform the session, failure to remember the day the session was scheduled and failure to show up to the scheduled activity. The reasons for not attending the sessions included forgetfulness since most of the patients were elderly, and in those cases in which a therapist did not perform the session, the patient did not participate or attend the session.\nThe experimental group (with cognitive impairment) was made up of 13 patients, and three were excluded from the study. Patients with cognitive impairment are characterized as mild (24-26 on the MoCA) and not mild (23 or lower on the MoCA). One patient was excluded from the intervention after being randomized, since she was then identified as having mild cognitive impairment (MoCA of 24 points) (25), which did not match the selection criteria. Three patients were absent during the sessions because they forget the date. For that, they should have received a reminder call before the session. But unfortunately, that day, they could not receive a call.\nIn the control group (cognitively intact), nine patients were excluded because they met the cognitively impairment selection criteria. The MoCA was used as a screening test, which identifies patients classified as having mild cognitive impairment (24 or lower on the MoCA), while the rest of the patients were classified as having cognitive intact (25 points or higher on the MoCA), this was used in the selection criteria.

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine",

The fibrotic and sclerotic scar tissue formed as part of the healing process of episiotomies may cause pain and other infections. Therefore, episiotomy is associated with sexual dysfunction due to the painful sexual intercourse, chronic pain and infections and scarring in long term. 40% of the patients complain about persisted dyspareunia after 6 months of delivery. Genital pelvic pain/penetration disorders disturb the quality of sexual life of the couple and affect the psychology and wellbeing of the partners. Since, vulva is rich in afferent nerve endings, episiotomy scar healing is associated with pain. Er:YAG laser is a safe option for the treatment of vulvar pain. Er:YAG laser is a non-invasive and nonablative procedure that strengthens the connective tissue in the vaginal wall. It provides controlled thermal energy and causes shrinkage of the collagen fibrils in the vaginal epithelium and lamina propria. It also induces neocollagenesis, elastogenesis and neoangiogenesis by temperature change. With minimum damage to the peripheral tissue, the viable cells in the target tissue react to this temperature change by expressing heat shock proteins (HSP). Then, HSP increases the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular epithelial growth factor which induce neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. Therefore, the thermal energy stored in the vaginal wall induces proliferation of the epithelium which is rich in glycogen, neovascularization and collagen production in the lamina propria. Er:YAG laser is also an effective modality to treat the scar tissue formed after the mediolateral episiotomy since it is a matter of functionality and esthetics. By tissue remodeling effect Er:YAG laser will improve the scar tissue of episiotomy and ameliorate the vulvar pain. In this study, the therapeutic effect of Er:YAG laser on the tissue healing of the episiotomy scars and the reduction of vulvar pain.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nTherapeutic Efficacy of Erbium:YAG Laser in Postpartum Patients With Episiotomy Scars in Respect of Genital Pelvic Pain and Scar Tissue Healing: A Randomized Sham-Controlled Prospective Study\n\nConditions\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n\nInclusion Criteria: Adult Female, 18 years of age or older Have given birth in the last 6 months with episiotomy Have vulvar pain and dyspareunia Exclusion Criteria: History of connective tissue disease History of other diseases that can cause vulvar pain (neurological, dermatological, Infectious etc.)\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n\nMinimum Age: 18 Years\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n\nFemale\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n-----------------\nNo\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\n <EOD> Aminothiazole based molecules as multifunctional inhibitors against dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses\n\nIn view of emerging pathogens, particularly Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), drug molecules are needed to stop their proliferation by inhibiting virus replication.

        "summary": "A randomized, controlled, and evaluator-blinded trial will be carried out to investigate the effects of 8 weeks of upper limb somatosensory discrimination therapy compared to an equal dose of motor therapy on sensorimotor outcomes in children and adolescents with spastic unilateral cerebral palsy aged 7 to 15 years old. Additionally, the potential role of clinical and neurological baseline characteristics on treatment response will be explored, including the extent of the brain lesion, age and baseline somatosensory function. The researchers primarily expect that the bimanual performance will improve equally in children and adolescents from both intervention groups, as measured immediately after the intervention has ended. The researchers hypothesize, however, that there will be a better retention effect in children and adolescents that received somatosensory discrimination therapy, resulting in differences between both groups in bimanual performance as measured at 6-months follow-up. The researchers further expect larger improvements in somatosensory function for children and adolescents in the somatosensory discrimination group and this both immediately after the intervention and at 6-month follow-up.",

        "summary": "Sepsis, characterized by severe organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated immune response to infection, is often life-threatening in clinical settings. Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis. Furthermore, we also evaluated the performance of APRI in hypoxic hepatitis and sepsis induced cholestasis (SIC), which are two subtypes of SALD.",

The mother and offspring form a deep emotional and enduring connection over time. Research has shown that the human body has receptors that enable this bond and that the brain develops to enable emotional attachment in the context of the relationship between mother and child. Research shows that a close mother-infant bond has many short-term and long-term effects on offspring. These effects include a healthier pregnancy, lower incidence of child abuse and neglect, lower emotional maladjustment in childhood, lower risk of depression, antisocial behavior and attention deficit disorder in childhood, lower mortality rate, lower body weight, and improved academic performance, among others. Maternal-infant bonding is an important parameter in the newborn, which is also an extremely important parameter in term healthy babies with no major and minor problems after birth. The importance of maternal-infant attachment for the healthy growth of the baby, the prevention of complications and mortality are important public health issues. The concept of bonding is based on attachment theory which was developed in clinical settings where mother and child separation was common . Research has also shown that it is possible to create a close relationship between mother and baby who have not been separated in the first period of life. It is a very common routine procedure for mothers to be separated from their babies in delivery room after delivery. However, when the mother and baby are physically separated, the mother's skin touch affects the baby. The early skin-to-skin postpartum period increases the physical contact between the mother and baby and enhances the bond and attachment in the neonatal period.

Their hypothesis is that they will use deep learning algorithms to find the best spatial-temporal deformation feature space to classify these individuals with chronic myofascial pain as having myofascial pain with latent or active trigger points. The first year will be spent on training, testing, and building upon the image analysis software to classify myofascial pain. In the R61 Phase 2 will begin building and preliminary validating this new biomarker. During the R61 Phase 2 the investigators will use the newly developed biomarkers to predict response to treatment. This work is innovative because of the use of myofascial pain with latent and active trigger points by the ultrasound biomarkers and the multimodal ultrasound image analysis software that builds this image.\n\nThe proposed research focuses on improving diagnostics and response to treatment prediction for people with low back pain, as well as providing a novel toolbox for assessing the spatial-temporal deformation features of the muscle and fascia for use in the clinical trial of patients with low back pain who are not eligible for spinal surgery. In addition, the team will establish a new protocol for deep learning of ultrasound multimodal imaging in a clinical setting - a new innovation that will likely have immediate clinical impact if the proposed studies go successfully. By providing a new method for diagnosing and predicting response to treatment of those with myofascial pain, the team will be able to improve management of chronic myofascial pain and low back pain, which is the number one cause of disability worldwide.

A 121 base pair (bp) stretch between the TATA box -26 and the \u03bc sequence was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene for the transient assay. The direction of the ATG relative to initiator was found to be important in the successful expression. Among the constructs in which the ATG was located in different positions, the plasmids with ATG located between -26 and -62 produced good levels of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase expression whereas the other plasmids express very little. By using the plasmids containing various lengths of DNA between the ATG and \u03bc sequence, it has been found that the transcription of the heterologous gene is optimally supported by a distance between the ATG and \u03bc sequence between 72 and 78 bp. These results suggest that the distance and direction of the ATG relative to start of the initiation of transcription is important for the efficient transcription of human \u03b2-globin gene. <EOD> The Glyoxalases in a Nitrogen-Fixing Endophyte of Wheat Stems, Herbaspirillum seropedicae (SLE-2)\n\nHerbaspirillum seropedicae (SLE-2) is an endophytic bacterium isolated from xylem of wheat stems that fixes nitrogen (N), which is a very toxic metabolite, with great efficiency.

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

In sera selected on the basis of age, sex, and occupation from each of 100 Swedish towns and their environs, complement-fixing antibody for influenza A was very frequent with age and frequency of infection with influenza B increased with increasing age also.

In this article the analysis of loss at this region in gliomas was reported. It was found that loss of heterozygosity occurred in 40% (7 cases) of the analyzed gliomas in two loci: one at the region 9p21.3 (10 markers), and the other at the 9p21.1-9p22.3 region (5 markers). Statistically, the loss of heterozygosity in tumors did not correlate with the grade of malignancy, sex, or age of the patients. The loss of the second allele, when present, was in all cases accompanied by the loss of at least one allele in one of the other chromosomal loci, thus providing the second hit in the genesis of the tumor genome. The loss of heterozygosity detected in these patients may be the result of deletions and/or of allelic homogeneity. Analysis of p53 polymorphism was not done in the patients. Loss of heterozygosity detected in gliomas in this study may be an important event in tumorization of the central nervous system. It is likely but requires to be confirmed that the loss of heterozygosity is linked with 9p21 region. <EOD> Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Phospholipid Membrane Elastic Modes.\nBy means of molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize elastic deformations of a planar bilayer of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipids in their liquid-crystalline state. We analyze two modes that could be detected experimentally by neutron scattering: undulations perpendicular to the bilayer with k=qcos\u03b8=0.15\u00a0\u00c5-1 along the zigzag chains and perpendicular to them along the main chain with the wave vector q=0.25\u00a0\u00c5-1. We calculate elastic constants for the in-plane and out-of-plane modes and obtain the mode shape and the phonon dispersion. The calculations provide quantitative explanation to the measured low-q values found in neutron scattering experiments. The calculated frequencies of the out-of-plane modes are in good agreement with low-q values determined from neutron scattering measurements on a small unilamellar vesicle. The obtained dispersion curves are used to calculate the sound modes of a multilamellar vesicle. In addition, we present the first-ever molecular dynamics simulations of an electromechanical coupling where the electric polarization of a DPPC bilayer is used as an order parameter. <EOD> .\nDetection of myofibrillar proteins in the cytosol was used as a criterion of myocyte destruction within 2-6 h and on day 2 after an acute hypertension-hypercapnea complex.

        "summary": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic disease characterized by an elevation in pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance. The condition most often is rarely detected, and patients frequently suffer symptoms for several years before being appropriately diagnosed. Patients with PH suffer from several symptoms, such as exertional dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, chest pain, fainting\u2026et al. Pulmonary hypertension is an incurable and progressive disease with complex symptoms and treatments. Patients must learn to deal with their unpredictable future and manage the complex treatments associated with severe adverse effects and need significant changes in lifestyle.\nTherefore, it is important to assist patients to develop the ability of symptom management.",
        "model_output": "[/INST]\n-----------------\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)\nThe most common types of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are PH due to pulmonary arteriopathy and PH due to chronic thromboembolic disease.Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) are two rare forms of PAH. The 5-year survival rate for the various PH etiologies reportedly ranges from 67% for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) to 19% for PCH.According to the pulmonary physiology, patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) will have a reduction in exercise capacity and will develop symptoms, most commonly dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, and impaired exercise capacity.The physical limitations due to PH impair daily activities and interpersonal relationships.Pulmonary hypertension has been reported to reduce quality of life ,to worsen emotional states, and to increase mortality and risk of death.Therefore, if patients with pulmonary hypertension receive appropriate care, their prognoses may improve.However, the majority of patients currently have symptoms for several years without receiving adequate assistance . A meta-analysis found that 48% of patients with pulmonary hypertension had never received any treatment .As a relatively rare condition, pulmonary hypertension is difficult to diagnose. Patients are often misdiagnosed with more commonly occurring diseases . Although pulmonary hypertension was first reported in 1958, the number of treatments developed since the late 1980s have been disappointing .Therefore, treatment is often delayed until the patient\u2019s condition has deteriorated to the point that he or she needs to be on long-term home oxygen therapy . Pulmonary hypertension has a mean survival time of 2.8 years . Because of its progressive and deadly nature, pulmonary hypertension has the largest mortality rate among all heart and circulatory diseases .\nPAH has a poor 5-year survival rate of 8.9% and a mortality rate of 0.31%.Therefore, the quality of life for patients with PAH should be optimized. PAH has a negative impact on the quality of life, including the physical domain, emotional domain, and psychological domain.Therefore, health care professionals should offer emotional support and encouragement and strive to improve the patients\u2019 quality of life.The effects of web-based health care programs have been proven in some diseases and have also shown promising effects in PH.A study in 2009 examined the effects of an 8-week PAH self-management program on 141 Chinese female PAH patients.The authors found a significant improvement in pulmonary hypertension symptoms and in depression and anxiety after the web-based health program was implemented.The results indicated that the web-based health care program was acceptable to patients and reduced their levels of depression and anxiety, which are common symptoms of PH. Therefore, we proposed a web-based health program to improve the quality of life in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n# Introduction and background\n\nThis paper intends to design a web-based health care program, a patient-centered, user-friendly tool that is easy to use, is cost-effective and is available to people anywhere with a computer and the Internet. The purpose of the Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Care Program (PAHCP) is to help patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) gain more information about the disease and to provide a better quality of life.\n\n# Pahc\nWeb-based health care programs use the Internet and multimedia devices to provide prevention and care services to remote patients .These programs include Web sites, patient education modules, online care plan information systems, telemedicine, and communication software.To develop a web-based health care program for the PAHCP, three principles should be considered. First, the web-based health care program should include educational modules, a decision and care plan and communication modules. Users can view these modules according to their interests and preferences. Second, the program should help patients to acquire knowledge and self-care skills. Third, the program should be easily accessible, and the interface should allow users to complete the program easily. The web-based health care program should be both convenient and accessible.

        "summary": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a serious rapidly progressive disease of the nervous system. The average survival from the time of diagnosis is two to three years. The patient physical and psychological sufferings in ALS are immense, and apart from Riluzole, there is no effective treatment. Care of advanced ALS have an estimated cost of 4-8 million NOK per year. Perhaps the most challenging topic of ALS care is the decision to extend ventilation support into the stages of disease that require treatment both during day and night. In these cases, treatment is clearly life-sustaining and although quality of life may be maintained, the burden of caregiving imposed upon family or health care workers is huge, regardless of tracheostomy (TIV) or non-invasive (NIV) modality.\nThe present study is a longitudinal questionnaire study in Norway measuring overall quality of life, health-related quality of life, and disease-specific quality of life in ALS patients, partners and children before and after the introduction of life sustaining ventilation support. The investigators aim to increase the knowledge on how life-sustaining ventilation support with NIV or TIV affects the quality of life in ALS patients, life partners and children. The results from the study may provide crucial information for clinicians and patients on one of the most difficult ethical issues of ALS treatment. The investigators anticipate that this information will facilitate a shared decision making processes, weighing benefits and disadvantages in a wider perspective.",

However, factors explaining the maximal muscle deoxygenation have been poorly explored. We quantified muscle deoxygenation and lactate concentration during an intense bout of exhaustive knee-extension exercise to determine the factors explaining maximal muscle deoxygenation. Ten males performed knee-extension exercise to exhaustion with a pedal frequency of 80 rpm (117.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3% maximum power output). Knee-extension muscles were imaged by intramuscular spectroscopic imaging, and the quadriceps femoris muscles and adipose tissue of the thigh were imaged by near-infrared spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009cm(3). Blood samples were analyzed to determine . During the final 60 s of exercise, an increase in muscle and adipose tissue deoxygenation was accompanied by a decrease in muscle . The amplitude and time course of muscle and adipose tissue deoxygenation did not differ between subjects. Compared with the onset of high-intensity exercise, muscle deoxygenation at exercise intensity showed a 25\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7% increase in  and a 20\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4% decrease in , indicating a larger oxygen unloading. These data demonstrate that muscle deoxygenation at exercise intensity is due primarily to exercise-induced fatigue and to a lesser extent to decreases in , whereas lactate appears to be a minor determinant of maximal muscle deoxygenation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Fatigue is identified as a major determinant of maximal muscle deoxygenation during a burst of exhaustive contractions. <EOD> Listeria monocytogenes: A Silent Pathogen with a Broad Cellular Arsenal to Multiply Intracellularly\n\nListeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic and facultatively intracellular food-borne pathogen that causes listeriosis in animals and humans. The infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms to devastating central nervous system infection, especially in newborns and immunocompromised patients. However, the underlying virulence mechanisms of L. monocytogenes during immune evasion, intracellular and systemic multiplication as well as virulence program expression are not completely known. Therefore, this short review describes our current knowledge regarding the intracellular pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes using recent models of infection.\n\n# Introduction\nThe facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic human pathogen and a prevalent Gram-positive zoonotic agent with a high mortality potential that causes listeriosis in immunocompromised persons, pregnant women and their newborns. L. monocytogenes is a motile and obligate intracellular bacterium of the order Listeriales in the class Bacilli. The Listeria species can be cultured as saprophytic soil microorganisms and contaminate various food products that are associated with food-borne listeriosis cases. Listeriosis is a life-threatening disease that is caused by the genus Listeria and, therefore, the genus was named after Victor Lister who is renowned for its contributions to the epizootiology of listeriosis. Listeriosis is caused by the virulent serotypes L. monocytogenes EGD (serotype 1/2a), 10403S, H7858 (serotype 4a, 4c, 4d), L2532 (serotype 4a), F2365 (serotype 1/2b) in both human and animal hosts. The human serotypes 1/2a, 4b and 4d have been reported to be the prevalent strains associated with listeriosis cases and account for 45.5%, 34.1% and 3",

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",

Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials on the inflammatory component of the disease, reducing the annualized relapse rate by 46% and the rate of new T2 lesions by 80% compared with interferon-\u03b2 1a.\nThe use of anti-CD20 agents, including ocrelizumab, is associated with an infectious risk that increases with duration of exposure, part of which is due to the development of hypo-gammaglobulinemia in relation to cumulative dose.\nSeveral reports suggest a persistent effect of anti-CD20 drugs in MS, with no resumption of inflammatory activity after discontinuation:\nDuring the development of ocrelizumab, at the end of phase 2, after having received 3 or 4 semi-annual cycles of ocrelizumab, a safety period with a therapeutic window of 18 months was planned, before re-administration in the extension study. During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

Around 80% of the patients who present with a colon cancer and is in a condition where surgery is possible will be offered resection of the tumor. A part of the colon is always removed together with the lymph nodes in order to ensure that cancer cells are not left behind. The risk of lymph node metastasis is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. The overall risk of lymph node metastases is less than 20 % in patients with early colon cancer. This indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer have no benefit of additional resection besides local tumor excision. The alternative to resecting a larger part of the bowel is to make more focused surgery only resecting a small part of the bowel part through a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques.

        "summary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",

We examined the characteristics of patients in the UK primary care setting, including their co-morbidities and management, focusing on asthma control and chronic sinusitis symptoms and diagnosis through a retrospective electronic medical records database study. Research design and methods: We used the electronic medical records of patients aged \u2265 12 years from The Health Improvement Network database. These anonymised data have demographics, general practice (GP) visits, medication, laboratory records, and prescription details. We calculated rates of co-existence of chronic sinusitis, asthma, and/or allergy. Results: The mean patient age was 43.7 years (2,280,785 person years). Mean patient follow-up time was 5.91 years and 61.57% (1393/2277) of patients had one or more visits with a GP with a concomitant diagnosis of asthma and chronic sinusitis. The proportion of patients with asthma and chronic sinusitis was highest for the age group 19\u201344 years (11.8%, 173/1136 compared to 3.3% of patients without asthma and chronic sinusitis, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In the 19\u201344 age group, women had a higher proportion of diagnosis of asthma and chronic sinusitis than men (16.2%  vs. 5.9% , p\u2009<\u20090.001). At any GP visit with co-existent asthma and chronic sinusitis, GP practice prescribing for chronic sinusitis was more frequent than for asthma (46.6%  compared to 31.5% ). Conclusions: For patients with asthma, comorbid chronic sinusitis is associated with more frequent GP visits. Co-existence of asthma and chronic sinusitis is greater in women and is highest among those aged 19\u201344 years. <EOD> The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on mental wellbeing of healthcare workers at a tertiary cancer centre: A mixed-methods study\nIntroduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a severe impact on the delivery of medical care for those with cancer. The psychological impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been substantial, with studies reporting significant psychological burden (depression, anxiety, burnout), particularly among healthcare workers. Objective This study aimed to examine the changes in SARS-CoV-2-related and psychosocial wellbeing in healthcare workers at a tertiary Cancer Centre. Methods Two cohorts of health care workers (HCWs) \u2009=\u2009263 and cohort 2\u2009=\u2009140) were surveyed over the period of 18\u2009months. The survey included questionnaires specific to SARS-CoV-2 and general psychosocial wellbeing. A qualitative review of open-ended questions was conducted through thematic analysis including interviews of a subset (N\u2009=\u200920) of participants. Results A total of 181 responses out of 263 (68.5%) health care workers responded. There were 57% males (101/181) with a mean age of 48 \u00b1 8years. There was an increase in burnout and psychosocial distress from first to last survey in both cohorts, particularly among nurses. Thematic analysis identified three central themes: 1) psychosocial distress, 2) healthcare worker anxiety and 3) changes to healthcare worker wellbeing. There was a negative impact on psychosocial distress (COVID scale), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), health perceptions of their general mental (SF-12 mental component scale), and general physical health (SF-12 physical component scale) in 2021 compared to 2020",

Histological diagnosis was spindle cell sarcoma (sclerosing fibrosarcoma). In the post-operative course chemotherapy(vincristine-actinomycin-adriamycin-cyclophosphamide) was given. The tumor cells did not express p53 protein immunohistochemically. Elevated p53 mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction(PCR) using oligo(dT) 20 primers. The tumor cells grew without cellular contact in vitro and formed multicellular sphere-like clusters in monolayer culture. After culturing in serum-free medium with antibiotics (RPMI1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 10ng/ml EGF, insulin, transferrin, hydrocortisone, 2-ME, gentamicin), the cells differentiated into epithelial cells expressing p53. The expression of p53 mRNA and p53 protein was found in differentiated cells by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The case suggested that some types of sarcomas may differentiate in vivo to epitheliallike cells and that these epitheliallike tumor cells may be capable of synthesis as much as normal epithelial cells in vivo. <EOD> Rheological Properties of Thermoresponsive Magnetic Suspensions\n\nIn this paper, we focus on understanding of the magnetorheological effect in the case of magnetic colloidal liquid crystal suspensions based upon an ionic thixotropic liquid crystal and ferrofluid. The study of rheology properties of the obtained suspensions allowed us to determine their magnetorheological characteristics and define their suitability for use in the design of novel soft actuators exhibiting temperature-responsive behaviour of shear viscosity in the presence of an external magnetic field. The temperature responsiveness of the viscosity value of the suspensions is associated with the peculiarities of the phase state of the ionic liquid crystal. This fact is utilized in the design of soft artificial muscles exhibiting a temperature-controlled direction of motion at zero magnetic field intensity. The proposed methodology has potential applications in design of robots with unconventional operation schemes based on the soft actuators having responsive functionality, e.g., in microsurgery and microactuators manufactured with printed circuit board technologies.\n\n# Introduction\nThe need for soft actuators capable of working under conditions that differ from traditional actuation modes and are designed for in-line and portable robotics is well recognized   Design and modeling of a novel flexible micromachine with biomimetic actuation, Deng     Design and kinematic control of a soft quadruped robot with pneumatic actuators..., Li     Biomimetic walking behavior using an anthropomorphic robotic fish driven by soft actuators, Nguyen     Soft pneumatic artificial muscle (S-PAM): New approach to soft actuator, Liu     Robotic grippers with soft and adaptable pneumatic actuators, Chu  . One of the proposed types of soft actuators based on shape memory alloys has demonstrated very high temperature responsiveness of the motion direction, but this solution fails to support the long-scale shape retention caused by the memory loss after the actuator has lost its initial temperature value. As a result, the long-acting actuators are required to keep their shape upon cooling. It is this problem which is addressed in the present study.\nThe solutions to the above-noted problem are represented by three kinds of actuator design approaches:\n(a) use of the magnetorheological effect, (b) use of the actuator of the ionic liquid crystal type and (c) use of the ionic liquid crystal with the magnetic colloidal suspension.\nThe possibility of combining actuators of the second type with the ionic liquid crystal with temperature-responsive functionality was demonstrated   Actuator based on soft polymeric-ion liquid crystal, Tutubalina  .

The present narrative review outlines the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with disabilities, and provides potential interventions and policies to better support the needs of this vulnerable population. Disability status should be added as a risk factor for increased severity and mortality from COVID-19, and data on health disparities among people with disabilities are critical. It is vital that we begin to understand the impact of structural racism on health disparities in the disability community. It is necessary for healthcare providers to increase their education about disabilities to ensure this vulnerable population is able to obtain the care needed to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# Introduction\nDisability policy was revolutionized as a result of the passage of the 1973, 1975, and 1986 landmark laws of the Americans with Disabilities Act . Although people with disabilities were historically marginalized and viewed as helpless and dependent, following these landmark bills, this group of people came to be seen as worthy and able of respect and equal rights as anyone else (Center on . Advances in the civil rights legislation has provided a blueprint for ensuring people with disabilities are given equal treatment in all aspects of society. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it painfully clear that in this society, some groups of people are being given more privilege than others. People with disabilities may be one of the most vulnerable and marginalized population in society in regards to COVID-19. People with disabilities may be facing greater challenges during the pandemic due to a lack of attention by researchers and policy makers. This is concerning, as it is well documented that people with disabilities receive less equal opportunities despite being protected under the Americans with disabilities Act (2021); their needs are not being taken into consideration in current health policy.\nPeople with disabilities, defined in this review as impairments and activity limitations due to any condition that is not primarily caused by aging or a progressive diseasesuch as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy; mental challenges; or sensory and intellectual disabilitiesare more likely to experience disparities in employment, housing, community integration, education, financial well-being, and healthcare. While these challenges existed before the pandemic, they are more profound and amplified during the COVID-19 outbreak. People with disabilities and chronic health conditions have had their health deteriorating further and have had worse outcomes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The preexisting healthcare disparities, barriers to healthcare, and the longstanding marginalization of the disability community by employers, institutions, and governments has led to the emergence of disproportionate COVID-19 death rates as well as other devastating impacts among people with disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased rates of unemployment among people with disabilities, especially younger people and those of low and moderate socioeconomic status, as well as individuals unable to work from home when needed. There also have been greater rates of depression, anxiety, and loneliness among the disability community than the general population.

        "summary": "After respiratory weaning, decannulation is sought. To do this, the tracheal cannula is first unblocked, so that patients no longer breathe in and out through the cannula, but (at least partially) passing the cannula by the natural route. In the presence of tracheal stenosis there is increased breathing effort, possibly restlessness and stridor. This constellation of symptoms suggests the suspicion of tracheal stenosis, so in the next step a tracheoscopy is performed to confirm or exclude tracheal stenosis. In case of symptomatic tracheal stenosis and at least 30-50% stenosis of the trachea (clinical symptoms can be expected from a 30-50% stenosis) then appropriate therapy (here: cryotherapy, other techniques only in exceptional cases) is planned. The goal is to be able to remove the tracheal cannula (long term) after successful therapy, so that patients do not have to be permanently provided with a tracheal cannula. There is no definitive/evidence-based standard therapy for the treatment of tracheal stenosis. Cryotherapy is a gentle therapy that has already been applied and described for the treatment of tracheal stenosis (see above). The examination is performed as part of an analgesic dose, as is routine for a bronchoscopy (in-house SOP). After treatment, a follow-up is planned for about 10 days later.",

The New Jersey statute also made similar restrictions on the use of alcohol, as well as other psychoactive drugs except marijuana, on both operators and passengers of boats under twenty-one feet. The state law was enacted by the New Jersey Legislature in August 1 9 , following a public hearing on the issue in June 1 9 9 0 conducted by a Joint Task Force of the Senate Law and Public Safety and the Assembly Law and Public Safety Committees. This hearing was convened by the Joint Legislative Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The Committee asked the Joint Task Force to evaluate the enabling legislation in New Jersey, including its enforcement and effectiveness in preventing alcohol-impaired operation of Boats, and to determine whether similar legislation was needed in New Jersey. The Committee also sought information on and recommendations for promoting awareness and compliance with state and federal laws related to alcoholimpaired operations of boats and other watercraft, including the federal \" boating-under-the-influence \" or \" dui \" statute (18 USC Section 1362(a)(1)). For these analyses, the legislative staff conducted surveys of marinas and the waterway patrols in Ocean County and Cape May County, as well as telephone interviews with operators of watercraft. The results of the study and the staff analysis were transmitted to the full Legislature in September . In October 1990. Governor Florio signed the State Law into effect. The first arrests were made statewide on January 1, 199 1. Subsequently, the New Jersey Boating and Fishing Enforcement Bureau began a statewide effort to promote greater awareness of the new Boating-Specific Alcohol Law and the federal law against impaired boating. <EOD> A Few Thoughts on Medical Science\n\nA FUEW THOUGHTS ON MEDICAL SCIENCE.\nA. The first consideration should be that a man shall not devote too large a share of his attention and time to the study of medical science. The great danger under all circumstances is that he will be made by it somewhat a \" specialist.\" It seems quite as perilous for a man to be a med ical specialist as to become a lawyer specialist or a theological specialist. But the medical specialist can become less dangerous if his attention is ever kept well-balanced between clinical, pathological and administrative branches of the subject. The real evil of such a tendency is to make a man narrow; a man who seems to think that everything is well, or can be well managed as far as he is concerned, in his special branch, and to be satisfied with his own \" specialty \" when he is consulted for advice in a general way. This condition may be avoided if a young medical man from the beginning knows better than to concentrate his whole attention upon those branches of the science which deal first with diseases of certain organs or tissues, or to be particularly interested in any particular disease. His first care should be to become well informed, as well as able and skilful, in ordinary medical practice. He should be familiar on the one hand with the special treatment of simple fractures, with the administration of the proper amount of ether, and with the taking of careful histories and careful physical examinations; and he should have his mind stored with general knowledge of the important diseases which fall to the lot of the people in general, and the more common abnormal conditions which people who are not specialists at all require to have understood and diagnosed, for the people who are in need of his services, or who trust their friends to be under his medical care, are very generally not the wealthy but the poor and ignorant. All are not capable of or even willing, on their own account, to take advice about minor matters alone from the specialist. While the best specialists have, in most cases, been trained in general medicine, that is not the case universally, they are not in all cases the best doctors, and it is",

        "summary": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by a variety of other symptoms, such as bipolar disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), etc. The behavioral and social complications often marginalize the population, impact on life satisfaction, undermined societal values that impact on economic and financial fairness, and so forth. Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.\nThe research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.\nThe study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care. Contributed by the sociostructural elements and necessities, black market amphetamine and ketamine have not only emerged in the regime for decades, but also have become a lucrative business. Their recreational uses are also sometimes accompanied by real necessities and needs; black markets cater to the needs but guidance on the usages is based on word-of-mouth stories without professional medical assistances. There is one case the Principal Investigator (PI) collected, that one person, possibly under depression contributed by PTSD, took relatively high dosage of amphetamine and went into a state of psychosis with overwhelming persecution mania. The study protocol, Psychiatric Orders in Psychoanalytic Treatment of ASD, is therefore designed for an evidence-based approach in treating complex psychiatric disorders with psychoanalytic guidance.",

Reverse transcriptase activity was assayed kinetically and compared with RNA-polymerase activities determined in vitro. All four avian hepadnavirus RTs had significantly less reverse transcriptase activity than human HBsAg RT during assays performed at optimal pH and 37 degrees C for both systems. Inactivation studies were performed by incubating RT at various pH values at 23 degrees C. Avian hepadnavirus enzymes were found relatively stable compared to human HBsAg RT and duck-passaged HBV RT, which were inactivated rapidly at pH 6.8 and 35 days at pH 6.2. The avian hepadnavirus RTs were able to be effectively reactivated even after 150-1300 hours of incubation at pH 4.3 using 0.6 M guanidine HCl and 150 mM sodium acetate at 0 degree C. Reactivations of these enzymes were comparable to reactivation of human HBsAg RT and duck-passaged HBV RT. Comparison of Km values and kinetic constants for duck hepatitis B viral DNA (DHBVDNA) and human hepatitis B viral DNA indicated that the avian enzymes had nearly 100-fold reduced affinity for DHBVDNA and comparatively low reverse transcriptase activity. These properties may be important for these enzymes to avoid the lethal response by the host cell. <EOD> \u03b2-elemene targets EZH2-mediated microRNA-340-5p/66w-5p/155-5p/148a-3p to inhibit tumor progression through Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in lung cancer.\nObjectives\nTo investigate the effect of \u03b2-elemene on the proliferation and invasion of the lung cancer cell line (A549 cell) and the mechanism of action.\n\n\nMethods\n3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Transwell assay were performed to detect the effect of \u03b2-elemene on the proliferation and invasion of A549 cells in vitro.

        "summary": "Since a new method called pulsed-field ablation (PFA) has emerged, allowing significantly simpler, safer, and faster creation of ablative lesions in paroxysmal AF and PsAF (13), redefining the optimal ablation approach started to appear mandatory. Our project (The PIVCO study) aims to determine a more standardized procedure representing optimal ablation strategy for patients suffering from PsAF using PFA and multielectrode ablation catheters. The central hypothesis is that ablation of the posterior LA wall (PWI), together with mitral and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation added on top of PVI, will be associated with better effects in terms of rhythm control. Given the speed, safety, and ease of standardization of ablation using electroporation, a demonstration of the superiority of either approach could significantly impact the current standard of clinical care.",

The CHI SJC program has not been studied to determine program effectiveness. The investigators intend to follow families and their children until the children in the study graduate from high-school or turn 19 years of age.\nThe study, as a template, uses the eight outcome domains listed and described in the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness website (http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/outcomes.aspx). These eight domains are:\nChild development and school readiness\nFamily economic self-sufficiency\nMaternal health\nReductions in child maltreatment\nChild health\nLinkages and referrals\nPositive parenting practices\nReductions in juvenile delinquency, family violence, and crime\nThe investigators expect to observe significant differences among the two groups with respect to the primary outcome domains listed. The investigators expect study group members randomized to the CHI SJC program will perform better on the eight outcome domains.\nOther hypotheses include:\nOther Hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1. Randomization to CHI SJC will be associated with higher quality functioning and better child health and well-being.\nHypothesis 2. Randomization to CHI SJC will result in more connections to community resources.\nHypothesis 3. Randomization to CHI SJC will result in improved indications of maternal health and positive parenting practices.\nHypothesis 4. Randomization to CHI SJC will be associated with higher measures of family economic self-sufficiency.\nHypothesis 5. Randomization to CHI SJC will be associated with increased school readiness and school progress and attainment.\nHypothesis 6. Randomization to CHI SJC will be associated with reductions in juvenile delinquency, family violence, and crime.\nThe study will collect outcome data in the same way and, at the same time, from treatment and control group members. Data collection will primarily be comprised of a set of self-report questionnaires and a review of administrative records that target the outcome domains described earlier. Study group members will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 3 years, 5 years, 8 years, 12 years, 15 years, and at high-school graduation or 19 years of age.",

        "summary": "Malaria is a major public health problem. There were around 240 million cases of malaria and 627,000 deaths worldwide in 2020. Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

I also read a book on the life of Galileo Galilei in which he was accused of heretical behaviour by the Catholic Church which caused him a 20-year trial and punishment. I found it interesting that when this man\u2019s scientific discoveries were published, the Catholic Church considered them false, in spite of the fact that some of his discoveries were fundamental for the understanding of basic scientific concepts, such as Galileo\u2019s law of fall where objects fall with the same velocity, no matter their weight, size or shape. Although Galileo had great admiration and respect for the Catholic Church authorities, he was clearly aware of that Catholic authorities would never understand his scientific discoveries and considered them incorrect. His scientific discoveries, nevertheless, remain fundamental for the basic understanding of scientific concepts and many natural phenomena, today. This example seems to occur in our era with some important concepts in modern medicine. In the current issue of the journal, we are pleased to have two scientific reports that seem to show that we could be on the right tracks, at least, regarding some important points related to antioxidant therapy in sepsis. The first report is on the beneficial mechanism of action of the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and deferoxamine in experimental sepsis. This report by Kie\u0142borski et al (page 689) seems to be an \u2018opening path of progress\u2019 for clinical applications of antioxidants in patients with sepsis. The most compelling points of the report are that antioxidant therapy reduces mortality from sepsis and that this beneficial effect could be a result of increased IL-10 levels after administration of antioxidants. One of the main problems of intensive care physicians is to determine the optimal therapy to treat sepsis and septic shock. The first steps should be to increase the amount of circulating blood volume, and to administer antibiotics and to decrease the concentration of pyrogens and cytokines. These therapeutic principles, in addition to the administration of fluids with normal saline or isotonic chloride solutions, were first proposed by Sir Alfred Shooter 45 years ago (1). In the past 45 years, however, some important advances have occurred in the therapy against infection. The administration of blood and plasma is now often used in some critical patients with sepsis and shock. With the availability of cytokines in vitro, it is interesting to know how these components behave in vivo and can cause the septic state. The cytokines that are mainly produced early after severe infection are the tumour necrosis factors, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-y, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-a (2). The mechanism of action of cytokines also seems to involve the activation of monocytes/ macrophages, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and other phagocytic cells, including cells of the adaptative immune system. This is a very interesting and complex story that physicians, molecular biologists and immunologists must deeply investigate and try to clarify to identify the molecular mechanisms of action of cytokines in vivo. In this scenario, it seems that some of these cytokines (interleukins) have very important beneficial properties in sepsis/shock, such as IL-10, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-15. We may conclude that infection involves some interesting and very complicated events at the immunological level, which are difficult to understand in depth. The second report is that on the benefits of phosphodiesterase III and V inhibition for the protection of multiple organ dysfunction caused by endotoxin (3). This report by Jang et al (page 706) also seems to be an important step on a path of great interest. The concept of multiple organ dysfunction or shock is related to the disseminated activation of",

        "model_output": "[/INST]\n\nSummary of the Summary: [/INST-H]\n\nThe Study Text\n==================\n\n[/INST]\n\nDear Doctor\n\nThere is a lack of effective methods for predicting GH responsiveness in subjects with ISS [1,2,3,4] and to our knowledge genetic variation is the only tool available so far to do so. We aim, therefore, to define the genetic basis of response in GH-treated idiopathic short statured individuals under the hypothesis that a large genetic architecture is responsible for variability in response to GH [5].\n\nThe aim is to define the genetic architecture responsible of GH responsiveness in children with ISS and relate it to growth at one year of GH treatment. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that DNA will be extracted from a large enough population to characterise the genetic variation in ISS (at least 500 subjects), and one of few studies of its kind at a genome-wide level.\n\nClinical samples will be sequenced using the SureSelect technology followed by enrichment with the RNA baits on the GHS gene panel.\n\nThe genetic study will provide a list of variants that are significantly associated with variation in response to GH therapy. This is particularly interesting with respect to the GSK-sponsored TEDS study. The TEDS study has been monitoring approximately 300,000 children. One of the characteristics of this programme is that the data has been analysed independently from each centre. Analysis of large cohorts independently from each other may result in non-reproducible results due to missing data such as missing information about the response to the GH therapy, the age of the child at the start of the treatment, etc. (i.e. incomplete and missing data).\n\nParticipants in TEDS whose GH response was determined (i.e. using genetic analysis) by the Genetic Study will be compared with those whose GH response was not determined in TEDS. Moreover, these participants will also be compared with similar patients whose GH response was determined in TEDS using growth measures.\n\nParticipants will be selected from different population cohorts. The samples will be analyzed in one central lab. Therefore, analysis of variation in GH responsiveness is possible via genetic analysis even in the absence of any analysis of GH response using a growth measure.\n\nThe goal is to better understand how ISS develops, to develop better management of ISS and to potentially find novel GH sensitivity markers for future clinical trials. These will be extremely important achievements for healthcare and clinical development, and will have positive future implications for all areas of medicine that are linked to diseases and disorders showing variability in their response to treatment.\n\nThe study will also provide a powerful resource to identify novel pathways and putative predictors of growth and GH response. This is expected as this is a large cohort study, thus providing more statistical power than studies of the same size from other centres. The study will also be the first to provide a genetic analysis of the genetic determinants affecting the response to GH therapy in humans.\n\nWhat we are asking in this study is that the participants of the study will provide a blood sample at the start of the study. The sample will be sent to our central laboratory and will be stored in liquid nitrogen. These samples will not contain any identifiable information. We may also need to take another blood sample when the participant is on year three of GH therapy.\n\nIf you would like to participate, your doctor will collect a small sample of blood from a vein in your child\u2019s arm. The sample will be used to find genetic variants. Before taking a blood sample, we will ask you to sign the consent form to take part in the study. During the study your doctor will enter some notes about your child in a research database. If you do not want us to enter notes about your child into a database, you should inform your doctor as soon as possible. If you inform us about your decision at any time while your child is already in the study we will still continue using the data that we have about your child in the study.\n\nParticipation is completely voluntary and a participant can end his participation or withdraw from the study at any time. This does not affect the care you will receive from any treatment. Once you have agreed to join the study, any information we already have about your child will be used for the study. If at any time you want to withdraw your consent, just inform your doctor who will record your wish in the research database. This decision will not affect any future treatment.\n\nYour doctor has given you",

In the ICU, care-related awakenings occur frequently, but it is unclear if differential neurocheck frequencies result in differential sleep, providing the scientific premise for this proposal.\nPopulation: Twenty-two patients (N=11 per group) who have undergone elective aneurysm coiling will be enrolled. On post-operative day (POD) 0, patients will be screened and approached for informed consent if they do not meet exclusion criteria, e.g., prior intracranial injury, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, mechanical ventilation. Patients with elective aneurysm coiling are being chosen because they require ICU level of care following their intracranial procedure, but do not have structural brain injury or ongoing sedation needs that might impact sleep measurements.\nMethods: Usual care: Patients are monitored every 15-30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-procedure, then Q1 or Q2 for up to 24 hours. If these patients remain stable, they are discharged home on post-operative day (POD) 1. Proposed Intervention: Enrolled patients will be randomized to Q1 or Q2 neurochecks following the institutionally required 6 hours of stable neurological and vascular checks.

In addition, Cu(Gly)(2), which has the strongest Cu-N bond, also showed the greatest antibacterial activity toward Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. These results indicate that the Cu-N bond, which is formed via the amino groups of an amino acid in the bisamidinate ligand, is important for the antibacterial action of M(2) and highlights the significance of the ligand's nature and structure for antibacterial activity. An X-ray crystal structure analysis of M(dab) revealed that there was no significant difference in the metal coordination sphere when comparing Cu(dab)(2) with Cu(Gly)(2). In addition, an X-ray structural analysis of M(Glu)(2) suggested that the Cu-N bond in M(Glu)(2) was too weak to influence the antibacterial action, whereas the Cu-N bond in M(dab)(2) and M(Gly)(2) was sufficiently stable to permit the influence of the d-electrons of the Cu ion on the resulting antibacterial action towards P. aeruginosa. The results suggest that the Cu-N bond in these M(dab)(2) and M(Gly)(2) metal complexes is crucial for their antibacterial activity, and the reason for this difference from M(Glu)(2) is that the d-electrons of the Cu ion cannot influence the hydrophilicity of the Cu-N bond in Cu(Glu)(2), but can do so in Cu(dab)(2) and Cu(Gly)(2). <EOD> Dental health education and prevention\nAn understanding of the processes that determine the occurrence of dental caries is essential to the prevention of the disease.

To better ascertain the potential prognostic significance of ENE by histomorphology.\n\n\nBackground: The pathologic presence of extranodal extension (ENE) is independently associated with significantly worse prognosis in N2 and N3a cN+ head and neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). ENE is detected on routine pretreatment imaging scans in up to 30% of patients with HNSCC and as many as 90% of patients with large tumors and clinically node-positive disease. Accurate staging of radiologic ENE is therefore of high importance to guide surgical and/or radiation management of these patients.\n\nConclusions: The importance of clinicians acknowledging the potential significance of radiologic ENE in patients with cN+ HNSCC has been increasingly highlighted. Radiologic ENE should be taken into account in HNSCC patients with cN+ disease.\n\nEthical Approval: Ethical approval obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at each of the participating institutions. This study was ethically approuved by all the involved Institutes. Data for this study will be extracted from patients' clinical records. Patients will not be recalled or exposed to additional assessment solely in the context of this study and the study would not impact upon patient care.\n\nCareer: The study investigators include specialist clinicians and surgeons involved in the acquisition, classification and radiological assessment of imaging ENE. The study would benefit current and future patient care and would not require any direct financial input from patients in terms of travel and or treatment costs.\n\nTrial Registration: This intergroup study is registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ID number ISRCTN72782437).\n\n\nTrial Registration: This ISRCTN72782437.\n\n\nStudy Location: This trial will be conducted in various centres throughout Europe. Recruitment will take place at the participating centers.\n\nNumber of Participants: Each center will be requested to identify approximately 4 to 8 patients meeting the selection criteria. Assuming each participating center will recruit approximately 4 patients per year, overall, we were expecting approximately 35 (4  x 9) patients or 10 patients per arm over 2 years.\n\nPurpose: To determine whether iENE may serve as an effective predictive and prognostic marker for local recurrence and survival.\n\nTime Frame: For the primary study outcome of accuracy, radiology report data were collected from January 1999 to December 2023.\n\nPrimary Endpoint: To evaluate the accuracy in radiologic diagnosis of iENE for the classification of pENE.\n\nSecondary Endpoint: To investigate the association between iENE detected by radiologic methods and long-term outcomes in locally advanced HNSCC (especially tumors that are more than 4 cm in diameter).\n\nTertiary Endpoints: To evaluate the",

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",

The summary should only be the summarization of the given trial. Do not explain how you summarize it.\nInput Text: African Americans (AA) Communities Speak\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nClinicians frequently care for patients who have preferences related to treatment that contradict those of patients and their families (e.g., aggressive vs comfort-focused treatment choices) 1-2 . These discordant treatment preferences, or Goals of Care (GC), are influenced by the patients' values, beliefs, and cultural background 1 . Discordant patient/family preferences present challenges for clinicians and result in communication-related conflict and clinician frustration 1-3 . The source of these conflicts and related stress can be identified in the patient's health care experience. Specifically, clinicians working in the hospital or in the community commonly identify bias, racism, and discrimination towards African Americans that lead to lower quality care, worse patient experiences, and decreased patient trust in health care systems, leading, in turn, to less optimal care 4-6 . These discordant GC and disparities in care quality are not evenly distributed among clinicians or across clinicians' practice sites, due in part to the presence of unequal access to quality care, as well as health disparities in populations that are not of European ancestry. African Americans have high GC preferences for comfort and quality of life, 1,2,7-10 which is reflected in their use of hospice over time. These preferences may be impacted by race-affinity, family culture, and the importance placed on religion and spirituality 11-13 . These preferences should be discussed with African Americans to enhance patient-centered care. A better understanding of African American preferences could lead to personalized care (e.g., shared decision-making) rather than traditional, 'one size fits all' care strategies, and improve African Americans' trust in healthcare providers and systems. The African American Communities' Speak, or AACS, education intervention was created to address African American preferences and disparities in goals of care. AACS empowers African American clinicians and their families in the following ways: the program aims to enhance clinician skills in: understanding the sources of race-related disparities in care; communicating effectively with African American patients/families about their goals of care; and identifying and discussing sources of racism and bias. The AACS education program for clinicians and their families will be developed with the input of African Americans, and then be tested and measured in an initial randomized control trial, to ensure changes in clinician attitudes, knowledge, and performance are shown. AACS will be an evidence-based intervention/program that will have a measurable clinical impact and can be implemented within clinical systems and healthcare organizations across the USA. To develop and pilot-test the AACS program in collaboration with community stakeholders (African Americans and clinicians ), with the goal of disseminating and supporting the program nationwide via a CDC-type resource center/repository, in collaboration with public health leaders. This paper outlines the steps of the project, the pilot testing and potential dissemination phase of the research project and program.

However, patients with HPV+ Head and Neck cancers are treated according to the same referential as HPV- Head and Neck cancers.

This clinical fact was not observed in the other types of HNSCC and we can assume that this is due to a greater sensitivity of HPV+ HNSCC to immunotherapy.\u00a0It is however not possible to predict upfront the positive or negative status of this HPV (for a given tumor) because the HPV profile is determined based on the sequencing results of HPV-16 (more sensitive). However, it is not the only one because there are other HPV, also linked to head and neck cancers.\n\n* The identification of other genomic markers is therefore likely to constitute a new line of investigation.\n\n* As a first step, there is a\u00a0need to obtain genomic data on a larger scale.

Approaching the different dimensions of PSR calls on a dozen essential components: workload, autonomy, social support, burnout, anxiety, efforts made, rewards, work addiction, investment, etc. a specific questionnaire which usually contains 20 to 30 questions, so that having an overall view of PSR using the current reference questionnaires (Karasek, Siegrist, etc.) represents a total of more than 300 questions. The response time is thus incompatible with current medical practice (passage in the waiting room before the occupational health medical examination) and leads to a majority of non-responses during anonymous questionnaires on the Internet. On the other hand, these validated questionnaires were carried out by different people and are very heterogeneous between them, including in their formulation, so that the respondents have the impression of disorganization and anarchy. There is therefore a need for short, quick and uniform questionnaires. EVAs offer the incredible advantage of meeting these criteria: speed, uniformity, precision. From a data analysis point of view, EVAs also have the advantage of offering a continuous quantitative response, allowing the use of all statistical approaches.

Some of these analogs showed moderate to good inhibition of PI3K and HDAC at low micromolar concentration, and the best inhibitors demonstrated high enzymatic selectivity. The 2,3-dioxo-N-phenylpropanamide derivatives containing N-methylindole moiety showed the strongest dual effects. Among these analogs, compound 3m showed promising antiproliferative activity and reasonable safety profile, implying it as an excellent drug candidate. Therefore, we plan to exploit 3m as a clinical candidate for treating pancreatic carcinoma. <EOD> Influence of phospholipase A on the formation of monofunctional complexes of cationic proteins with DNA.\nThe influence of the lipocalm 3000 preparation of phospholipase A (15 mg/l) on the formation of monofunctional complexes of the basic protamine complex and the histones H1, H5 and pH2(86A) with DNA in the systems with physiological concentrations of sodium has been investigated using the method of thermal denaturation of DNA. This preparation did not affect the stability of the protamine-DNA complex, but promoted the histone H1-DNA complex disintegration. <EOD> Hormonal, nutritional, and metabolic factors as inducements of adrenal medullary hyperplasia in laboratory rats with inherited hypertension.\nThe adrenal medulla is characterized, in the normal state and in various conditions, especially in neoplastic diseases, by an increased basophilia. The basophilia is regarded as an expression of increased cell function or alterations of the pigment granule population. Hypertension in Sprague-Dawley rats is a characterized genetic disease which is associated with hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla that is independent of the blood pressure. The basophilia of the adrenal medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is reduced and unchanged in young and adult rats, respectively, after treatment with a single dose of epinephrine. Hypophysectomy of young animals produces hyperplasia not only of the adrenal medulla but also of the myocardium, which, however, is much less pronounced than the hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla. After administration of thyroxin, as well as of 1-d-pindolol, a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, the basophilia of the adrenal medulla is increased. The effects are inhibited by a treatment with reserpine or atropine. It is concluded that: 1. The adrenal medulla of SHR of either sex is characterized by an increased basophilia. In the young animal the basophilia is significantly reduced by administration of epinephrine, whereas in the adult animal this effect is not observed. 2. Hypophysectomy results in hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla, as well as of the myocardium, in both young and adult SHR. 3.

After training eight intensive care nurses on two different occasions, significant improvements in the accuracy with which the nurses were able to measure ICP were found. The findings of this study indicate, therefore, that didactic lectures combined with practical experience using a simulator can be a useful education and training method in this difficult skill. Further, in light of the high failure rate in training ICP technicians, it is hoped this type of training will prove successful in improving the quality of ICP measurements made in routine practice. <EOD> Influence of Birth Order and Birth Weight on the Incidence of Aortic Aneurysm and Aortic Dissection\nBackground. The aim of our study was to investigate whether birth order and/or birth weight influence the risk of hypertension in the later life, and furthermore, whether these factors influence the incidence of aortic aneurysm and/or aortic dissection. Method. In 1953 5436 (3122 men) births were registered in the city of Oulu, Finland. The subjects were classified according to their birth order (primitive, middle, last\u2010born) in relation to their siblings (nonsiblings included). Birth weight data were available from 45 to 50 years for 2437 persons (1277 men). Results. The mean age at the time of the study was 52 (1) years. Those with only nonsiblings had the highest incidence (0.11/1 000 person\u2010years) of aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, while the secondborn had the highest incidence of other hypertension (1.44/1 000 person\u2010years, P5.0 kg at birth. Conclusions. It was found that the incidence of aortic aneurysm and dissection is increased in the siblings of nonsibling children, compared with the siblings of middleborn children. The birth order may be a risk factor of aortic dissection. Birth order may predict the risk of hypertension, although the association of this with aortic dissection seems to be explained by genetic factors. The incidence of aortic aneurysm was not associated with birth order. For those weighing less than 4.5 kg at birth, the incidence of heart failure due to aortic dissection and other hypertension was higher than that of aortic aneurysm cases, compared with those born with a normal birth weight. <EOD> The Prognostic Importance of the Incomplete Distal Inferior Vascular Bundle Crimping in Right Coronary Artery Cusp Atresia\nBackground: An incomplete crimping (ICM) of the inferior vascular band (IVB) of right coronary artery ostium in the absence of a left-sided dominant anatomy and the prognostic importance of this observation have been rarely studied.

The cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease are tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. As the disease progresses, it causes more pronounced stiffness, more prominent bradykinesia, hypokinesia with gait disturbance, postural instability, and difficulty in turning.The incidence rates of Parkinson's disease are 10 to 25 per 100,000 annually. 2 More than 1.5 million people worldwide are currently affected by this disease; over the next 20 years, this number will continue to grow by 40% to 45% in industrialized countries.

The \u03b2-glucan is identified as a main component of BLEX 404. Not only with therapeutic potential on several types of cancer, BLEX 404 has also shown the potential to improve hematopoiesis, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, and the cytotoxicity activity of immune cells in recent animal studies. Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity. BLEX 404 enhances hematopoiesis by increasing mouse bone marrow cell and human cord blood cell differentiation into granulocytes-macrophages (GMs), granulopoiesis and mobilization of granulocytes, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF production.

Advanced lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. More than half of the lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common variant and is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 mutations is clinically heterogeneous, with poor response to standard first line therapy. Therefore, there remains an unmet need to develop effective treatments. Osimertinib is a third generation EGFR-TKI which binds to the same site on EGFR as other first and second generation EGFR-TKIs. A Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of osimertinib in patients with EGFR T790M mutation have shown sustained clinical effectiveness beyond progression on EGFR TKIs with manageable adverse events. EMPULSE-Lung-07 is an open label, phase I/II study which was planned to investigate Pemetrexed+Cisplatin and Osimertinib combination as an EGFR exon 20 insertion first line therapy for EGFR exon 20 insertion NSCLC patients. BLEX404 (BLEX Bioscience, Inc., New Taipei City, Taiwan) is a proprietary 800 mg/ml of EGFR-TKI and MMP inhibitor, which is developed for treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. BLEX404 is a highly water-soluble crystalline powder and is formulated into an oral liquid to optimize convenience and adherence to use by cancer patients through its favorable taste. BLEX404 combined with Pemetrexed or Paclitaxel was found to elicit strong anticancer effect with low toxicity and could be a new therapeutic option in treating NSCLC patients. Study objectives: Primary: Determination the dose-limiting toxicity in the first cycle of combination use of BLEX404 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in stage IV NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations Secondary: Determination the recommended dose level in the first cycle of combination use of BLEX404 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in stage IV NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations Assessments: Treatment-emergent adverse events, objective response rate at Cycle 4 (defined as at least 4 cycles of therapy or at least 90 days on therapy and within 7 days after last therapy), progression-free survival (the probability of subjects surviving with disease progression at given survival time), overall survival (the probability of subjects surviving from the time of randomization until death from any cause), quality of life and pharmacokinetics, and serum concentration of BLEX404, Pemetrexed and H 3 BF 4 , and urine concentration of BLEX404 or Pemetrexed. Study design: Open-label, single center, phase I/II study with a 3+3 doseescalation design in part A. Part B patients will receive BLEX404 800mg/ml, Pemetrexed 500mg/ m 2 , and Cisplatin 75mg/m 2 Q3W.\n[/PART]\nPrior Research in the Treatment of NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20 Mutations\n---------------------------\n\nTreatment options for EGFR exon 20 patients with NSCLC are very limited.

The data was collected from the KNHANES V1 (2010-2012) and the KYRBWS V (2011 and 2015), conducted as a follow-up study for adults, aged 19~39 years, who underwent the KNHANES IV surveys from 2007 to 2009. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between various risk factors and suicidality, including suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. We also used multiple imputation by chained equations (N=700) for missing data of child abuse history for more accurate estimation of the impact of the risk factors of suicidality.Results:The findings showed a high prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology in college students. High-risk behavior included current smoking, alcohol consumption, a lower level of caregiver support, and a poor family financial state during childhood. Child abuse history was significantly related to suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. The risk factors for suicidality include younger age, females, physical abuse during childhood, low-level household income, and lower level of caregiver support during childhood. Multiple logistic regression revealed that child abuse during childhood, lower level of caregiver support at baseline, and low-level household income increased the odds of suicidal ideation. In addition, child abuse during childhood, low-level caregiver support, and low-level household income increased the odds of attempted suicide.Conclusion:We found a high prevalence of child abuse history. Suicidality is associated with risk factors including younger age, low caregiver support, low-level household income, and child abuse.\n\n# Introduction\nDuring their college years, students experience various types of stress, including academic failure, economic instability, relationship stress, and pressure for excellence, and these stressors are often present for a long time.

The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). In the case of rehabilitation of older patients post-COVID-19, we do not know what the course of recovery for these patients will be, and what treatment/approaches will deliver the best outcomes.\nPersons that are recovering from a COVID-19 infection, and admitted on a geriatric ward for early rehabilitation, or geriatric rehabilitation ward or facility, can be included in the study. They will receive routine, usual care; participation in this study will not affect their rehabilitation care. Routine care data will be collected from their electronic patient files at admission to geriatric rehabilitation, and at discharge. This also includes some data about their premorbid status. In addition, study participants will be called six weeks and six months after discharge from rehabilitation and asked some questions about their recovery. There is no risk association with participation in this study. Data will be anonymously collected in an online database.\nThe primary aim of this study is to get insight into the course of recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe. Mainly, we are interested in functioning in activities of daily living (ADL-functioning) such as toileting, bathing, dressing, etc., and in quality of life. The second aim of this study is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organization of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive. Therefore, we collect data on the types of care provided and the professionals involved. Moreover, we collect some patient characteristics such as year of birth, gender, date of admission and date of discharge; and data about complications such as delirium, pain, post-traumatic stress syndrome, hospital readmissions, and mortality. Our hypothesis is that most patients will show recovery during geriatric rehabilitation and in the six months after. However, we expect that the amount and/or speed of recovery will vary between patients.",

After one or two doses of the bivalent Omicron mRNA vaccine we evaluate humoral and cellular immune response in all participants by determination of receptor binding domain (RBD) specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations in serum. After 3 doses of the bivalent Omicron BA.4 and/or BA.5 mRNA vaccine, this evaluation is repeated together with a determination of anti-spike neutralizing capacity. After both vaccinations, we also investigate the frequency of T cells that recognize BNT162b2 virus-infected human cells in the blood of the participants. Furthermore, two-dose COVID-19 vaccination is supplemented by (optional) two doses of the Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (Shingrix). After the second Shingrix vaccination, participants will be included in the vaccine herpes zoster study.\n\nWe compare humoral and cellular responses to COVID-19 vaccines in participants who continue treatment with everolimus instead of mycophenolate mofetil. To do so, we will compare responses from recipient of everolimus with matched recipients who remain on CNI.\n\nWe also include a group of kidney transplant recipients that receive the herpes zoster vaccine during the study, but do not receive COVID-19 vaccination. This study arm allows us to investigate a potential induction of herpes zoster vaccinemediated immunity in participants on everolimus after COVID-19 vaccination as a side-effect.\n\nThe inclusion of participants who accept to provide an additional blood sample after three doses of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will allow us to further investigate cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on the number and phenotype of memory T cells of the participants. We will use the blood samples and compare them with data generated from serum obtained after standard clinical chemistry measurements.\n\nPrimary Objective\n==================\nTo investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in higher immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination, with a focus on neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain after second vaccination.\n\nKey Secondary Objective\n==================\nTo investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in higher immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination, with a focus on frequency of T cells recognizing BNT162b2 virus-infected human cells after second vaccination.\n\nKey Secondary Objectives\n==========================\nTo evaluate the immunogenicity of replacing maintenance of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients to both the bivalent Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 and original/Omicron BA.1 (V-003-2022-NL7401, V15-00987-NL7401, ZIN-203302006.\n\nIntervention Arms\n================\nKidney transplant recipients who use everolimus instead of CNI for at least six weeks will receive the bivalent Omicron vaccination during the study.

The patients were classified either as schizophrenics (n = 20) or as having first psychotic schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) (n = 44). The pathologists who examined the autopsy material were unaware of the diagnostic category or the age of the subjects.\n\n\nFINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\nAt autopsy, the only macroscopic and microscopic differences found were that the cortical sulci were wider and the basal ganglia were larger in the patients with schizophrenia than in patients with SPD with psychosis, and that, compared to the SPD group, more patients with schizophrenia had an old cerebral infarct. <EOD> Improving Healthcare Resource Utilization in the Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome in the United States and Europe.\nEarly diagnosis and prompt treatment remain essential in achieving optimal outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Current management guidelines for ACS emphasize early recognition and prompt revascularization for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to reduce morbidity and mortality, but also suggest treatment with the same medical interventions applied early in patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) despite more delayed symptom presentation. The rapid diagnosis and successful treatment of ACS, though, are complicated by significant delays in presentation for treatment. The combination of late presentation and insufficient emergency medical services (EMS) transport to the nearest hospital capable of treating ACS are responsible for prolonged delays to hospital presentation. These delays in treatment may occur despite access to healthcare services and may lead to suboptimal patient outcomes. This review demonstrates ways to improve healthcare resource utilization in the treatment of ACS by utilizing evidence-based clinical strategies to reduce and/or eliminate delays encountered during the prehospital and emergency department (ED) phases of care. The review also focuses on measures to improve patient outcomes by reducing door-to-ECG and door-to-needle/balloon times. <EOD> ORIGIN OF VARICOSITIES.\nTwo patients presented with typical reticulate skin as a result of the long-term application (2 to 10 years) of hydroxyurea for the prophylactic treatment of a severe hemolytic anemia.

The summary should aim to communicate the key information succinctly and accurately based on the provided clinical trial report. It should capture the primary information. Avoid explaining or elaborating on the description of the study, instead, provide enough information to the reader to be able to decide if they would be interested in the study.\n\n# Explanatory Text\n__________________\n\nThe provided clinical trial is titled: Efficacy of Upper Trapezius Stretching on Neck Pain, Range of Motion and Disability in Patients With Cervical Spondylosis: A Randomised Controlled Trial.\n\nFourty-two patients with cervical spondylosis were randomly assigned to either the intervention (an upper fibers trapezius stretching intervention) or control group (standard care). The intervention consisted of specific stretching exercises designed to target the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle. The stretching exercises were performed under the guidance of a licensed physical therapist and involved extending the neck while gently pulling the head downward to stretch the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle.\n\nThe provided clinical trial results showed that the intervention group had a significant improvement in neck pain at 4 weeks and 3 months compared to the control group, as well as a significant improvement in neck range of motion and disability at 3 months. Overall, these findings suggest that the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention can effectively reduce neck pain and improve neck range of motion and disability for patients with cervical spondylosis.\n\nDiscussion\n__________________\nThe upper fibers of the trapezius muscle play a crucial role in maintaining balance, movement, and posture of the neck 1]. Individuals with cervical spondylosis may experience altered biomechanical and motor control of the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle, leading to the development of pain and decreased neck mobility 2,3]. The upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention aims to reduce neck pain and improve neck mobility by re-aligning the shoulder girdle and increasing the passive extensibility of the trapezius muscle, and has been found to be an effective treatment modality in clinical studies 4][5]. This clinical trial provides robust evidence for the use of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention as an effective treatment for individuals with cervical spondylosis.\n\nThe findings of this clinical trial are consistent with previous studies on manual therapy for individuals with neck pain, which suggests an overall benefit of manual therapy in reducing pain and disability 6]. This study also aligns with the conclusions of recent systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines on the management of neck pain, which highlight the importance of exercise as a treatment modality and the need for further research to better understand the effectiveness of specific intervention strategies 7,8].\n\nTaken together, the findings of this clinical trial support the use of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention as an effective treatment option for individuals with cervical spondylosis. By providing insights into the effects of the intervention and highlighting the promising potential of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence regarding the management of neck pain and disability.\n\nBackground information\n__________________\n\nCervical spondylosis is a commonly occurring pathology of the cervical spine that can cause varying degrees of neck pain. In more severe cases, it can lead to neck stiffness and reduced range of motion 9]. The upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention has been investigated as a potential treatment option to promote improved neck mobility and less pain in individuals with neck and shoulder pain. The intervention involves gently pulling down the head while extending the neck, with the intention of stretching the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle. While evidence suggests that the stretching intervention may be effective in reducing pain and improving function, there is little consensus on the relative benefits of specific trapezius stretching modalities. The efficacy of these modalities can vary based on individual factors such as pain location and severity, neck mobility, and specific features of the stretch being performed. Clinical guidance on the optimal stretching interventions for individuals with cervical spondylosis pain remains limited. This highlights the need for further research to determine the most effective approaches to alleviate the pain and improve the range of motion for patients with cervical pain.",

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

The results showed that, compared with the control group, 30 g.kg-1 PQ had no effect on the growth performance, digestion, immune, antioxidation and liver and kidney functions, but 70 g.kg-1 PQ decreased the apparent digestibility of dry matter (P < 0.05) and the total tract apparent digestibility of N and crude fat (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), depressed growth performance (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), decreased serum immunoglobulins (P < 0.05) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD, P < 0.01), increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) (P < 0.05) and diamine oxidase (DAO, P < 0.01), and increased serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN, P < 0.01) and creatinine (CRE, P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In conclusion, the addition of 30 g.kg-1 PQ to diet would improve the growth performance, digestion, immune and antioxidation and ameliorate the liver and kidney functions of growing pigs, and the inclusion rate of 70 g.kg-1 PQ in diet would reduce the growth performance as well as the serum immunoglobulins and T-SOD, and increase the serum BUN and CRE of growing pigs. <EOD> Mucosal and systemic immune responses after oral immunization with plasmacytoid dendritic cells pulsed with VP6 protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus\n\n2022) Mucosal and systemic immune responses after oral immunization with plasmacytoid dendritic cells pulsed with VP6 protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.\nPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a swine coronavirus; the VP6 of PEDV is a common viral antigen of the Alphacoronaviruses. Since oral administration of VP6-pulsed plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) has been demonstrated to have good immune protection against PEDV, it is important to investigate the possible mechanism of immunity after oral administration of VP6-pulsed in pDCs. In this study, we found that oral administration of pDCs pulsed with the VP6 of PEDV led to higher levels of VP6-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in serum, feces, and intestinal washouts at each time point (2wk, 4wk, 6wk and 24wk postimmunization) in piglets compared to those of the control groups.

This infertility may be due to pelvic adhesions and surgery but also because of poor oocyte quality. It is known that endometriosis is associated with an increase oxidative stress, wich induce chronic inflammation, deleterious effect for DNA, proteins and can caused cellular death. ROS markers found in follicular fluid or in serum are significatively higher in endometriosis women. The investigators want to dose a marker of apoptosis in infertile women and see if it's significatively higher in serum and in follicular fluid of patients with endometriosis compared to others infertility causes and if it's correlated to oocyte quality and IVF results. Real time PCR will be used to dose cell free DNA in serum and follicular fluid of patients undergoing IVF treatment (endometriosis and infertility due to tubal factor, male infertility or idiopathic cause).

Therefore, a precise assessment of ovarian steroids is essential to any study relating ovarian steroid concentrations with follicular and luteal development and/or function. Recently, we demonstrated the development and evaluation of a specific, and relatively simple method to extract and quantify steroids contained within complex biological fluids as well as within follicular fluids. We have attempted to use this method to quantify oestradiol metabolites present within the plasma and follicle fluids of 20 patients who had undergone laparoscopy for treatment of reproductive problems with a secondary finding of atrophic ovaries. Plasma was obtained from an antecubital vein in four of the 20 patients from which follicular fluid was also obtained. A 70 microl sample of plasma was extracted with dichloromethane in order to obtain an internal standard and then deconjugated. The extraction efficiency of conjugated steroids was > 85%. The concentration of oestradiol metabolites (conjugated + deconjugated) in plasma, venous ovarian blood and follicular fluid (FF) was estimated by radioimmunoassay. The recovery of oestradiol conjugated metabolites was 50% of the total (deconjugated + conjugated) metabolites. Follicular fluid concentrations of oestradiol metabolites were twofold higher than those in ovarian venous plasma in only three of the 20 patients. The total oestradiol extracted from the ovarian venous plasma samples was fivefold higher than that in plasma samples obtained from the same patients antecubital vein. Oestradiol values of either plasma or follicle fluid are likely to underestimate actual follicular fluid levels by omitting the contribution of the conjugated metabolites present. Therefore, we suggest a correction factor of 5 to be applied to oestradiol fluorescence values obtained from either plasma or follicle fluids to arrive at the correct follicle fluid oestradiol content. <EOD> Interaction of antibody specific for a human melanoma-associated antigen with human and murine melanoma cells in mixed culture.\nThe mouse monoclonal antibody B27 (IgG3) was found to react with a subset of melanoma cells. B27 reacted with only 4 of 32 (12.5%) human melanoma specimens, and 6 of 6 tumor cell lines established from metastatic lesions. B27 did not react with the cellular components of normal melanocytes, normal glia, normal blood elements, or normal epithelial cells of various organs. In a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay, B27 killed cell lines derived only from patients with metastatic melanoma, which was confirmed by subsequent studies in which B27 bound to the surface of only metastatic melanoma cells and reacted with the antigen only when the cells were grown in serum-free media. B27 bound to the antigen on the surface of the melanoma cells and not to antigens shared by epithelial cells. As demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies with metastatic melanoma cell lines, B27 did not react with antigens shared by other tumors commonly seen in human melanoma patients. When the B27 antibody was reacted with either human or murine melanoma cells under dissociated culture conditions, it preferentially reacted with the murine melanoma cells, a finding suggestive of complement-",

        "summary": "Background Patients experiencing problems with their conventional maxillary denture can benefit from implant- retained overdentures. Several retention systems are available. These retention systems can be roughly divided into bar-retained implant overdentures, in which multiple implants are splinted and the overdenture is attached through retentive clips, and into retention systems using non-splinted solitary attachments (locators). Evidence on maxillary implant overdenture attachment systems has been mostly short to medium term, non-comparing or retrospective. Even more, 10-years data of comparative studies are lacking.\nMain research question To compare treatment outcomes of fully edentulous patients with maxillary overdentures, supported by four implants, retained by either bars or locators . The primary objective of the study is to analyze marginal bone level changes by radiological assessments at 10-years follow-up. Secondary objectives are implant and overdenture survival, condition of peri- implant mucosa and patients' satisfaction.\nDesign (including population, confounders/outcomes) The study design is an observational study of a group of patients which were treated 10 years ago with dental implants and an overdenture in the maxilla because of problems with retention and stability with their conventional denture. Outcomes: primary outcome is the change in marginal peri-implant bone level 10 years after placing the overdenture. Secondary outcome measures will be implant and overdenture survival, peri-implant mucosa health and patients' satisfaction using a questionnaire.",

It has also been identified to display functions in kidney formation, thyroid, gastric cellular differentiation, and myelination of the central nervous system. It is considered a poor progression biomarker for numerous cancers, although it has been found to play a pivotal role in brain cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and liver cancer. Studies have shown a differential expression of TTF1 in the prostate. Its expression in prostate cancer has attracted attention since it is not expressed in normal prostate tissue. This review summarizes current knowledge of the relationship between TTF1 with the progression and outcome of prostate cancer.ARTICLE HISTORY\n\n# Introduction\nThe prostate cancer (PC) tumor microenvironment (TME)-including cancer cells and stroma-regulates tumor growth and dissemination in many human cancers. Improved knowledge in PC TME is a necessity for identifying targets for new therapies aimed at slowing disease progression and the metastatic spread of the tumor. The thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1, also known as NKX2.1) has proven to play a crucial role in prostate cancer progression. It is a homeodomain protein with three important domains: a homeodomain, a Trefoil motif domain, and a DNA-binding domain. The Trefoil motif domain is important for cell adhesion, migration, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. The NKX homeodomain is a transcription factor containing a specific DNA-binding sequence that is involved in cell differentiation. This factor is found in a number of tissues including lung, kidney, and many other tissues.\nRecent evidence has shown that TTF1 has a unique role in cancer. Cancer tissue often shows expression of TTF1, but its expression in normal tissue is rare. TTF1 is involved in growth, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. Its aberrant expression in cancer tissues has proven to have an essential role in tumorigenesis. The expression of TTF1 in normal cells and its potential role in PC has been highlighted. TTF1 is now considered a progression biomarker in a number of cancers,",

Thymoglobulin was evaluated in lung transplants at 3 mg/kg/d for 2 days. Twenty\u2010five sequential lung transplant patients received rabbit anti\u2010thymocyte globulin in 1995, another 25 in 1996. A retrospective analysis was completed for 12 months. The rate of rejection was significantly higher (14 vs. 11, p 500 \u03bcmol/L, 11 vs. 16, p 440 \u03bcmol/L. Two patients had antibiotic prophylaxis. The first used a 5\u2010day regimen of vancomycin and ciprofloxacin and the second a 2\u2010week course of ciprofloxacin/metronidazole. Two patients developed P. jirovecii pneumonia; antifungal prophylaxis was not used. The patients on vancomycin/ciprofloxacin had a median course of steroids of 9 days, whereas the second course was prolonged at 13 days, but these values were not statistically significant. Patients from the earlier course required a longer course of steroids. There were no serious complications. Patients who received steroids with thymoglobulin induction had prolonged courses of steroids, but no infectious complications were noted except for 2 cases of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be indicated in patients after thymoglobulin induction. <EOD> A comprehensive evaluation of the antifungal activity of chitosan and its combinations with plant extracts against the common fungal pathogens of tomato\nAbstract The present study was aimed at evaluating the fungicidal activity of chitosan (CTS), its combinations with plant extracts and the inhibitory effects of their treatments on fungal growth, disease development and yield attributes of tomato (Solanum lycopersicuum) plants against Fusarium oxysporum and F. solani. The in vivo inhibitory effect of CTS against the tested fungi was assessed by mycelia growth inhibition (MGI), and in vivo growth suppression (IGS), while the in vitro effect was estimated by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The synergistic effect of cinnamon and grape seed plants extracts (PE) in the combinations with different concentrations of CTS on the pathogenic in vitro fungal growth was also estimated using Chaverr\u00f3n et al (2013) index. The combinations of the tested fungi with 500, 1000, 1500 mg l\u20131 of CTS were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the percentage of MGI and IGS and also decreased (P < 0.01) the incidence of the studied fungi in the soil. High values of the MGI, IGS and MIC for both pathogens were recorded for the 1500 mg l\u20131 of CTS. In vitro growth suppression index estimated that combination of GPE-CTS and CSE-CTS were the most effective. The antagonist effect of GPE and CSE was synergistically increased with increase of CTS concentrations. It may be concluded that the GPE and CSE was effective alternatives to chemical pesticides for use as safe and biodegradable antifungal agents against tomato fungal pathogens. <EOD> A novel approach to estimate soil organic carbon pools in the European Soil Data Network\nWe describe a soil data\u2010inverted approach that can retrieve sub\u2010horizontal soil properties from large\u2010extent soil maps.

        "summary": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common gastroenterological disorders with a reported prevalence of 10% to 20% percent in Europe and the USA and less than 5% in Asia. GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores. Further the modulation of anxiety on the severity of reflux symptoms such as fullness, heartburn and dysphagia is examined.",

Previously, we reported that p53 abnormalities were detected in only 35% of soft tissue and bone sarcomas. In this study we investigated p53 status in more soft tissue and bone sarcomas, and extended our evaluation to include analysis of squamous cell carcinomas and endometrial carcinomas. Since exons 5 to 8, in which 80% of all reported mutations are located, were sequenced in p53 (7), we wanted to test a new assay that detects point mutations in any of the 10 exons of p53. For this assay (PCR-SSCP), we used genomic DNA directly from the tumor specimen. Amplification, denaturation and electrophoresis of the PCR-SSCP products was performed according to the method of T. Man, which was designed to improve the sensitivity of the SSCP technique. We compared results of this PCR-SSCP method with the previously published method (RT-PCR with immunochemistry). This PCR-SSCP assay, in which normal tissue is used as template for control, appears to be better for detecting point mutations in the p53 gene than the mutant-allele-specific PCR (MAS-PCR) assay. The 14 bone sarcomas investigated for mutations in this study by the PCR-SSCP method yielded good results: In 8 cases (57%) there were mutations in the exon 7 (encoding the putative zinc finger region), in 7 cases (50%) in exon 8 (encoding the C-terminus) and in 2 cases (14%) a point mutation was present in exon 5 (encoding the 1st zinc finger). These data suggest that mutations in the p53 genes play an important role in the pathogenesis of bone sarcomas. <EOD> Assessment of in vitro cyt",

The Doppler investigation of the uterine arteries in pregnant women carrying IUGR fetuses revealed a lower resistance index and an increase in the ratio of peak velocity flow to terminal flow. The data obtained have shown the diagnostic value of the Doppler examination of the uterine arteries in the evaluation of the vascular function of the uteroplacental complex in pregnant women carrying IUGR fetuses. <EOD> Connexin 30 Expression Is Increased during Permanent Inactivation of Cerebellar Nuclei\n\nThe expression of connexin 30 (Cx30), the major gap junction protein in Purkinje cells, was evaluated with a set of specific antibodies with different immunogen/antigen epitopes during Permanent Inactivation of Cerebellar Nuclei (PICN) in the cerebellum of adult rats. Our results show increased Cx30 levels at all nuclear and Purkinje cell layers, being the strongest increase in granule cells during PICN, and a lower increase observed in molecular layer cells, compared to the contralateral cerebellum. The changes in Cx30 expression patterns may be considered a compensatory mechanism produced in the adult rat cerebellum to decrease the disinhibition generated by PICN.\n\n# Introduction\nThe cerebral cortex has numerous synapses and long-range projections, which require a powerful excitatory transmission to regulate neural circuits. To this end, neurons must have a high amount of neurotransmitter receptors on their membranes in order to maintain a proper synaptic communication, but in some pathological situations the density of receptors on cell membranes may decrease generating an excessive attenuation of synaptic responses   Modulation of synaptic transmission by endocannabinoids, Lovinger     Effect of glutamate receptors on the regulation of synaptic transmission in the..., Lovinger     The role of serotonergic drugs in neuroprotection, Grzegorz     Acetylcholinesterase and adamantyl acetylcholinesterase blockers prevent muscarinic hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis: a novel..., Medina     GABA(B) receptor ligands prevent seizure activity induced by a GluR6-focused epileptogenic system, Jimenez  .

        "summary": "Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common genetic predisposition syndrome for colorectal cancer (CRC), responsible for around 2-4% of cancers. It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in this specific population. To this end, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing CAD EYE with CE in patients with LS.",

When polyps are detected, they are rigorously described and histological prediction of the endoscopist reported. Then polyps will be removed by polypectomy or mucosectomy. Removed polyps are then sent for anatomopathologic analysis.\n\nIn a subset of 40 patients, the endoscopist's description and the CAD EYE prediction will be compared.\n\nAt the end of the procedure, CAD EYE analysis is made retrospectively from the images acquired during examination. Only the histological report of the removed polyps defines the final diagnosis. This will be reported to the study sponsor within 6 months after the end of the trial or within 3 months after the end of the individual protocol for patients still included in the trial.

Although serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), quantitative serum immune electrophoresis (SIE), immunoelectrophoresis (IEP), and serum protein immunofixation (SPI) were repeatedly normal, a polyclonal component could not be ruled out by IEP and SPI performed on the patient's serum diluted with the patient's urine at a molar ratio of 1:10.

This study supports the hypothesis that \"preamyloid,\" the precursor of amyloidogenic monoclonal immunoglobulins, may arise not only in plasma cells, being the origin of the amyloid fibrils, but also in normal cells, playing no pathogenetic role.

        "summary": "Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now recommended as a first-line option in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation. However, current international clinical practice guidelines and product inserts suggest caution and/or avoidance in using DOACs in case of potential potential drug-drug interactions (DDI), including DDI with anticancer therapies. Indeed, potential important DDIs can affect the efficacy and safety of DOACs and/or anticancer therapies and/or other interfering medications in these patients. Data about the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DOACs in cancer patients are scarce. By using a PK approach, this study aims :\nto describe the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting\nto identify factors (age, weight, renal function, co-morbidities, etc) influencing the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting.",

PopPK analysis evaluates drug exposure in relationship to therapeutic outcome.\n\n\nStudy Expected Outcomes\n=================\n* Assessment of rivaroxaban exposure in cancer patients compared to previously reported in non-cancer patients (i.e., Phase I clinical trial and real-life experience).\n* Assessment of apixaban exposure in cancer patients compared to previously reported in non-cancer patients (Phase I clinical trial).\n* Identification of covariates influencing rivaroxaban and apixaban exposure in cancer patients.\n* Identification of covariates influencing cancer patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban (cancer) compared to rivaroxaban or apixaban controls (e.g. AF or VTE).\n* Identification of clinical correlates of rivaroxaban and apixaban exposure in cancer patients.\n* Population pharmacokinetic evaluation of rivaroxaban and apixaban concentrations adjusted with cancer patients characteristics including sex, age, weight, renal function, DDI, etc.: * DDI includes concomitant antitumoral treatments such as: anthracyclines, taxanes, oxaliplatin etc.\n* Potential impact of the DDI on drug exposure (AUC):\nAdjustment for weight using allometric method (body weight)\nAdjustment for renal function using (eGFR)\nAdjustment for sex:\nRivaroxaban: women are known to be more sensitive to DOACs than men (AUC in women is a little bit higher)\nApixaban: to our knowledge no gender-related difference of apixaban pharmacokinetics.\n* Potential impact of the DDI on exposure-effect relationship\n\nWhat is rivaroxaban?\n\n\n\nRivaroxaban is the brand name for a drug that is a highly potent, orally active, direct, highly selective, competitive inhibitor of the enzyme activated factor X bound in plasma. Direct Factor Xa inhibitors like rivaroxaban prevent the natural breakdown of blood clots and prevents blood clots from forming and/or growing. Rivaroxaban does not require frequent laboratory monitoring as the patient's exposure to the drug remains relatively stable at steady-state. It is approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for the postoperative period following hip or knee replacement.\n\n\n\nWhat are the side effects?\n\n\nRivaroxaban can result in increased bleeding (bruising, nosebleeds, epistaxis), and bleeding at other sites (e.g. intracranial, gastrointestinal, gingival, gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleedings). Severe bleeding can lead to life-threatening conditions including intracranial hemorrhage or death.\n\n\n\n\n## Why are cancer patients on rivaroxaban? \nThe use of rivaroxaban may have the benefits over conventional anticoagulants in cancer patients because it is rapidly absorbed (less interference of anticoagulated food) and does not require laboratory monitoring (lesser inconvenience to patient), and can be associated with less bleeding events. However, clinicians should note that rivaroxaban has a small elimination half-life of 12 hours in healthy volunteers, and a relatively large number of these individuals had an international normalized ratio (INR) above therapeutic range on the last day of drug intake (12 individuals; 12/60; 20%); this can be of increased concern when used in cancer patients receiving concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs. It should not be used concomitantly with direct FXa inhibitors, unless approved drug-drug interaction studies confirm this is feasible and not harmful.\nCancer is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and stroke and the risk is increased by other factors such as a poor performance status, prior vascular surgery, incisional surg",

In Vero cells, SV5 replicated more efficiently than VSV. The expression of the beta-interferon (beta-IFN) gene, as measured by luciferase (LUC) reporter activity, was 3-4 times higher in Vero cells infected with SV5 or with VSV than in uninfected cells, being maximal (at 24-48 h post infection) at lower virus titers. However, in MLE cells, SV5 replicated poorly compared with VSV, and beta-IFN production at high levels was observed at 24 h post infection; thereafter, the replication of VSV also decreased significantly. In MLE cells infected with SV5, at high multiplicities of infection, beta-IFN mRNA, protein and LUC activity were observed at 36 or 48 h, indicating that expression from the SV5 genome was enhanced at comparable multiplicities of infection (at 36 or 48 h). In summary, the levels of the induction of the beta-IFN gene promoted by SV5 were much higher in Vero cells than in MLE cells, although only at low levels of SV5 infection in MLE occurred. It followed that expression of the beta-IFN gene depends on multiplicities of infection in epithelial cells such as MLE cells. <EOD> In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Essential Oils from Artemisia scoparia ssp.

New and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity.\nThis study looks to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of such a model, using rehabilitation technology to enrich and enhance delivery of rehabilitation within an NHS inpatient stroke unit environment. This model of rehabilitation delivery has already been tested by the research team with community-dwelling participants in the chronic phase of stroke (over a year since stroke) and is known to be feasible and safe. Participants will be recruited from the stroke unit at University Hospital Wishaw during the acute and sub-acute phase of stroke (0-6 months since stroke), if requiring rehabilitation following a stroke and deemed medically fit enough to participate. Participants will be supported to complete activities in a newly dedicated 'technology enriched rehabilitation space' by NHS staff, in addition to their usual treatment. This will enable participants to engage in rehabilitation activities relating to their physical, cognitive, visual, communication and functional goals using equipment such as an adapted treadmill, interactive screens and tablets, upper limb exercise devices, power-assisted gym equipment and virtual reality. All devices are commercially available and known to be safe for use with stroke patients, however the use of such devices within NHS services is currently known to be under-utilised.

Several studies have reported the positive impact of antibiotic susceptibility testing performed on urine cultures on the appropriate use of antibiotics.\nThe selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing , defined as the restriction of the list of antibiotics mentioned in the report according to the antibiotic resistance profile, would allow, according to observational studies, a reduction of 25 to 70% of the initial prescriptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics and a 20% rate of antibiotic de-escalation (=reduction of the antibacterial spectrum of an antibiotic treatment after re-evaluation).\nThe objective is to assess the impact of disseminating a selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing on the dispensing of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) for E. coli positive urine cultures in adult women, compared to the dissemination of a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing.",

Selective reporting aims to restrict the antibiotics that can be prescribed to women experiencing uncomplicated cystitis. As the standard antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) report includes all antibiotic susceptibility profiles, the clinician needs to choose among available antibiotics. For patients with uncomplicated cystitis, the antibiotic susceptibility report is generally based on the 2007 European urinary tract infection (UTI) guidelines. These guidelines suggest using amoxicillin/ampicillin or nitrofurantoin for the treatment of uncomplicated lower UTI. Ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins could be used only when antibiotic susceptibility tests show resistance to amoxicillin/ampicillin and/or when nitrofurantoin is contraindicated 2 . However, over time, resistance to each antibiotic has been increasing",

Materials and methods: The human oral squamous carcinoma cell line of KB-3-1 (human oral squamous cells carcinoma) was purchased from Nawah Scientific Inc. (Cairo, Egypt). The cells were grown on plastic tissue culture dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). The cells were seeded into 96-well plates in 200 lL DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 in a humidity incubator. After 24 hours, the cells were incubated with serial dilutions of both plant extracts in culture medium for 72 hours. The cells were then assessed by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium)-based cell proliferation kit and IC 50 determination (concentration at which the treated cells were inhibited by 50% in comparison to control ones). Results: The cytotoxic concentrations were obtained by adding 20 lL of the extract to the wells in the culture plates in duplicate. Then, the plates were left for 24 hours to allow the treated cells' recovery before MTT solution was added to the wells and they were incubated for 4 h. The result showed that the cytotoxic concentrations of T. platyphyllos extract (TP) versus the methanolic extract from T. americana (TM) were 220 lg/mL versus 200 lg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, T. platyphyllos extracted by ethanol had a greater cytotoxic effect on the human oral squamous carcinoma cell line KB-3-1, as shown by IC 50 values of 197 lg/mL and 220 lg/mL, respectively. Conclusion: T. platyphyllos extract had higher cytotoxic activity than T. americana extract on the oral squamous cell carcinoma. These methanolic or ethanolic extracts from Tilia americana and T. platyphyllos could be useful for developing drugs against human oral squamous carcinoma cell lines.\n\n# Introduction\nHuman oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSC) is a common form of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Researchers intend to show how the use of a virtual coach is more effective in preoperative weight reduction prior to ventral hernia repair over usual care. Correspondingly, this may lower unplanned hospital readmissions. For this clinical trial, where randomization is not possible, the study team will implement the use of propensity score matching that sorts individuals into different study arms as if randomly assigned. The primary outcome is the average net amount of time-dependent weight change per group over six months. Secondary outcomes are for the intervention group, patient satisfaction with the virtual coach and for both groups, quality of life. In addition, areas of social and economic disadvantage will be identified that may contribute to higher obesity rates. Machine learning (ML) modeling will be used to determine the important features for weight lost over the course of the study. The impact of this work will be to demonstrate efficacy and realized workflow efficiencies within a hospital-based surgery clinic.",

We report the findings of histopathological and cytological studies of 12 cases of adenocarcinoma obtained before and after NAC. Methods: The pre-, post- and final curettage specimens from 12 patients with endometrial cancer were submitted to morphological and immunohistochemical study. Results: In 5 cases (41.6%) the pretreatment specimen showed squamous differentiation. In 7 cases (58.3%) the cytology was diagnostic of carcinoma. 5 of 12 tumors were considered resistant (<90% necrosis), but 7 tumors had >90% necrosis and were therefore considered responders to NAC in our study. 3 cases presented cell clusters with a clear cytoplasm and central areas of necrosis. 2 cases presented papillary fragments. The treatment was well tolerated by all patients. The only complication was pain during curettage in 1 case. Conclusion: NAC was an effective method of decreasing the extent of surgical procedures and facilitating local control, and should be offered to some subset of patients with advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma when the primary tumor is surgically unresectable. <EOD> A rapid method for detecting Salmonella spp. on foods using a polyclonal immunoglobulin Y-stabilized whole-cell O/W emulsion\nA new immunochromatographic method was developed to detect Salmonella spp. on fruits, vegetable leaves, and grains. Salmonella serogroup O antigens were stabilized by adsorption to polyclonal immunoglobulin Y (IgY) stabilized with a liposome system to eliminate the interference of organic fluids present in foods. The assay can be completed (incubating the test sample in a tube) within 1 h of receiving a sample. Two polyclonal IgYs produced in chickens and rabbits against the O antigens of Salmonella (Salmonella group B, C2, and D1) were mixed with a suspension of Salmonella to create the immunochromatographic test strip. All 84 serotypes, belonging to the 22 subgroups, could be detected by the immunochromatographic test strip, although the Salmonella enterica spp. Enteritidis (ET), I 4,[5],12:i :, and Heidelberg O:19 could not be detected. The specificity of the assay in identifying three serotypes differing from Salmonella spp. was 99.2%. In testing more than 6,300 fruits, vegetable leaves, and grains, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatographic test strip were 85.3 and 88.8%, respectively, indicating good accuracy. The results showed that this test strip would be useful as a sensitive, specific method of rapid detection of Salmonella spp. in foods. <EOD> Comparison of Intravenous and Oral Fosfomycin (Fosfan\u00ae) Activity in an Experimental Enterococcus faecium Strain Infection In Mice\nSummary The effect of different routes of administration of fosfomycin (Fosfan\u00ae) was studied in an experimental Enterococcus faecium infection in mice.
