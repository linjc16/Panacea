        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",

Objectives: To explore possible ADHD-specific pharmacotherapy use patterns that differ between patients with vs without co-occurring dyslexia. Methods: Based on claims data, 30,354 patients with ADHD were stratified into clusters based on comorbidities with dyslexia at diagnosis. Results: A total of 7.2% (n = 2144) of patients within this ADHD sample were included into one of four different clusters, showing a comorbid ADHD-and-dyslexia prevalence of 17.8% (n = 1062). Within the ADHD population, patients with/without dyslexia were similar in age, sex distribution as well as utilization of non-pharmaceutical treatments, except for psychology services (8.4% more often utilized vs not used in ADHD + dyslexia). Compared with ADHD patients without dyslexia, those with dyslexia used psychotherapy and special schooling more frequently. At least one medicine was more frequently prescribed for ADHD + dyslexia patients. The most commonly prescribed were atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and bupropion, respectively. Atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine and methylphenidate showed significantly shorter DDDs for pharmacotherapy in ADHD + dyslexia patients, compared with ADHD patients without dyslexia. Additionally, medicines with more often used pharmaceutical treatments in the ADHD-only group compared with the overall population. Conclusions: Comorbid ADHD and dyslexia resulted in different patterns regarding pharmacotherapy, especially with regard to the prescription behavior. This implies that pharmacotherapy needs/dosages might differ between ADHD patients with and without dyslexia and thus that clinical diagnosis might be necessary to adjust treatment. Overall, the results highlight the need for additional research on the comorbidity of ADHD and dyslexia, especially regarding pharmacotherapy indication.\n\n# Introduction\nAttention-deficit-/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder comprising impaired attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which can lead to a wide range of comorbidities and negative effects on patients' development, functioning, and social integration. ADHD, in all probability, is more frequent than previously believed when compared to the officially defined patient population. For example, a recent German survey of approximately 10,000 children and adolescents with the same mean age as those who reportedly receive outpatient care for ADHD (10.5 years) showed that 3.3% (= 330/10,144) already had a confirmed ADHD diagnosis in the year before the study's survey start. Moreover, a German multicenter study carried out between October 2011 and December 2012 identified ADHD in 13.5% (= 307/2268) of all children interviewed (aged 6 to 8 years; 51% (= 1145/2268) of all interviewed children had at least one mental health problem).\nIn line with findings in other, mainly larger international studies, ADHD comorbidities can be diverse and range from anxiety disorders, depression, sleep disorders, substance abuse, or obesityas well as learning difficulties such as dyslexia (i.e., a persistent disorder affecting the ability to read), impairments in concentration, comprehension, and memory, which persist throughout their lifetime or significantly interf",

This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of ocular adverse events associated with the use of antiepileptic drugs among Nepali patients with epilepsy. This hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, College of Medical Sciences, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal, from May to December 2022. It included Nepalese patients aged >18 years diagnosed with epilepsy attending the Epilepsy clinic of Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 20.0) and R Studio. A total of 330 patients were included in the study, with a mean (\u00b1SD) age 33.95 (\u00b114.06) years. Out of total patients, 196 (59.7%) were male. Among the study patients, 72 (21.8%) patients had used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for \u226510 years. The most commonly prescribed AEDs were oxcarbazepine (65; 19.7%) and Zonisamide (60; 18.2%). In the past 2 years, 15 (4.5%) patients were diagnosed with cataract. Moreover, three (0.9%) patients had experienced blurred vision, and two (0.6%) patients had cataract surgery done. Furthermore, 2 (0.6%) had experienced conjunctival hemorrhage and six (1.8%) had visual impairment within the last year. The incidence of ocular events in this study was lower than those reported in previous studies. The present study concludes that ocular adverse events are not uncommon, but their occurrence is lower than in previous studies. The results might be due to improvements in drug combinations, pharmacotherapy, and the management of epileptic patients during recent years. <EOD> Bactericidal Properties of Synthetic \u03b5-polylysine-based Antimicrobial Coatings.\nToday, it is necessary to protect foods from contaminants due to the increasing number of microbial pathogens, the increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and consumer awareness.

What is the effect of virtual reality on anxiety management before abdominal surgery? Which technique is the best and most effective for preoperative anxiety management? Variables of the Research Preoperative anxiety scale/level Data Collection Tools Patient Information Form, VAS-A and a smart wristband with stress level measurement feature will be used to collect data. Form-1. Patient Information Form: It is a form consisting of sociodemographic questions created by the researchers. Form-2. Visual Anxiety Scale (VAS-A): The Numerical Anxiety Severity Scale consists of a horizontal line that begins with the expression 0 or no anxiety and ends with the expression 100 or severe anxiety. The patient is asked to choose the number that best describes the pain, between 0 and 100, by showing the scale. The result of the scale was evaluated over the arithmetic mean (Carr et al 2005; Kindler et al 2000). Smart Wristband: A smart wristband with photoplethysmography (PPG) feature that detects and reports stress-related changes will be used. After assessing whether the data fit the normal distribution with the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, if the data fit the normal distribution, parametric tests (Single Sample t-Test, One- and Multi-Way Analysis of Variance, Spearman's Correlation Analysis); if the data do not fit the normal distribution, non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskall Wallis Test, Friedman Test, Pearson's Correlation Analysis) will be used. Mean, standard deviation and percentage distribution methods will be used in the descriptive analysis of the data. The power of the sample will be calculated with the post hoc analysis to be made.

Here, we sequenced three mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, cytochrome b, and the control region) for four Rieppeleon samples and 35 samples of other members of the squamate branch of the amniote tree from GenBank. We conducted phylogenetic analyses on the concatenated dataset (n = 94) including other rieppeleontid and squamate sequences retrieved from GenBank (n = 18) using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ML), Maximum Parsimony (MP), Distance (neighbor joining and unweighted pair\u2010group method with arithmetic mean), and Bayesian estimation. For the three mitochondrial genes, we sequenced an additional 10 Rieppeleon samples and compared two methods of DNA extraction: the standard phenol/chloroform method, and a magnetic bead\u2010based method for DNA extraction. Both methods consistently produced high\u2010quality DNA samples, and the magnetic bead\u2010based protocol decreased the amount of time required for extraction by roughly 50%. Sequencing of all three mitochondrial markers produced a well\u2010resolved tree with strong bootstrap support. Members of the family Rieppeleontidae are well\u2010supported as sister to geckos (Squamata: Gekkota). The genus Rieppeleon is sister to Angolacerta (Squamata), and therefore, to Rieppeleontidae. Both the MP, neighbor joining, and NJ analyses of the concatenated data support the grouping of Rieppeleon as the basal group of geckos. The DNJ and UPGMA results do not completely agree with the rest of the results. Overall, our results show increased resolution within the Rieppeleontidae and increased phylogenetic stability, with strong support for both Rieppeleon as the basal group for Geckos and the family Rieppeleontidae as the sister clade to Geckos. <EOD> Rheumatoid factors: past, present and future.\nRheumatoid factors (RFs) are autoantibodies against the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G. The detection of circulating RFs, originally in the late 1960s, was a pioneering step towards identifying autoantibodies. RFs are found in 60% to 80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and are associated with severe joint damage. In addition to their utility as a diagnostic aid, RFs represent a unique model to investigate B-cell memory. In this review, we will describe the use of RFs as diagnostic and prognostic markers for rheumatoid arthritis, the generation of naturally occurring RFs during aging, development and the immunomodulatory potential of RFs. RFs have the potential to serve as surrogate markers to define and treat dysregulated humoral immunity in autoimmune disorders. This will guide the development and testing of novel therapies. <EOD> Fatal Pasteurella multocida pneumonia following traumatic dental injury.\nA 15-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department after sustaining a traumatic dental injury at a hockey practice while wearing a full face shield.

        "summary": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axon damage. Affecting approximately 2.5 million individuals around the world and seen mostly in young adults, MS can cause different levels of disability in functional activities, cause limitations in social and professional life, and impair quality of life. Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that develops on the basis of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Nutritional habits and physical activity are important environmental factors. These can be effective in the course of MS and change the quality of life. Compatibility of nutrition with the Mediterranean diet and providing adequate physical activity may be beneficial in increasing physical and mental well-being in general, and therefore the quality of life of the person.\nIn our country, there is not enough information about the ongoing nutritional habits and physical activity levels of MS patients in their daily lives, and quality of life studies are limited. Our limited knowledge on these issues narrows the possibility of movement in an area that can be corrected in MS patients and thus have a positive impact on their quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters.",

Materials and Methods:Records of 672 patients diagnosed with renal cell cancer were examined. The revised AJCC TNM, the old American Cancer Society, and new AJCC staging systems were compared. Results:Age, gender, presenting symptom, and past smoking status were not significant independent prognostic factors. A stage II renal cell carcinoma patient was 50% less likely to have died compared with a patient in a higher disease stage. An overall survival (OS) time of 16.9 months was found to be the threshold separating prognosis into good and bad categories, with survival of 17 months or less representing \u201cnot a good prognosis.\u201d The new AJCC TNM staging system improved discrimination compared with the old American Cancer Society staging. The AJCC TNM system yielded improved prognostic discrimination compared with the old staging system. The AJCC, TNM predicted an overall 5-year survival rate of 65% (95% CI, 61.7\u201368.3%). The new staging system was more predictive of survival than the old American Cancer Society staging system, and the revised AJCC appeared most useful in clinical studies by categorizing a sizeable group of patients (stage II) at low risk compared with the other 2 classifications. Conclusions:The most significant change of the 1997 AJCC TNM staging system was the reduction of the number of groups from four to three based on tumor size and the addition of nodal status as a criterion for T stage. The revised AJCC staging system provides a more clinically useful prognostic classification for patients with renal cell carcinoma. <EOD> FDA Drug Approvals, Mechanism of Actions, and Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Pain: Part 2.\nChronic pain is a significant medical problem in this country and worldwide. Recent national efforts, including the National Pain Strategy, have called for changes in the way chronic pain management is approached. One part of these efforts emphasizes the development of new therapies for chronic pain via randomized controlled trials leading to regulatory approval for these new therapies. This article (part 2 of a 3-part series) describes the FDA drug approvals and mechanism of actions for therapies developed to meet these goals during the period 2013 to the present. A brief comment on pain medication formulations approved between 2010 and 2012, not covered in part 1 of this series, is also included. The FDA approved 43 new therapies for chronic pain from March 2013 through November 2021. Most approvals were for products containing opioids (n = 17), gabapentin-containing (n = 6), and melatonin-containing formulations (n = 4). The mechanisms of action for each of these new approaches has been described in part 1 of this series. Although a review of the literature suggests that many patients with chronic pain who receive these new therapies will have relief, there is currently very limited evidence demonstrating long-term effects on the opioid and other substance use disorders, nonaddiction drug use, and mental health disorders that complicate chronic pain management and often drive continued demand for new therapies. Therefore, this third part of this series focuses on therapies for chronic pain that are currently in development. <EOD> Fertilization of maturing oocytes stimulates glucose transport via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in pig oocytes.\nReproductive systems have adapted to the ovarian cycle in a way that facilitates the resumption of meiosis and the transition to early embryogenesis.

While clinical symptoms are considered dopaminergic, cortical mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we used fMRI to investigate the neural substrates of tic generation in TS before and after pharmacologically modulated states. Twenty-three adults with TS and age-matched controls were scanned during a tactile finger localizer task, followed by two 10-min tasks to evaluate the relationship between tics and the cortical motor network. Subjects tapped their fingertips during a simple buttonbox finger-tapping task (FT) and were asked to withhold tics when possible. Control subjects showed only somatosensory responses to finger stimulation. Twice as many (n = 650) tics occurred in the FT (Ft) as in the withholding task (without tics: Wt). TS subjects showed bilateral fMRI activation of the primary somatosensory areas (S1) corresponding to the tic locations, with only one subject displaying activation of the secondary somatosensory areas (S2). Tics occurring in S1 during Ft activated bilateral motor cortex (M1), whereas tics occurring in S2 during the withdrawal state (Wt) failed to generate M1 activity. The data suggest that generation of TS tics occurs in sensorimotor cortical areas and that the transition of a somatosensory state into an active motor act is cortically regulated.\n\n# Introduction\nTourette syndrome (1-2% of the population   The Tourette syndrome and other phenomenology of motor 26, Comings   is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the upper and lower extremities   Tic disorders: clinical presentation in a tertiary referral sample, Packer     Diagnosis and management of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and other 29..., Cavanna   with motor and vocal tics as its most prominent feature   The tics, voice, and behaviours (TVB) scale: assessing tic-associated behaviours across 378..., Robertson  .

        "summary": "An overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by frequent en nightly voiding, small bladder capacity and the occurrence of sudden urge to void, with or without urinary incontinence. The prevalence of OAB with bothersome complaints is around 11% in women and 9% in men with an increasing incidence with age. OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed. Depending on the patient's characteristics and the physician's preference intravesical injections of Botox or the implantation of a sacral neuromodulator (SNM) can be considered.\nBoth options are equal and effective, but many individual differences exist in preference. Regarding outcome, some factors have been described to prefer one therapy above the other, for example in case of concomitant fecal incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections,\u2026 The personal preference of doctors and patients has been investigated, but currently no study has focused on therapy preference in a culturally and linguistic divers (CALD) population. The latter broadly describes a population with ethnical, cultural, religious and/or language characteristics and is a general accepted measure of diversity.\nIn the current study, the investigators aim to describe the different (dis)advantages of both second line treatments for OAB in a discrete choice experiment. The study population will consist of a diverse group of patients with OAB from different hospitals. The goal is to investigate if CALD patients make a different choice in treatment and what factors contribute to that decision in order to provide more tailored information regarding the treatment options in the future. Taking a patient's context into account in the shared decision making between a patient and physician increases therapy compliance and satisfaction of the chosen treatment.\nThe total questionnaire will consist out of general demographic info, the EQ-5D, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)-OAB and the discrete choice questionnaire in which patients make a choice between two fictional treatment options consisting of a combination of different therapy characteristics.

This paper aimed to provide more information on how a diverse cultural population with OAB rate different OAB treatment methods. A total of 101 patients with OAB filled out questionnaires, a discrete choice experiment, and 1-on-1 interviews. The results showed that a diverse population tends to dislike therapies that do not provide long-lasting improvement. They are also more receptive to side effects and would opt for less invasive treatment options if quality of life was improved.\n\nBackground\n============\nOveractive Bladder (OAB) can be described as an increased urge to urinate that is accompanied by urine leakage, and/or urgency and frequency. Symptoms of overactive bladder can be very disruptive to an individual\u2019s daily activities leading to high costs and poorer quality of life (QOL) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), OAB is defined as urinary discomfort perceived to be related to an overactive, bladder. OAB can affect both men and women at all ages, although it is more commonly found in the elderly. Worldwide, the prevalence of OAB in adults has been calculated to be 16% while prevalence in the elderly has been calculated to be 30% .\n\nManagement of OAB consists of many treatment options including conservative therapies, antimuscarinics, beta agonists, urethral bulking agents, beta mimetic agents, and neuromodulation (sacral neuromodulation, SNM). Currently, botulinum toxin (botulinum A toxin) (onabotulinum toxin A (ONA)) is used as a second-line treatment for OAB . Botulinum toxin is thought to work by blocking presynaptic calcium channels as a result of which bladder contractions are limited . This paper aims to explore to examine the influence that diversity and demographics have upon how a CALD community rates OAB",

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

'Serious Game', an abbreviation of 'Serious Game', means: Game, i.e. a digital entertainment application, but this is a game for educational purposes, i.e. it has a clear purpose, more than just fun.\n\n### What's the difference between serious games and non-educational games?\nSerious games differ from non-educational games in several points. A serious game is not only entertaining, but also brings to our attention an important content.\n\n### How serious games differ from normal software?\nThe software is a set of instructions (or programs) that allows you to control the computer, to change the state of the computers and the information contained within it. These programs are designed to enable us to do certain things. If the software performs a certain function then it is called an APPLICATION. An application uses specific resources such as file systems, web services, access to databases, memory, etc. An APPLICATION is not simply a program.\n\n### What are the most popular game genres?\nOne of the best known genres is the Action genre, in which is included an entire line of sub-genres, called the Action Adventure genre or Action-RPG. The most popular genres, in the following order, are:\n* Action\n* Adventure\n* RPG\n* Arcade\n\nHow to cite this Text\n==============\n\nText citation @article by @author, @authors, and @authors\n\nReferences\n==============\n <EOD> Antithrombotic and antiplatelet effect of T-786, a synthetic anti-inflammatory compound.\nT-786 (2-({3--2-propenyl}amino)benzoate dihydrochloride), a synthetic anti-inflammatory compound, was studied for antithrombotic and antiplatelet activities. At a dose level of 10 mg/kg, T-786 showed inhibitory effects on blood platelet activity with dose-dependence in rats. In addition, T-786 (200-600 mg/kg, p.o.) given once daily for 7 consecutive days showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on thrombosis induced by atherogenic diet, as compared with controls. These results suggest that T-786 might inhibit pathways of thrombogenesis, including blood platelet activity and thrombosis. <EOD> A comparison of the efficacy and safety profile of two fixed-dose combination regimens in treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a multiphase, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the efficacy and safety profile of two fixed-dose combination regimens containing tacrine (18 mg), donepezil (10 mg) and galantamine (6.25 mg) in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA total of 566 patients taking placebo throughout the 24-week acute treatment period were re-randomized to either once daily active treatment of T-DAG (n: 180), AD-P (n: 20), AD-DAG (n: 69), or placebo (n: 275) for 32 weeks, where the dosage regimens remained unchanged and the efficacy was evaluated at Week 56.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients in the T-DAG, AD-P, AD-DAG, and placebo group were administered active treatment for a mean period of 60.4, 12.3, 61.4, and 111.7 days, respectively.

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

And to analyze its evolution over the last decade. To evaluate the factors potentially involved in this evolution.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nObservational descriptive study of the frequency hospitalizations in the pediatric emergency department of the General University Hospital of Albacete, a third level hospital in the province of Castilla La Mancha (Spain) in the period of January 1944 to December 2003, that is, the entire period for which hospitalization statistics have been recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe number of pediatric hospitalizations in the emergency room increased from 36,980 to 40,804 (+4.58%). This increase is largely attributable to the increase in the proportion of foreigners in the pediatric population served from 6.87 to 15.45% (+201%) and in hospitalizations to the emergency unit from 0.07 to 2.00%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe increase in the number of foreign-born children in our department has contributed greatly to the increase in the number of hospitalizations.

Cytochrome (CYP) 1, a superfamily of P450 isoforms in CYP1 gene family, has been implicated in metabolism and detoxification of carcinogens. The CYP1A1 gene is related with susceptibility to lung, breast, esophagus, kidney, colorectal and bile duct carcinogenesis. Our study aimed at evaluating the association of two polymorphisms in the 5 CYP1A1 gene (-6235G>A and -4464C>G) with HNC risk in the Iranian population. A total of 124 HNC patients and 189 cancer-free controls were recruited. Genotyping of variant CYP1A1 at -6235G>A and -4464C>G was determined by polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The genotype frequencies of -6235G>A and -4464C>G polymorphisms of CYP1A1 were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group. There was no relationship between CYP1A1 genotypes and the risk of HNC in this study. The -6235AA (p=0.025) and -6235GG (p=0.020) genotypes revealed higher risk of HNC in recessive models after adjustment for confounding factors. But the -6235, -4464 polymorphisms were not found to be associated with HNC risk in codominant, dominant and allelic models. This is the first study to demonstrate the association of two polymorphisms (rs1048943 and rs4646903) in the 5 CYP1A1 gene with the risk of HNC in Iran.

With GaN grown on GaAs substrates using molecular-beam epitaxy, a series of thin-films and layer structures have been developed, and their optical properties have been investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry. It was found that at low coverage, GaN layers have lower effective refractive indices and larger effective optical band gaps than those of thin-films. The effect of growth time and substrate temperature on the structural and optical properties of thin-films and layers was also investigated. The optical band gap of GaN thin-films and layers was investigated in terms of two-band theories with the measured optical constant. In both GaN films and layers, the effective biaxial strain was calculated to be close to -2% and less than one-half of the GaN bulk strain. <EOD> Reaching out to adolescents: an outpatient program for substance abusers",

Fistulae complicating diverticulitis are the result of a localized perforation into adjacent viscera, and occur in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease[2]. The types of fistulae include colovesical, colovaginal, colotubal, coloenteric, and colocutaneous fistulae[3]. Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely, accounting for 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease[4]. Herein we describe a case of a fistula connecting the sigmoid colon with the left flank-lower lumbar area, due to diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon[5].\nA new over-the-scope clip system, called OTSC (Ovesco Endoscopy, T\u00fcbingen, Germany), appeared on the market about 3 years ago[6]. The system consists of a nitinol clip loaded at the tip of the endoscope that can capture a large amount of tissue and compress the lesion until healed[7]. Results from animal models and initial clinical use support the efficacy of OTSC closure in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding; its role in the management of iatrogenic perforations in humans is less defined, and reports on its use in treating colorectal postsurgical leaks and fistulas are anecdotal [8].

Intubation was performed with 7 lm of cuffed tube and anesthesia (N(2)O + O(2)). Resistance to airflow through a model of the larynx and plasma levels of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) were measured before and during laryngoscopy and intubation. There were no significant differences in laryngeal resistance or plasma E and NE between the two groups of animals. Thus, although glucocorticoid-induced enhancement of the stress response attenuated the development of myosis, these data suggest that laryngoscopy and intubation is not associated with the same stress response that can be identified using other stressors. <EOD> Cranial ultrasound as a prognostic marker of neurological status in premature infants.\nUNLABELLED\nCranial ultrasound (CUS) enables the detection of the primary injury of the brain in preterm infants as well as the assessment of brain development in early postnatal age.

Milk kefir is a traditional food product made with water kefir grains (KGs) and milk. The KG mixture contains a variety of indigenous milk acidifying bacteria and yeast. The fermentation of milk kefir is a complex process involving multiple species of microorganisms including yeasts and bacteria. Bacterial species that have been isolated from milk kefir include Micrococcus lactis, Streptococcus macedonicus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Lacticaseibacillus kefiranofaciens. The Lacticaseibacillus kefiranofaciens (L. kefiranofaciens) is the dominant heterofermentative bacterium in milk kefirand is considered to be the principal strain contributing to the overall fermentation of kefir. It is well known for its ability to produce an interesting biopolymer called kefiran. Kefiran is an extracellular polysaccharide that can be produced by fermentation of L. kefiranofaciens by lactose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and milk powder. Interestingly, kefiran is also considered to be a safe food additive approved by the European Commission. Lacticaseibacillus kefiranofaciens is considered a potential probiotic. It plays an important role in the microbial community of milk kefir. This strain has also been shown to produce 1,3-d-glucose with excellent bifidogenic activity. In addition, it is also used for immune modulation, improving intestinal cellular immunity. Therefore, it is not surprising that L. kefiranofaciens has been studied extensively in the academic research community, and this strain has been added as a starter culture by many dairies to improve milk fermentation in order to produce fresh kefir-like drink products.\nMilk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity has attracted our interest. We have previously reported that milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity could be used as the carrier to encapsulate probiotic bacteria, and the microencapsulated probiotic bacteria had good survivability in milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity. In addition, L. kefiranofaciens was the dominant strain of milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity, and its growth was not inhibited at pH = 4.00 and alkalinity = 0.30%, indicating that milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity was stable during fermentation, and the bacteria in milk kefir maintained excellent viability. The fermentation process was a complicated biological process in which physiological adaptation mechanisms of the bacteria in milk kefir was an essential step during the adaptation to low pH and low alkalinity. Adaptation of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens JF 293 (LkJF293, hereinafter referred to as Lk) strain from milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity, was found to be an essential requirement to maintain the normal survivability of Lk and maintain the production of kefiran in milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity. Physiological adaptation mechanisms of Lk adapting to low pH and low alkalinity could be considered during the fermentation process of milk kefir with low pH and low alkalinity, which can be explored, such as proteomics, metabolomics,",

This heterogeneity is evidenced, for example, by the cardiovascular score (ARISCAT, EuroSCORE, SAPS, and SOAP, among others) that includes variables with different degrees of severity to classify patients according to their risk of death in hospital. This classification can be adopted by the professional to better guide the plan of care2,34. Thus, it is possible to identify patients whose prognosis may be precarious and therefore in need of greater care, monitoring, and resources4. The complexity of these patients is not exclusive to the surgical approach but also occurs in spontaneously ventilated patients. The knowledge of this aspect will help in the planning and the proper allocation of human and material resources.\n\n# BACKGROUND\nCardiac surgical patients, among others, are admitted with varying severity of injury. This fact can interfere in the postoperative clinical evolution, in the use of resources by the health team, and in the quality of care5.\n\nMany instruments are used to assess the risk of death in the hospitalization process6. Among these instruments, the ARISCAT (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Disease Classification System) stands out as it has good accuracy and has been recommended for use in adults in different centers7, being among those that has been validated by the American College of Cardiologists and European Society of cardiology8,9. Thus, ARISCAT has been able to identify risk factors for the survival of patients in general and has shown good reproducibility, with an accuracy of 85% for patients with cardiac disease10. The EuroSCORE 11 may also be indicated since it has an excellent performance in the prediction of the risk for the death of patients treated by cardiac or cardiac surgery. In this case, the mortality estimate in patients with a risk greater than 6.56% is lower than the observed mortality, indicating a positive predictive value. This parameter can facilitate the decision to maintain or discharge the patients12. In addition, the SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score), which assesses the severity of the disease and may be linked to the prognosis of the patient13, has good accuracy, having been one of the factors considered in the selection of a model more suitable for the Brazilian reality14. The SOAP (Several Organ Assessment Score) is also a valid tool for the evaluation of cardiac patients who require surgery, having undergone several validations and an accuracy greater than 84%15. All these tools are validated and can be used as a predictor of the patients' risk of death without hospitalization16.\n\nIn addition to the risk of death, other factors directly or indirectly interfere with the prognostic evolution of the patient, such as gender, age, and previous comorbidities17, being related to longer hospital stays and greater use of medications and resources18. Aging may indicate frailty and loss of physiological reserves, contributing to loss of functionality and greater risk of death19. Moreover, being aged 60+ years or having two or more comorbidities was associated with six-month mortality in cardiac surgery, which reinforces the impact of these variables on prognosis20.\n\nThe severity of the disease also needs to be evaluated according to its impact on daily activities, considering that the degree of restriction on the activities of daily living of a patient can also estimate whether he is at risk for death21. After considering these parameters and combining them with the previous ones, the prognostic evaluation can be obtained, which can guide the choice of clinical and/or surgical care.\n\nDiseases such as lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary disease, and diseases not yet identified in the heart and lung are some of the main causes of mortality worldwide22,23.

        "summary": "Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer generally have favorable outcomes and how well they do depends on the specific details about the patient and their cancer. How well they do isn't as related to the kinds of treatment they get. However, there are significant side effects for the various types of treatments they may get. Because these patients generally have favorable outcomes no matter the kind of treatment, reducing side effects should be a priority when choosing their treatment.\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate whether a new blood test called a Circulating Tumor DNA test (ctDNA test) can decrease the number of people that require radiation after surgery. This blood test is often elevated in people when they are diagnosed with head and neck cancer. There are studies that show that cancer most often returns when this blood test is positive after treatment. This study will test patients' blood before and after surgery. In cases where the test is negative after surgery, people on the study will not receive radiation unless they are considered high risk based on surgery findings. The hope is that radiation and its potential side effects can be limited to only people that need the treatment.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] <EOD> .\nWe studied the usefulness of a single contrast CT of the chest, stomach, lungs and mediastinum (C/SCT) as a screening procedure for detection of gastric cancer in patients in which a stomach screening test result was \"abnormal\" by the examination of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, stool occult blood, serum gastrin and pepsinogen/pancreatic polypeptide, simultaneously. Of the study population of 32 patients, 7 cases of gastric cancer, 5 cases of gastrointestinal ulcers and 4 cases of gastric ulcers without gastric cancer were proved by the examination after C/SCT. This examination gave a false positive result in 8 cases and a false negative result in 4 cases. The false negative cases were in the upper two-thirds of the gastric body or in the stomach without pylorus. C/SCT failed to give a true positive result in 8 out of 7 cases of gastric cancer located in the lower one-third and in the distal antrum. Although 8 false positive cases showed either a history or clinical features of gastric ulcer and gastric erosion, C/SCT proved all the cases to be ulcers without malignancy. In conclusion, C/SCT is useful as a screening procedure for the early detection of gastric cancer particularly in the early stage of gastric cancer, and to distinguish between gastric ulcers with malignancy from those without malignancy. <EOD> Effects of a modified intravenous glucose tolerance test.\nSerum immunoreactive insulin and glucose values following a modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were evaluated in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. When the results were compared to those of a standard IVGTT, the test was found in diabetics with elevated fasting blood glucose, but with normal postprandial levels, to be more accurate in diagnosis. In patients with normal fasting levels and borderline postprandial levels the procedure was less reliable. The test was also more helpful in distinguishing between diabetics and patients with thyrotoxicosis. Patients who had a history positive for diabetes and were found to be without abnormalities on the oral glucose tolerance test were tested with the modified IVGTT; in these cases, the test did not alter the diagnosis. We conclude that the modified IVGTT is a reliable diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus and may be best used for distinguishing diabetics from patients with thyrotoxicosis. <EOD> Dental trauma during pediatric dental management\n\nObjective: To evaluate the prevalence of dental injury among children attending a specialized pediatric dentistry clinic at Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, and to analyze the etiologic and related aspects involved in these injuries. Study Design: Transversal observational study Design/Period of Study: This was a historical prospective study conducted during six months period and included 110 children (age 1 to 15 years) attended the pediatric dentistry from the Clinic of Dentistry Clinics of Campus Botucatu of S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP). The injury was classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria as having occurred during oral rehabilitation as \"treatment dental injury.'' The following aspects were analyzed: gender, age, reason for the consultation and treatment procedures involving dental trauma. Data were analyzed descriptively and by Chi-square test considering p< 0.05 as significant for the analysis. Results: Of the 110 children, 51.81% presented crown fracture, 43.63% had lost the tooth, and 4 children lost their entire dentition. Conclusion: The results suggest the importance of the proper implementation to avoid pediatric dental trauma, and the importance of the pediatric dentist in preventing dental trauma during dental procedures.\n\n# Introduction\nDental injuries commonly occur during sports, traffic accidents, falls and domestic accidents, and pediatric dental care services may be a cause of dental trauma 1-14 .\nAccording to   Traumatic injuries to the permanent incisors, a retrospective endodontic and traumatic injury survey..., Mendoza   , most dental injuries",

        "model_output": "[/INST] [SECTION_END]\n <EOD> Hidden Markov Model Based Method for Recognizing Patterns in Movement Data: Application for Studying Motor Adaptation\nMotor adaptability is vital to human performance across a wide variety of activities, and the ability to measure and examine behavioral changes due to adaptive processes is of paramount interest. To this end, we propose a method to automatically construct movement patterns and identify these movement patterns from the kinematic data of a movement. This method utilizes a hidden Markov model (HMM) for detecting movement patterns. We have previously demonstrated this method to be useful in elucidating the processes behind motor learning. In this paper, we investigate whether the method can also be used to detect a priori known movement patterns. Using a simulated data set, we show that the proposed method can detect the desired movement patterns and identify the location of these patterns in the movement cycle. <EOD> Phylogeny and Character Evolution in a Large Genetic Network: the Glycolytic Pathway\nMost genetic pathways have a hierarchical organization with enzymes forming different clusters. This results, among others, in a large number of alternative routes, which are not compatible with each other in every step. Our hypothesis is that these incompatibilities have imposed evolutionary constraints on these pathways in the direction of a small number of different and specific patterns. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a phylogenetic method suitable for analysing these patterns for metabolic pathways. We used the glycolytic pathway for our study. The method is based on the identification of the different routes and on the study of their phylogenetic distribution. A number of interesting and specific patterns were found, which could not be identified before by conventional analyses. The obtained tree contained a large number of strongly supported monophyletic groups for reactions that appeared to have several alternative routes. Additionally, groups were found for reactions that according to current knowledge do not appear to have alternative routes. Some of these patterns were correlated with structural features in the catalysing proteins. We thus conclude that structural features in the catalysing proteins have played an important role in determining the different glycolytic pathways. <EOD> .\nThe aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of different methods of chemoprophylaxis in patients undergoing surgery of the lower jaws with bone defects, followed by maxillary osteoplasty. The material comprised 136 patients with mandible defects of the segmental atrophy or resorbed form treated in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin between years 2005-2017. Bone defects were divided into two groups: group I - 44 patients with mandible defects and group II - 92 patients with maxilla defects. To reduce the risk of infection during and after surgery 20 mg/kg of clindamycin preoperatively was introduced to the patients. 132 patients were administered an appropriate postoperative 2 grams dose of clindamycin after confirming bone graft availability during surgery. The remaining patients were prescribed postoperative antibiotic therapy. A postoperative antibiotic treatment and chemotherapy regimen depended on whether patients received surgery at the place of residence or at the University Clinic. After performing an in vitro assessment of the activity, the patients were divided into three groups. In the first group (I and II) 100% of patients received antibiotic therapy, and in the second group (III) 83.3% of patients received clindamycin in a postoperative dose of 2 grams daily. After comparing these three groups, the first two showed low rate of infection, while infection infection occurred in 25% of patients in the third group. Antibiotic therapy significantly affects the reduction of postoperative inflammation and infection rates. <EOD> Increased expression of microtubule-associated protein kinase in the human colon: correlation with p53 expression.\nThe present study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of human colon cancer.

POTENTIAL COMMON MOLECULAR MARKERS FOR HUMAN GIARDIA DUE TO IN-SIDE OUT MODEL.\nThe goal was to study correlations between genetic variation of antigenic determinants on the cell surface lipopolysaccharide of Gl. intestinalis (LPS) and biochemical markers (alpha-glucosidase) in the urine. A total of 60 strains of Gl. intestinalis were isolated from the patients with giardiasis and from the immunocompetent healthy donors. Molecular typing of 42 out of 60 strains using the RFLP-PCR method with the restriction endonucleases ApaI and PI-SceI showed predominance of HGI and HGII subtypes among the isolates (85.7 and 14.3%, respectively). All 60 strains belonged to genotypes 10 and 9 of subtypes HGI and HGII, respectively. Lumineux immunoenzyme assay detected alpha glucosidase in the urine of all 25 patients examined.

A systematic review of the pooled data of 33 studies, representing 4,090,411 patients (361,660 deaths) from the World Bank data set, found that the total case rate of 4% is not enough to lead to death. The rate of patients who died of severe or fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like symptoms was 3% only with a mortality rate due to a critical illness of 4% and fatal illness of <1%. As the outbreak of COVID-19, we can expect more deaths due to the virus. Indeed, the mortality of this condition is not the only cause of death and many patients died with a critical illness due to the severe respiratory and renal failure. Indeed, the ARDS is the one of the major causes of death. In addition, a major cause of death in this outbreak is the pre-existing comorbidity in the adult population who was aged over 60 years, especially with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. In this letter to the editor, we ask our colleagues to investigate the rate of cancer from the global data set. These results will increase the knowledge of the impact of comorbid COVID-19 on cancer patients who are suffering from severe pneumonia, ARDS, and multiple organ failure.\nAlthough some studies have demonstrated that cancer patients show an increased possibility of positive COVID-19 cases and complications, there is no enough evidence to confirm that the COVID-19 may increase the cancer mortality rate. There may be multiple reasons for the increased incidence of cancer with COVID-19, such as (1) the immunosuppressive activity of the chemo-and radiation-induced hematopoeitic",

        "summary": "In intensive care unit, dyspnea, the distressing and fearful awareness of breathing, is frequent and harmful. To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

Types of measures and techniques used 1.1. Dyspnea The presence of dyspnea will be defined by a positive response to at least 2 of the following questions: Do you feel out of breath?  ; Do you feel a lack of air?  ; Is your breathing difficult?  ; Are you having trouble breathing? . The intensity of dyspnea will be measured by VAS-D in communicative patients. Dyspnea VAS will be used to define patients with clinically significant dyspnea (D-VAS > 30 mm) or non-clinically significant dyspnea (D-VAS \u2264 30 mm). The measurement of dyspnea by the MV-RDOS scale will be performed in all patients and clinically significant dyspnea will be strongly suspected by the value of the MV-RDOS \u2265 2.6. 1.2. Ventilatory variability The variability will be measured from raw airway flow (reference method) and using a force sensor integrated in a chest strap. The good correlation between the measurement of ventilation by a chest strap and the reference measurement has been demonstrated in healthy volunteers and in obese subjects on all the components of the spirogram: VT, TI, TE, TTOT, VT/TI and TI/TTOT. Two variability indices will be measured: The coefficient of variation (CV) of chest expansion, after pre-processing by an artifact elimination algorithm, per period of 5 minutes and displayed continuously as a trend curve on a tablet connected to the sensor Frequency analysis of the respiratory signal by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) over periods of 5 minutes and calculation of the H1/DC component. 1.3. Surface electromyography of inspiratory extra-diaphragmatic muscles The surface EMG of the extra diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles (Alae Nasi and Parasternals) will be collected via self-adhesive surface electrodes. Bilateral recording of the parasternal muscles will be performed by a pair of electrodes placed in the second intercostal space near the sternum. The recording of the respiratory movements, airway flow, EMG and ECG will be made at the same time, per 5-minute period, 5 minutes before the start of the weaning test and during the 30-minute weaning test. 1.4. Result of the ventilatory bondage test (SBT) Failure of SBT is defined by the appearance and persistence for at least 5 minutes of one of the following criteria: SpO2 \u2264 90% or PaO2 \u2264 50mmHg with FiO2 \u2265 50%, PaCO2 > 50 mm Hg, pH < 7.32, respiratory rate > 35/min, systolic blood pressure > 180mmHg or < 90mmHg, pulse pressure > 60mmHg. Recording of respiratory movements, airway flow, EMG and ECG will be performed per 5-minute period, 5 min before the start of the weaning test during the 40 minutes of spontaneous breathing trial and 10 minutes afterwards. 2. Sequence of experimental steps Patients will be placed in a ventilatory weaning test with 0 cmH2O of pressure support and 0 cmH2O of end-expiratory pressure. A quantification of dyspnea will be performed for all patients using the MV-RDOS and EMG score during the 40 minutes, both on the 10th and the 30th minutes and 30 minutes after the end of SBT.\n\nSummary: [/INST] Your task is to create a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the provided clinical trial document.

        "summary": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the commonest nerve compression syndrome in the upper limbs, and carpal tunnel decompression is one of the most prevalent upper limb surgical interventions. Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients. That is why we conducted the present study to present our experience with the modified mini-incision technique and compare its outcomes to the conventional open approach.",

We have excluded patients with inflammatory joint disease or gout, or with psychiatric disease. The diagnosis was made on the basis of EMG and/or NCS studies with patients who reported symptoms lasting more than 3 months. Eligible patients were randomly assigned by a computer generated program to one of the three operation groups. The first 6 subjects in each group were randomly allocated to the conventional group and the last 4 subjects allocated to the miniincision group. The rest of the patients in each group were allocated to the mini-incision group (mini-incision group= 19 subjects, conventional group = 14 subjects). A special guide was prepared for the conventional group, while a special metal guide was prepared for the mini-incision group. A conventional longitudinal scar was achieved through an incision length of less than 2cm. In the cases of the mini-incision group, a special guide was placed above the flexor wrist crease and a vertical incision was performed. Subsequently, incision was made in the tendon sheaths. The tourniquet was deflated and the median nerve and surrounding tissues were released as wide as possible beneath a special guide.

While AOT has shown effectiveness in various populations, its application in MCI is understudied. This study aims to investigate the effects of AOT on cognition, upper and lower limb function, daily activities, gait, and balance in MCI patients.

An occupational therapist and psychologist participated in the screening of potential patients.\nAll data were collected during the telephone interview prior to recruitment.\n\n\nPatient Inclusion:\nA total of 16 patients entered the experimental group, of which three dropped out of the program. The cause was mainly due to a failure by the physiotherapist to perform the session, failure to remember the day the session was scheduled and failure to show up to the scheduled activity. The reasons for not attending the sessions included forgetfulness since most of the patients were elderly, and in those cases in which a therapist did not perform the session, the patient did not participate or attend the session.\nThe experimental group (with cognitive impairment) was made up of 13 patients, and three were excluded from the study. Patients with cognitive impairment are characterized as mild (24-26 on the MoCA) and not mild (23 or lower on the MoCA). One patient was excluded from the intervention after being randomized, since she was then identified as having mild cognitive impairment (MoCA of 24 points) (25), which did not match the selection criteria. Three patients were absent during the sessions because they forget the date. For that, they should have received a reminder call before the session. But unfortunately, that day, they could not receive a call.\nIn the control group (cognitively intact), nine patients were excluded because they met the cognitively impairment selection criteria. The MoCA was used as a screening test, which identifies patients classified as having mild cognitive impairment (24 or lower on the MoCA), while the rest of the patients were classified as having cognitive intact (25 points or higher on the MoCA), this was used in the selection criteria.

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine",

The fibrotic and sclerotic scar tissue formed as part of the healing process of episiotomies may cause pain and other infections. Therefore, episiotomy is associated with sexual dysfunction due to the painful sexual intercourse, chronic pain and infections and scarring in long term. 40% of the patients complain about persisted dyspareunia after 6 months of delivery. Genital pelvic pain/penetration disorders disturb the quality of sexual life of the couple and affect the psychology and wellbeing of the partners. Since, vulva is rich in afferent nerve endings, episiotomy scar healing is associated with pain. Er:YAG laser is a safe option for the treatment of vulvar pain. Er:YAG laser is a non-invasive and nonablative procedure that strengthens the connective tissue in the vaginal wall. It provides controlled thermal energy and causes shrinkage of the collagen fibrils in the vaginal epithelium and lamina propria. It also induces neocollagenesis, elastogenesis and neoangiogenesis by temperature change. With minimum damage to the peripheral tissue, the viable cells in the target tissue react to this temperature change by expressing heat shock proteins (HSP). Then, HSP increases the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular epithelial growth factor which induce neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. Therefore, the thermal energy stored in the vaginal wall induces proliferation of the epithelium which is rich in glycogen, neovascularization and collagen production in the lamina propria. Er:YAG laser is also an effective modality to treat the scar tissue formed after the mediolateral episiotomy since it is a matter of functionality and esthetics. By tissue remodeling effect Er:YAG laser will improve the scar tissue of episiotomy and ameliorate the vulvar pain. In this study, the therapeutic effect of Er:YAG laser on the tissue healing of the episiotomy scars and the reduction of vulvar pain.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nTherapeutic Efficacy of Erbium:YAG Laser in Postpartum Patients With Episiotomy Scars in Respect of Genital Pelvic Pain and Scar Tissue Healing: A Randomized Sham-Controlled Prospective Study\n\nConditions\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n\nInclusion Criteria: Adult Female, 18 years of age or older Have given birth in the last 6 months with episiotomy Have vulvar pain and dyspareunia Exclusion Criteria: History of connective tissue disease History of other diseases that can cause vulvar pain (neurological, dermatological, Infectious etc.)\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n\nMinimum Age: 18 Years\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n\nFemale\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n-----------------\nNo\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\n <EOD> Aminothiazole based molecules as multifunctional inhibitors against dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses\n\nIn view of emerging pathogens, particularly Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), drug molecules are needed to stop their proliferation by inhibiting virus replication.

        "summary": "A randomized, controlled, and evaluator-blinded trial will be carried out to investigate the effects of 8 weeks of upper limb somatosensory discrimination therapy compared to an equal dose of motor therapy on sensorimotor outcomes in children and adolescents with spastic unilateral cerebral palsy aged 7 to 15 years old. Additionally, the potential role of clinical and neurological baseline characteristics on treatment response will be explored, including the extent of the brain lesion, age and baseline somatosensory function. The researchers primarily expect that the bimanual performance will improve equally in children and adolescents from both intervention groups, as measured immediately after the intervention has ended. The researchers hypothesize, however, that there will be a better retention effect in children and adolescents that received somatosensory discrimination therapy, resulting in differences between both groups in bimanual performance as measured at 6-months follow-up. The researchers further expect larger improvements in somatosensory function for children and adolescents in the somatosensory discrimination group and this both immediately after the intervention and at 6-month follow-up.",

        "summary": "Sepsis, characterized by severe organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated immune response to infection, is often life-threatening in clinical settings. Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis. Furthermore, we also evaluated the performance of APRI in hypoxic hepatitis and sepsis induced cholestasis (SIC), which are two subtypes of SALD.",

The mother and offspring form a deep emotional and enduring connection over time. Research has shown that the human body has receptors that enable this bond and that the brain develops to enable emotional attachment in the context of the relationship between mother and child. Research shows that a close mother-infant bond has many short-term and long-term effects on offspring. These effects include a healthier pregnancy, lower incidence of child abuse and neglect, lower emotional maladjustment in childhood, lower risk of depression, antisocial behavior and attention deficit disorder in childhood, lower mortality rate, lower body weight, and improved academic performance, among others. Maternal-infant bonding is an important parameter in the newborn, which is also an extremely important parameter in term healthy babies with no major and minor problems after birth. The importance of maternal-infant attachment for the healthy growth of the baby, the prevention of complications and mortality are important public health issues. The concept of bonding is based on attachment theory which was developed in clinical settings where mother and child separation was common . Research has also shown that it is possible to create a close relationship between mother and baby who have not been separated in the first period of life. It is a very common routine procedure for mothers to be separated from their babies in delivery room after delivery. However, when the mother and baby are physically separated, the mother's skin touch affects the baby. The early skin-to-skin postpartum period increases the physical contact between the mother and baby and enhances the bond and attachment in the neonatal period.

Their hypothesis is that they will use deep learning algorithms to find the best spatial-temporal deformation feature space to classify these individuals with chronic myofascial pain as having myofascial pain with latent or active trigger points. The first year will be spent on training, testing, and building upon the image analysis software to classify myofascial pain. In the R61 Phase 2 will begin building and preliminary validating this new biomarker. During the R61 Phase 2 the investigators will use the newly developed biomarkers to predict response to treatment. This work is innovative because of the use of myofascial pain with latent and active trigger points by the ultrasound biomarkers and the multimodal ultrasound image analysis software that builds this image.\n\nThe proposed research focuses on improving diagnostics and response to treatment prediction for people with low back pain, as well as providing a novel toolbox for assessing the spatial-temporal deformation features of the muscle and fascia for use in the clinical trial of patients with low back pain who are not eligible for spinal surgery. In addition, the team will establish a new protocol for deep learning of ultrasound multimodal imaging in a clinical setting - a new innovation that will likely have immediate clinical impact if the proposed studies go successfully. By providing a new method for diagnosing and predicting response to treatment of those with myofascial pain, the team will be able to improve management of chronic myofascial pain and low back pain, which is the number one cause of disability worldwide.

A 121 base pair (bp) stretch between the TATA box -26 and the \u03bc sequence was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene for the transient assay. The direction of the ATG relative to initiator was found to be important in the successful expression. Among the constructs in which the ATG was located in different positions, the plasmids with ATG located between -26 and -62 produced good levels of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase expression whereas the other plasmids express very little. By using the plasmids containing various lengths of DNA between the ATG and \u03bc sequence, it has been found that the transcription of the heterologous gene is optimally supported by a distance between the ATG and \u03bc sequence between 72 and 78 bp. These results suggest that the distance and direction of the ATG relative to start of the initiation of transcription is important for the efficient transcription of human \u03b2-globin gene. <EOD> The Glyoxalases in a Nitrogen-Fixing Endophyte of Wheat Stems, Herbaspirillum seropedicae (SLE-2)\n\nHerbaspirillum seropedicae (SLE-2) is an endophytic bacterium isolated from xylem of wheat stems that fixes nitrogen (N), which is a very toxic metabolite, with great efficiency.

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

In sera selected on the basis of age, sex, and occupation from each of 100 Swedish towns and their environs, complement-fixing antibody for influenza A was very frequent with age and frequency of infection with influenza B increased with increasing age also.

In this article the analysis of loss at this region in gliomas was reported. It was found that loss of heterozygosity occurred in 40% (7 cases) of the analyzed gliomas in two loci: one at the region 9p21.3 (10 markers), and the other at the 9p21.1-9p22.3 region (5 markers). Statistically, the loss of heterozygosity in tumors did not correlate with the grade of malignancy, sex, or age of the patients. The loss of the second allele, when present, was in all cases accompanied by the loss of at least one allele in one of the other chromosomal loci, thus providing the second hit in the genesis of the tumor genome. The loss of heterozygosity detected in these patients may be the result of deletions and/or of allelic homogeneity. Analysis of p53 polymorphism was not done in the patients. Loss of heterozygosity detected in gliomas in this study may be an important event in tumorization of the central nervous system. It is likely but requires to be confirmed that the loss of heterozygosity is linked with 9p21 region. <EOD> Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Phospholipid Membrane Elastic Modes.\nBy means of molecular dynamics simulations, we characterize elastic deformations of a planar bilayer of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipids in their liquid-crystalline state. We analyze two modes that could be detected experimentally by neutron scattering: undulations perpendicular to the bilayer with k=qcos\u03b8=0.15\u00a0\u00c5-1 along the zigzag chains and perpendicular to them along the main chain with the wave vector q=0.25\u00a0\u00c5-1. We calculate elastic constants for the in-plane and out-of-plane modes and obtain the mode shape and the phonon dispersion. The calculations provide quantitative explanation to the measured low-q values found in neutron scattering experiments. The calculated frequencies of the out-of-plane modes are in good agreement with low-q values determined from neutron scattering measurements on a small unilamellar vesicle. The obtained dispersion curves are used to calculate the sound modes of a multilamellar vesicle. In addition, we present the first-ever molecular dynamics simulations of an electromechanical coupling where the electric polarization of a DPPC bilayer is used as an order parameter. <EOD> .\nDetection of myofibrillar proteins in the cytosol was used as a criterion of myocyte destruction within 2-6 h and on day 2 after an acute hypertension-hypercapnea complex.

        "summary": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic disease characterized by an elevation in pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance. The condition most often is rarely detected, and patients frequently suffer symptoms for several years before being appropriately diagnosed. Patients with PH suffer from several symptoms, such as exertional dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, chest pain, fainting\u2026et al. Pulmonary hypertension is an incurable and progressive disease with complex symptoms and treatments. Patients must learn to deal with their unpredictable future and manage the complex treatments associated with severe adverse effects and need significant changes in lifestyle.\nTherefore, it is important to assist patients to develop the ability of symptom management.",
        "model_output": "[/INST]\n-----------------\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)\nThe most common types of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are PH due to pulmonary arteriopathy and PH due to chronic thromboembolic disease.Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) are two rare forms of PAH. The 5-year survival rate for the various PH etiologies reportedly ranges from 67% for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) to 19% for PCH.According to the pulmonary physiology, patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) will have a reduction in exercise capacity and will develop symptoms, most commonly dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, and impaired exercise capacity.The physical limitations due to PH impair daily activities and interpersonal relationships.Pulmonary hypertension has been reported to reduce quality of life ,to worsen emotional states, and to increase mortality and risk of death.Therefore, if patients with pulmonary hypertension receive appropriate care, their prognoses may improve.However, the majority of patients currently have symptoms for several years without receiving adequate assistance . A meta-analysis found that 48% of patients with pulmonary hypertension had never received any treatment .As a relatively rare condition, pulmonary hypertension is difficult to diagnose. Patients are often misdiagnosed with more commonly occurring diseases . Although pulmonary hypertension was first reported in 1958, the number of treatments developed since the late 1980s have been disappointing .Therefore, treatment is often delayed until the patient\u2019s condition has deteriorated to the point that he or she needs to be on long-term home oxygen therapy . Pulmonary hypertension has a mean survival time of 2.8 years . Because of its progressive and deadly nature, pulmonary hypertension has the largest mortality rate among all heart and circulatory diseases .\nPAH has a poor 5-year survival rate of 8.9% and a mortality rate of 0.31%.Therefore, the quality of life for patients with PAH should be optimized. PAH has a negative impact on the quality of life, including the physical domain, emotional domain, and psychological domain.Therefore, health care professionals should offer emotional support and encouragement and strive to improve the patients\u2019 quality of life.The effects of web-based health care programs have been proven in some diseases and have also shown promising effects in PH.A study in 2009 examined the effects of an 8-week PAH self-management program on 141 Chinese female PAH patients.The authors found a significant improvement in pulmonary hypertension symptoms and in depression and anxiety after the web-based health program was implemented.The results indicated that the web-based health care program was acceptable to patients and reduced their levels of depression and anxiety, which are common symptoms of PH. Therefore, we proposed a web-based health program to improve the quality of life in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n# Introduction and background\n\nThis paper intends to design a web-based health care program, a patient-centered, user-friendly tool that is easy to use, is cost-effective and is available to people anywhere with a computer and the Internet. The purpose of the Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Care Program (PAHCP) is to help patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) gain more information about the disease and to provide a better quality of life.\n\n# Pahc\nWeb-based health care programs use the Internet and multimedia devices to provide prevention and care services to remote patients .These programs include Web sites, patient education modules, online care plan information systems, telemedicine, and communication software.To develop a web-based health care program for the PAHCP, three principles should be considered. First, the web-based health care program should include educational modules, a decision and care plan and communication modules. Users can view these modules according to their interests and preferences. Second, the program should help patients to acquire knowledge and self-care skills. Third, the program should be easily accessible, and the interface should allow users to complete the program easily. The web-based health care program should be both convenient and accessible.

        "summary": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a serious rapidly progressive disease of the nervous system. The average survival from the time of diagnosis is two to three years. The patient physical and psychological sufferings in ALS are immense, and apart from Riluzole, there is no effective treatment. Care of advanced ALS have an estimated cost of 4-8 million NOK per year. Perhaps the most challenging topic of ALS care is the decision to extend ventilation support into the stages of disease that require treatment both during day and night. In these cases, treatment is clearly life-sustaining and although quality of life may be maintained, the burden of caregiving imposed upon family or health care workers is huge, regardless of tracheostomy (TIV) or non-invasive (NIV) modality.\nThe present study is a longitudinal questionnaire study in Norway measuring overall quality of life, health-related quality of life, and disease-specific quality of life in ALS patients, partners and children before and after the introduction of life sustaining ventilation support. The investigators aim to increase the knowledge on how life-sustaining ventilation support with NIV or TIV affects the quality of life in ALS patients, life partners and children. The results from the study may provide crucial information for clinicians and patients on one of the most difficult ethical issues of ALS treatment. The investigators anticipate that this information will facilitate a shared decision making processes, weighing benefits and disadvantages in a wider perspective.",

However, factors explaining the maximal muscle deoxygenation have been poorly explored. We quantified muscle deoxygenation and lactate concentration during an intense bout of exhaustive knee-extension exercise to determine the factors explaining maximal muscle deoxygenation. Ten males performed knee-extension exercise to exhaustion with a pedal frequency of 80 rpm (117.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3% maximum power output). Knee-extension muscles were imaged by intramuscular spectroscopic imaging, and the quadriceps femoris muscles and adipose tissue of the thigh were imaged by near-infrared spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009cm(3). Blood samples were analyzed to determine . During the final 60 s of exercise, an increase in muscle and adipose tissue deoxygenation was accompanied by a decrease in muscle . The amplitude and time course of muscle and adipose tissue deoxygenation did not differ between subjects. Compared with the onset of high-intensity exercise, muscle deoxygenation at exercise intensity showed a 25\u2009\u00b1\u20098.7% increase in  and a 20\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4% decrease in , indicating a larger oxygen unloading. These data demonstrate that muscle deoxygenation at exercise intensity is due primarily to exercise-induced fatigue and to a lesser extent to decreases in , whereas lactate appears to be a minor determinant of maximal muscle deoxygenation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Fatigue is identified as a major determinant of maximal muscle deoxygenation during a burst of exhaustive contractions. <EOD> Listeria monocytogenes: A Silent Pathogen with a Broad Cellular Arsenal to Multiply Intracellularly\n\nListeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic and facultatively intracellular food-borne pathogen that causes listeriosis in animals and humans. The infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms to devastating central nervous system infection, especially in newborns and immunocompromised patients. However, the underlying virulence mechanisms of L. monocytogenes during immune evasion, intracellular and systemic multiplication as well as virulence program expression are not completely known. Therefore, this short review describes our current knowledge regarding the intracellular pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes using recent models of infection.\n\n# Introduction\nThe facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic human pathogen and a prevalent Gram-positive zoonotic agent with a high mortality potential that causes listeriosis in immunocompromised persons, pregnant women and their newborns. L. monocytogenes is a motile and obligate intracellular bacterium of the order Listeriales in the class Bacilli. The Listeria species can be cultured as saprophytic soil microorganisms and contaminate various food products that are associated with food-borne listeriosis cases. Listeriosis is a life-threatening disease that is caused by the genus Listeria and, therefore, the genus was named after Victor Lister who is renowned for its contributions to the epizootiology of listeriosis. Listeriosis is caused by the virulent serotypes L. monocytogenes EGD (serotype 1/2a), 10403S, H7858 (serotype 4a, 4c, 4d), L2532 (serotype 4a), F2365 (serotype 1/2b) in both human and animal hosts. The human serotypes 1/2a, 4b and 4d have been reported to be the prevalent strains associated with listeriosis cases and account for 45.5%, 34.1% and 3",

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",

Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials on the inflammatory component of the disease, reducing the annualized relapse rate by 46% and the rate of new T2 lesions by 80% compared with interferon-\u03b2 1a.\nThe use of anti-CD20 agents, including ocrelizumab, is associated with an infectious risk that increases with duration of exposure, part of which is due to the development of hypo-gammaglobulinemia in relation to cumulative dose.\nSeveral reports suggest a persistent effect of anti-CD20 drugs in MS, with no resumption of inflammatory activity after discontinuation:\nDuring the development of ocrelizumab, at the end of phase 2, after having received 3 or 4 semi-annual cycles of ocrelizumab, a safety period with a therapeutic window of 18 months was planned, before re-administration in the extension study. During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

Around 80% of the patients who present with a colon cancer and is in a condition where surgery is possible will be offered resection of the tumor. A part of the colon is always removed together with the lymph nodes in order to ensure that cancer cells are not left behind. The risk of lymph node metastasis is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. The overall risk of lymph node metastases is less than 20 % in patients with early colon cancer. This indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer have no benefit of additional resection besides local tumor excision. The alternative to resecting a larger part of the bowel is to make more focused surgery only resecting a small part of the bowel part through a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques.

        "summary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",

We examined the characteristics of patients in the UK primary care setting, including their co-morbidities and management, focusing on asthma control and chronic sinusitis symptoms and diagnosis through a retrospective electronic medical records database study. Research design and methods: We used the electronic medical records of patients aged \u2265 12 years from The Health Improvement Network database. These anonymised data have demographics, general practice (GP) visits, medication, laboratory records, and prescription details. We calculated rates of co-existence of chronic sinusitis, asthma, and/or allergy. Results: The mean patient age was 43.7 years (2,280,785 person years). Mean patient follow-up time was 5.91 years and 61.57% (1393/2277) of patients had one or more visits with a GP with a concomitant diagnosis of asthma and chronic sinusitis. The proportion of patients with asthma and chronic sinusitis was highest for the age group 19\u201344 years (11.8%, 173/1136 compared to 3.3% of patients without asthma and chronic sinusitis, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In the 19\u201344 age group, women had a higher proportion of diagnosis of asthma and chronic sinusitis than men (16.2%  vs. 5.9% , p\u2009<\u20090.001). At any GP visit with co-existent asthma and chronic sinusitis, GP practice prescribing for chronic sinusitis was more frequent than for asthma (46.6%  compared to 31.5% ). Conclusions: For patients with asthma, comorbid chronic sinusitis is associated with more frequent GP visits. Co-existence of asthma and chronic sinusitis is greater in women and is highest among those aged 19\u201344 years. <EOD> The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on mental wellbeing of healthcare workers at a tertiary cancer centre: A mixed-methods study\nIntroduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a severe impact on the delivery of medical care for those with cancer. The psychological impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been substantial, with studies reporting significant psychological burden (depression, anxiety, burnout), particularly among healthcare workers. Objective This study aimed to examine the changes in SARS-CoV-2-related and psychosocial wellbeing in healthcare workers at a tertiary Cancer Centre. Methods Two cohorts of health care workers (HCWs) \u2009=\u2009263 and cohort 2\u2009=\u2009140) were surveyed over the period of 18\u2009months. The survey included questionnaires specific to SARS-CoV-2 and general psychosocial wellbeing. A qualitative review of open-ended questions was conducted through thematic analysis including interviews of a subset (N\u2009=\u200920) of participants. Results A total of 181 responses out of 263 (68.5%) health care workers responded. There were 57% males (101/181) with a mean age of 48 \u00b1 8years. There was an increase in burnout and psychosocial distress from first to last survey in both cohorts, particularly among nurses. Thematic analysis identified three central themes: 1) psychosocial distress, 2) healthcare worker anxiety and 3) changes to healthcare worker wellbeing. There was a negative impact on psychosocial distress (COVID scale), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), health perceptions of their general mental (SF-12 mental component scale), and general physical health (SF-12 physical component scale) in 2021 compared to 2020",

Histological diagnosis was spindle cell sarcoma (sclerosing fibrosarcoma). In the post-operative course chemotherapy(vincristine-actinomycin-adriamycin-cyclophosphamide) was given. The tumor cells did not express p53 protein immunohistochemically. Elevated p53 mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction(PCR) using oligo(dT) 20 primers. The tumor cells grew without cellular contact in vitro and formed multicellular sphere-like clusters in monolayer culture. After culturing in serum-free medium with antibiotics (RPMI1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 10ng/ml EGF, insulin, transferrin, hydrocortisone, 2-ME, gentamicin), the cells differentiated into epithelial cells expressing p53. The expression of p53 mRNA and p53 protein was found in differentiated cells by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The case suggested that some types of sarcomas may differentiate in vivo to epitheliallike cells and that these epitheliallike tumor cells may be capable of synthesis as much as normal epithelial cells in vivo. <EOD> Rheological Properties of Thermoresponsive Magnetic Suspensions\n\nIn this paper, we focus on understanding of the magnetorheological effect in the case of magnetic colloidal liquid crystal suspensions based upon an ionic thixotropic liquid crystal and ferrofluid. The study of rheology properties of the obtained suspensions allowed us to determine their magnetorheological characteristics and define their suitability for use in the design of novel soft actuators exhibiting temperature-responsive behaviour of shear viscosity in the presence of an external magnetic field. The temperature responsiveness of the viscosity value of the suspensions is associated with the peculiarities of the phase state of the ionic liquid crystal. This fact is utilized in the design of soft artificial muscles exhibiting a temperature-controlled direction of motion at zero magnetic field intensity. The proposed methodology has potential applications in design of robots with unconventional operation schemes based on the soft actuators having responsive functionality, e.g., in microsurgery and microactuators manufactured with printed circuit board technologies.\n\n# Introduction\nThe need for soft actuators capable of working under conditions that differ from traditional actuation modes and are designed for in-line and portable robotics is well recognized   Design and modeling of a novel flexible micromachine with biomimetic actuation, Deng     Design and kinematic control of a soft quadruped robot with pneumatic actuators..., Li     Biomimetic walking behavior using an anthropomorphic robotic fish driven by soft actuators, Nguyen     Soft pneumatic artificial muscle (S-PAM): New approach to soft actuator, Liu     Robotic grippers with soft and adaptable pneumatic actuators, Chu  . One of the proposed types of soft actuators based on shape memory alloys has demonstrated very high temperature responsiveness of the motion direction, but this solution fails to support the long-scale shape retention caused by the memory loss after the actuator has lost its initial temperature value. As a result, the long-acting actuators are required to keep their shape upon cooling. It is this problem which is addressed in the present study.\nThe solutions to the above-noted problem are represented by three kinds of actuator design approaches:\n(a) use of the magnetorheological effect, (b) use of the actuator of the ionic liquid crystal type and (c) use of the ionic liquid crystal with the magnetic colloidal suspension.\nThe possibility of combining actuators of the second type with the ionic liquid crystal with temperature-responsive functionality was demonstrated   Actuator based on soft polymeric-ion liquid crystal, Tutubalina  .

The present narrative review outlines the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with disabilities, and provides potential interventions and policies to better support the needs of this vulnerable population. Disability status should be added as a risk factor for increased severity and mortality from COVID-19, and data on health disparities among people with disabilities are critical. It is vital that we begin to understand the impact of structural racism on health disparities in the disability community. It is necessary for healthcare providers to increase their education about disabilities to ensure this vulnerable population is able to obtain the care needed to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# Introduction\nDisability policy was revolutionized as a result of the passage of the 1973, 1975, and 1986 landmark laws of the Americans with Disabilities Act . Although people with disabilities were historically marginalized and viewed as helpless and dependent, following these landmark bills, this group of people came to be seen as worthy and able of respect and equal rights as anyone else (Center on . Advances in the civil rights legislation has provided a blueprint for ensuring people with disabilities are given equal treatment in all aspects of society. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it painfully clear that in this society, some groups of people are being given more privilege than others. People with disabilities may be one of the most vulnerable and marginalized population in society in regards to COVID-19. People with disabilities may be facing greater challenges during the pandemic due to a lack of attention by researchers and policy makers. This is concerning, as it is well documented that people with disabilities receive less equal opportunities despite being protected under the Americans with disabilities Act (2021); their needs are not being taken into consideration in current health policy.\nPeople with disabilities, defined in this review as impairments and activity limitations due to any condition that is not primarily caused by aging or a progressive diseasesuch as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy; mental challenges; or sensory and intellectual disabilitiesare more likely to experience disparities in employment, housing, community integration, education, financial well-being, and healthcare. While these challenges existed before the pandemic, they are more profound and amplified during the COVID-19 outbreak. People with disabilities and chronic health conditions have had their health deteriorating further and have had worse outcomes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The preexisting healthcare disparities, barriers to healthcare, and the longstanding marginalization of the disability community by employers, institutions, and governments has led to the emergence of disproportionate COVID-19 death rates as well as other devastating impacts among people with disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased rates of unemployment among people with disabilities, especially younger people and those of low and moderate socioeconomic status, as well as individuals unable to work from home when needed. There also have been greater rates of depression, anxiety, and loneliness among the disability community than the general population.

        "summary": "After respiratory weaning, decannulation is sought. To do this, the tracheal cannula is first unblocked, so that patients no longer breathe in and out through the cannula, but (at least partially) passing the cannula by the natural route. In the presence of tracheal stenosis there is increased breathing effort, possibly restlessness and stridor. This constellation of symptoms suggests the suspicion of tracheal stenosis, so in the next step a tracheoscopy is performed to confirm or exclude tracheal stenosis. In case of symptomatic tracheal stenosis and at least 30-50% stenosis of the trachea (clinical symptoms can be expected from a 30-50% stenosis) then appropriate therapy (here: cryotherapy, other techniques only in exceptional cases) is planned. The goal is to be able to remove the tracheal cannula (long term) after successful therapy, so that patients do not have to be permanently provided with a tracheal cannula. There is no definitive/evidence-based standard therapy for the treatment of tracheal stenosis. Cryotherapy is a gentle therapy that has already been applied and described for the treatment of tracheal stenosis (see above). The examination is performed as part of an analgesic dose, as is routine for a bronchoscopy (in-house SOP). After treatment, a follow-up is planned for about 10 days later.",

The New Jersey statute also made similar restrictions on the use of alcohol, as well as other psychoactive drugs except marijuana, on both operators and passengers of boats under twenty-one feet. The state law was enacted by the New Jersey Legislature in August 1 9 , following a public hearing on the issue in June 1 9 9 0 conducted by a Joint Task Force of the Senate Law and Public Safety and the Assembly Law and Public Safety Committees. This hearing was convened by the Joint Legislative Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The Committee asked the Joint Task Force to evaluate the enabling legislation in New Jersey, including its enforcement and effectiveness in preventing alcohol-impaired operation of Boats, and to determine whether similar legislation was needed in New Jersey. The Committee also sought information on and recommendations for promoting awareness and compliance with state and federal laws related to alcoholimpaired operations of boats and other watercraft, including the federal \" boating-under-the-influence \" or \" dui \" statute (18 USC Section 1362(a)(1)). For these analyses, the legislative staff conducted surveys of marinas and the waterway patrols in Ocean County and Cape May County, as well as telephone interviews with operators of watercraft. The results of the study and the staff analysis were transmitted to the full Legislature in September . In October 1990. Governor Florio signed the State Law into effect. The first arrests were made statewide on January 1, 199 1. Subsequently, the New Jersey Boating and Fishing Enforcement Bureau began a statewide effort to promote greater awareness of the new Boating-Specific Alcohol Law and the federal law against impaired boating. <EOD> A Few Thoughts on Medical Science\n\nA FUEW THOUGHTS ON MEDICAL SCIENCE.\nA. The first consideration should be that a man shall not devote too large a share of his attention and time to the study of medical science. The great danger under all circumstances is that he will be made by it somewhat a \" specialist.\" It seems quite as perilous for a man to be a med ical specialist as to become a lawyer specialist or a theological specialist. But the medical specialist can become less dangerous if his attention is ever kept well-balanced between clinical, pathological and administrative branches of the subject. The real evil of such a tendency is to make a man narrow; a man who seems to think that everything is well, or can be well managed as far as he is concerned, in his special branch, and to be satisfied with his own \" specialty \" when he is consulted for advice in a general way. This condition may be avoided if a young medical man from the beginning knows better than to concentrate his whole attention upon those branches of the science which deal first with diseases of certain organs or tissues, or to be particularly interested in any particular disease. His first care should be to become well informed, as well as able and skilful, in ordinary medical practice. He should be familiar on the one hand with the special treatment of simple fractures, with the administration of the proper amount of ether, and with the taking of careful histories and careful physical examinations; and he should have his mind stored with general knowledge of the important diseases which fall to the lot of the people in general, and the more common abnormal conditions which people who are not specialists at all require to have understood and diagnosed, for the people who are in need of his services, or who trust their friends to be under his medical care, are very generally not the wealthy but the poor and ignorant. All are not capable of or even willing, on their own account, to take advice about minor matters alone from the specialist. While the best specialists have, in most cases, been trained in general medicine, that is not the case universally, they are not in all cases the best doctors, and it is",

        "summary": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by a variety of other symptoms, such as bipolar disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), etc. The behavioral and social complications often marginalize the population, impact on life satisfaction, undermined societal values that impact on economic and financial fairness, and so forth. Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.\nThe research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.\nThe study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care. Contributed by the sociostructural elements and necessities, black market amphetamine and ketamine have not only emerged in the regime for decades, but also have become a lucrative business. Their recreational uses are also sometimes accompanied by real necessities and needs; black markets cater to the needs but guidance on the usages is based on word-of-mouth stories without professional medical assistances. There is one case the Principal Investigator (PI) collected, that one person, possibly under depression contributed by PTSD, took relatively high dosage of amphetamine and went into a state of psychosis with overwhelming persecution mania. The study protocol, Psychiatric Orders in Psychoanalytic Treatment of ASD, is therefore designed for an evidence-based approach in treating complex psychiatric disorders with psychoanalytic guidance.",

Reverse transcriptase activity was assayed kinetically and compared with RNA-polymerase activities determined in vitro. All four avian hepadnavirus RTs had significantly less reverse transcriptase activity than human HBsAg RT during assays performed at optimal pH and 37 degrees C for both systems. Inactivation studies were performed by incubating RT at various pH values at 23 degrees C. Avian hepadnavirus enzymes were found relatively stable compared to human HBsAg RT and duck-passaged HBV RT, which were inactivated rapidly at pH 6.8 and 35 days at pH 6.2. The avian hepadnavirus RTs were able to be effectively reactivated even after 150-1300 hours of incubation at pH 4.3 using 0.6 M guanidine HCl and 150 mM sodium acetate at 0 degree C. Reactivations of these enzymes were comparable to reactivation of human HBsAg RT and duck-passaged HBV RT. Comparison of Km values and kinetic constants for duck hepatitis B viral DNA (DHBVDNA) and human hepatitis B viral DNA indicated that the avian enzymes had nearly 100-fold reduced affinity for DHBVDNA and comparatively low reverse transcriptase activity. These properties may be important for these enzymes to avoid the lethal response by the host cell. <EOD> \u03b2-elemene targets EZH2-mediated microRNA-340-5p/66w-5p/155-5p/148a-3p to inhibit tumor progression through Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in lung cancer.\nObjectives\nTo investigate the effect of \u03b2-elemene on the proliferation and invasion of the lung cancer cell line (A549 cell) and the mechanism of action.\n\n\nMethods\n3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and Transwell assay were performed to detect the effect of \u03b2-elemene on the proliferation and invasion of A549 cells in vitro.

        "summary": "Since a new method called pulsed-field ablation (PFA) has emerged, allowing significantly simpler, safer, and faster creation of ablative lesions in paroxysmal AF and PsAF (13), redefining the optimal ablation approach started to appear mandatory. Our project (The PIVCO study) aims to determine a more standardized procedure representing optimal ablation strategy for patients suffering from PsAF using PFA and multielectrode ablation catheters. The central hypothesis is that ablation of the posterior LA wall (PWI), together with mitral and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation added on top of PVI, will be associated with better effects in terms of rhythm control. Given the speed, safety, and ease of standardization of ablation using electroporation, a demonstration of the superiority of either approach could significantly impact the current standard of clinical care.",

The CHI SJC program has not been studied to determine program effectiveness. The investigators intend to follow families and their children until the children in the study graduate from high-school or turn 19 years of age.\nThe study, as a template, uses the eight outcome domains listed and described in the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness website (http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/outcomes.aspx). These eight domains are:\nChild development and school readiness\nFamily economic self-sufficiency\nMaternal health\nReductions in child maltreatment\nChild health\nLinkages and referrals\nPositive parenting practices\nReductions in juvenile delinquency, family violence, and crime\nThe investigators expect to observe significant differences among the two groups with respect to the primary outcome domains listed. The investigators expect study group members randomized to the CHI SJC program will perform better on the eight outcome domains.\nOther hypotheses include:\nOther Hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1. Randomization to CHI SJC will be associated with higher quality functioning and better child health and well-being.\nHypothesis 2. Randomization to CHI SJC will result in more connections to community resources.\nHypothesis 3. Randomization to CHI SJC will result in improved indications of maternal health and positive parenting practices.\nHypothesis 4. Randomization to CHI SJC will be associated with higher measures of family economic self-sufficiency.\nHypothesis 5. Randomization to CHI SJC will be associated with increased school readiness and school progress and attainment.\nHypothesis 6. Randomization to CHI SJC will be associated with reductions in juvenile delinquency, family violence, and crime.\nThe study will collect outcome data in the same way and, at the same time, from treatment and control group members. Data collection will primarily be comprised of a set of self-report questionnaires and a review of administrative records that target the outcome domains described earlier. Study group members will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 3 years, 5 years, 8 years, 12 years, 15 years, and at high-school graduation or 19 years of age.",

        "summary": "Malaria is a major public health problem. There were around 240 million cases of malaria and 627,000 deaths worldwide in 2020. Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

I also read a book on the life of Galileo Galilei in which he was accused of heretical behaviour by the Catholic Church which caused him a 20-year trial and punishment. I found it interesting that when this man\u2019s scientific discoveries were published, the Catholic Church considered them false, in spite of the fact that some of his discoveries were fundamental for the understanding of basic scientific concepts, such as Galileo\u2019s law of fall where objects fall with the same velocity, no matter their weight, size or shape. Although Galileo had great admiration and respect for the Catholic Church authorities, he was clearly aware of that Catholic authorities would never understand his scientific discoveries and considered them incorrect. His scientific discoveries, nevertheless, remain fundamental for the basic understanding of scientific concepts and many natural phenomena, today. This example seems to occur in our era with some important concepts in modern medicine. In the current issue of the journal, we are pleased to have two scientific reports that seem to show that we could be on the right tracks, at least, regarding some important points related to antioxidant therapy in sepsis. The first report is on the beneficial mechanism of action of the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and deferoxamine in experimental sepsis. This report by Kie\u0142borski et al (page 689) seems to be an \u2018opening path of progress\u2019 for clinical applications of antioxidants in patients with sepsis. The most compelling points of the report are that antioxidant therapy reduces mortality from sepsis and that this beneficial effect could be a result of increased IL-10 levels after administration of antioxidants. One of the main problems of intensive care physicians is to determine the optimal therapy to treat sepsis and septic shock. The first steps should be to increase the amount of circulating blood volume, and to administer antibiotics and to decrease the concentration of pyrogens and cytokines. These therapeutic principles, in addition to the administration of fluids with normal saline or isotonic chloride solutions, were first proposed by Sir Alfred Shooter 45 years ago (1). In the past 45 years, however, some important advances have occurred in the therapy against infection. The administration of blood and plasma is now often used in some critical patients with sepsis and shock. With the availability of cytokines in vitro, it is interesting to know how these components behave in vivo and can cause the septic state. The cytokines that are mainly produced early after severe infection are the tumour necrosis factors, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-y, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-a (2). The mechanism of action of cytokines also seems to involve the activation of monocytes/ macrophages, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and other phagocytic cells, including cells of the adaptative immune system. This is a very interesting and complex story that physicians, molecular biologists and immunologists must deeply investigate and try to clarify to identify the molecular mechanisms of action of cytokines in vivo. In this scenario, it seems that some of these cytokines (interleukins) have very important beneficial properties in sepsis/shock, such as IL-10, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-15. We may conclude that infection involves some interesting and very complicated events at the immunological level, which are difficult to understand in depth. The second report is that on the benefits of phosphodiesterase III and V inhibition for the protection of multiple organ dysfunction caused by endotoxin (3). This report by Jang et al (page 706) also seems to be an important step on a path of great interest. The concept of multiple organ dysfunction or shock is related to the disseminated activation of",

        "model_output": "[/INST]\n\nSummary of the Summary: [/INST-H]\n\nThe Study Text\n==================\n\n[/INST]\n\nDear Doctor\n\nThere is a lack of effective methods for predicting GH responsiveness in subjects with ISS [1,2,3,4] and to our knowledge genetic variation is the only tool available so far to do so. We aim, therefore, to define the genetic basis of response in GH-treated idiopathic short statured individuals under the hypothesis that a large genetic architecture is responsible for variability in response to GH [5].\n\nThe aim is to define the genetic architecture responsible of GH responsiveness in children with ISS and relate it to growth at one year of GH treatment. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that DNA will be extracted from a large enough population to characterise the genetic variation in ISS (at least 500 subjects), and one of few studies of its kind at a genome-wide level.\n\nClinical samples will be sequenced using the SureSelect technology followed by enrichment with the RNA baits on the GHS gene panel.\n\nThe genetic study will provide a list of variants that are significantly associated with variation in response to GH therapy. This is particularly interesting with respect to the GSK-sponsored TEDS study. The TEDS study has been monitoring approximately 300,000 children. One of the characteristics of this programme is that the data has been analysed independently from each centre. Analysis of large cohorts independently from each other may result in non-reproducible results due to missing data such as missing information about the response to the GH therapy, the age of the child at the start of the treatment, etc. (i.e. incomplete and missing data).\n\nParticipants in TEDS whose GH response was determined (i.e. using genetic analysis) by the Genetic Study will be compared with those whose GH response was not determined in TEDS. Moreover, these participants will also be compared with similar patients whose GH response was determined in TEDS using growth measures.\n\nParticipants will be selected from different population cohorts. The samples will be analyzed in one central lab. Therefore, analysis of variation in GH responsiveness is possible via genetic analysis even in the absence of any analysis of GH response using a growth measure.\n\nThe goal is to better understand how ISS develops, to develop better management of ISS and to potentially find novel GH sensitivity markers for future clinical trials. These will be extremely important achievements for healthcare and clinical development, and will have positive future implications for all areas of medicine that are linked to diseases and disorders showing variability in their response to treatment.\n\nThe study will also provide a powerful resource to identify novel pathways and putative predictors of growth and GH response. This is expected as this is a large cohort study, thus providing more statistical power than studies of the same size from other centres. The study will also be the first to provide a genetic analysis of the genetic determinants affecting the response to GH therapy in humans.\n\nWhat we are asking in this study is that the participants of the study will provide a blood sample at the start of the study. The sample will be sent to our central laboratory and will be stored in liquid nitrogen. These samples will not contain any identifiable information. We may also need to take another blood sample when the participant is on year three of GH therapy.\n\nIf you would like to participate, your doctor will collect a small sample of blood from a vein in your child\u2019s arm. The sample will be used to find genetic variants. Before taking a blood sample, we will ask you to sign the consent form to take part in the study. During the study your doctor will enter some notes about your child in a research database. If you do not want us to enter notes about your child into a database, you should inform your doctor as soon as possible. If you inform us about your decision at any time while your child is already in the study we will still continue using the data that we have about your child in the study.\n\nParticipation is completely voluntary and a participant can end his participation or withdraw from the study at any time. This does not affect the care you will receive from any treatment. Once you have agreed to join the study, any information we already have about your child will be used for the study. If at any time you want to withdraw your consent, just inform your doctor who will record your wish in the research database. This decision will not affect any future treatment.\n\nYour doctor has given you",

In the ICU, care-related awakenings occur frequently, but it is unclear if differential neurocheck frequencies result in differential sleep, providing the scientific premise for this proposal.\nPopulation: Twenty-two patients (N=11 per group) who have undergone elective aneurysm coiling will be enrolled. On post-operative day (POD) 0, patients will be screened and approached for informed consent if they do not meet exclusion criteria, e.g., prior intracranial injury, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, mechanical ventilation. Patients with elective aneurysm coiling are being chosen because they require ICU level of care following their intracranial procedure, but do not have structural brain injury or ongoing sedation needs that might impact sleep measurements.\nMethods: Usual care: Patients are monitored every 15-30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-procedure, then Q1 or Q2 for up to 24 hours. If these patients remain stable, they are discharged home on post-operative day (POD) 1. Proposed Intervention: Enrolled patients will be randomized to Q1 or Q2 neurochecks following the institutionally required 6 hours of stable neurological and vascular checks.

In addition, Cu(Gly)(2), which has the strongest Cu-N bond, also showed the greatest antibacterial activity toward Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. These results indicate that the Cu-N bond, which is formed via the amino groups of an amino acid in the bisamidinate ligand, is important for the antibacterial action of M(2) and highlights the significance of the ligand's nature and structure for antibacterial activity. An X-ray crystal structure analysis of M(dab) revealed that there was no significant difference in the metal coordination sphere when comparing Cu(dab)(2) with Cu(Gly)(2). In addition, an X-ray structural analysis of M(Glu)(2) suggested that the Cu-N bond in M(Glu)(2) was too weak to influence the antibacterial action, whereas the Cu-N bond in M(dab)(2) and M(Gly)(2) was sufficiently stable to permit the influence of the d-electrons of the Cu ion on the resulting antibacterial action towards P. aeruginosa. The results suggest that the Cu-N bond in these M(dab)(2) and M(Gly)(2) metal complexes is crucial for their antibacterial activity, and the reason for this difference from M(Glu)(2) is that the d-electrons of the Cu ion cannot influence the hydrophilicity of the Cu-N bond in Cu(Glu)(2), but can do so in Cu(dab)(2) and Cu(Gly)(2). <EOD> Dental health education and prevention\nAn understanding of the processes that determine the occurrence of dental caries is essential to the prevention of the disease.

To better ascertain the potential prognostic significance of ENE by histomorphology.\n\n\nBackground: The pathologic presence of extranodal extension (ENE) is independently associated with significantly worse prognosis in N2 and N3a cN+ head and neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). ENE is detected on routine pretreatment imaging scans in up to 30% of patients with HNSCC and as many as 90% of patients with large tumors and clinically node-positive disease. Accurate staging of radiologic ENE is therefore of high importance to guide surgical and/or radiation management of these patients.\n\nConclusions: The importance of clinicians acknowledging the potential significance of radiologic ENE in patients with cN+ HNSCC has been increasingly highlighted. Radiologic ENE should be taken into account in HNSCC patients with cN+ disease.\n\nEthical Approval: Ethical approval obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at each of the participating institutions. This study was ethically approuved by all the involved Institutes. Data for this study will be extracted from patients' clinical records. Patients will not be recalled or exposed to additional assessment solely in the context of this study and the study would not impact upon patient care.\n\nCareer: The study investigators include specialist clinicians and surgeons involved in the acquisition, classification and radiological assessment of imaging ENE. The study would benefit current and future patient care and would not require any direct financial input from patients in terms of travel and or treatment costs.\n\nTrial Registration: This intergroup study is registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ID number ISRCTN72782437).\n\n\nTrial Registration: This ISRCTN72782437.\n\n\nStudy Location: This trial will be conducted in various centres throughout Europe. Recruitment will take place at the participating centers.\n\nNumber of Participants: Each center will be requested to identify approximately 4 to 8 patients meeting the selection criteria. Assuming each participating center will recruit approximately 4 patients per year, overall, we were expecting approximately 35 (4  x 9) patients or 10 patients per arm over 2 years.\n\nPurpose: To determine whether iENE may serve as an effective predictive and prognostic marker for local recurrence and survival.\n\nTime Frame: For the primary study outcome of accuracy, radiology report data were collected from January 1999 to December 2023.\n\nPrimary Endpoint: To evaluate the accuracy in radiologic diagnosis of iENE for the classification of pENE.\n\nSecondary Endpoint: To investigate the association between iENE detected by radiologic methods and long-term outcomes in locally advanced HNSCC (especially tumors that are more than 4 cm in diameter).\n\nTertiary Endpoints: To evaluate the",

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",

The summary should only be the summarization of the given trial. Do not explain how you summarize it.\nInput Text: African Americans (AA) Communities Speak\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nClinicians frequently care for patients who have preferences related to treatment that contradict those of patients and their families (e.g., aggressive vs comfort-focused treatment choices) 1-2 . These discordant treatment preferences, or Goals of Care (GC), are influenced by the patients' values, beliefs, and cultural background 1 . Discordant patient/family preferences present challenges for clinicians and result in communication-related conflict and clinician frustration 1-3 . The source of these conflicts and related stress can be identified in the patient's health care experience. Specifically, clinicians working in the hospital or in the community commonly identify bias, racism, and discrimination towards African Americans that lead to lower quality care, worse patient experiences, and decreased patient trust in health care systems, leading, in turn, to less optimal care 4-6 . These discordant GC and disparities in care quality are not evenly distributed among clinicians or across clinicians' practice sites, due in part to the presence of unequal access to quality care, as well as health disparities in populations that are not of European ancestry. African Americans have high GC preferences for comfort and quality of life, 1,2,7-10 which is reflected in their use of hospice over time. These preferences may be impacted by race-affinity, family culture, and the importance placed on religion and spirituality 11-13 . These preferences should be discussed with African Americans to enhance patient-centered care. A better understanding of African American preferences could lead to personalized care (e.g., shared decision-making) rather than traditional, 'one size fits all' care strategies, and improve African Americans' trust in healthcare providers and systems. The African American Communities' Speak, or AACS, education intervention was created to address African American preferences and disparities in goals of care. AACS empowers African American clinicians and their families in the following ways: the program aims to enhance clinician skills in: understanding the sources of race-related disparities in care; communicating effectively with African American patients/families about their goals of care; and identifying and discussing sources of racism and bias. The AACS education program for clinicians and their families will be developed with the input of African Americans, and then be tested and measured in an initial randomized control trial, to ensure changes in clinician attitudes, knowledge, and performance are shown. AACS will be an evidence-based intervention/program that will have a measurable clinical impact and can be implemented within clinical systems and healthcare organizations across the USA. To develop and pilot-test the AACS program in collaboration with community stakeholders (African Americans and clinicians ), with the goal of disseminating and supporting the program nationwide via a CDC-type resource center/repository, in collaboration with public health leaders. This paper outlines the steps of the project, the pilot testing and potential dissemination phase of the research project and program.

However, patients with HPV+ Head and Neck cancers are treated according to the same referential as HPV- Head and Neck cancers.

This clinical fact was not observed in the other types of HNSCC and we can assume that this is due to a greater sensitivity of HPV+ HNSCC to immunotherapy.\u00a0It is however not possible to predict upfront the positive or negative status of this HPV (for a given tumor) because the HPV profile is determined based on the sequencing results of HPV-16 (more sensitive). However, it is not the only one because there are other HPV, also linked to head and neck cancers.\n\n* The identification of other genomic markers is therefore likely to constitute a new line of investigation.\n\n* As a first step, there is a\u00a0need to obtain genomic data on a larger scale.

Approaching the different dimensions of PSR calls on a dozen essential components: workload, autonomy, social support, burnout, anxiety, efforts made, rewards, work addiction, investment, etc. a specific questionnaire which usually contains 20 to 30 questions, so that having an overall view of PSR using the current reference questionnaires (Karasek, Siegrist, etc.) represents a total of more than 300 questions. The response time is thus incompatible with current medical practice (passage in the waiting room before the occupational health medical examination) and leads to a majority of non-responses during anonymous questionnaires on the Internet. On the other hand, these validated questionnaires were carried out by different people and are very heterogeneous between them, including in their formulation, so that the respondents have the impression of disorganization and anarchy. There is therefore a need for short, quick and uniform questionnaires. EVAs offer the incredible advantage of meeting these criteria: speed, uniformity, precision. From a data analysis point of view, EVAs also have the advantage of offering a continuous quantitative response, allowing the use of all statistical approaches.

Some of these analogs showed moderate to good inhibition of PI3K and HDAC at low micromolar concentration, and the best inhibitors demonstrated high enzymatic selectivity. The 2,3-dioxo-N-phenylpropanamide derivatives containing N-methylindole moiety showed the strongest dual effects. Among these analogs, compound 3m showed promising antiproliferative activity and reasonable safety profile, implying it as an excellent drug candidate. Therefore, we plan to exploit 3m as a clinical candidate for treating pancreatic carcinoma. <EOD> Influence of phospholipase A on the formation of monofunctional complexes of cationic proteins with DNA.\nThe influence of the lipocalm 3000 preparation of phospholipase A (15 mg/l) on the formation of monofunctional complexes of the basic protamine complex and the histones H1, H5 and pH2(86A) with DNA in the systems with physiological concentrations of sodium has been investigated using the method of thermal denaturation of DNA. This preparation did not affect the stability of the protamine-DNA complex, but promoted the histone H1-DNA complex disintegration. <EOD> Hormonal, nutritional, and metabolic factors as inducements of adrenal medullary hyperplasia in laboratory rats with inherited hypertension.\nThe adrenal medulla is characterized, in the normal state and in various conditions, especially in neoplastic diseases, by an increased basophilia. The basophilia is regarded as an expression of increased cell function or alterations of the pigment granule population. Hypertension in Sprague-Dawley rats is a characterized genetic disease which is associated with hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla that is independent of the blood pressure. The basophilia of the adrenal medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is reduced and unchanged in young and adult rats, respectively, after treatment with a single dose of epinephrine. Hypophysectomy of young animals produces hyperplasia not only of the adrenal medulla but also of the myocardium, which, however, is much less pronounced than the hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla. After administration of thyroxin, as well as of 1-d-pindolol, a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, the basophilia of the adrenal medulla is increased. The effects are inhibited by a treatment with reserpine or atropine. It is concluded that: 1. The adrenal medulla of SHR of either sex is characterized by an increased basophilia. In the young animal the basophilia is significantly reduced by administration of epinephrine, whereas in the adult animal this effect is not observed. 2. Hypophysectomy results in hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla, as well as of the myocardium, in both young and adult SHR. 3.

After training eight intensive care nurses on two different occasions, significant improvements in the accuracy with which the nurses were able to measure ICP were found. The findings of this study indicate, therefore, that didactic lectures combined with practical experience using a simulator can be a useful education and training method in this difficult skill. Further, in light of the high failure rate in training ICP technicians, it is hoped this type of training will prove successful in improving the quality of ICP measurements made in routine practice. <EOD> Influence of Birth Order and Birth Weight on the Incidence of Aortic Aneurysm and Aortic Dissection\nBackground. The aim of our study was to investigate whether birth order and/or birth weight influence the risk of hypertension in the later life, and furthermore, whether these factors influence the incidence of aortic aneurysm and/or aortic dissection. Method. In 1953 5436 (3122 men) births were registered in the city of Oulu, Finland. The subjects were classified according to their birth order (primitive, middle, last\u2010born) in relation to their siblings (nonsiblings included). Birth weight data were available from 45 to 50 years for 2437 persons (1277 men). Results. The mean age at the time of the study was 52 (1) years. Those with only nonsiblings had the highest incidence (0.11/1 000 person\u2010years) of aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection, while the secondborn had the highest incidence of other hypertension (1.44/1 000 person\u2010years, P5.0 kg at birth. Conclusions. It was found that the incidence of aortic aneurysm and dissection is increased in the siblings of nonsibling children, compared with the siblings of middleborn children. The birth order may be a risk factor of aortic dissection. Birth order may predict the risk of hypertension, although the association of this with aortic dissection seems to be explained by genetic factors. The incidence of aortic aneurysm was not associated with birth order. For those weighing less than 4.5 kg at birth, the incidence of heart failure due to aortic dissection and other hypertension was higher than that of aortic aneurysm cases, compared with those born with a normal birth weight. <EOD> The Prognostic Importance of the Incomplete Distal Inferior Vascular Bundle Crimping in Right Coronary Artery Cusp Atresia\nBackground: An incomplete crimping (ICM) of the inferior vascular band (IVB) of right coronary artery ostium in the absence of a left-sided dominant anatomy and the prognostic importance of this observation have been rarely studied.

The cardinal symptoms of Parkinson's disease are tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. As the disease progresses, it causes more pronounced stiffness, more prominent bradykinesia, hypokinesia with gait disturbance, postural instability, and difficulty in turning.The incidence rates of Parkinson's disease are 10 to 25 per 100,000 annually. 2 More than 1.5 million people worldwide are currently affected by this disease; over the next 20 years, this number will continue to grow by 40% to 45% in industrialized countries.

The \u03b2-glucan is identified as a main component of BLEX 404. Not only with therapeutic potential on several types of cancer, BLEX 404 has also shown the potential to improve hematopoiesis, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, and the cytotoxicity activity of immune cells in recent animal studies. Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity. BLEX 404 enhances hematopoiesis by increasing mouse bone marrow cell and human cord blood cell differentiation into granulocytes-macrophages (GMs), granulopoiesis and mobilization of granulocytes, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF production.

Advanced lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. More than half of the lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common variant and is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 mutations is clinically heterogeneous, with poor response to standard first line therapy. Therefore, there remains an unmet need to develop effective treatments. Osimertinib is a third generation EGFR-TKI which binds to the same site on EGFR as other first and second generation EGFR-TKIs. A Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of osimertinib in patients with EGFR T790M mutation have shown sustained clinical effectiveness beyond progression on EGFR TKIs with manageable adverse events. EMPULSE-Lung-07 is an open label, phase I/II study which was planned to investigate Pemetrexed+Cisplatin and Osimertinib combination as an EGFR exon 20 insertion first line therapy for EGFR exon 20 insertion NSCLC patients. BLEX404 (BLEX Bioscience, Inc., New Taipei City, Taiwan) is a proprietary 800 mg/ml of EGFR-TKI and MMP inhibitor, which is developed for treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. BLEX404 is a highly water-soluble crystalline powder and is formulated into an oral liquid to optimize convenience and adherence to use by cancer patients through its favorable taste. BLEX404 combined with Pemetrexed or Paclitaxel was found to elicit strong anticancer effect with low toxicity and could be a new therapeutic option in treating NSCLC patients. Study objectives: Primary: Determination the dose-limiting toxicity in the first cycle of combination use of BLEX404 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in stage IV NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations Secondary: Determination the recommended dose level in the first cycle of combination use of BLEX404 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in stage IV NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 mutations Assessments: Treatment-emergent adverse events, objective response rate at Cycle 4 (defined as at least 4 cycles of therapy or at least 90 days on therapy and within 7 days after last therapy), progression-free survival (the probability of subjects surviving with disease progression at given survival time), overall survival (the probability of subjects surviving from the time of randomization until death from any cause), quality of life and pharmacokinetics, and serum concentration of BLEX404, Pemetrexed and H 3 BF 4 , and urine concentration of BLEX404 or Pemetrexed. Study design: Open-label, single center, phase I/II study with a 3+3 doseescalation design in part A. Part B patients will receive BLEX404 800mg/ml, Pemetrexed 500mg/ m 2 , and Cisplatin 75mg/m 2 Q3W.\n[/PART]\nPrior Research in the Treatment of NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20 Mutations\n---------------------------\n\nTreatment options for EGFR exon 20 patients with NSCLC are very limited.

The data was collected from the KNHANES V1 (2010-2012) and the KYRBWS V (2011 and 2015), conducted as a follow-up study for adults, aged 19~39 years, who underwent the KNHANES IV surveys from 2007 to 2009. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between various risk factors and suicidality, including suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. We also used multiple imputation by chained equations (N=700) for missing data of child abuse history for more accurate estimation of the impact of the risk factors of suicidality.Results:The findings showed a high prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology in college students. High-risk behavior included current smoking, alcohol consumption, a lower level of caregiver support, and a poor family financial state during childhood. Child abuse history was significantly related to suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. The risk factors for suicidality include younger age, females, physical abuse during childhood, low-level household income, and lower level of caregiver support during childhood. Multiple logistic regression revealed that child abuse during childhood, lower level of caregiver support at baseline, and low-level household income increased the odds of suicidal ideation. In addition, child abuse during childhood, low-level caregiver support, and low-level household income increased the odds of attempted suicide.Conclusion:We found a high prevalence of child abuse history. Suicidality is associated with risk factors including younger age, low caregiver support, low-level household income, and child abuse.\n\n# Introduction\nDuring their college years, students experience various types of stress, including academic failure, economic instability, relationship stress, and pressure for excellence, and these stressors are often present for a long time.

The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). In the case of rehabilitation of older patients post-COVID-19, we do not know what the course of recovery for these patients will be, and what treatment/approaches will deliver the best outcomes.\nPersons that are recovering from a COVID-19 infection, and admitted on a geriatric ward for early rehabilitation, or geriatric rehabilitation ward or facility, can be included in the study. They will receive routine, usual care; participation in this study will not affect their rehabilitation care. Routine care data will be collected from their electronic patient files at admission to geriatric rehabilitation, and at discharge. This also includes some data about their premorbid status. In addition, study participants will be called six weeks and six months after discharge from rehabilitation and asked some questions about their recovery. There is no risk association with participation in this study. Data will be anonymously collected in an online database.\nThe primary aim of this study is to get insight into the course of recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe. Mainly, we are interested in functioning in activities of daily living (ADL-functioning) such as toileting, bathing, dressing, etc., and in quality of life. The second aim of this study is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organization of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive. Therefore, we collect data on the types of care provided and the professionals involved. Moreover, we collect some patient characteristics such as year of birth, gender, date of admission and date of discharge; and data about complications such as delirium, pain, post-traumatic stress syndrome, hospital readmissions, and mortality. Our hypothesis is that most patients will show recovery during geriatric rehabilitation and in the six months after. However, we expect that the amount and/or speed of recovery will vary between patients.",

After one or two doses of the bivalent Omicron mRNA vaccine we evaluate humoral and cellular immune response in all participants by determination of receptor binding domain (RBD) specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations in serum. After 3 doses of the bivalent Omicron BA.4 and/or BA.5 mRNA vaccine, this evaluation is repeated together with a determination of anti-spike neutralizing capacity. After both vaccinations, we also investigate the frequency of T cells that recognize BNT162b2 virus-infected human cells in the blood of the participants. Furthermore, two-dose COVID-19 vaccination is supplemented by (optional) two doses of the Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (Shingrix). After the second Shingrix vaccination, participants will be included in the vaccine herpes zoster study.\n\nWe compare humoral and cellular responses to COVID-19 vaccines in participants who continue treatment with everolimus instead of mycophenolate mofetil. To do so, we will compare responses from recipient of everolimus with matched recipients who remain on CNI.\n\nWe also include a group of kidney transplant recipients that receive the herpes zoster vaccine during the study, but do not receive COVID-19 vaccination. This study arm allows us to investigate a potential induction of herpes zoster vaccinemediated immunity in participants on everolimus after COVID-19 vaccination as a side-effect.\n\nThe inclusion of participants who accept to provide an additional blood sample after three doses of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will allow us to further investigate cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on the number and phenotype of memory T cells of the participants. We will use the blood samples and compare them with data generated from serum obtained after standard clinical chemistry measurements.\n\nPrimary Objective\n==================\nTo investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in higher immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination, with a focus on neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain after second vaccination.\n\nKey Secondary Objective\n==================\nTo investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in higher immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination, with a focus on frequency of T cells recognizing BNT162b2 virus-infected human cells after second vaccination.\n\nKey Secondary Objectives\n==========================\nTo evaluate the immunogenicity of replacing maintenance of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients to both the bivalent Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 and original/Omicron BA.1 (V-003-2022-NL7401, V15-00987-NL7401, ZIN-203302006.\n\nIntervention Arms\n================\nKidney transplant recipients who use everolimus instead of CNI for at least six weeks will receive the bivalent Omicron vaccination during the study.

The patients were classified either as schizophrenics (n = 20) or as having first psychotic schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) (n = 44). The pathologists who examined the autopsy material were unaware of the diagnostic category or the age of the subjects.\n\n\nFINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\nAt autopsy, the only macroscopic and microscopic differences found were that the cortical sulci were wider and the basal ganglia were larger in the patients with schizophrenia than in patients with SPD with psychosis, and that, compared to the SPD group, more patients with schizophrenia had an old cerebral infarct. <EOD> Improving Healthcare Resource Utilization in the Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome in the United States and Europe.\nEarly diagnosis and prompt treatment remain essential in achieving optimal outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Current management guidelines for ACS emphasize early recognition and prompt revascularization for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to reduce morbidity and mortality, but also suggest treatment with the same medical interventions applied early in patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) despite more delayed symptom presentation. The rapid diagnosis and successful treatment of ACS, though, are complicated by significant delays in presentation for treatment. The combination of late presentation and insufficient emergency medical services (EMS) transport to the nearest hospital capable of treating ACS are responsible for prolonged delays to hospital presentation. These delays in treatment may occur despite access to healthcare services and may lead to suboptimal patient outcomes. This review demonstrates ways to improve healthcare resource utilization in the treatment of ACS by utilizing evidence-based clinical strategies to reduce and/or eliminate delays encountered during the prehospital and emergency department (ED) phases of care. The review also focuses on measures to improve patient outcomes by reducing door-to-ECG and door-to-needle/balloon times. <EOD> ORIGIN OF VARICOSITIES.\nTwo patients presented with typical reticulate skin as a result of the long-term application (2 to 10 years) of hydroxyurea for the prophylactic treatment of a severe hemolytic anemia.

The summary should aim to communicate the key information succinctly and accurately based on the provided clinical trial report. It should capture the primary information. Avoid explaining or elaborating on the description of the study, instead, provide enough information to the reader to be able to decide if they would be interested in the study.\n\n# Explanatory Text\n__________________\n\nThe provided clinical trial is titled: Efficacy of Upper Trapezius Stretching on Neck Pain, Range of Motion and Disability in Patients With Cervical Spondylosis: A Randomised Controlled Trial.\n\nFourty-two patients with cervical spondylosis were randomly assigned to either the intervention (an upper fibers trapezius stretching intervention) or control group (standard care). The intervention consisted of specific stretching exercises designed to target the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle. The stretching exercises were performed under the guidance of a licensed physical therapist and involved extending the neck while gently pulling the head downward to stretch the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle.\n\nThe provided clinical trial results showed that the intervention group had a significant improvement in neck pain at 4 weeks and 3 months compared to the control group, as well as a significant improvement in neck range of motion and disability at 3 months. Overall, these findings suggest that the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention can effectively reduce neck pain and improve neck range of motion and disability for patients with cervical spondylosis.\n\nDiscussion\n__________________\nThe upper fibers of the trapezius muscle play a crucial role in maintaining balance, movement, and posture of the neck 1]. Individuals with cervical spondylosis may experience altered biomechanical and motor control of the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle, leading to the development of pain and decreased neck mobility 2,3]. The upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention aims to reduce neck pain and improve neck mobility by re-aligning the shoulder girdle and increasing the passive extensibility of the trapezius muscle, and has been found to be an effective treatment modality in clinical studies 4][5]. This clinical trial provides robust evidence for the use of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention as an effective treatment for individuals with cervical spondylosis.\n\nThe findings of this clinical trial are consistent with previous studies on manual therapy for individuals with neck pain, which suggests an overall benefit of manual therapy in reducing pain and disability 6]. This study also aligns with the conclusions of recent systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines on the management of neck pain, which highlight the importance of exercise as a treatment modality and the need for further research to better understand the effectiveness of specific intervention strategies 7,8].\n\nTaken together, the findings of this clinical trial support the use of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention as an effective treatment option for individuals with cervical spondylosis. By providing insights into the effects of the intervention and highlighting the promising potential of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence regarding the management of neck pain and disability.\n\nBackground information\n__________________\n\nCervical spondylosis is a commonly occurring pathology of the cervical spine that can cause varying degrees of neck pain. In more severe cases, it can lead to neck stiffness and reduced range of motion 9]. The upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention has been investigated as a potential treatment option to promote improved neck mobility and less pain in individuals with neck and shoulder pain. The intervention involves gently pulling down the head while extending the neck, with the intention of stretching the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle. While evidence suggests that the stretching intervention may be effective in reducing pain and improving function, there is little consensus on the relative benefits of specific trapezius stretching modalities. The efficacy of these modalities can vary based on individual factors such as pain location and severity, neck mobility, and specific features of the stretch being performed. Clinical guidance on the optimal stretching interventions for individuals with cervical spondylosis pain remains limited. This highlights the need for further research to determine the most effective approaches to alleviate the pain and improve the range of motion for patients with cervical pain.",

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

The results showed that, compared with the control group, 30 g.kg-1 PQ had no effect on the growth performance, digestion, immune, antioxidation and liver and kidney functions, but 70 g.kg-1 PQ decreased the apparent digestibility of dry matter (P < 0.05) and the total tract apparent digestibility of N and crude fat (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), depressed growth performance (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), decreased serum immunoglobulins (P < 0.05) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD, P < 0.01), increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) (P < 0.05) and diamine oxidase (DAO, P < 0.01), and increased serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN, P < 0.01) and creatinine (CRE, P < 0.05, P < 0.01). In conclusion, the addition of 30 g.kg-1 PQ to diet would improve the growth performance, digestion, immune and antioxidation and ameliorate the liver and kidney functions of growing pigs, and the inclusion rate of 70 g.kg-1 PQ in diet would reduce the growth performance as well as the serum immunoglobulins and T-SOD, and increase the serum BUN and CRE of growing pigs. <EOD> Mucosal and systemic immune responses after oral immunization with plasmacytoid dendritic cells pulsed with VP6 protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus\n\n2022) Mucosal and systemic immune responses after oral immunization with plasmacytoid dendritic cells pulsed with VP6 protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.\nPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a swine coronavirus; the VP6 of PEDV is a common viral antigen of the Alphacoronaviruses. Since oral administration of VP6-pulsed plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) has been demonstrated to have good immune protection against PEDV, it is important to investigate the possible mechanism of immunity after oral administration of VP6-pulsed in pDCs. In this study, we found that oral administration of pDCs pulsed with the VP6 of PEDV led to higher levels of VP6-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in serum, feces, and intestinal washouts at each time point (2wk, 4wk, 6wk and 24wk postimmunization) in piglets compared to those of the control groups.

This infertility may be due to pelvic adhesions and surgery but also because of poor oocyte quality. It is known that endometriosis is associated with an increase oxidative stress, wich induce chronic inflammation, deleterious effect for DNA, proteins and can caused cellular death. ROS markers found in follicular fluid or in serum are significatively higher in endometriosis women. The investigators want to dose a marker of apoptosis in infertile women and see if it's significatively higher in serum and in follicular fluid of patients with endometriosis compared to others infertility causes and if it's correlated to oocyte quality and IVF results. Real time PCR will be used to dose cell free DNA in serum and follicular fluid of patients undergoing IVF treatment (endometriosis and infertility due to tubal factor, male infertility or idiopathic cause).

Therefore, a precise assessment of ovarian steroids is essential to any study relating ovarian steroid concentrations with follicular and luteal development and/or function. Recently, we demonstrated the development and evaluation of a specific, and relatively simple method to extract and quantify steroids contained within complex biological fluids as well as within follicular fluids. We have attempted to use this method to quantify oestradiol metabolites present within the plasma and follicle fluids of 20 patients who had undergone laparoscopy for treatment of reproductive problems with a secondary finding of atrophic ovaries. Plasma was obtained from an antecubital vein in four of the 20 patients from which follicular fluid was also obtained. A 70 microl sample of plasma was extracted with dichloromethane in order to obtain an internal standard and then deconjugated. The extraction efficiency of conjugated steroids was > 85%. The concentration of oestradiol metabolites (conjugated + deconjugated) in plasma, venous ovarian blood and follicular fluid (FF) was estimated by radioimmunoassay. The recovery of oestradiol conjugated metabolites was 50% of the total (deconjugated + conjugated) metabolites. Follicular fluid concentrations of oestradiol metabolites were twofold higher than those in ovarian venous plasma in only three of the 20 patients. The total oestradiol extracted from the ovarian venous plasma samples was fivefold higher than that in plasma samples obtained from the same patients antecubital vein. Oestradiol values of either plasma or follicle fluid are likely to underestimate actual follicular fluid levels by omitting the contribution of the conjugated metabolites present. Therefore, we suggest a correction factor of 5 to be applied to oestradiol fluorescence values obtained from either plasma or follicle fluids to arrive at the correct follicle fluid oestradiol content. <EOD> Interaction of antibody specific for a human melanoma-associated antigen with human and murine melanoma cells in mixed culture.\nThe mouse monoclonal antibody B27 (IgG3) was found to react with a subset of melanoma cells. B27 reacted with only 4 of 32 (12.5%) human melanoma specimens, and 6 of 6 tumor cell lines established from metastatic lesions. B27 did not react with the cellular components of normal melanocytes, normal glia, normal blood elements, or normal epithelial cells of various organs. In a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay, B27 killed cell lines derived only from patients with metastatic melanoma, which was confirmed by subsequent studies in which B27 bound to the surface of only metastatic melanoma cells and reacted with the antigen only when the cells were grown in serum-free media. B27 bound to the antigen on the surface of the melanoma cells and not to antigens shared by epithelial cells. As demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies with metastatic melanoma cell lines, B27 did not react with antigens shared by other tumors commonly seen in human melanoma patients. When the B27 antibody was reacted with either human or murine melanoma cells under dissociated culture conditions, it preferentially reacted with the murine melanoma cells, a finding suggestive of complement-",

        "summary": "Background Patients experiencing problems with their conventional maxillary denture can benefit from implant- retained overdentures. Several retention systems are available. These retention systems can be roughly divided into bar-retained implant overdentures, in which multiple implants are splinted and the overdenture is attached through retentive clips, and into retention systems using non-splinted solitary attachments (locators). Evidence on maxillary implant overdenture attachment systems has been mostly short to medium term, non-comparing or retrospective. Even more, 10-years data of comparative studies are lacking.\nMain research question To compare treatment outcomes of fully edentulous patients with maxillary overdentures, supported by four implants, retained by either bars or locators . The primary objective of the study is to analyze marginal bone level changes by radiological assessments at 10-years follow-up. Secondary objectives are implant and overdenture survival, condition of peri- implant mucosa and patients' satisfaction.\nDesign (including population, confounders/outcomes) The study design is an observational study of a group of patients which were treated 10 years ago with dental implants and an overdenture in the maxilla because of problems with retention and stability with their conventional denture. Outcomes: primary outcome is the change in marginal peri-implant bone level 10 years after placing the overdenture. Secondary outcome measures will be implant and overdenture survival, peri-implant mucosa health and patients' satisfaction using a questionnaire.",

It has also been identified to display functions in kidney formation, thyroid, gastric cellular differentiation, and myelination of the central nervous system. It is considered a poor progression biomarker for numerous cancers, although it has been found to play a pivotal role in brain cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and liver cancer. Studies have shown a differential expression of TTF1 in the prostate. Its expression in prostate cancer has attracted attention since it is not expressed in normal prostate tissue. This review summarizes current knowledge of the relationship between TTF1 with the progression and outcome of prostate cancer.ARTICLE HISTORY\n\n# Introduction\nThe prostate cancer (PC) tumor microenvironment (TME)-including cancer cells and stroma-regulates tumor growth and dissemination in many human cancers. Improved knowledge in PC TME is a necessity for identifying targets for new therapies aimed at slowing disease progression and the metastatic spread of the tumor. The thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1, also known as NKX2.1) has proven to play a crucial role in prostate cancer progression. It is a homeodomain protein with three important domains: a homeodomain, a Trefoil motif domain, and a DNA-binding domain. The Trefoil motif domain is important for cell adhesion, migration, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. The NKX homeodomain is a transcription factor containing a specific DNA-binding sequence that is involved in cell differentiation. This factor is found in a number of tissues including lung, kidney, and many other tissues.\nRecent evidence has shown that TTF1 has a unique role in cancer. Cancer tissue often shows expression of TTF1, but its expression in normal tissue is rare. TTF1 is involved in growth, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. Its aberrant expression in cancer tissues has proven to have an essential role in tumorigenesis. The expression of TTF1 in normal cells and its potential role in PC has been highlighted. TTF1 is now considered a progression biomarker in a number of cancers,",

Thymoglobulin was evaluated in lung transplants at 3 mg/kg/d for 2 days. Twenty\u2010five sequential lung transplant patients received rabbit anti\u2010thymocyte globulin in 1995, another 25 in 1996. A retrospective analysis was completed for 12 months. The rate of rejection was significantly higher (14 vs. 11, p 500 \u03bcmol/L, 11 vs. 16, p 440 \u03bcmol/L. Two patients had antibiotic prophylaxis. The first used a 5\u2010day regimen of vancomycin and ciprofloxacin and the second a 2\u2010week course of ciprofloxacin/metronidazole. Two patients developed P. jirovecii pneumonia; antifungal prophylaxis was not used. The patients on vancomycin/ciprofloxacin had a median course of steroids of 9 days, whereas the second course was prolonged at 13 days, but these values were not statistically significant. Patients from the earlier course required a longer course of steroids. There were no serious complications. Patients who received steroids with thymoglobulin induction had prolonged courses of steroids, but no infectious complications were noted except for 2 cases of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy may be indicated in patients after thymoglobulin induction. <EOD> A comprehensive evaluation of the antifungal activity of chitosan and its combinations with plant extracts against the common fungal pathogens of tomato\nAbstract The present study was aimed at evaluating the fungicidal activity of chitosan (CTS), its combinations with plant extracts and the inhibitory effects of their treatments on fungal growth, disease development and yield attributes of tomato (Solanum lycopersicuum) plants against Fusarium oxysporum and F. solani. The in vivo inhibitory effect of CTS against the tested fungi was assessed by mycelia growth inhibition (MGI), and in vivo growth suppression (IGS), while the in vitro effect was estimated by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The synergistic effect of cinnamon and grape seed plants extracts (PE) in the combinations with different concentrations of CTS on the pathogenic in vitro fungal growth was also estimated using Chaverr\u00f3n et al (2013) index. The combinations of the tested fungi with 500, 1000, 1500 mg l\u20131 of CTS were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the percentage of MGI and IGS and also decreased (P < 0.01) the incidence of the studied fungi in the soil. High values of the MGI, IGS and MIC for both pathogens were recorded for the 1500 mg l\u20131 of CTS. In vitro growth suppression index estimated that combination of GPE-CTS and CSE-CTS were the most effective. The antagonist effect of GPE and CSE was synergistically increased with increase of CTS concentrations. It may be concluded that the GPE and CSE was effective alternatives to chemical pesticides for use as safe and biodegradable antifungal agents against tomato fungal pathogens. <EOD> A novel approach to estimate soil organic carbon pools in the European Soil Data Network\nWe describe a soil data\u2010inverted approach that can retrieve sub\u2010horizontal soil properties from large\u2010extent soil maps.

        "summary": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common gastroenterological disorders with a reported prevalence of 10% to 20% percent in Europe and the USA and less than 5% in Asia. GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores. Further the modulation of anxiety on the severity of reflux symptoms such as fullness, heartburn and dysphagia is examined.",

Previously, we reported that p53 abnormalities were detected in only 35% of soft tissue and bone sarcomas. In this study we investigated p53 status in more soft tissue and bone sarcomas, and extended our evaluation to include analysis of squamous cell carcinomas and endometrial carcinomas. Since exons 5 to 8, in which 80% of all reported mutations are located, were sequenced in p53 (7), we wanted to test a new assay that detects point mutations in any of the 10 exons of p53. For this assay (PCR-SSCP), we used genomic DNA directly from the tumor specimen. Amplification, denaturation and electrophoresis of the PCR-SSCP products was performed according to the method of T. Man, which was designed to improve the sensitivity of the SSCP technique. We compared results of this PCR-SSCP method with the previously published method (RT-PCR with immunochemistry). This PCR-SSCP assay, in which normal tissue is used as template for control, appears to be better for detecting point mutations in the p53 gene than the mutant-allele-specific PCR (MAS-PCR) assay. The 14 bone sarcomas investigated for mutations in this study by the PCR-SSCP method yielded good results: In 8 cases (57%) there were mutations in the exon 7 (encoding the putative zinc finger region), in 7 cases (50%) in exon 8 (encoding the C-terminus) and in 2 cases (14%) a point mutation was present in exon 5 (encoding the 1st zinc finger). These data suggest that mutations in the p53 genes play an important role in the pathogenesis of bone sarcomas. <EOD> Assessment of in vitro cyt",

The Doppler investigation of the uterine arteries in pregnant women carrying IUGR fetuses revealed a lower resistance index and an increase in the ratio of peak velocity flow to terminal flow. The data obtained have shown the diagnostic value of the Doppler examination of the uterine arteries in the evaluation of the vascular function of the uteroplacental complex in pregnant women carrying IUGR fetuses. <EOD> Connexin 30 Expression Is Increased during Permanent Inactivation of Cerebellar Nuclei\n\nThe expression of connexin 30 (Cx30), the major gap junction protein in Purkinje cells, was evaluated with a set of specific antibodies with different immunogen/antigen epitopes during Permanent Inactivation of Cerebellar Nuclei (PICN) in the cerebellum of adult rats. Our results show increased Cx30 levels at all nuclear and Purkinje cell layers, being the strongest increase in granule cells during PICN, and a lower increase observed in molecular layer cells, compared to the contralateral cerebellum. The changes in Cx30 expression patterns may be considered a compensatory mechanism produced in the adult rat cerebellum to decrease the disinhibition generated by PICN.\n\n# Introduction\nThe cerebral cortex has numerous synapses and long-range projections, which require a powerful excitatory transmission to regulate neural circuits. To this end, neurons must have a high amount of neurotransmitter receptors on their membranes in order to maintain a proper synaptic communication, but in some pathological situations the density of receptors on cell membranes may decrease generating an excessive attenuation of synaptic responses   Modulation of synaptic transmission by endocannabinoids, Lovinger     Effect of glutamate receptors on the regulation of synaptic transmission in the..., Lovinger     The role of serotonergic drugs in neuroprotection, Grzegorz     Acetylcholinesterase and adamantyl acetylcholinesterase blockers prevent muscarinic hyperexcitability and epileptogenesis: a novel..., Medina     GABA(B) receptor ligands prevent seizure activity induced by a GluR6-focused epileptogenic system, Jimenez  .

        "summary": "Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common genetic predisposition syndrome for colorectal cancer (CRC), responsible for around 2-4% of cancers. It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in this specific population. To this end, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing CAD EYE with CE in patients with LS.",

When polyps are detected, they are rigorously described and histological prediction of the endoscopist reported. Then polyps will be removed by polypectomy or mucosectomy. Removed polyps are then sent for anatomopathologic analysis.\n\nIn a subset of 40 patients, the endoscopist's description and the CAD EYE prediction will be compared.\n\nAt the end of the procedure, CAD EYE analysis is made retrospectively from the images acquired during examination. Only the histological report of the removed polyps defines the final diagnosis. This will be reported to the study sponsor within 6 months after the end of the trial or within 3 months after the end of the individual protocol for patients still included in the trial.

Although serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), quantitative serum immune electrophoresis (SIE), immunoelectrophoresis (IEP), and serum protein immunofixation (SPI) were repeatedly normal, a polyclonal component could not be ruled out by IEP and SPI performed on the patient's serum diluted with the patient's urine at a molar ratio of 1:10.

This study supports the hypothesis that \"preamyloid,\" the precursor of amyloidogenic monoclonal immunoglobulins, may arise not only in plasma cells, being the origin of the amyloid fibrils, but also in normal cells, playing no pathogenetic role.

        "summary": "Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now recommended as a first-line option in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation. However, current international clinical practice guidelines and product inserts suggest caution and/or avoidance in using DOACs in case of potential potential drug-drug interactions (DDI), including DDI with anticancer therapies. Indeed, potential important DDIs can affect the efficacy and safety of DOACs and/or anticancer therapies and/or other interfering medications in these patients. Data about the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DOACs in cancer patients are scarce. By using a PK approach, this study aims :\nto describe the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting\nto identify factors (age, weight, renal function, co-morbidities, etc) influencing the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting.",

PopPK analysis evaluates drug exposure in relationship to therapeutic outcome.\n\n\nStudy Expected Outcomes\n=================\n* Assessment of rivaroxaban exposure in cancer patients compared to previously reported in non-cancer patients (i.e., Phase I clinical trial and real-life experience).\n* Assessment of apixaban exposure in cancer patients compared to previously reported in non-cancer patients (Phase I clinical trial).\n* Identification of covariates influencing rivaroxaban and apixaban exposure in cancer patients.\n* Identification of covariates influencing cancer patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban (cancer) compared to rivaroxaban or apixaban controls (e.g. AF or VTE).\n* Identification of clinical correlates of rivaroxaban and apixaban exposure in cancer patients.\n* Population pharmacokinetic evaluation of rivaroxaban and apixaban concentrations adjusted with cancer patients characteristics including sex, age, weight, renal function, DDI, etc.: * DDI includes concomitant antitumoral treatments such as: anthracyclines, taxanes, oxaliplatin etc.\n* Potential impact of the DDI on drug exposure (AUC):\nAdjustment for weight using allometric method (body weight)\nAdjustment for renal function using (eGFR)\nAdjustment for sex:\nRivaroxaban: women are known to be more sensitive to DOACs than men (AUC in women is a little bit higher)\nApixaban: to our knowledge no gender-related difference of apixaban pharmacokinetics.\n* Potential impact of the DDI on exposure-effect relationship\n\nWhat is rivaroxaban?\n\n\n\nRivaroxaban is the brand name for a drug that is a highly potent, orally active, direct, highly selective, competitive inhibitor of the enzyme activated factor X bound in plasma. Direct Factor Xa inhibitors like rivaroxaban prevent the natural breakdown of blood clots and prevents blood clots from forming and/or growing. Rivaroxaban does not require frequent laboratory monitoring as the patient's exposure to the drug remains relatively stable at steady-state. It is approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and for the postoperative period following hip or knee replacement.\n\n\n\nWhat are the side effects?\n\n\nRivaroxaban can result in increased bleeding (bruising, nosebleeds, epistaxis), and bleeding at other sites (e.g. intracranial, gastrointestinal, gingival, gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleedings). Severe bleeding can lead to life-threatening conditions including intracranial hemorrhage or death.\n\n\n\n\n## Why are cancer patients on rivaroxaban? \nThe use of rivaroxaban may have the benefits over conventional anticoagulants in cancer patients because it is rapidly absorbed (less interference of anticoagulated food) and does not require laboratory monitoring (lesser inconvenience to patient), and can be associated with less bleeding events. However, clinicians should note that rivaroxaban has a small elimination half-life of 12 hours in healthy volunteers, and a relatively large number of these individuals had an international normalized ratio (INR) above therapeutic range on the last day of drug intake (12 individuals; 12/60; 20%); this can be of increased concern when used in cancer patients receiving concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs. It should not be used concomitantly with direct FXa inhibitors, unless approved drug-drug interaction studies confirm this is feasible and not harmful.\nCancer is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and stroke and the risk is increased by other factors such as a poor performance status, prior vascular surgery, incisional surg",

In Vero cells, SV5 replicated more efficiently than VSV. The expression of the beta-interferon (beta-IFN) gene, as measured by luciferase (LUC) reporter activity, was 3-4 times higher in Vero cells infected with SV5 or with VSV than in uninfected cells, being maximal (at 24-48 h post infection) at lower virus titers. However, in MLE cells, SV5 replicated poorly compared with VSV, and beta-IFN production at high levels was observed at 24 h post infection; thereafter, the replication of VSV also decreased significantly. In MLE cells infected with SV5, at high multiplicities of infection, beta-IFN mRNA, protein and LUC activity were observed at 36 or 48 h, indicating that expression from the SV5 genome was enhanced at comparable multiplicities of infection (at 36 or 48 h). In summary, the levels of the induction of the beta-IFN gene promoted by SV5 were much higher in Vero cells than in MLE cells, although only at low levels of SV5 infection in MLE occurred. It followed that expression of the beta-IFN gene depends on multiplicities of infection in epithelial cells such as MLE cells. <EOD> In Vitro Antifungal Activity of Essential Oils from Artemisia scoparia ssp.

New and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity.\nThis study looks to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of such a model, using rehabilitation technology to enrich and enhance delivery of rehabilitation within an NHS inpatient stroke unit environment. This model of rehabilitation delivery has already been tested by the research team with community-dwelling participants in the chronic phase of stroke (over a year since stroke) and is known to be feasible and safe. Participants will be recruited from the stroke unit at University Hospital Wishaw during the acute and sub-acute phase of stroke (0-6 months since stroke), if requiring rehabilitation following a stroke and deemed medically fit enough to participate. Participants will be supported to complete activities in a newly dedicated 'technology enriched rehabilitation space' by NHS staff, in addition to their usual treatment. This will enable participants to engage in rehabilitation activities relating to their physical, cognitive, visual, communication and functional goals using equipment such as an adapted treadmill, interactive screens and tablets, upper limb exercise devices, power-assisted gym equipment and virtual reality. All devices are commercially available and known to be safe for use with stroke patients, however the use of such devices within NHS services is currently known to be under-utilised.

Materials and methods: The human oral squamous carcinoma cell line of KB-3-1 (human oral squamous cells carcinoma) was purchased from Nawah Scientific Inc. (Cairo, Egypt). The cells were grown on plastic tissue culture dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). The cells were seeded into 96-well plates in 200 lL DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 in a humidity incubator. After 24 hours, the cells were incubated with serial dilutions of both plant extracts in culture medium for 72 hours. The cells were then assessed by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium)-based cell proliferation kit and IC 50 determination (concentration at which the treated cells were inhibited by 50% in comparison to control ones). Results: The cytotoxic concentrations were obtained by adding 20 lL of the extract to the wells in the culture plates in duplicate. Then, the plates were left for 24 hours to allow the treated cells' recovery before MTT solution was added to the wells and they were incubated for 4 h. The result showed that the cytotoxic concentrations of T. platyphyllos extract (TP) versus the methanolic extract from T. americana (TM) were 220 lg/mL versus 200 lg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, T. platyphyllos extracted by ethanol had a greater cytotoxic effect on the human oral squamous carcinoma cell line KB-3-1, as shown by IC 50 values of 197 lg/mL and 220 lg/mL, respectively. Conclusion: T. platyphyllos extract had higher cytotoxic activity than T. americana extract on the oral squamous cell carcinoma. These methanolic or ethanolic extracts from Tilia americana and T. platyphyllos could be useful for developing drugs against human oral squamous carcinoma cell lines.\n\n# Introduction\nHuman oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSC) is a common form of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

We report the findings of histopathological and cytological studies of 12 cases of adenocarcinoma obtained before and after NAC. Methods: The pre-, post- and final curettage specimens from 12 patients with endometrial cancer were submitted to morphological and immunohistochemical study. Results: In 5 cases (41.6%) the pretreatment specimen showed squamous differentiation. In 7 cases (58.3%) the cytology was diagnostic of carcinoma. 5 of 12 tumors were considered resistant (<90% necrosis), but 7 tumors had >90% necrosis and were therefore considered responders to NAC in our study. 3 cases presented cell clusters with a clear cytoplasm and central areas of necrosis. 2 cases presented papillary fragments. The treatment was well tolerated by all patients. The only complication was pain during curettage in 1 case. Conclusion: NAC was an effective method of decreasing the extent of surgical procedures and facilitating local control, and should be offered to some subset of patients with advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma when the primary tumor is surgically unresectable. <EOD> A rapid method for detecting Salmonella spp. on foods using a polyclonal immunoglobulin Y-stabilized whole-cell O/W emulsion\nA new immunochromatographic method was developed to detect Salmonella spp. on fruits, vegetable leaves, and grains. Salmonella serogroup O antigens were stabilized by adsorption to polyclonal immunoglobulin Y (IgY) stabilized with a liposome system to eliminate the interference of organic fluids present in foods. The assay can be completed (incubating the test sample in a tube) within 1 h of receiving a sample. Two polyclonal IgYs produced in chickens and rabbits against the O antigens of Salmonella (Salmonella group B, C2, and D1) were mixed with a suspension of Salmonella to create the immunochromatographic test strip. All 84 serotypes, belonging to the 22 subgroups, could be detected by the immunochromatographic test strip, although the Salmonella enterica spp. Enteritidis (ET), I 4,[5],12:i :, and Heidelberg O:19 could not be detected. The specificity of the assay in identifying three serotypes differing from Salmonella spp. was 99.2%. In testing more than 6,300 fruits, vegetable leaves, and grains, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatographic test strip were 85.3 and 88.8%, respectively, indicating good accuracy. The results showed that this test strip would be useful as a sensitive, specific method of rapid detection of Salmonella spp. in foods. <EOD> Comparison of Intravenous and Oral Fosfomycin (Fosfan\u00ae) Activity in an Experimental Enterococcus faecium Strain Infection In Mice\nSummary The effect of different routes of administration of fosfomycin (Fosfan\u00ae) was studied in an experimental Enterococcus faecium infection in mice.

We performed a pooled analysis of 77,899 participants with 4,996 incident cases of coronary heart disease (CHD) from the Women's Health Initiative. We evaluated the joint association of early postmenopausal weight gain with CHD risk, and assessed whether the association was mediated through weight cycle-induced changes in lipids and glucose. Compared to women who remained stable in weight between 1 and 3 years postmenopause, women who gained a moderate amount (2.1-4.9 kg) had a 20% greater risk of CHD. This association was attenuated to the null after additionally adjusting for changes in lipids and glucose (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83 to 1.11). In separate analyses of lipids and glucose, we found that changes in glucose explained 34% (CI: \u2212 12 to 66%) of the association between postmenopausal weight gain and CHD, which was attenuated to the null after removal of glucose. Our study suggests that weight gain 1 to 3 years following menopause is associated with CHD risk independent of changes in lipids and glucose, however, this association is attenuated and does not reach statistical significance.\n\n# Introduction\nCardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death among women in the US. The onset of menopause marks the beginning of an excess in CVD among women, with the rate of CVD beginning to increase from the age of 45 yearsand approaching that of men by 49 years. Obesity, a wellestablished cardiovascular risk factor, is inversely associated with age of the onset of menopause. Menopause is also accompanied by a decrease in levels of estrogen which has been linked with increased cholesterol levels. Weight gain associated with menopause has been associated with changes in lipids and glucose, which are associated with the risk of CHD in both men and women.\nAn inverse relationship between age and adiposity exists, such that there is weight gain following menopause, on average. While studies have typically focused on abdominal and central adiposityor overall weight change over time, a study by suggested that weight gain occurring immediately after menopause might be particularly problematic. Given that risk of CHD typically increases after the onset of menopause, an increased risk for CHD is expected if weight gain after menopause occurs. However, while studies have suggested a higher risk of several cardiov",

In response to the WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Strategy, domestic bivalent HPV vaccine has been offered free of charge to adolescent females aged 13-14 years, but there is still a lack of evidence comparing the antibody titer levels of domestic HPV vaccine and imported HPV vaccine in younger females. Therefore, we conducted the present immunogenicity study to explore the immunogenicity and immune persistence after vaccination with domestic bivalent HPV vaccine versus imported HPV vaccine in this age group of females.",

The serologic diagnosis of the disease is based essentially on testing serum antibody titers using the indirect immunofluorescence method (IFA). In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for detection of CCHF virus-specific antibodies after adaptation of an indirect immunoperoxidase test (ATRS) described elsewhere. The antibody titers of IgG to 3 structural proteins of the virus (N, Gc, and Gn) and the phosphoprotein (P) from a panel of serum samples collected from patients from Southeast Asia were determined by IFA and the ATRS. The results showed that ELISA using P or G protein in combination with P protein (GpC) to detect IgM antibodies as a diagnostic criterion for CCHF is a promising test procedure in terms of sensitivity and specificity. This ELISA method could be considered as an alternative to more expensive and time-consuming tests like IFA.\nCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe and often fatal disease caused by an arenavirus. It is transmitted by ticks and, in some regions, by bites from hematophagous arthropods. The virus is transmitted to humans by tick bites and by contact with fresh blood, which contains virus-containing ticks, the excreta of infected animals, or the body fluids of infected individuals or patients during medical interventions such as blood transfusions and autopsy procedures, including infected and/or freshly dead animals.\nIn the former Soviet Union, CCHF was first diagnosed in Crimea during a large epidemic in 1944 and from cattle with hematemesis   Tick-borne viral diseases in animals and humans, Kop\u00e1cek  . Although the virus was isolated from the blood of a patient in Georgia in 1964, the disease was not diagnosed (1). In 1996, CCHF occurred in a region of Africa where it had not been previously reported (Zakazaki virus), prompting researchers to suggest that the virus occurred in the region before the 1988 outbreak in the Southeast Asian countries and that the viral infection was undetected. The disease was associated with the consumption of uncooked organs of infected animals by tribesmen in the area. In 1999, the first cases were seen in Turkey, and the disease subsequently has appeared as endemic in Turkey and Iran   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus: genetic analysis and phylogenetic comparison of strains with..., Sevucu  . The virus also occurs in the Balkans, southern Europe, and Africa, as well as throughout Central Asia   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the New World, Wilson  .\nThe CCHF virus has 4 different molecular groups or genotypes, termed Balkan, West, East, and Central Africa. The disease has not been observed in North America or Australia. In southeast Asia, three different genomic subtypes are present, and each subtype consists of many different genotypes.\nThe disease shows no or only mild flulike symptoms in the beginning but usually develops as a lethal disease (case death rate, 30 to 50%) after a short febrile phase with sudden onset of capillary and petechial bleeding that increases mortality (case fatality rate, \u03fe50%). The incubation period can range from a few days to 2 weeks. The mortality rate in humans is higher for infections acquired by tick bites than for infections acquired by contact with animal blood. Splenomegaly is always present, and hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and neurologic symptoms occur as well   Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ergonul  .

Despite these advantages, the long-term presence of central venous catheters is associated with thrombotic and infectious risks , including catheter-related bacteremia, which can be complicated by septic thrombophlebitis and endocarditis that can lead to death.\nSeptic thrombophlebitis is a complication of venous catheter infections, which increases the morbidity. It is defined by the presence of a thrombosis in the vein where the venous catheter is located, associated with a bacteremia. A distinction is made between superficial and deep thrombophlebitis.\nThe frequency of septic thrombophlebitis of venous catheters is variable and poorly described in the literature.\nWhen the diagnosis of septic thrombophlebitis is made, it is recommended to extend the duration of antibiotic therapy, to remove the infected catheter and to prescribe anticoagulant treatment.

This requires the early administration of antibiotics. However, in the early days of the bacteremia process, there is no sign allowing to make the diagnosis. The only proof of the bacteremia is the culture obtained on the blood drawn for routine. To get early proof, the detection of a bacteria positive blood culture is required which can only be obtained to take a peripheral blood specimen. This can delay diagnosis and thus treatment. It is therefore necessary to be able to detect signs of bacteriological interest (sign of thrombophlebitis) earlier which will allow to administer antibiotics in time.

These BAIs were evaluated to verify their ability for attracting foraging Formosan termites, Coptotermes formosanus, using several traps. Two commercially available baits, i.e. BASF AdvanceTM and Advance 2.0, as positive controls, were used for comparison. In the laboratory, the BAI did not demonstrate a statistically superior ability to both of baits to attract Formosans. On the other hand, in the field tests, the BAI attracted more termites than the commercial baits in most of the traps placed randomly at the ground of outdoor areas. In addition, the termite captures increased in the BAI and the commercial baits from the second to the fourth trapping weeks. The aboveground portion of the BAI significantly enhanced the termite attraction of the commercial baits. Collectively, this new technology has great potential to be a replacement of the currently available and well-known bait against Coptotermes termites. <EOD> 2-Hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid as a versatile chiral auxiliary: use in synthesis and NMR studies of biologically active compounds.\n2-Hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid (4, 2-hydroxy-acetophenone, or salicylaldehyde) reacts with cyclic primary amines at ambient temperature to provide the aza-Michael adducts 4 in about 80% yield. The NMR spectra of 4 (or 11, 4-N,N-dimethylaminocyclohexylamine) prepared by this method show that the hydroxyl group of the 4 substituent is shielded by strong electron-withdrawing substituents on the cyclohexyl ring. An exception appears to be the NMR spectra of 4 prepared by reaction of 4 with amine NH2(4,4'-iminodipyridine) (8), which give a broad singlet signal (3H) centered at about 8.38 ppm, corresponding to one exchangeable hydrogen atom. The NMR spectra of the adduct 11 (or 44, piperidine) prepared from 4 and piperidine exhibit a singlet at 6.20 ppm corresponding to 2 exchangeable hydrogen atoms. A 2,2-dimethylamino substituent at the 3-position of 4 reduces the chemical shift of the hydroxyl proton to 8.45ppm. A 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidino substituent on the 4-position produces a singlet at 8.31 ppm. The formation of these adducts with aniline 16 and a substituted aniline 42 in 80 and 100% yield, respectively, has allowed their NMR spectra to be recorded and their structures confirmed by the X-ray analysis of 49 (or 100, 4-aminodiphenylacetic acid, 4-ADPAA) with the aniline substituent on C-4 position of the 3-phenylpropionic acid core. These results and a brief review of the early synthetic applications of phenylpropanoic acids (or simple acid chlorides derived from the 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehydes) are presented. The adduct 42 has been synthesized from the readily available D-tyrosine by the selective oxidation of the 3 hydroxyl group, the aldehyde cyclocondensation, and the dehydrogenation with sodium triacetoxyborohydride, conditions which were first developed for the aromatic hydroxylation of mono- and diamino amines. <EOD> Transurethral resection of the prostate in horseshoe kidney: A case report\n\nThe combination of bladder stone is always a potential risk factor of urethral cancer and recurrence stone.

        "summary": "Purpose: Pterygium is a common ocular surface disease defined by fibrovascular conjunctival growth extending onto the cornea. Its pathogenesis remains unclear. In severe cases, it may extend into the central cornea, inducing irregular corneal astigmatism and causing loss of vision. CD44( phagocytic glycoprotein-1 ) is involved in the organization of certain cellular processes, for instance, cell adhesion, division, and migration, by binding with its main ligand, hyaluronic acid. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a proliferation marker in the nucleus. E-cadherin is a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the protection of tissue integrity and cell-to-cell adhesion. This study aimed to determine the role of CD44, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and E-cadherin in pterygium formation and recurrence.",

This dose of serotonin precursor was found to abolish the increase of 5-HT content in the cortex, striatum and hypothalamus induced by apomorphine, morphine and amphetamine. This effect of 5-HTP was found to be antagonized by pretreatment of the animals with 5 mg/kg p-chlorophenylalanine. Behavioral response to the drug treatment in absence of 5-HTP was used as the control measurement. When p-chlorophenylalanine was administered in saline solution in a dose  as of 5-HTP, the increase of 5-HT content in the cortex of apomorphine and morphine pretreated animals were similar to those induced by the two drugs in 5-HTP untreated animals. On the other hand, the reduction of 5-HT content induced by amphetamine and its effect upon apomorphine-induced 5-HT response were not influenced by pretreatment of animals with p-CPA. <EOD> Synergism of the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin in human small cell lung carcinoma in a nude mouse model.\nGemcitabine (difluorodeoxycytidine, DFdC) is a new dideoxycytidine analogue with proven potency against a large variety of human solid tumors. Since gemcitabine can exert potent antitumor activity in a variety of tumors with DNA-damaging effects similar to those of alkylating agents, we investigated a potential chemotherapeutic synergy of gemcitabine and cisplatin (CDDP) in the nude mouse human small cell lung cancer model. We were able to demonstrate an additive effects of the combination of gemcitabine plus CDDP in comparison to a single-agent treatment with either drug. <EOD> The Clinical Value of Quantitative Dementia Assessment Using Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Critical Review and Meta-Analysis of the Literature\n\nBackground: The accuracy of clinical dementia assessment by cognitive screening and diagnostic criteria may be improved through integration of biomarker information.

The present study was performed to determine a simple clinicopathological index for distinguishing LGE, Crohn's disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) from other enteritis. Methods. Sixty-eight patients with enterocolonic diseases were divided into groups A (LGE), B (CD), and C (UC). Histopathological changes in the mucosa were examined and a histological score and villous atrophy of the enteritis were scored as 0-3. We analyzed the inflammatory cell types, eosinophils, and lymphocytes at the inflammatory site. We examined the ratios of inflammatory cells, immunoglobulin (Ig)-A-plasma cells, and Ig-G-and Ig-A-containing cells at the inflammatory site. Results.

Phospholipids Shape the Immune Microenvironment An emerging field of interest in immunology is the role of nutrients and their metabolites in affecting the T cell response. Many of the enzymes that drive metabolic pathways in T cells are also responsible for producing signals that influence antitumor immunity and tolerance. In this study, Shen and colleagues find that one of those enzymes, choline kinase alpha (ChoK\u03b1), increases choline metabolism and antitumor immune response. To better understand how choline metabolism shapes the immune response in a tumor microenvironment, they compared na\u00efve and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for alterations in choline metabolism, which had not been addressed in previous studies. This was done by metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of na\u00efve and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from mice with or without tumors. The authors found a high intracellular choline metabolic flux in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which was accompanied by an increased choline metabolic gene signature compared to na\u00efve lymphocytes. To understand the functional effect of choline metabolism altering T cell phenotype, they used an inhibitor of choline phospholipid metabolism, CK-699, which increased na\u00efve helper T lymphocytes that differentiated in vitro into regulatory T lymphocytes. They further showed that the addition of choline promoted a regulatory T cell response and antitumor immunity in syngeneic tumor models. The authors conclude that high choline phospholipid metabolism increases regulatory T cell populations and may be a therapeutic target in tumor immunotherapy. T cells play crucial roles in regulating the antitumor immune response, which has been well studied for its contribution to tumor evasion. In contrast, knowledge of the immune cell metabolic requirements required to sustain the antitumor response is less understood. Using mass spectrometry\u2013based metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis, we identified a high choline phospholipid metabolic flux in tumor-infiltrating T cells, as well as enhanced choline metabolism in na\u00efve T cells from tumor-bearing hosts. Pharmacological inhibition of choline metabolism with a CK-699, which interferes with phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, skewed peripheral na\u00efve helper T lymphocyte differentiation toward regulatory T lymphocytes, enhanced antitumor immunity, and decreased tumor growth in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. These results show that choline phospholipid metabolism shapes the T cell immune environment in cancer. Graphical Abstract <EOD> Correction: Evaluation of the effic",

The summary should capture the key aspects of the trial.\nThe output should only be the summarization of the given trial. Do not explain how you summarize it.\nInput Text: Breast cancer in patients with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative, or triple-negative disease is the most common malignancy arising in women. The standard treatment in this setting includes surgery and adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy, which is toxic. Endocrine agents, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators, may reduce ovarian function and thus worsen quality of life or decrease survival. Endocrine therapy can be used as an adjunct or alternative to cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy regimens have recently been extended to include the taxanes docetaxel or paclitaxel, which, like anthracyclines, appear to improve both progression-free survival and overall survival. Aromatase inhibitors, including exemestane, anastrozole, and letrozole, are now the standard adjuvant endocrine treatment after tamoxifen. In the pivotal NSABP-B-34 study, the 5-year survival rate with exemestane was 93%, and 7 years after the start of treatment, it was 83%. The 5-year rates of survival with tamoxifen were 89% and 69% at years 6 and 7. Patients who complete 5 years' adjuvant tamoxifen and have a recurrence have worse survival outcomes. Among them, exemestane improves overall survival and reduces mortality by 22%. In the NCIC CTG MA.17 trial, the rate of recurrence was lower in the group assigned to letrozole, without an apparent change in survival. In the IES study, letrozole significantly improved 3-year disease-free survival compared with placebo. In a randomized phase 3 study, the effect of anastrozole treatment in metastatic breast cancer on bone mineral density showed a significantly higher rate of bone mineral density loss in the anastrozole group. In the adjuvant setting, the effect of tamoxifen on ovarian function has been recognized to be dose dependent, and it is generally accepted not to exceed 20 mg/d to reduce the onset of menopausal symptoms. In the EBCTCG meta-analysis of randomized adjuvant endocrine trials done in patients receiving 20 mg/d or more, the duration of tamoxifen treatment was not significantly linked to the risk of death, but was related to adverse events. Among endocrine adjuvants, the risk of adverse events appears to be greatest with exemestane, aromatase inhibitors, and fulvestrant. One meta-analysis found a trend towards improved outcome for 8 to 18 months of letrozole, but not for 18 to 30 months duration. In clinical trials comparing different aromatase inhibitors, endocrine treatment and letrozole are similar. Endocrine therapy or chemotherapy is administered for 3 years, after which it is discontinued in patients with a high rate of disease-free survival at 2 years of treatment. Patients experiencing recurrence can receive new-generation endocrine therapy, second-line chemotherapy, or treatment combinations with cytotoxic and endocrine components. Patients should be advised to continue exercise and to eat a healthy diet. If the patient is overweight, weight reduction is recommended. Women on tamoxifen therapy should undergo bone density screening and bisphosphonate therapy if recommended.

The 5 year survival rate is 11%.1 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer, is usually an aggressive disease with poor overall survival. 2,3 Advanced pancreatic cancer does not respond to conventional chemotherapy for most patients. In a significant minority of patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) is often given post-operatively.4 There are two FDA approved drug regimens for neoadjuvant therapy: FOLFIRINOX (a combination of irinotecan, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxalipatin) and nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine. 1\n\n| REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE & SIGNIFICANCE |\n| --- |\n| Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody specific for the IL-1\u03b2\ncytokine. In an interim analysis of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/Alliance trial C9681, among patients with non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, significant improvement in PFS was observed with chemotherapy and anti-IL-1\u03b2 versus chemotherapy alone (7.0 vs. 5.5 months). IL-1\u03b2 blockade was associated with a 38% decrease in risk of progression, with a similar decrease in risk of death, but these results were not significant.5\n\n| Study rationale/intervention description |\n| --- |\n| This is a phase IB, single armed, single center study using Canakinumab and Nab-Paclitaxel with Gemcitabine in patients with a resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.

Recent research has shown Egypt to be the third-largest country globally, with an estimated 52% cesarean sections (3). However, the cesarean section has many serious complications, including the primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (4). During labor, the average blood loss is about 300 to 400 ml. Bleeding postpartum is known as losing over five hundred milliliter of blood following a vaginal birth and losing over one thousand milliliter after the cesarean section (5). The prime cause of maternal death rate is postpartum bleeding, predominately in poor countries, and the estimated mortality number due to postpartum bleeding is one hundred thousand per year (6). Therefore, it is essential to reduce bleeding during and after CS to diminish maternal mortality and morbidity (7). The most successful technique for decreasing PPH is the active third stage labor management, requiring prophylactic uterotonic drugs like oxytocin, ergometrine malate, prostaglandins (E1, E2, and F2\u03b1), and combinations of them, or hemostatic agent as tranexamic acid (Kapron) and Etamsylate (Dicynon) (8, 9).",

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment. Thus, the role of pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for five days in volunteers undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (BVR) will be investigated in order to verify the vascular expression of SPhk1, transcriptome and vascular proteome remodeling, as well as S1P content in HDL.",

The objective of this study was to describe epidemiology of preeclampsia among African and Caribbean pregnant women living in metropolitan France. It aimed to characterize associated maternal risk factors and perinatal outcomes. We conducted a retrospective multi-center study from January 2010 to December 2013. Women with preeclampsia from the two largest university maternity centers in Paris (France) were included. Women of African ethnicity were compared to Caribbean women. Risk factors were compared using univariate analysis with \u03a7 2 test, and adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression. A total of 609 cases of preeclampsia were identified, including 366 in Caribbean and 243 in African women. Hypertension before pregnancy was the strongest risk factor for preeclampsia (OR = 2.9, 95% [2.1;4.0]). Caribbean women had a two times higher risk for preeclampsia than African women (OR = 2.3, 95% [1.8;2.8]). Both Caribbean and African women had higher birthweight (C-BW +426g; A-BW +394g) and lower preterm deliveries (C-12.1%; A-16.6%) among babies of preeclamptic women than babies of healthy women (C+269 g; A+ 280 g) p < 0.01. Lower BW and higher preterm deliveries were associated with severe form of preeclampsia, whereas lower preterm deliveries were associated with non-severe preeclampsia.

Patient position error is one of the most common errors reported in panoramic radiography. Various patient positional errors include the lack of head extension, the lack of tongue positioning against the palate, and the failure to use a celluloid matrix tape. Various studies reported that the average positional errors of the tongue were 77.5 percent for the mixed dentition period and 9.5 percent for the permanent dentition period. Failure to hold the tongue against the hard palate, using the palm of the hand for positioning the patient, failure to give an explanation of the tongue position before and during imaging, or not requiring the patient to do so have been shown as the main causes of failure to keep the tongue in an adequate position.The main cause of PGA error in panoramic imaging is not correctly holding the soft palate and tongue with the hard palate, causing the space between the soft palate and tongue with the hard palate to be visible in the image. This error is seen in approximately 10% of panoramic radiographs.This error occurs due to an incomplete and non-coordinated closure of the mouth on the hard palate during imaging, in other words due to uncoordinated closure of the lips and hard palate on the tongue. In these cases, the tongue is usually not tightly attached to the hard palate. The use of rubber bands or chewing gums could be helpful in this case. Other reasons for error in this issue include uncoordinated contraction of the lips, the tongue and the cheek, the lack of cooperation of the patient or the operator, swallowing during imaging (which may be prevented by asking the patient not to swallow), gagging, and not following the instructions. Thus, failure to hold the tongue adequately against the hard palate is considered one of the most common errors in panoramic radiography. Failure to use celluloid matrix tape is another frequent and preventable error in panoramic radiographs.In this error, the patient or the person conducting the imaging may unknowingly forget to use the tape while performing imaging. Also, in cases where the patient is not fully cooperative, use of a more reliable tape instead of a piece of cotton thread is recommended. Using a 6 mm \u00d7 20 mm celluloid matrix tape for oral and maxillofacial radiography, in cases where the patient or the person responsible for radiography are required to perform the imaging without the tape, can prevent this error.Food and chewing tubes can be considered in patients who unintentionally did not use the tape or in cases where the tape cannot be used. According to the literature, using strips of food or chewing tubes can successfully control the tongue position (more than that of the celluloid matrix tape). Using some strips in combination with chewing tubes also reduces the risk of error. Using a chewing rod during imaging reduces tongue tension to a certain degree; using food strips is more effective in this regard; using these two tools simultaneously can effectively reduce tongue tension in this error. Thus, it can prevent this error in panoramic radiographs in various cases.Based on the above facts, it can be inferred that using a wide variety of strips during the panoramic imaging technique of patients can reduce the error rate of panoramic imaging. Therefore, using different strips during imaging will prevent the error of panoramic imaging. Thus, the tongue and soft tissue can be adequately attached to the hard palate. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the use of strips effectively reduces the error related to palate imaging. This article examines the effect of using different strips on the effect of radiograph positioning to the error of tongue.\n\nThe effect of errors. This",

The risk of prostate cancer diagnosis at high SES or AJTC-TNM low-risk group was 0.627 times lower (95% confidence intervals : 0.566-0.697, p <0.001) and 0.560 times lower (95% CI: 0.503-0.626, p <0.001) than that at low SES or AJTC-TNM high-risk group in the Cox proportional multivariate hazard regression. The proportion of patients with low SES in the high-risk group was higher than that in the high-risk group.

This study investigated the effects of the pandemic on diet and lifestyle to identify problems and develop measures for college students and to assess how the pandemic affected their feelings and life satisfaction.Materials and Methods: A total of 723 students from a college in Japan completed an online survey. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted to assess the diet and lifestyle habits of students during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, as well as their feelings, depression and anxiety levels, family cohesion, and life satisfaction. The Student Satisfaction and Health (SSH) score was used to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students.Results: About 25% of students did not follow the same diet or ate less food during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, and 35% had low daily physical activity and sleep habits (< 6 h). The SSH score of all 723 students was 3.79 \u00b1 0.84 (range 2 to 4 points), with about 20% having high or low scores. Multiple regression analysis showed that the following affected the impact of COVID-19 on life satisfaction: (1) decrease in physical activities (\u03b2 = \u22120.116; P < .05), (2) lack of sleep or increase in sleep time (\u03b2 = \u22120.097; P < .05), (3) feeling \"I want to stay at home,\" (\u03b2 = \u22120.082; P < .05), and (4) negative feeling about the future (\u03b2 = \u22120.128; P < .05",

        "summary": "Epidemiological studies have shown that OSA is closely related to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases, especially hypertension. At present, there are 66 million patients with moderate to severe OSA in China, and the current diagnosis and treatment of OSA is mainly completed in the sleep center of the hospital, which is time-consuming and laborious, resulting in the delayed diagnosis and treatment of a large number of patients, making about 80% of potential OSA patients have not been diagnosed and treated in time. With the development of the Internet technologies, telemedicine has been increasingly applied to the diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic diseases with its advantages of convenience, interactivity, efficiency, sharing, coherence and breaking through the limitations of time and space. Our center has initially built a remote diagnosis and treatment management model for OSA. Compared with the traditional medical model, the medical and health economic analysis shows that the OSA diagnosis and treatment model based on telemedicine is more cost-effective, but its clinical efficacy needs to be further verified. Hypertension is a common complication in OSA patients, and continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) has a significant hypertensive effect in the treatment of OSA. However, whether clinical management based on remote diagnosis and treatment mode can achieve the same therapeutic effect as traditional face-to-face diagnosis and treatment mode in improving ambulate blood pressure in OSA patients needs to be further clarified. This study will compare the improvement of ambulatory blood pressure management in patients with hypertension under the new telemedicine mode and the traditional medical mode through a single-center randomized controlled trial, so as to optimize the diagnosis and treatment process of OSA patients with hypertension, establish a more convenient and efficient remote diagnosis and treatment mode with reliable clinical outcome, and provide a theoretical basis for subsequent multi-center research and promotion",

The patients were divided into 5 groups in the following order: healthy donors of blood (control) who had never suffered from COVID-19; previously infected patients (recovery group); patients with moderate course of COVID-19, with the first time infection for less than 2 weeks; patients with moderate COVID-19, more than 2 weeks from the time of the infection; patients with severe form of COVID-19, less than 2 weeks since infection; patients with severe form of COVID-19, more than 2 weeks from infection.\n\n\nRESULTS\nit was found that in the red blood cells of patients with severe and moderate forms of COVID-19, which caused the accumulation of lipid deposits, a significant increase in the activity of the succinate oxidase system, which reflects the state of cellular mitochondrial metabolism, was observed. In the red blood cells of patients with a moderate form of COVID-19, the activity of the hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase systems decreased, which indicates the weakening of glycolysis, the accumulation of intermediates in the cycle. It was revealed that in patients with various variants of COVID-19, including severe forms against the background of significant anemia, the intensity of phosphorylation of erythrocyte metabolism increased and the intensity of phosphorylation of intermediates of glycolysis and pentose pathway decreased. A significant relationship was revealed between the level of severity of clinical course and the decrease in hexokinase activity. Phosphofructokinase activity was more than two times higher than the average level of activity compared with the control sample. Also, there was a significant positive correlation between the intensity of the accumulation of lipids in the red blood cells of patients with severe and moderate forms of COVID-19 and the activity of the ATP-dependent systems of erythrocytes in the direction of the accumulation of lipids and oxygen consumption.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nwe revealed the differences in the metabolic processes in the red blood cells of patients with COVID-19 in different variants of the disease at all stages of the development of infection. We observed the relationship between the intensity of changes in metabolism and oxidative stress in COVID-19. <EOD> Exact solution for the nonequilibrium free-energy gap of the one-dimensional Bose gas near the critical point.\nA simple model for free expansion is used to study the nonequilibrium free energy for the Bose gas as a function of time in a one-dimensional harmonic trap for large values of the dimensionless temperature. In this model the system is represented by a stochastic process with Langevin dynamics. A stationary distribution may be obtained. Results for the free-energy gap are compared with exact analytic results, numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, and Langevin simulation with a large number of particles. <EOD> Diagnostic methods for bone tumours and tumour-like lesions.\nTo diagnose bone tumours and tumour-like lesions, imaging investigations have a decisive role. The application of imaging techniques allows for the recognition of pathological processes, their type and size, as well as for making a prognosis and planning further treatment. Modern imaging techniques based on ionizing radiation, in comparison with traditional methods, are characterized by higher accuracy and minimal invasiveness, which allows for the reduction of additional radiation dose for patients, thus excluding its negative effects. The article reviews the possibilities of applying computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound in the diagnostics of bone tumours and tumour-like lesions. The advantages and disadvantages of mentioned techniques are presented.

Despite availability of modern analgesics, postoperative pain management remains a challenge.\nOne opportunity to enhance the analgesic effect of the pharmacological treatments given to people suffering from pain (and not just pain) is through increasing the expectations for pain relief following treatment. Although much knowledge has been accumulated about the significant effect of expectations on pain, virtually all evidence are based on experimental studies carried out in laboratory settings, and there is a need to investigate how this knowledge could translated into improved clinical care.\nThe aim of the current study is to examine whether the communication style between the nursing staff and the patient during analgesic administration will affect the results of pain relief treatment in the mother-newborn ward after cesarean section. As another goal, the study will examine whether relevant patient's characteristics will predict the effectiveness of the treatment.",

Serotonin was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The binding affinities of 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonists were determined by radioligand competitive binding assay. The effects of 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonists on glucose metabolism in HepG2 cells were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. The cell viabilities of serotonin-stimulated HepG2 cells were measured by MTT (3--2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method or lactate dehydrogenase assay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe two subtypes of serotonin receptors showed similar dialytic rates on administration of serotonin. Binding studies indicated that 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonists could bind to the target rapidly and that they were good drug candidates. A cell-based assay revealed that 5-HT2A antagonists had an inhibitory effect on the progression of diabetes by lowering serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and preventing the degradation of the IRS-1 protein in HepG2 cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonist could be a novel orally active diabetic retinopathy drug. <EOD> High-resolution mass spectrometry and metabolomics analysis of the genus Miconia species (Melastomataceae).\nINTRODUCTION\nAnalyses of the chemotaxonomic and geographical signatures of Miconia and its subgenera (Tetramicra, Miconia, Miconella, and Acrocele) are crucial for further plant bioprospecting. We combined metabolomics methodology (HRMS, multivariate analyses, and chemometric models) with a chemotaxonomic approach based on the profiling of diterpenoids and simple phenolic derivatives from M. albicans, M. caesifolia, and M. crinifolia.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to understand which taxonomic markers can be used in identification and bioprospecting of drugs from this genus.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\nIn vitro culture of M. albicans, M. caesifolia, and M. crinifolia was evaluated to produce and accumulate biomass and metabolites, and also the quality and authenticity of the natural drug were analyzed. The chemical analysis of 50 diterpenoids and phenols was obtained by HRMS and NMR analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe metabolomics models were developed by multivariate methodology (partial least squares), followed by chemometric tools for the identification of molecules. The model had a satisfactory separation between the species, particularly the first three components explain approximately 59.7% of the total data variance. In conclusion, this study revealed 10 metabolic markers, which differentiate the three species, including 8 terpenoids and 2 phenolic compounds.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe metabolomics methodology proved to be a new tool for the phytochemical classification of M. albicans, M. caesifolia, and M. crinifolia subgenera,",

        "summary": "Low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer (LCS) has been shown to reduce lung cancer specific mortality in multiple randomised controlled trials. However, although LDCT screening has been demonstrated to reduce cancer- specific mortality, there remain outstanding questions regarding how screening can be implemented. In particular, indeterminate nodules are common, and can be challenging to distinguish from benign nodules on CT appearances alone. Furthermore, distinguishing cancers which are likely to become clinically significant from those that will remain indolent is challenging, but essential to prevent over-treatment and overdiagnosis. There is significant interest in using a multi-modal approach to LCS, incorporating biomarkers obtained from minimally-invasive samples alongside LDCT to improve ability to recognise clinically-significant lung cancers at an early stage.\nThe Targeted Lung Health Check (TLHC) programme is an NHS programme with the aim of using LDCT screening in appropriately high-risk individuals to improve early diagnosis and survival in lung cancer. The North Central London TLHC programme started in December 2022.\nThe purpose of the ALPINE study is to develop a platform to allow collection of minimally-invasive samples from participants undergoing screening within the North Central London TLHC programme. The use of such biomarkers in the diagnosis of lung cancer is a rapidly developing field and novel techniques and technologies are continuously under development. The ALPINE study will generate a cohort with matched biosamples, CT scans and clinical data which will be uniquely well placed to serve to develop or validate biomarkers in lung cancer screening and risk prediction.",

The genes contained several nucleic acid sequences with poly A signals on their 3\u2032 ends. These recombinant genes were synthesized in vitro as double-stranded DNA by PCR method with pUC18 plasmid as template and ligated to plasmids which were circularized by circular reaction. In the final stage of reaction, the circular plastic DNA was incorporated into liposomes made of lipids derived from Sendai virus by reverse genetic approach. This viral DNA was then transfected into human embryo kidney cells (HEK293) and HepG2 cells by addition of HVJ-liposomes. Expression of the genes and activity of rHuTNF-\u03b1 protein were detected by immunocytochemical and biological methods. <EOD> The Rising Prevalence of Pediatric Extra-intestinal Abscess in Australia\nObjectives Pediatric extra-intestinal abscesses (EIAs) are a serious manifestation of invasive bacterial infection. The rise and fall of EIA rates with antibiotic prophylaxis has not been well defined. Methods This was a population-based cohort study using administrative data from Australia\u2019s largest health service, NSW Health, for all children and adolescents (0\u201314 years) diagnosed as having an intra-abdominal abscess from January 2010 to December 2017. We calculated EIA rates as ratios of number of patients diagnosed as having any type of EIA during the study period, compared to numbers predicted by the Poisson regression analysis using an autoregressive error structure. Results A total of 10 747 children were diagnosed as having a intra-abdominal abscess (IA) of whom 64.4% (n=6883) had EIA. There was an increase of EIAs among children over the study period, with a doubling of the EIA numbers across the data for the years 2011 to 2017 (mean IA 1401; mean EIA 701). Over this period the ratio of EIA to total IA (including EIA) rates increased by 50%/year (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1\u20135.0). Over the study period, EIA rates increased for all age groups (p trend <0.05), including infants aged <1 year, with EIA rates/1000 person-years increased by 16.9% with an annual increase of 5%. Conclusions The prevalence of EIA as a proportion of total IA in children has continued to increase over the study period, with all age groups over 1 year having significantly increased EIA rates. This increasing burden of EIA is likely multifactorial including increasing prevalence of risk factors (eg, prematurity and obesity) and increased access to subspecialist care. <EOD> .\nAIM\nThe main challenge in surgical treatment of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is the achievement of long-term remission of symptoms.

        "summary": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition associated with hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic causes and results in high mortality. However, the epidemiology and treatment strategy for ARDS may have changed significantly due to the accumulation of a large body of knowledge, following the two-year pandemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) of which the primary manifestation is ARDS. To improve the quality of ICU care that patients receive after admission to the ICU, a variety of academic societies, including the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, are currently developing evidence-based guidelines and consensus guidelines and statements regarding ABCDEF bundles, nutritional therapy, ICU diary. The ABCDEF bundle, nutritional therapy, and ICU diary have been developed and are being promoted for implementation in hospitals around the world. The implementation of evidence-based ICU care is strongly recommended, especially for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who frequently require ventilators to maintain their lives, because their patient outcomes are worse than those who were admitted to ICU with other causes.\nHowever, there is still little evidence on how the quality of ICU care (compliance rate) correlates with patient prognosis and outcomes, and there are currently no clear goals or indicators for the ICU care we should develop.\nThis study aims to investigate the epidemiology and treatments given to the patients and evaluate the implementation of evidence-based ICU care and its association with the outcomes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to the ICU. The contents of mechanical ventilation settings, respiratory conditions, and the evidence-based ICU care, such as analgesia, sedation, rehabilitation, and nutrition, given to the patients will be collected in a daily basis.\nAim 1: Epidemiology Aim 2: Treatments Aim 3: Evidence-based ICU care Aim 4: ARDS related Post Intensive Care Syndrome",

The summary should capture the key aspects of the trial.\n\nThe output should only be the summarization of the given trial. Do not explain how you summarize it.\n <EOD> A new role for the S-antigen: as a receptor for the protein adduct of the glutathione adduct of 4-hydroxynonenal.\nIn the human eye lens, the reactive aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) reacts with glutathione to form a reactive protein adduct (Gly-Cys-S-HNE). By using solid-phase competition assays, we have found that the 32-kDa S-protein, formerly referred to as beta b1-crystallin, possesses a binding site(s) for Gly-Cys-S-HNE. No other crystallin possesses such a binding pocket. Thus, although the S-protein is classified as alpha-crystallin because it has two alpha-crystallin domains, one at the amino-terminal region and the other at the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule, it appears to have other, as yet undefined, functions. Immunoblot analyses have shown that only the S-protein is present in the supernatant of lens extracts, and not other crystallins, at 1-5 M NaCl. This suggests another function for the S-protein in lens physiology. <EOD> The effects of oral administration of hydrogen sulfide in cyclophosphamide-induced testicular damage in rats.\nAIM\nWe aimed to investigate the effect of oral hydrogen sulfide (H2S) administration on oxidant and antioxidant parameters and histopathological changes in cyclophosphamide-induced testicular damage in rats.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study used 36 male Spraque-Decker, Albino rats aged 12 weeks, randomized into six groups: control group, single-dose control group, cyclophosphamide group, cyclophosphamide group with 6 days of H2S treatment after cyclophosphamide administration, 30 doses of H2S group, and 60 doses of H2S group. Testicular damage was created by a single intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide injection at 300 mg/kg. The control group was given tap water by mouth. The H2S treatments were applied by placing a single H2S capsule in the mouth. Serum, testis, and epididymis tissues were taken. Testosterone, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde parameters were studied in serum. Histopathological evaluations of the testis and epididymis were performed under a light microscope.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDose number and duration increased in the 30 and 60 H2S doses compared to the control and single-dose groups (p<0.05). Serum malondialdehyde levels were reduced significantly, and testosterone levels were increased in the H2S treatments compared to the cyclophosphamide group (p<0.05). The histopathological findings showed that testicular damage in the H2S group decreased compared to the cyclophosphamide group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, these findings revealed the beneficial effects of H2S treatment on oxidation and antioxidation parameters and testicular damage in experimental cyclophosphamide-induced testicular damage. Therefore, these results suggest that H2S is likely be an excellent candidate for the management and prevention of testicular damage. <EOD> Antagonism of morphine-induced hyperactivity and antinociception by a \u03bc1 opioid antagonist in rats.\nMicroinjection of a selective \u03bc1 opioid agonist, (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly-ol)-enkephalin (DAMGO), into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) but not the caudate putamen (CPu), blocks morphine-induced hyperactivity in morphine-dependent rats.

        "summary": "In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",

The study population consisted of 684 persons aged 66 years and over who reported the main problems concerning their housing to be related to the availability of water and electricity. One of the main problems concerned the availability of electricity: 8% of the elderly considered being without electricity a health hazard. The average household contained 1.4 members. More than 33% of the respondents stated to be living comfortably in their current living arrangement. The majority (53%) found it necessary to ask help from family or acquaintances, but only one out of five elderly persons needed financial support. A significantly higher percentage of older persons in poor housing was found to suffer from chronic and/or psychological disorders. The study suggests that the housing condition of elderly persons may influence their well-being. Improvements in dwellings should follow a policy of integrating housing and other services, including medical and social services, to contribute positively to the quality of life of elderly persons. <EOD> A Covalent Organic Framework\u2013Based Imaging Agent with Aggregation\u2010Induced Emission for Breast Cancer Inhibition via Targeting P\u2010Glycoprotein\nA tumor multidrug\u2010resistance (MDR) overexpressed membrane protein, P\u2010glycoprotein (P\u2010gp), is responsible for drug efflux leading to chemotherapy resistance and has become a therapeutic target for eliminating cancer chemoresistance.

In order to do this, the investigators intend to run a series of questionnaires with primary care services, vascular science services, and perform some cost effectiveness modelling on running diagnostic services in primary care and in secondary care settings. A one off questionnaire, designed in Qualtrics, will be sent out to primary care practitioners via social media and email contacts. This will be aimed at establishing their current role and any guidelines they follow with regards to the diagnosis and management of venous leg ulcers in primary care, and to determine their opinion of what this patient pathway should involve. A Delphi consensus will be carried out amongst vascular scientists across the UK to determine current and streamline future practice in diagnostics for patients with venous leg ulcers. The consensus will be achieved when there is \u2265 70% agreement.

The patients were divided into two study groups. Cyclosporin A (5mg/kg/day) was administered from day 0 and tacrolimus (TAC, 0.1mg/kg/day) from day 21 until day 100 in the 1st group and from day 11 until day 60 in the 2nd group (9 patients), while CsA (5mg/kg/day) was administered from day 0 and CsA (10 mg/kg/day) from day 21 until day 50 in the 3rd group (9 patients). One patient of the 2nd group and one of the 3rd group lost the follow-up, while all patients of the 1st group were followed up until day 100. For the assessment of the acute graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD), the clinical and biological criteria and for chronic aGVHD, the organ manifestation and the skin involvement.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe incidence of severe aGVHD was 42% in the CsA (5mg/kg/day) group but there was no patient with > grade II aGVHD in the TAC group, while there was no severe aGVHD in TAC group who had CsA (10 mg/kg/day) for the prophylaxis of aGVHD. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 52% in CsA (5mg/kg/day) group, 44.4% in CsA (10mg/kg/day) group and 0% in TAC group. The patients were followed up for 26.8 months (range; 6-44 months) in the CsA (5mg/kg/day) group, 24.1 months (range: 3-17 months) in the CsA (10mg/kg/day) group and 32.5-months (range: 6-52 months) in the TAC group (p>0.05).

The accuracy of this method using the Biotyper system for the identification of bacteria isolated from blood culture (BC) was investigated. Among the 402 microorganisms tested, 368 isolates (91.61%) could be identified at the level of genus. Among the isolates, Bacillus (36.07%) was the most frequently isolated, followed by Escherichia (13.96%). Among the Gram-positive isolates tested, 206 isolates (69.01%) could be identified at the species level, while among the Gram-negative isolates only 139 isolates (72.65%) could be identified at the species level. The most frequently detected species were Bacillus subtilis (22.05%) and Klebsiella pneumonia (18.31%). We found 30 unique bacterial spectra which could not be identified by our in-house MALDI-TOF MS database. However, identification results could be obtained in the database after using the MALDI Biotyper web query service. After our database was updated, the overall identification rate increased to 95.42%.

METHODS We assessed 704 consecutive subjects with suspected SS recruited in 20 centers in 7 countries for an SS trial (EC-SS; NCT00647127). All subjects underwent an assessment of criteria fulfillment, clinical and serologic evaluations, and oral and ocular dryness evaluations, and data were compared with those of 100 subjects with SS and 300 matched controls. RESULTS The sensitivity of the criteria was 65.7% and specificity 88.7%; 24.6% of the subjects not diagnosed with SS who met the criteria required a biopsy to diagnose definite SS. Among the subjects studied, 26.6% met only the minor criteria, 20.7% scored 4, 13.4% 5, and 2.4% 6. Increased scores were observed with older age and male sex. CONCLUSIONS This validation study using clinical data from a large prospective patient cohort with established diagnosis and extensive characterization validated the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for primary SS, including the presence of dry eyes (ocular staining) and a positive unstimulated salivary flow test.

        "summary": "Implants in the maxillary posterior region are associated with compromised bone in both quantity - notably in vertical dimension- and quality. Along with the fact that the posterior teeth are subjected to higher occlusal forces than the anterior teeth (Marianne Morand & Tassos Irinakis, 2007). In order to overcome these shortcomings, various procedures have been advocated including open and closed sinus lift (Nkenke E & Stelzle F, 2009; Schropp et al, 2003). The use of short implants is a valid alternative for these procedures (Wallace SS & Froum SJ, 2003) sparing the need of applying augmentation techniques with the associated increased time, morbidity and complexity of such procedures.",
        "model_output": "[/INST]\n\n# Additional details\n[/INST]\nThe aim of this study was to measure the stability of short implants versus standard length implants (6 mm Straumann\nBLX), placed with internal sinus floor elevation in posterior maxillae. The primary outcome measured was the\ncrestal bone level. A total of 160 edentulous patients that needed a posterior maxillary implant, were randomized to\neither of the two treatment arms: short implant or a standard length 10 mm Straumann implant, placed with internal sinus\nfloor elevation. A single straight implant was placed in all the patients, irrespective of the group to which they had been\nrandomized. The periapical radiographs were taken immediately after surgery and at six-months, one\nyear, and three years after implant restoration. Crestal bone level (CBL) was measured intraorally by a trained examiner and\nintraoral X-radiographs (paralleling technique) with a long-cone paralleling technique were taken. The radiographs were\nanalyzed by a blinded evaluator using the computer densitometry technique. CBL measurements were made at the baseline.\n\nTreatment outcomes of this randomized clinical trial revealed that three-year survival rates of the short and the conventional\nimplants were comparable (86.7% vs. 87.5%), demonstrating good stability. In case of conventional implants, a\nsuperior stability (higher success rate) was shown, although the difference was not statistically significant at\n95% Confidence Interval. The overall bone loss of less than 2 mm after three years was comparable in both of the two\ngroups. The results of this comparative investigation confirm the usefulness of short implants in the posterior maxillae.\n\nA clinical trial was conducted as a proof of concept study, in order to compare the outcome of short vs. standard length\nimplants. The results of this study showed the same outcome for short and standard length implants.\n\n# Summary of study results\nThe null hypothesis was rejected since the difference between the two groups was significant. The mean crestal bone level\nwas higher in Control group. The conclusion drawn was that the short implants showed the same success rate as the control group,\nalthough not statistically significant. Moreover, no significant difference with respect to the marginal bone level\nwas recorded between the study and the control groups. Thus, within the limits of the present study, it could be suggested\nthat the use of short implants is a suitable alternative to full-length implants in posterior maxillae.\n\n# Limitations\n- One limitation was the radiological assessment, since it could be influenced by several factors that were outside of the\ncontrol of the researchers. These disadvantages could potentially compromise the quality of the radiographic technique\nin spite of the efforts of the researchers to standardize the procedure.\n- In addition, the clinical crown reconstruction was not identical in each group. This was because the standardization of the\nclinical crown, with prosthetic crowns being 3 mm apical and 2 mm coronal to the alveolar crest, was not considered appropriate\nto avoid damage to the bone.\n- It is likely that two implants per patient would be more advantageous in the long-term survival of the implants and the bone\ndichalcea. Implant treatment in patients with narrow bone dimensions may be considered a challenge. However, short\nimplants, with sufficient primary stability and bone apposition after placement, can restore function and aesthetics.\n\n# Statistical Methods\nStatistical comparisons were performed by the Chi-squared test. To perform univariate analysis, the survival tables were\nconstructed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe and analyze survival rates. The statistical evaluation was\nbased on a 5% level of significance.\n\nTreatment outcomes of this randomized clinical trial revealed that three-year survival rates of the short and the control implants were comparable (78, 27, 86, 27%). In the short implants group, there were three failures during the healing period, one of them requiring implant removal secondary to infection, two were due to fracture of the bone supporting the implant. The failures of implant in the control group occurred in 4 patients during the healing and rehabilitation periods. One of these four failures was due to the fracture of the implant (se",

        "summary": "Despite progress in chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still the only curative procedure for some hematological malignancies. The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old. The co-transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) at the time of transplantation has previously shown a double interest in GvHD immunomodulation and hematopoiesis support. Pre-clinical studies (in mice) have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from Wharton's Jelly reduce the incidence of GvHD when the infusions are weekly repeated.

Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) allows a more robust engraftment  , with lower relapse rate, and higher overall survival (OS). However, it leads to substantial morbidity and mortality. In order to increase the number of patients who can benefit from HSCT, reduced intensity conditionings (RIC) were introduced. With RIC transplantation, acute GVHD and graft vs host disease (GVHD) incidence is lower, but the rate of graft failure and relapse is increased. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) are the major complications after HLA matched as well as mismatched unrelated HSCT. The incidence of aGVHD after MAC ranges from 30% to 80 %  ; with a higher risk of grade II to IV in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as compared with patients with chronic GVHD (36%vs 13.2%)  . However, cGvHD remains the most important cause of late mortality  . \n\nCyclophosphamide (CY) added to traditional myeloablative conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI) may promote long-term engraftment and GVHD prophylaxis  . However, it leads to delayed engraftment and a higher rate of severe regimen-related toxicity(RRT)  .\nImmunologically, TBI induces a cytokine storm, increasing the risk of post-transplant complications \n\nAllogeneic disease progression can also be an issue in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning (MAC). A higher degree of myeloid malignancy has been associated with a reduced engraftment rate, and increased relapse and transplant-related mortality (TRM) post HSCT . However, an extensive review of the literature did not show a significant difference of OS when transplanted with or without MAC (HR for OS=1.31  versus 1.09  respectively) . There is no clear consensus on whether the HSCT should be postponed or not in MDS patients with progression.\n\nHuman Wharton's Jelly Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (WJ-MSC) are promising stem cell therapies \n\nCellular therapies may induce long-term remission in steroidresistant acute GVHD  and might decrease the toxicity linked by to the use of immunosuppressive agents. In particular, WJ-MSC infusion appears safe and effective in both adults and children . The toxicity associated with their infusion has not been reported, due to their low mutational load and the low immunogenicity of WJ-MSC. WJ-MSC have anti-inflammatory properties, and have been used to prevent and treat steroidresistant aGVHD and cGVHD . The mechanism of action is not yet fully understood \n\nHowever, the dose of WJ-MSC infused is probably a key factor. In fact, the first study in adults with aGVHD showed a good effect on skin aGVHD  with a low dose (5x106 cells/kg/d",

There are no comparator sites in phase 1. The intervention hospitals have implemented a real-time machine learning program within their EHR (Healthfusion), which includes real-time alerting and decision support. Clinical deterioration is operationalized as the algorithm identifying the clinical trajectory of a hospitalized patient leading to severe illness and requiring escalation in care. The algorithm identifies two patient characteristics that inform clinical deterioration risk, and its alerts are presented in the patient record where the nurse can use it to guide decision-making. The patients and sites are expected to remain in the study for 12 months. Following onsite training and consultation, an interdisciplinary team will implement and evaluate the program's function within their facility. A pilot quality improvement program has already implemented and is showing potential in terms of impact.

In addition, AA women have poor healthcare utilization and compliance with psychiatric treatment compared to Caucasian women. An intervention is required to supplement and support the clinical objectives of the mother's depression care without requiring the mother's direct involvement. Fathers are an underutilized resource to reduce the mother's environmental stress and encourage healthy maternal behaviors. The African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment- Partners alleviating Perinatal Depression (ASSET-PPD) protocol will target the fathers' support of the mothers' mental health treatment and their active engagement in the family to reduce maternal stress. The ASSET-PPD intervention will be designed to have 4 active modules that address key factors to reduce maternal stress during the prenatal period and 2 postpartum review sessions. The modules will be individual sessions constructed to provide training, information, and behavioral assignments to increase fathers': 1) prenatal and postpartum family involvement; 2) mental health psychoeducation; 3) interparental communication and relationship skills; and 4) balanced division of family tasks. ASSET-PPD will be evaluated in a pilot RCT with 50 cohabitating or non-cohabitating fathers and AA mothers who will be randomized into the ASSET-PPD intervention or the comparator group. Fathers only will participate in the intervention, and mothers and fathers will complete measures of mental health and parental experiences. Maternal depressive symptoms will be assessed as a primary outcome, and breastfeeding and parent-infant interactions will be assessed as secondary outcomes.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nAfrican-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment-Partners alleviating Perinatal Depression\n\nConditions\n=================\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\nHow is the study designed?\n---------------\nDesign Details\n\nPrimary Purpose: Supportive Care\n\nAllocation: Randomized\n\nIntervention Model: Parallel Assignment\n\nInterventional Model Description: We plan to enroll 50 parent dyads (100 individuals total, 25 romantic or non-romantic partners per arm).

In this article, we describe four perspectives on what can be measured to capture the long-lasting impact of head and neck cancer (HNC) on quality of life (QoL). These perspectives include the clinical point-of-view, the viewpoint of health-related QoL (HRQoL) measures, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and patient experience. Each perspective provides important insights in the measurement of HRQoL in HNCC care. The clinical perspective informs how the clinician can identify patients that need attention in HRC healthcare delivery, and the viewpoint of HRQoL measures provides useful instruments to measure this outcome. In addition, the perspective of PROMs, i.e. patient-completed questionnaires, as well as from a patient experience perspective, helps to understand how patients perceive their clinical symptoms as problems. Based on four specific examples taken from the literature, we discuss differences and similarities in the interpretation of clinical symptom expression, HRQoL, PROMs, and patient experience. The four perspectives discussed in this review can be valuable to clinicians, researchers, and policy makers to better understand how patient-centred outcome domains fit within routine clinical practice and research.Plain English summaryHead and neck cancer (HNC) has adverse impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). QoL is a multidimensional concept that comprises various aspects, such as physical symptoms, socio-economic status, and psychological distress. Different perspectives exist with regard to what is considered as relevant outcome factors for HNC care. In this article, we describe four perspectives on this issue. The clinical perspective focuses on specific physical symptoms that have a direct impact on cancer survivors, and the perspective of health related QoL (HRQoL) measures provides a valuable addition to capture generic aspects of QoL in HNCC care. Both have their limitations in explaining the full impact of HNC on patients. The perspective of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provides information on the burden of symptoms from the patients' point of view. The perspective of patient experience is a novel way to capture the broader and less objective perception of the patient on how HNC influences their daily life. This paper provides insights in how different perspectives can complement each other in HNC care.A B S T R A C TSurvivors of head and neck cancer (HNC), oral and oro-and hypopharyngeal cancer (OHCC), have an impaired quality of life (QoL) and HRQoL, owing to the adverse side effects of HNC cancer, its treatment and the subsequent medical consequences[1,2]. For example, the majority of HNC survivors [3-8] experience problems with swallowing (dysphagia), ranging from mild to severe, which influences HRQoL[9,10]. These symptoms often endure, despite treatment completion, and can significantly impact aspects of eating, socialisation, and emotional well-being. Due to their long-term nature, symptom persistence is often a problem in HRC healthcare delivery. A common understanding within HNC care across clinicians, researchers, and policy makers that considers QoL in the assessment of health service effectiveness and the provision of care is therefore highly desirable.In this article, we describe four perspectives on what can be measured to capture the long-lasting impact of HNC on patients' QoL . These include the clinical point of view, the viewpoint of health-related QoL (HRQoL) measures, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and patient experience. Our aim is to provide insights into the HRQoL measurement perspective in HNC care, and to help understand how these perspectives can be translated within",

The severity of the disease was assessed using the modified Atlanta classification. A total of 319 patients were diagnosed to have acute pancreatitis during the study period, of whom 145 (55 men) were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOut of the 145 patients, 49 (33.8%) had mild to moderate disease and 87 (62.2%) had severe acute pancreatitis. Seventeen out of the 145 (11.7%) developed complications. Patients with severe acute pancreatitis were 10 times more likely to develop pancreatic abscess and 6 times more likely to develop intra abdominal pancreatic fluid collection than patients with mild or moderate pancreatitis. None of the 70 patients, who did not receive the second-look laparotomy (SL) developed pancreatic abscess while 2 out of the 9 who received an immediate laparotomy and went on to develop pancreatic abscess.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEarly SL for patients with severe acute pancreatitis can help to reduce the incidence of pancreatic abscess. <EOD> .\nBACKGROUND\nThe aim of this investigation was to evaluate and compare the value and applicability of the 1996 and 2003 ACR classification criteria, and the 2010 criteria of the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematodes.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nThe study included 183 patients diagnosed with and treated for systemic lupus erythematosus or patients with disease symptomatology typical of systemic lupus erythematosus but who were given that diagnosis by the clinician.

The NaCd(0.5)Zr(0.5)S(2) (NCZS) phosphor was fabricated via chemical reactions followed by a melt quenching method. The phosphor properties, including optical properties, luminescent lifetime, and photoluminescence quantum yield, were systematically measured to evaluate its potential application. The photoluminescence (PL) emission of the NCZS phosphor was obtained at 513 nm via self-activated emission under the excitation density of 10 microW cm(-2). The dependence of PL intensity on the excitation intensity was investigated, demonstrating the good linearity. The luminescent lifetime of NCZS was measured under 513.05 nm laser excitation. Photoluminescence quantum yields of NCZS were higher than 27.7%. The influence of the doping concentration of Zr (0-0.5) and the temperature (20-950 K) on the photoluminescence of the resulting NCZS phosphors were examined to estimate their potential for display applications. <EOD> Synthetic Actions of 2- and 3-Substituted Indolactam V Compounds\nThe synthesis of a series of 2(1H)-indolyl-substituted analogs of the serotonin receptor antagonist indolactam V (1; 2,2-dimethyl-6-(3-nitro-4-methoxybenzyl)-7-vinyl]indol-3(1H)-one) is described.

They found abnormalities in a broad spectrum of neuropsychological functions among patients with overt signs of neurological damage. The frequency of deficit in the subgroups was quite similar to that in a control group of children with similar educational levels and with no evidence of cerebral involvement. A longitudinal study, performed in a subgroup of 40 patients, showed that deficits, although partly stable, partly improved during 1 year, in a proportion similar to that in the control group. The authors conclude that, in patients with recovered and uncomplicated human cerebral malaria, cognitive deficits are often mild, multiplex, and mostly irreversible. Moreover, their results favor the hypothesis of a single form of brain damage, both in cerebral malaria with and without neurological impairments, and with and without evidence of cerebral involvement on computed tomography scan. <EOD> Assessing the value of a new drug.\nRecent reviews of the drug industry have discussed the need to revalue the way new drugs are assessed.1,2 A more reliable means of assessing the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of a new drug before it is added to the formulary of the National Health Service (NHS) has been proposed.3 This relies on more extensive and detailed clinical trials, before the use of the drug with the population, particularly in primary care, is assessed.\n\nIt is accepted that for drugs with limited therapeutic value for which existing cheaper drugs exist, such as chlorthalidone4 for essential hypertension or methyldopa5 for mild hypertension, this method of assessment may be the most appropriate.6 However, the cost effectiveness for such drugs may still not be improved because the cost of the drug in isolation (which is not the only factor in the assessment of cost effectiveness) would be too high. To assess which new drugs to include on the NHS drugs \u2026 <EOD> Chylothorax\nChylothorax is the accumulation of a milky/creamy substance (chyle) in the pleural space.  It may occur on its own or as part of a syndrome.  It is associated with damage to the thoracic duct (the primary path for reflux of ingested lipid back to the gut, and hence the source of chyle). It is a rare condition in adults. Chylothorax most commonly occurs as a surgical complication. It may arise from damage to the thoracic duct following major open thoracic surgery (including heart surgery), cardiac catheterization or trauma, or from thoracentesis (e.g, due to iatrogenic perforation of a tortuous duct). \n\n# Causes\n- Congenital Chylothorax is characterized by abnormally wide thoracic ducts or a single duct with cystic malformations at different locations.\n- Traumatic thoracic duct rupture is a rare complication of major thoracic surgery (e.g. oesophagectomy, aortocoronary bypass graft). Post-surgical pleural leak may lead to thoracic duct leak. \n- The syndrome of idiopathic (primary) Chylothorax (or chylous ascites) occurs in young, thin, male adults.  It is often associated with Graves' disease (causing a large thyroid), aneurysm, or previous thoracic/other surgery.  \n- Tuberculosis - may affect cervical lymph nodes to cause traumatic rupture of the thoracic duct. \n- Other causes - include lymphoma, mycosis, sarcoidosis, congenital syphilis, Kawasaki disease (a form of giant coronary aneurysm),  and, rarely, diabetes, pancreatic pseudocyst, pericardial calcification (Calcinosis circumscripta/Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Syringomatous papillomas (tubercul",

The announcement of the cancer, the treatment methods and their side effects can generate unpleasant emotions, such as fear, for example, and the resources for coping with them differ according to the patient. Coming to the hospital as an outpatient for chemotherapy is in itself a source of anxiety.\nThe use of music in the treatment process is a therapy that can help patients to reduce the intensity of their unpleasant emotions. Active music therapy involves the patient playing an instrument, including voice and body movement in rhythm, without requiring any musical skills. The presence of a qualified music therapy professional is essential, particularly in the reception of the emotions that may be generated during the sessions. These sessions can be collective or individual. In breast cancer, music therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing pain, anxiety, depressive symptoms and length of hospitalisation in patients undergoing mastectomy.",

However, the combination regimen has not been fully studied and its efficacy against advanced biliary tract cancer is not fully established. To prospectively evaluate safety and efficacy, we conducted this multicenter phase II clinical trial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTotal 39 patients from 10 institutions were enrolled and treated by S-1 (80mg/m2/day) and CBDCA (CBDCA AUC of 4 mg- hr/ml/day) with oral S-1 (40 mg/m2/12 hour) for 14 days and i.v.

Grade 3 toxicities included hematotoxicity (25%), gastrointestinal symptoms (26%), and skin rash (25%). As a conclusion, the two-week toxicity profile was quite acceptable, while the three-week toxicity profile was poor. Overall RR was 36.0% and that was excellent for CBDCA including group (CBDCA+S-1 group). Partial response was observed in 20%, SD in 80%. Median time to progressive disease was 97 days.

In this study, we used a transgenic mouse model of PXR overexpression and small interfering (si)RNA-mediated knockdown of hepatic PXR to further examine the relationship between PXR and bile salt metabolism in vivo. The overexpressed PXR led to significant increases in plasma and fecal concentrations of bile salt, while hepatic expression of both UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family 1 (UGT1) mRNA and activities of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 exhibited a marked response to 20-fold increase in PXR protein level. By contrast, expression of PXR target genes in biliary excretion of bile salt such as sulfotransferase family 2A (SULT2A1), multidrug resistance proteins (mdr1a and mdr1b), and organic anion transporting polypeptide (oatp4) was not affected by PXR overexpression. To determine whether the induction of expression of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 by PXR is of physiologic importance, we used an antisense PXR RNA oligonucleotide to specifically decrease PXR levels in the liver of rats fed a cholic acid (CA)-containing diet. Compared with control oligonucleotide-treated rats that were fed a normal diet, PXR-morpholino-oligonucleotide-treated rats showed a significant decrease in fecal CA levels and hepatic PXR mRNA and protein levels. Compared with the controls, the PXR-morpholino-oligonucleotide-treated rats also exhibited an attenuated increase in hepatic PXR protein levels and decreases in fecal b",

As such, this study was carried out to analyse the prevalence of caries, periodontal disease and malocclusion in a sample of patients residing in nursing homes in the province of Soria (Spain). To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to analyse the prevalence of these conditions in elderly patients in Spain.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA transversal, observational, epidemiological, descriptive and analytic study was undertaken and the sample selected was non probabilistic. The sample consisted of 329 elderly patients. The age range was 65\u2013107 years. Two clinical and radiographical examinations were performed on each patient. The data were subsequently analysed, first, to determine the prevalence of the pathologies and the clinical and radiographical diagnoses and, second, the relationship between the prevalence of pathologies and the clinical diagnoses in the individuals and groups. The statistical study was conducted using the Chi 2 test and Fischer's Exact Test.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf those affected by oral pathologies, more than 40% presented a diagnosis of periodontopathies. In addition, the highest overall prevalence of abnormalities was found in patients above 75 years, who had 0.28 abnormalities per person.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAfter being checked against the general population, elderly patients are seen to have more affected sites than the general population in all the pathologies studied. However, a relationship could not be established with the different clinical categories in each age group. <EOD> The Effect of Transabdominal Cerclage in the Second Trimester on Fetal Outcomes and Clinical Course of Women with Unexplained Second Trimester Recurrent Miscarriage\nObjective: To assess the effect of transabdominal cerclage (TAC) in the second trimester on the clinical course and fetal outcomes of women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. Materials and methods: TAC was applied to 30 patients as a standard procedure. The patients were assessed clinically in terms of the clinical course, and the results of serial ultrasound studies, fetal biophysical profile and Doppler examination were compared with the results of the 43 untreated women in the same period, constituting the control group. Results: We did not find any fetal death following TAC. TAC reduced the miscarriage rate from 73.3% in the control group to 20% in the TAC group (p < 0.05). The patients of the control group had more fetal growth retardation (FGR) (30% versus 12.6%, p < 0.05) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants (28.3% versus 0, p < 0.05) than the TAC group. The rate of the preterm births between the two groups was not statistically different (17.4% versus 9.1%, respectively, p = 0.319). The rate of perinatal mortality, stillbirths, and intrauterine demise were similar in the two groups. The rate of preterm deliveries following TAC was 9.1%, while the preterm birth rate of the control group was 21.8% (p < 0.05). Conclusion: TAC applied in the second trimester prevents recurrent second trimester miscarriages and reduces FGR and SGA infants. <EOD> .\nThis study is a contribution to the investigation of acute infections of the ear, nose and throat.

In this study, we reviewed all evidence for effectiveness of CRT across all relevant domains to inform treatment practice. A systematic review was conducted and supplemented by analysis of relevant published data and meta-analyses from the literature. A total of 62 studies were included examining effects of CRT on four symptom domains-psychosis (19), depression (13), anxiety (5), and cognition (19)-and eight life domains-employment (12), education (10), medication adherence (1) and substance misuse (1). Meta-analyses were conducted where possible. In most cases, CRT was not a significantly more efficacious treatment than control groups (e.g., education or support) in clinical samples (k = 32). Moderator investigations of the effects of CRT indicated that effect sizes tended to be smaller in older individuals with longer illness duration (i.e., greater than 20\u00a0years) with larger effects being observed in younger individuals with shorter illness duration (i.e., 10 years). We reviewed all available evidence comparing CRT to a control condition. In addition, we reviewed some evidence to support the effectiveness of CRT in improving cognition and symptoms, and there is some evidence for CRT improving employment and education outcomes. It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of cognitive remediation given the substantial heterogeneity of programs in terms of methodology, delivery mode and targets. Nonetheless, in line with an evolving scientific field with many program innovations, it is important to recognize progress in the delivery of effective therapies for an often debilitating mental illness. <EOD> .\nPURPOSE\nTo evaluate the long-term clinical effects after the use of modified coronally advanced flap.\n\n\nMETHODS\n18 patients with bilateral mucogingival defect caused by orthodontic extraction during orthodontic treatment were included in this study.

On first histological examination, a diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), a rare inflammatory condition of unknown etiology, was proposed; the diagnosis was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Two years after the diagnosis of LyP, a primary extraskeletal carcinoma of the left pleural cavity was diagnosed and surgically removed. LyP was then considered to be an extracutaneous manifestation of malignant disease. One week later, the patient died following a recurrence of malignant mesothelioma. The pathogenesis of extracutaneous LyP is discussed. <EOD> Comparison of serum free light chains between high-risk multiple myeloma at presenting and remission phase.\nTITLE\nComparision of the serum free lite chains (FLC) in patients with multiple myeloma.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe study was carried out on 30 MM patients (male 20, female 10, mean age 64). The patients were classified in 2 groups according to their risk as high risk and standard risk MM patients. The immunofixation, urine immunofixation and serum immunofixation were done in all cases and serum immunofixation was done again in the group risk 2 before stem cell transplantation. Serum free light chain (s k chains) was measured before doing the bone marrow biopsy and after bone marrow biopsy in the standard risk and high risk patients groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFourteen patients were in standard risk group (mean age 57.5 +/- 48.7 years) and 16 cases were in high risk group (mean age 68.3 +/- 68.4 years). The IgG type was more than other types in all cases. The value of s k chains before MM treatment in both high risk patients and standard group was 34.9 +/- 27.4% and 29.2 +/- 23.1% respectively(p > 0.05). The value of s k chains after treatment was 6.1 +/- 4.8 in patients with standard risk and 39.9 +/- 27.7% in other group(p < 0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNo significant difference in level of s k chains between standard risk and high risk MM patients, but after treatment, the level of s k chains was normalized only in the standard risk patients. <EOD> .\nIn the paper, there are discussed the possibilities of diagnostics of occupational intoxications.

It affects more than 1% of the world population regardless of demographic characteristics such as ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status and is one of the leading causes of global disability. Bipolar disorder can cause serious cognitive and functional impairments and maintaining life with this disorder involves some difficulties for the individual. Functional impairments such as deterioration in family relationships, problems in work life and incompatibilities in social relationships negatively affect both the well-being and quality of life of the individual. The ability to cope with difficulties is assumed to be a protective factor for quality of life. However, individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder are exposed to more stressful events due to their illness and experience coping problems, including in the euthymic period. For these reasons, developing coping skills is among the targets in the treatment process of bipolar disorder. The stress coping strategies of these individuals may even affect the risk of suicide. Bipolar disorder is characterised by high impulsivity even during recovery periods. It is not only associated with suicide attempts but may also lead to functional impairment. Impulsivity, which can be defined as a predisposition to unplanned reactions to internal and external stimuli regardless of negative consequences and the absence of behavioural inhibition, is one of the clinical features of bipolar disorder. It is more common during manic episode, but may also be found in other mood phases. In the literature, it has been revealed that high impulsivity is associated with poor quality of life. In the light of this information, this study aimed to determine the predictive effects of impulsivity and coping skills on quality of life in patients with bipolar disorder.\n\nQuality of Life, Health Status Generic (Patient Reported Outcome Measures)\nPatient outcomes should be reported.

To use N1PAP for the in vivo selection of genes involved in the transport and degradation of amino acids, a metagenomic library was constructed from the archaeon of the Sagami sea sediment. This library consisted of a combination of genomic DNA of the host organism with short fragments (approximately 1000 nucleotides) of environmental DNA. The library was screened and the clone containing the plpp gene was isolated. One of plpp upstream fragments from this clone appeared to contain a novel transposon-like sequence consisting of a composite transposon TnG12A1. A partial nucleotide sequence of the original clone was examined using a Genetyx-J program for the identification of other transposon sequences. As a result, a series of composite transposon sequences was detected by this procedure. One of them was designated TnG4B5. Transposon analysis using TnG4B5 as a transposon donor demonstrated that this composite transposon system also exhibited the promoter function. These transposon systems have the potential to be used as unique genetic elements for the in vivo selection of functional genes and for the generation of genetic libraries in hyperthermophilic archaea. <EOD> .\nThe authors describe a method of treatment of chronic parodontitis with a combined use of 3% chlorhexidine",

        "summary": "Dentists have recently preferred to use composite materials and restorative techniques that allow the use of simplified clinical protocols in order to reduce the time the patient spends in the dentist's chair and minimize technical sensitivity. Color selection in the clinic is a very sensitive process and is affected by environmental factors and operator-related variables. This has led to the development of single-color universal composite resins that aim to facilitate color selection. These materials have a universal opacity and several Vita shades and are recommended by manufacturers to be used in a single color layer that can match different tooth colors. In recent years, monochromatic universal composites have been developed that are supposed to be compatible with all Vita Classic Scale shades from A1 to D4. Manufacturers report that single-color universal composites can be applied to teeth of all colors without using the layering technique using different color composites.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to compare the clinical performance of 2 different single-color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions with the control group (Filtek Z250, 3M), which is a multi-color composite resin material, using modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) and World Dental Federation (FDI) criteria.",

The increase on cardiac output induced by increasing heart rate was larger than the increase induced by augmentations of blood pressure and stroke volume. The changes were more pronounced after metoprolol than after propranolol. 40Ca uptake by the ventricular muscle was slightly higher after metoprolol, but was only decreased by propranolol in the heart rate-pressure product areas with high systemic arteriolar resistance. <EOD> 3,4-Dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxamide\n\nKey indicators: single-crystal X-ray study; T = 296 K; mean (C-C) = 0.003 \u00c5; R factor = 0.049; wR factor = 0.126; data-to-parameter ratio = 12.8. organic compounds o1530 Shuai-Hua Jin and Zhe Hua Comment 3,4dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine derivatives have attracted considerable attention in terms of their application as antifunglals, anticancer and antidiabetic agents (Chandra et al., 2004; Tong et al., 2005).Here we report the crystal structure and synthesis of the title compound C 8 H 10 N 2 O 2 .

The infecting forms of the fungus are capable of disseminating into the lung, meninges, eye, skin, bone marrow, and other organs. Clinical signs include respiratory distress, headache, altered mental status, hearing loss, aseptic meningitis, blindness, and endocrine-related symptoms. The diagnosis is confirmed by culture of cryptococci from CSF, skin biopsy, or pleural or pulmonary tissue, or by lung biopsy. Treatment options include fluconazole, amphotericin B with flucytosine, and more recently a combination of fluconazole and flucytosine.

        "summary": "Up to 60% of endometrial cancer cases are attributed to obesity, in part because obesity promotes development of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), and up to 40% of women with AEH go on to develop endometrial cancer. The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment. It is the hypothesis that premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer who desire uterine preservation will be more likely to have atypia-free uterine preservation at two years if they receive progestin in combination with a behavioral weight loss intervention versus progestin plus enhanced usual care.",

C., seeking to have a Federal District Court Judge nullify a portion of the Medicare legislation and to stop other aspects of the law which had not been fully implemented by November 1983. The suit was brought by several physicians, hospitals, third party carriers and other organizations. Central to the complaint presented in the suit was the Government's assertion that the hospital prospective payment system (PPS) contained flaws which created inefficient and cost-increasing incentives and therefore should not be implemented. As previously discussed, the implementation of the PPS system is being reviewed and tested on a provisional nature in three pilot projects in New Jersey, Michigan and Maryland. This process of testing and review and adaption is now under the jurisdction of the United States Department of Health and Human Services via the Health Care Financing Administration, through its Regional Offices and Intermediary Contractor Offices. <EOD> Nutrition Education Intervention Reduces Fatalistic Health Beliefs and Promotes Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Among Women with Breast Cancer.\nPURPOSE/OBJECTIVES\nTo test a nutrition education intervention on fatalistic beliefs (beliefs that one has little or no control over what happens to them) and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption for women with breast cancer who had completed cancer treatment.\n\n\nRESEARCH APPROACH\nLongitudinal design with random assignment of subjects to experimental and control groups.\n\n\nSETTING\nResearch study conducted in a mid-size urban community including four of the five oncology clinics.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 44 women with self- reported cancer in active follow-up treatment whose treatment was complete (i.e., not ongoing) within the last six months with an age range of of 32 to 81, 90% with a college education or higher, 70% identifying as white, and all with stage 0, 1, 2, or 3 breast cancer.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGIC APPROACH\nData were obtained from a survey conducted at baseline and six months later via mailed survey methodology.\n\n\nMAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES\nFatalistic beliefs, beliefs about cause, beliefs about control or cure, and FV consumption.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nThere was a significant increase in FV consumption in the experimental group (4 servings/day) that was significantly higher than the control group (no change; p < 0.02). There was a significant decrease in fatalism beliefs for the intervention group (p < 0.01) that was significantly higher than the control group (no change; p < 0.02). A small but statistically significant increase in belief about cause (p < 0.05) for the intervention group compared to the control group (no change), was observed; however, belief in control was unchanged for both groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrated the utility of implementing a nutrition education intervention focused on addressing fatalistic beliefs with women with recently completed cancer treatment.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING\nThis study's findings show that nurses' attention to health beliefs among people recently with breast cancer may lead to reduced fatalistic beliefs and increased fruit and vegetable consumption. <EOD> .\nGastric malignancies constitute a highly lethal disease.

Important psychological problems can be experienced after sports injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), these delay physical recovery, affect the quality of rehabilitation, and eventually cause problems or re-injuries in the process of returning to sports. The most important of these problems are re-injury anxiety, rehabilitation adherence, rehabilitation self-efficacy problems, and kinesiophobia. Although some interventions have been proposed for the solution of these problems, a structured intervention approach has not been put forward yet. With this research project, our aim is to examine the effectiveness of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol (CBT+VR) enriched with the contribution of virtual reality (VR), which the investigators prepared to intervene in psychological problems that arise after ACL operation. If the CBT+VR protocol is effective, it can be used to increase the quality of physical rehabilitation and therefore to ensure that the perceptions of athletes regarding their psychological outcomes about their return to sport are positive. CBT+VR protocol will be tested, and if it is found effective, it will make a significant contribution to both the literature and practice. The main peculiarity of this study is that a holistic protocol including virtual intervention will be developed for the solution of psychological problems encountered in the rehabilitation process of sports injuries for the first time. The research will be conducted with 60 athletes who meet the inclusion criteria. In the study, which is planned as a 4X5 (groupXmeasurement) mixed factorial design model with four groups (intervention1-intervention2-intervention3, control), the athletes will be filled with psychological assessment scales in order to collect the first data within the first week of starting physical therapy after ACL operation. The CBT+VR protocol will be applied to the first intervention group. Only the behavioral intervention part of the protocol in the VR environment will be applied to the second intervention group. The CBT protocol will be applied without the VR environment for the third intervention group. It is planned that for all intervention groups and the control group, there will be 10 sessions in total once a week, and each session lasts 50 minutes. There will be conversation in the control group sessions; in addition, images that give calmness from nature will be watched for 5 minutes with VR glasses. The remaining 45 minutes will continue with a conversation with encouragement and emotional support, which will not create a therapeutic effect. The scales will also be filled in three more times. The data obtained will be analyzed with multi-level statistics.

It is currently unclear which patients need physical therapist intervention in the hospital, and how much physical therapy is necessary, in order to achieve a functional status that is adequate to discharge home. We have developed a patient-level clinical decision support tool to guide optimal treatment frequency. This tool-the Physical Therapy Frequency Clinical Decision Support Tool, or PT-PENCIL-is based on a statistical model that predicts discharge home relative to the frequency of physical therapist treatment.\nThe primary goals of this study are to assess the implementation strategy for the PT-PENCIL and analyze its effect on improving the proportion of patients who discharge home.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] Your task is to create a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the provided clinical trial document. The output should only be the summarization of the given trial. Do not explain how you summarize it.\n\nInput Text: Analysis of a Stepped-Wedge Implementation of the PT-PTENCIL Tool (PT-PENCIL) PT-PENCIL was created with a modified Delphi process based on a pilot trial previously performed at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI; 136 patients were enrolled; 51 patients received daily PT as determined by the statistical model built on the Delphi process, and 85 patients received the control treatment (standard care as determined by the treating physicians). This randomized controlled trial, comparing usual versus more frequent physical therapy, demonstrated that more frequent physical therapy (at least once per day) significantly increased the proportion of patients discharged home from the hospital.\n\n### General Study Objectives\nThere is currently no standard of care to determine the necessary dosing and functional goals of therapy. The Physical Therapy Frequency Clinical Decision Support Tool (PT-PENCIL) was created to facilitate this standard. In this study, we will pilot the use of the PT-PENCIL during the patient\u2019s time in the hospital to increase their functional independence before discharge to facilitate discharge home. To determine the effect of the PT-PENCIL on the proportion of patients discharged home, we designed a cluster-randomized trial (involving patients as clusters), a stepped-wedge design to be conducted at three regional academic medical centers, and in which the intervention and control arms were alternately allocated. The data that we will collect and evaluate include patient data (demographic data, admission data, functional data, and discharge data), which will be abstracted from the electronic health record of each patient, and therapists\u2019 perceptions of the tool.\n\n### PT-PTENCIL\nPT-PENCIL determines a patient\u2019s predicted probability that he or she will become more functionally independent with an increasing frequency of physical therapy. For an individual patient, PT-PENCIL estimates the probability of the patient being discharged home versus into a facility with a decreasing frequency of physical therapy, thus allowing hospital therapists to see the patient as high risk to be discharged home with physical therapy, and vice-versa.\n\n# Summary Analysis\n\n### PT-PENCIL algorithm:\nPT-PENCIL utilizes logistic regression models that combine independent predictors of patients\u2019 functional status, clinically available within 24 hours of admission. The variables included are: \n\nThe PT-PENCIL algorithm uses a sliding step that is a function of the days since admission. At day j, where j is the first day that the value of the PT-PENCIL is applied.\n\n### PT-PSL and PT-PFD:\nFor each patient, PT-PENCIL assigns PT-PSL and PT-PFD, which are numerical values, not binary. PT-PSL provides a measure of the strength of the association between the patient\u2019s age (Xj) and the probability that he or she may benefit from more frequent physical therapy (Yj). Similarly, PT-PSL is the strength of the association between the number of comorbidities (Xj) and improved functional status with more frequent physical therapy (Yj).\n\n### Step Rules:\nStep Rules apply the PT-PSL and PT-PFD to determine how many days will pass before the patient can be assigned an action score of 0 or 1.\n\n# Introduction\n\n# Background\nPT-PENCIL was developed to overcome the current lack of clinical decision support tools to inform healthcare stakeholders on how physical therapy dosing impacts patient outcomes. We developed PT-PENCIL to provide a clinical decision support tool to inform healthcare stakeholders on how physical therapy dosing impacts patient outcomes. To date, there is no standard of care to determine the necessary dosing of physical therapy for individual patients. To address this clinical gap, we developed the PT-PENCIL, a clinical decision support tool to optimize physical therapy frequency in acute care to facilitate greater levels of functional independence and thereby discharge disposition. PT-PENCIL is predicted functional status based on patient data. Patient data include age, gender, race, number and severity of",

The composite contains ZnO, TiO 2 nanocrystals, and ZnTiO 3 nanoparticles. The ZIF-8-derived composite exhibited the maximum BET surface area of 322 m 2 g \u00c01 and the largest pore volume of 1.67 cm 3 g \u00c01 (0.47 cm 3 g \u00c01 of pure TiO 2 ).

The optimized photocatalytic efficiency of 1% ZnTiO 3 /ZnO/SiO 2 composite was 96% towards the degradation of Congo red, and the optimized hydrogen production rate was 156.2 ml min \u00c01 g cat \u00c01 . The improvement of photocatalytic activity was explained based on the charge separation, electron transfer, and crystal phase of ZnO, TiO 2 , and ZnTiO 3 . The photodegradative mechanism was also investigated.\n\n# Introduction\nZnO is well known because of its interesting physicochemical properties. Many applications of ZnO in sensors, 1 photocatalysis, 2 gas sensors,and \ue103eld emission transistorshave already been reported. ZnO with a hexagonal wurtzite structure exhibits a band gap of 3.37 eV, which makes it highly capable to absorb incident long-wavelength light.The band gap was decreased by co-doping of ZnO with non-metals like N, F, and Cl.ZnO nanoparticles are used as active components in UV-A and UV-B protective creams for skin protection. Due to its high chemical stability, ZnO nanomaterials have found a wide spectrum of applications.\nThe synthesis of 0D, 1D, 2D, and 0D/1D ZnO nanomaterials has become more and more attractive in modern materials because of the various physical and chemical properties they possess compared with ZnO bulk materials and ZnO nanostructures. ZnO exhibits excellent stability and is thus a favored choice for its structural application due to its high melting point, nontoxic, and non-poisonous nature. However, the synthesis of well-de\ue103ned ZnO in morphologies of nanoparticles, nanowires and nanotubes is still highly desirable and more complex.\nThe use of ZnO in the development of heterostructured structures is also an area of current research interest. Zinc oxide is a semiconductor material, which is used as a \ue104eld-effect transistor (FET) and as a p type semiconductor. Due to its chemical/structural stability, good electrical properties, and environmental protection, ZnO is ideal for heterostructured system fabrication.The ZnO/SiO 2 heterostructure consists of SiO 2 crystallized ZnO with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. ZnO/SiO 2 heterojunction materials are usually created using a spin-coating technology. ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are synthesized by a hydrothermal method at 90 C for 40 hours. These nanoparticles are then adhered to Si substrates by spin coating and then the samples are dried for 50 min at 140 C and stored at room temperature. The NPs have become adhesive to the SiO 2 substrate.\nZinc titanate (ZnTiO 3 ) is considered to be a potential material for photocatalytic applications. ZnTiO 3 has a large band gap of 2.49 eV, which is more conducive to the absorption of ult",

The effect is however often transient, but the effect of a fluid bolus on stroke volume and other hemodynamic variables over time are poorly described. The volume effect of a fluid bolus (effect on blood volume) can be calculated by measuring Haemoglobin. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the hemodynamic effects of a fluid bolus during normovolemia and hypovolemia in healthy volunteers. Study details include:\n\u2022 Study Duration: 2 visits of approximately 2 h duration each + follow-up visit. Visits 1 and 2 are at least 2 days apart.

Fluid responsiveness is also questioned to be diminished in this experimental hypovolemia model.\n</p>\n\nIntervention:\n<p>[/HUMAN] Two different levels of experimental hypovolemia will be induced in this study. One level where the participants will be subjected to 40mmHg lower body negative pressure (LBNP), with the aim to diminish cardiac performance and stroke volume (volume condition), similar to conditions of acute normovolemic anaemia. A second level where we will attempt to simulate a more extreme hypovolemic condition and induce a decrease in stroke volume to levels lower than what is seen in experimental anaemia. This is achieved by combining 40mmHg\u00a0LBNP with intravenous fluid removal and with the use of acetated ringer\u00b4s fluids, resulting in a decrease in stroke volume by approximately 35 per cent. The experimental hypovolemic condition is maintained for 150\u00a0minutes (volume condition trial). This intervention will be initiated at t=0, in an attempt to evaluate intravenous fluid responsiveness for a 2hour period.\n</p>\n\n\nResults:\n<p>[/HUMAN] To our knowledge, no experimental study has been published investigating intravenous fluid responses in hypovolemia. One randomised, controlled trial in human participants with experimental anaemia induced by blood donation investigated fluid responsiveness in a similar context. In this trial, however, the participants were randomised, in a blinded fashion, to either receive 0.9\u00a0% saline or a colloid infusion. All infusions were calculated to induce approximately 10% rise in stroke volume. Both fluid types were found equally potent in restoring stroke volume, despite that stroke volume was lower than normal at the onset of the hypervolemia induced by the resuscitation. Another controlled trial investigated fluid response in hypovolemia, induced by acute gastrointestinal fluid loss. A bolus of 350ml intravenous Ringer's lactate was administered to restore euvolaemia, and stroke volume was measured during the resuscitation phase. This study demonstrated that stroke volume increased, although it did not exceed the basal levels, as stroke volume could not be restored to normal values. In contrast to these results, we previously demonstrated that Ringer\u00b4s acetate given 10\u00a0ml\u00a0kg-1 in an experimental study of experimental anaemia does not restore stroke volume in healthy human volunteers. However, only one intervention was evaluated, and whether or not the fluid responses would have been different when measuring several time-points at several time points, and at different interventions, is still unproven. Moreover, our results do not take into account, that the use of lower body negative pressure, may cause a lower restoration of stroke volume during normovolaemic fluid administration, as seen in a porcine blood donation model.\n</p>\n\n\nConclusion:\n<p>[/HUMAN] \n</p>\n\nExclusion criteria:\n<p>[/HUMAN]\u00a0Participants on medications, with prior allergic reactions, or pre-existing conditions that could affect hemodynamic stability as a result of study interventions will not be eligible for enrolment in the study.

The investigators aim to enroll 4 participants with skin tones associated with those of African descent (Group A), 4 of East Asian descent (Group B), and 4 of European descent (Group C). Additionally, the investigators aim to ensure half of group is male, and the other half female. For the duration of the study, two wearable devices will be placed on the participant: a Nonin PureSat pulse oximeter on a forefinger, and the novel wearable pulse oximeter - MABOS - on the other forefinger. Prior to testing, an Ocean HR2 XR Spectrometer will be used to assess the absorbance of three wavelengths of light - 410, 660, 940 nm - on each patient's inner wrist. Following this, the two devices will be placed on the patient, set up, and calibrated for 10 minutes. During the calibration period, MABOS will be used to measure the same three wavelengths of light utilized by the Ocean HR2 XR Spectrometer (410, 660, and 940 nm). After the calibration period, all participants will be asked to perform the following procedure 5 times as part of the testing period: a deep inhalation lasting no longer than 10 seconds, followed by a slow exhalation lasting no longer than 30 seconds. Between each trial, a five-minute break will be required. For the entire testing period, all two devices will be continuously acquiring data. After this testing period, all two devices will continue taking measurements until 90 minutes have elapsed. Skin integrity will be examined before spectrometer use, after spectrometer use, after the calibration period, every 30 minutes after the start of the testing period, and after the testing period. During the study, if the participants report any uncomfortable feeling and/or pain or if a change to the skin at the site of device placement occurs, the measurements will be discontinued, and all the devices placed on the participants will be removed. Questionnaires will be provided after the study period and during follow-up visits approximately 48 hours and 96 hours post the device testing visit for a proof-of-concept evaluation of the safe wearability.",

        "model_output": "[/INST]\n==========================================================\n\n\n\n <EOD> .\nIn this paper, based on the results of the pharmacokinetics studies and tissue distribution of tanshinone IIA in rats, a novel in situ absorption dialysis-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (ID-MS/MS) method with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the determination of tanshinone IIA was developed and validated by using a mobile phase system consisting of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% formic acid. The ID-MS/MS system was developed using in situ absorption dialysis sampling technique and reversed-phase LC-MS/MS. After that, validation of the proposed ID-MS/MS for the analysis of tanshinone IIA was performed. The results showed that the linear range of tanshinone IIA was 20.32-101.66 ng/mL and the correlation coefficient was not <0.9901, whereas the limit of quantification (LOQ) of tanshinone IIA was 20.32 ng/mL and the limit of detection (LOD) was 4.25 ng/mL. The recovery was 93.06%-98.76%, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) of recovery was no greater than 12.66%. Moreover, the results indicated that the proposed method is accurate and reliable. The proposed ID-MS/MS coupled with LC-MS/MS system was employed to quantify tanshinone IIA, which can be considered a potential tool for the pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution study of tanshinone IIA. <EOD> Cerebellar and pontine involvement in Friedreich ataxia: a transcranial sonographic study\nAnatomical imaging studies in the cerebellum suggest that, in cases of sporadic degenerative cerebellar disease, atrophy of the anterior dentate and flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellar vermis might correlate with an early onset of ataxia. However, anatomical imaging studies are unable to depict the very early stages of neurodegenerative processes in the cerebellum, before cerebellar atrophy and secondary ataxia has developed. Transcranial sonography can depict the very early stages of neurodegeneration in the cerebellum by demonstrating the loss of cerebellar echogenicity. The present study therefore aimed to evaluate the cerebellar and pontine echogenicity of young patients with Friedreich's ataxia, a hereditary form of cerebellar degeneration. Twelve patients with symptoms of progressive cerebellar disease underwent sonographical evaluation. All cases exhibited atrophy of the cerebellar vermis (92%), echogenic lesions of the flocculonodular lobe (100%), increased echogenicity of cerebellar folia (100%), and reduced echogenicity of their underlying gray and white matter (100%, all cases). The posterior part of the vermis was relatively more atrophic than the anterior region. Eight patients demonstrated pontine hyperechogenicity (67%). We conclude that transcranial sonography provides an objective index of neuroaxonal degeneration in Friedreich's ataxia much earlier than clinical ataxia could, indicating that cerebellar echogenicity might be a useful sonographic correlate of the very early stages of neurodegeneration during ataxia development. <EOD> .\nClinical, histological, and electronmicroscopical study of 20 patients with systemic scleroderma syndrome (SSS) and 15 patients with chronic (local) active arterial hypoxia (CAH) was carried out.

The low dose group (group A) included 35 patients treated with methylprednisolone 30 min after trauma (35 mg/ kg), 6 h in succession. The high dose group (group B) included 30 patients treated with methylprednisolone at the same time (200 mg/ kg, 48 h in succession), the control group (group C) included 30 patients treated with placebo. The follow-up was conducted 3, 6 months after trauma with Barthel function index, FIM evaluation and the Mental State Examination.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBarthel index (BI) of group A improved more than that of the other two groups. BI and mini-mental state examinations (MMSE) of group A were the high groups. FIM scores of group A on bladder control and bowel control were higher than those of group B and C groups at 3 and 6 months after injury.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe early use of high dosage of methylprednisolone has a beneficial effect on early motor function especially on the bladder bowel dysfunction after acute spinal cord injury. <EOD> .\nWe retrospectively analyzed 45 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in HIV+ patients, seen at our Hospital from 1987 to 1992.

Lymphoma predominantly localized in the gastrointestinal tract (64.4%), especially in the small bowel. The median interval between diagnosis of NHL and AIDS was 12.5 months. The median time from NHL diagnosis to death was 8.1 months; the main cause of death was myeloma (39.5%). Clinical manifestations included abdominal pain (7.8%), ascites (13.6%), GI bleeding (8.8%), constitutional symptoms and weight loss (88.8%), abdominal mass (40%), hepatomegaly (42.1%). B symptoms (fever and night sweats) were present in one case. Laboratory findings included CD4+ cell count < 50/mm3 (28.8%); the median CD4+ cell count was 121.5/mm3; 64.4% had HAART treatment before diagnosis of lymphoma. Extra-nodal involvement (mainly, gastrointestinal tract); B symptoms were less frequent than in other series of NHL. CD4+ cell count < 50/mm3 was infrequent, we presume that the low incidence of lymphocytopenia was a false negative and not a real one.

Causes of theses sleep alterations are complex including environmental noise (alarms, beepers, conversations\u2026), continuous light, nurse care and repetitive measures of vital parameters.\nNumerous studies have reported a relationship between severe sleep alterations and a prolonged weaning period and mortality. Improving sleep quality in critically ill patients is a major challenge to promote ICU patient's recovery.\nA very promising treatment is the application of a nocturnal  quiet-time  during which non urgent care, comfort care, systematic measures of vital parameters are delayed and clustered in order to limit room entries. However,  quiet time  procedures have failed to improve sleep quality to date.\nA miniaturized medical device recording one EEG channel and embedding an automated sleep scoring algorithm running in real-time was devised. This device (positioned on forehead, and continuously recording noise and light levels) indicates if the patient is awake or asleep using a tablet positioned at doorstep of the room, so that nurses know if patient is sleeping, without entering the room.\nHypothesis proposes that applying sleep protection procedures (clustering cares, limiting room entries, reducing lights and noise, delaying non urgent care\u2026) when patients are sleeping (= EEG-guided strategies) will increase patients sleep quality.\nThis study will assess the effect of such device on sleep quality in ICU patients. This is a before / after design. The first group (control group), will be recorded but the sleep scoring will not be displayed by the tablet and patient will be expose to standard care.

In the present study, the drug cytotoxicity to the human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLF) has been studied in details. Materials and Methods: For cell culture, 4 freshly extracted wisdom teeth were aseptically extracted from 3 patients who were clinically and radiographically diagnosed as having a dental extraction indication and required a tooth extraction for periodontal reasons. All teeth were extracted at dental clinics for periodontal reasons after obtaining consent from patients. Extracted teeth were immediately transferred to the Department of Periodontics, Faculty of Dentistry. On the same day after tooth extraction, hPDLF were isolated by enzyme (0.25% Trypsin/EDTA [GIBCO, Grand Island, NY]) digestion and subcultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), 2 mM glutamine (GIBCO) and 1% antibiotic and antimycotic solution (GIBCO). For the experiments, primary osteoblasts of hPDLF were exposed to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 25 and the cell viability was assessed using trypan blue and methyl thiazoldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results: There was no statistical difference between the number of dead cells after 1 days exposure between the experimental and control groups (P > 0.05). Also, viability of hPDLF did not change significantly after the 7-day culture (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid has no significant cytotoxic effect on hPDLF and can be considered as the choice of choice for the regenerative approaches.\n\n# Introduction\nAntimicrobial agents have been used for treating dental problems since the early 20 th century. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is widely used in dentistry for periodontal disease treatment. Amoxicillin is effective against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid has an excellent antimicrobial spectrum and may provide the maximum therapeutic effect at the lowest total dose of antibiotic.   Efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: A double-blind,..., Ozcura   However, the overuse of this antimicrobial agent may cause the development of resistant microorganisms and its toxic effects on human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLF). hPDLF are localized between the tooth and periodontal ligament (PDL), are derived from PDL stem cells, and may differentiate into osteoblast or fibroblasts. Also, they are responsible for synthesis of connective tissue constituents during bone formation, and play a crucial role in maintaining periodontal tissue.   Cellular changes in jaw periosteum in response to orthodontic force application, Tanimoto   Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid has been reported to affect the cell proliferation and morphology of cultured periodontal ligament cells (PDL) and bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSC).   Cytotoxic effects of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on periodontal ligament cells and bone marrow..., Jang   Nevertheless, the present study did not clearly address any cell proliferation or morphological changes due to prolonged exposure of amoxicillinclavulanic acid. Moreover, it is unclear if the PDL cells and BMSC differ from hPDLF in their responses to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid",

We expect our main hypothesis that Endocalyx improves fluid retention is true, since we hypothesize that the Glycocalyx will be better restored in Endocalyx treated patients. This will improve diastolic compliance of the heart and reduce congestion, therefore decreasing congestion-related symptoms such as leg swelling. Endocalyx is a special food supplement containing glycosaminoglycans derived from marine-produced seaweed. We expect Endocalyx to be an effective and promising treatment option since it will also normalize sodium overload. Previous publications have demonstrated improved physical limitations and hemodynamic parameters in patients with CHF that received Endocalyx compared with patients who received placebo.(16) Endocalyx is expected to be especially useful in patients who suffer from CHF with preserved or mid range EF (EF >40%) and suffer from congestion due to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade or a diuretic(3, 7, 11, 16, 17, 29).

        "summary": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health threat in China. At present, a functional cure, also known as clinical cure or sustained Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, is recommended as the ideal endpoint of HBV treatment. However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection. In this study, a large multicenter prospective study will be performed to explore the safety and efficacy of a novel combination strategy involving immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 antibody) and IFN\u03b1 in CHB patients, observe the HBsAg loss rate in NA-treated CHB patients receiving this combination strategy, evaluate the potential of breaking immune tolerance by this strategy, and further assess its efficacy to further improve the clinical cure rate on the basis of New Switch Study. Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients. The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the burden of HBV infection in China and contribute to the goal of global elimination of hepatitis B and C by 2030 (WHO 2030).",
        "model_output": "[/INST]\n\n| Term | Symbol | Meaning |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Adverse Event | AE | An adverse event refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product.|\n| Adverse Drug Reaction | ADR | An adverse drug reaction is defined as a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in man. An ADR can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not considered related to the drug. An ADR (as opposed to other unfavorable or unintended effects of medicinal products) can generally be distinguished from a lack of clinical effect [No Effect (NE) by inability to produce a drug effect by a combination of dose, time and subject].|\n| Suspected Product Defect | SPD | A suspected product defect is defined as a biological or mechanical error in the manufacture of a product. An SPD (as opposed to other undesirable and unintended effects [for example, a lack of clinical effect]) indicates a deviation from a product within normal manufacturing specifications.|\n| Relatedness | Rel | A relationship (Rel) describes causal relationships between an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) or a Suspected Product Defect (SPD) and a given pharmaceutical product. According to the Guidelines of the Uppsala Academic Centre, three levels of relationships can be distinguished:|\n| - Conclusion 1: The event does not result from, does not follow, and is not caused by the administration of the product as described in the protocol. - Conclusion 2: Lack of an observable relation; the event does not result from, does not follow, and is not caused by the administration of the product as described in the protocol. - Conclusion 3: The product directly (but dose not necessarily) causes the event. Thus, the relationship between the event and the drug is certain.|\n| Causality | Cau | This term describes the likelihood of a causal relationship between an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) or Suspected Product Defect (SPD) and a given pharmaceutical product. The causality assessment is an individual assessment, based on the totality of information available (including the outcome of diagnostic tests). The results of the causality assessment lead to one of the following causality ratings:|\n| - Not likely | - Probably not | - Possible | - Probable | - Definitely | - Certain (proven in court of law or based on evidence of a medical and forensic nature) |\n| Duration | Dur | The evaluation of the duration of a drug effect is a measure of effectiveness when a drug is used in accordance with its indication in a clinical context that does not change over a preset period of time and duration.|\n| End of Treatment | EOTE | Measured from the first administration to the date of the last administration of a study drug.|\n| Efficacy | EF | Efficacy is a measurable or quantifiable benefit of treatment in disease or health care and is measured by assessing various levels of response, for example, changes in the total number of cells or changes in the total amount of protein in a patient before and after treatment.|\n| Effectiveness | EF | Effectiveness is a measurable or quantifiable benefit of treatment in disease or health care and is assessed by an assessment of a range of clinical endpoints, for instance the reduction of pain, anxiety, or the number of relapse in disease patients.|\n| Exposure | Expo | Exposure to a drug (or medical device) for a prespecified period (treatment duration).|\n| Investigational Site | Inst | An actual site at which investigational drug and/or medical device will be administered.|\n| Investigational Product | InInv | The drug and/or medical device that is investigated in the study.|\n| Investigational Site | InvSt | One or more individual investigator sites (may include an institution(s), country etc.).|\n| Instructive | Inst | A term used to describe",

On the last day of the study subjects were weighed, completed a 24-h dietary recall and the Profile of Mood States questionnaire. Their BP was also measured and blood samples were obtained for assessment of total protein, electrolytes, lipid profile, hepatic markers, plasma glucose, and insulin (HPI), plasma leptin, thyroid stimulating hormone, and lipid peroxidation (LPO).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTotal body water and fat percentages, as well as systolic and diastolic BPs decreased in the HPLC, while total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs) and LPO increased in the HCLP. Weight, fat mass (FM), HPI, serum alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) decreased in the HPLC, while leptin and TSHs increased. The HCLP subjects had higher total protein, chloride, and calcium than the HPLC subjects. HDL-cholesterol decreased significantly in both groups. There was no change in plasma glucose in response to both diets. There were no significant differences in the mood states of both groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this study suggest that at least during a short-term HC diet, the HPLC diet is characterized by more desirable changes in markers of body composition, insulin sensitivity, lipids and glucose homeostasis, BP, hepatic markers and total protein. <EOD> Improvement of the performance of p\u2010type SiNW FETs using self\u2010passivated nanowires by forming self\u2010organized silicon oxide\nSi nanowire (SiNW) field\u2010effect transistors (FETs) fabricated by using an N\u2010type Si nanowire (SiNW) as a nanotransporting channel are regarded as the most promising candidates for next\u2010generation electronics due to the advantages of high electrical conductivity and large surface\u2010to\u2010volume ratio. However, SiNWs typically grown by vapor\u2013liquid\u2013solid (VLS) mechanism are p\u2010type in nature because of the presence of a thick Si core/shell structure due to the lack of the surface passivation, and the fabrication of p\u2010type SiNW FETs has been a great challenge so far. Here, we report high\u2010quality p\u2010type SiNWs and p\u2010type SiNW FETs fabricated by using a self\u2010organized silicon oxide (SOS) as a nanotemplate for Si crystal growth. An SOS substrate composed of a monocrystalline Si core and a SiO2 shell has been reported previously, which is capable of self\u2010passivating the Si NW surface of the SiNWs grown on it. In this article, the SiNW grown on the SOS substrate has been shown to possess an excellent electrical performance, which originates from both of the unique structural and physiochemical properties of the SOS template, including the self\u2010passivated and chemically homogeneous shell layer, the uniform amorphous silica core and the high electrical conductivity of silicic acid liquid. The fabricated p\u2010type SiNW FET without surface treatments shows an on\u2013off current ratio of 109, and is comparable to that of a p\u2010type SiNW FET with a surface thermal oxide.

Three commercially manufactured vehicles were used to evaluate the GPA: the General Motors Geo Metro, the Ford Escort-6V and the Ford Tempo-2.7L. The Geo Metro met Euro emission limit criteria. The Ford Escort failed to meet Euro 2b.0 emission limits for the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Tier I test for oxides of CO and hydrocarbons (HC). The Ford Tempo failed to meet Euro criteria. The test vehicles were operated using a variety of engine control settings and fuel grades to ensure that maximum source dependence would be measured. The performance evaluation of GPA 11A and GPA 836C included 20 different source compositions and seven other types of error sources including the use of a 1 L calibrator.

The effect of each error source on the calibration of the instruments was evaluated and the instrument error components were identified as source-dependent, systematic instrument errors; these errors were identified as the source of approximately 5% to 10% of the bias in measurement of the source-dependent errors. <EOD> Influence of Different Preparation Methods and Different Forms of Garlic Extract on the Antioxidant Properties and Cholesterol Reducing Potential\nThe present study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant properties of alcoholic extracts, aqueous extracts and oleoresins of garlic (Allium sativum Linn.) prepared using different techniques (hot, cold etc.) and in different forms (bulb, powder, whole plant, leaves etc.) and to assess their potential to reduce cholesterol concentration in HepG2 cells. The results have indicated that the ethanolic extracts produced by hot and cold maceration have shown significant (p < 0.05) antioxidant activities. Oleoresins prepared using the cold maceration technique have also shown significant antioxidant activities. Antioxidant activities and cholesterol reducing potentials of all the samples were also assessed using GC\u2013MS. On further analysis, the oleoresin samples were identified having good antioxidant potentials. The present study indicates the different extracts and forms of garlic preparations to have good protective effect against oxidative stress. The study also indicates that the cholesterol-reducing potential of garlic may be attributed to both total phenolics and flavonoid contents due to the presence of some active phytochemicals. The cholesterol reducing effect of alcoholic extracts may be attributed to its active component, the diallyl disulfide. <EOD> Comparison of the in vitro immunomodulating effects on murine and human lymphocytes and on murine fibroblasts of two distinct types of phenytoin esters\nDifferent species differences in in vitro effects of phenytoin esters on immune responses may be responsible for the disparate species\u2010specific antitumor effects of phenytoin esters.

Of 2867 patients, 37 were diagnosed with SMS with severe osteolytic destruction, vertebral compression fracture, and spinal instability. One patient was ultimately excluded due to incomplete medical records, leaving 36 patients for the study. SBRT was initiated in May 2017. Spinal instability was diagnosed based on bony involvement of the spinous processes, osteolytic destruction, and sagittal-oblique vertebral compression fracture. Compressive fractures were classified as types A (bone density not reduced), B (reduced density of <1000 Hounsfield units ), and C (reduced density of >1000 HU). Bony involvement was classified into two grades: grade 1 (spinous process) and grade 2 (transverse process, vertebral body, or pedicle). The follow-up period was from SBRT to the occurrence of adverse events until December 31, 2022.

Causes of poor sperm DNA integrity include unhealthy lifestyles such as smoking and exposure to gonadotoxins, as well as, obesity, varicoceles, infections, advanced paternal age and systemic disorders. An increase in DNA fragmentation in sperm has been linked to lower fertilisation rate, poorer quality embryos, lower pregnancy rate, and high miscarriages rate.\nThe best way for sperm selection and processing in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) should be noninvasive and cost-effective. It should also make it possible to identify high-quality spermatozoa and produce more favorable results in terms of pregnancy and live birth rates.7 Meanwhile, the microfluidic sperm separation technology is a less expensive and less invasive alternative.

The amount of money a person receives in assistance, however, should not only cover his or her out-of-pocket medical costs, but should also cover other expenses. Thus, if a person's income is such that they qualify for assistance, they should be able to survive on what they are given. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different strategies for determining how much money low-income individuals in the United States make. As a result, this study aimed to increase the amount of coverage provided by health care reform without compromising the well-being of the poor.Methods: Using the data of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2002 to 2010 for a survey sample of 948,427 respondents, a logistic regression analysis was conducted. The dependent variable was dichotomized as to be low-income-receiving subsidies-or non-low-income. The independent variables were sex, age, education level, marital status, size of household, health insurance, health status, and the type of coverage.Results: In terms of household characteristics, marital status and education level were found to have a positive but marginal effect on health insurance.

Skill in archery is defined as the ability to shoot an arrow to a given target in a certain time span with accuracy. The discipline is described as a three-phase (the stance, the drawing and the sighting) movement. Shooting can be divided these phases into six: bow hold, drawing, full draw, aiming, release and follow-through. Each of these phases represented a stable sequence of movements and was ideal for studying the motor control and skill acquired during this voluntary kinematic process. An archer pushes the bow with an extended arm, which is statically held in the direction of the target, while the other arm exerts a dynamic pulling of the bowstring from the beginning of the drawing phase, until the release is dynamically executed. The release phase must be well balanced and highly reproducible to achieve commendable results in a competition. The bowstring is released when an audible impulse is received from a device called clicker that is used as a draw length check. Each arrow can be drawn to an exact distance and a standard release can be obtained using the device. The clicker is reputed to improve the archer's score and used by all target archers. The archer should react to the clicker as quickly as possible. In particular, a repeated contraction and relaxation strategy in the forearm and pull finger muscles should be developed for this reason. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of stabilization and stabilization-related parameters on shooting performance at the cervical, lumbal and scapular levels in archery athletes.\n\nOfficial Title\n=================#\n\nOk\u00e7uluk Sporcular\u0131nda Stabilizasyonun ve Stabilizasyonla Ili\u015fkili Parametreler\u0130n At\u0131\u015f Performans\u0131na Olumlu Etkisinin Servikal, Lumbal ve Skapular Seviyede Incelenmesi\n\nConditions\n=================#\n\nAthletic Injuries, Instability, Joint\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n=================#\n* Other: shooting performance\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------#\nInclusion Criteria: healty athletes who have been professionally engaged in archery for at least 1 year using same type of equipment(compound or recurve) being volunteer\nExclusion Criteria: who have orthopedic or neurological problems in last one year having structural or functional scoliosis no surgical operations BMI>30 kg/m2\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n=================#\nMinimum Age: 10 Years\nMaximum Age: 18 Years\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n=================#\nAll\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n=================#\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n\n\nStudy Plan\n=================#\n\nHow is the study designed?\n----------------------------\n\nArms and Interventions\n\n| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |\n| --- | --- |\n| Good shooting performance<br>archery athletes who had 589 and more | Other: shooting performance<br>* collecting total points after 72 target shootings done<br>|\n| Bad shooting performance<br>archery athletes who had 588 and less | Other: shooting performance<br>* collecting total points after 72 target shootings done<br>|\n\nWhat is the study measuring?\n=================#\nPrimary Outcome Measures\n\n| Outcome Measure | Measure Description | Time Frame |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| cervical stabilization | cervical stabilization assess with craniocervical flexion test. | baseline | \n| lumbar stabilization grade | lumbar stabilization asses with sahrmann's core stability test and will grade according to test outcome. | baseline | \n| lumbar stabilizator muscle contraction | the athlete perform abdominal",

We retrospectively reviewed the files of all patients with psoriasis followed in the outpatient Dermatology Department from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2011. One hundred and 13 psoriasis patients were initially selected, and 112 of them had arthritis. At the time of diagnosis, patients were subdivided according to PsA presence, and a correlation between the presence of arthritis and clinical and laboratory findings was established. Statistical analysis was performed by Chi 2 test. We followed the same methodology for those patients who were free of arthritis at the time of diagnosis. In both groups, the presence of arthritis was recorded according to the year of follow-up with psoriasis. The frequency of PsA in patients with psoriasis was 11.5%. Diabetes was 500% more frequent in arthritic patients. Cardiomyopathy had a higher prevalence in the non-arthritic group, being 2.7% and 1.5%, respectively. There was a significant association between PsA and metabolic disease in the group of arthritic patients (P < 0.001). The presence of arthritis at the time of diagnosis of psoriasis does not affect the prognostic and overall survival.

Although age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an age-related disease, the concentration of NO in the aqueous humor of patients with AMD has not been determined. In this study, aqueous humor was obtained from 11 AMD patients undergoing aphakic operation. The cGMP levels in the aqueous humor of AMD patient was examined using a cGMP radioimmunoassay kit. The amounts of NO in the aqueous humor from AMD patients were determined using the Griess reaction.

The cGMP levels were correlated with the amount of NO in the aqueous humor of AMD patients. <EOD> Internalization of bacteria by retinal pigment epithelium: an additional potential mechanism for endotoxin-induced uveitis.\nPURPOSE\nPrevious studies have shown that endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) can be exacerbated by prior retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and complement components (CCs). The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that this exacerbating effect is due to the internalization of gram-negative bacteria by RPE cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSheep RPE cells were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of CCs, and these treated RPE cells were then incubated with a fluorescently labeled gram-negative bacterium, Proteus mirabilis. After extensive washing, fluorescence was measured in pellets by fluorometry, cell-associated fluorescence by flow cytometry, and intracellular versus free bacteria by confocal microscopy. Cells were also exposed to FITC-labeled dextran (3 to 500 kDa molecular size) and observed by confocal microscopy to examine the effect of LPS treatment on RPE cell monolayer permeability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRPE cell treatment with LPS and CCs resulted in increased bacterial internalization compared with control RPE cells. RPE cells treated with CCs prior to bacterial incubation also showed a concentration- and time-dependent increase in intracellular bacteria. RPE cell permeability to albumin, as measured by the leakage of intracellular fluorescein-labeled dextran, was not affected by LPS treatment when compared with control cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data suggest that LPS uptake, via complement primed RPE cells, can lead to internalization of gram-negative bacteria, a potential cause of exacerbation of EIU. As such, endotoxin-induced uveitis may be a multifactorial disease resulting, in part, from LPS-induced activation of resident RPE cells. <EOD> Preparation of the Methylated DNA Immunoassay Using Monoclonal Antibody AE3 for Evaluation of Apoptosis\nAn immunoassay using methylated DNA and a monoclonal antibody (AE3) against the triethylene glycol moiety of the N-methyl group of the methylated DNA of DNA fragmentation-induced cultured cells was developed for estimation of apoptosis.

Cancer cells that make too much HER2 may grow more quickly and are more likely to spread to other parts of the body as metastases, including the central nervous system. Trotabresib is part of a family of drugs called BET inhibitors. Trotabresib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Vinorelbine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body. Giving trotabresib and vinorelbine may increase in the anti-cancer activity of vinorelbine when used in combination with radiation (radiotherapy).",

        "summary": "More than 30% of Black women with obesity binge eat. Binge eating may increase the risk for the development of metabolic syndrome and binge-eating-disorder (BED), which is associated with severe obesity. Though several effective treatments for binge eating exist, Black women have not fared well. Not only has their inclusion in treatment trials been limited, but when participating, they are more likely to drop out, and/or lose less weight, compared to their White counterparts. Furthermore, treatment for binge eating is often not available in primary care and community-based settings places where Black women are more likely to receive treatment for their eating and weight-related concerns. Currently, there is scant intervention research to treat binge eating in Black women. With the highest rates of obesity (57%) nationally, Black women are in need of culturally-relevant treatments for binge eating and weight gain prevention. Given the established relationship between frequent binge eating and subsequent weight gain, addressing binge eating among Black women with obesity is imperative.",

        "summary": "Dietary nitrate supplementation, administered in the form of nitrate-rich beetroot juice, has been shown to improve exercise performance and may have more pronounced effects on exercise that requires high-power and high-velocity muscle contraction such as weightlifting and body-mass resisted exercise (i.e, resistance exercise). However, limited data are available that have examined the potential performance enhancing effect of beetroot juice in resistance exercise. Moreover, there is no information on the dose of nitrate required for performance enhancing effects during resistance exercise which limits its widespread use to enhance performance. Therefore, the investigators will assess if supplementing the diet with nitrate-rich beetroot juice impacts resistance exercise performance (e.g., power, velocity), when compared to supplementing the diet with nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (i.e. placebo). The investigators will also investigate the dose-response effect of beetroot juice on resistance exercise performance by providing a low, moderate, and high nitrate dose of concentrated beetroot juice. The results of this study will improve understanding of whether beetroot juice influences resistance exercise performance and will provide insight on whether different doses of beetroot juice influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation on resistance exercise performance. Together, these data will guide supplementation strategies for enhancing resistance exercise performance.",

Beetroot juice supplementation could augment resistance exercise performance since previous ingestion studies show a heightened post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery (PCr), oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbohydrate oxidation compared to nitrate-free beetroot juice. Importantly, these improvements were evident across both lower (e.g., leg extension) and upper (e.g., dumbbell incline press) body resistance exercise, which highlights the potential of nitrate supplementation as a means to maximizing performance in a wide array of exercise tasks. However, the dose-response effects of dietary nitrate on resistance exercise performance are underinvestigated with previous research only investigating high doses of beetroot juice (76 mmol nitrate; 1-2.5 L) in healthy, endurance trained males. In summary of the evidence, dietary nitrate supplementation may provide a simple means for improving resistance exercise performance, however, a large degree of uncertainty exists regarding the dose-response effect of beetroot juice on resistance exercise performance. Thus, the primary purpose of this study will be to compare the effect of differing doses of dietary nitrate (low, moderate, and high) on neuromuscular performance (e.g., jump height, countermovement jump kinematics, velocity, power) during an acute resistance exercise bout. An elevated dose of dietary nitrate will also be included to determine if a ceiling effect occurs for performance enhancement. In addition to this, secondary goals of the study will compare the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation on resistance exercise performance between healthy, healthy, and resistance trained individuals. Finally, the study will evaluate the influence of dietary nitrate on indices of physiological stress (e.g., heart rate, rate of perceived, muscle pain) during resistance exercise.\n\nSummary: [/INST]\n\n\nAlternatives to the study: \n\nBeetroot juice is the most potent elicitor of exercise-induced plasma nitrate\nBeetroot Juice supplementation has been shown to acutely enhance endurance exercise performance, particularly at exercise durations lasting greater than 10 min, through improved oxygen extraction and increased PCr resynthesis. Recently, beetroot juice supplementation has also been investigated before an acute bout of power and resistance exercise, where it heightened exercise performance in anaerobically-dominant movements such as sprinting and weightlifting. However, the relationship between dietary nitrate and resistance exercise performance is relatively unexplored, with previous research suggesting elevated dietary nitrate intake has no influence on resistance exercise performance. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the effects of different doses of dietary nitrate (low, moderate, high) on resistance exercise performance in healthy, untrained, and resistance trained individuals. We hypothesize that a low dose of dietary nitrate (7 mmol) will not enhance performance, a moderate dose of dietary nitrate (23 mmol) will enh",

Approximately 3-4 liters of carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation (inflating the abdominal cavity with carbon dioxide gas) is applied and the intra-abdominal pressure is adjusted to 10-20 mmHg. Intra-abdominal pressure is continuously measured by pressure monitoring, which is routinely performed during laparoscopic procedures. The applied intra-abdominal pressure is determined by the surgical team and the most optimal value that creates pneumoperitoneum for the patient is preferred. Abdominal compartment syndrome can be seen due to abdominal hypertension at intra-abdominal pressure values above 20 mmHg. Both pressure values aimed to be applied in this study are applied in laparoscopic cholecystectomy operations and do not cause any harm to the patient and their superiority to each other has not been determined. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy operation is routinely performed with 12 mmHg or 14 mmHg pressures in our operating room. Both pressure values applied to the patients intraoperatively are within safe ranges. The mechanical power of ventilation (MP) is the amount of energy transferred per unit time from the mechanical ventilator to the respiratory system. Although this energy is mainly used to overcome airway resistance and respiratory system compliance, some of it directly affects the lung tissue, potentially causing ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). MP is a summary variable that includes several components, including tidal volume (VT ), peak pressure (Ppeak), driving pressure, and respiratory rate (RR). These components; requires that the mechanical ventilator be adjusted so that the least amount of energy is transferred to the respiratory system per unit time for each patient in order to prevent ventilator-associated lung injury. In the researches; a relationship between mechanical power (MP) and complications such as ventilator-associated lung injury (VILI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been found. The findings suggest that the mechanical force applied to the lungs should be reduced during intraoperative ventilation in patients undergoing major surgery. In adult patients undergoing general anesthesia during major surgical operations, higher patient exposure to ventilation as measured by higher mechanical power; it has been associated with increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications and acute respiratory failure in the first 7 days of the postoperative period. In the results obtained in the published studies; increased mechanical strength has been associated with increased in-hospital mortality and higher hospital stay and higher ICU follow-up requirement. The airway pressure of patients who undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been shown to increase in the intraperitoneal pressure group in the intra-operative period and to improve in the postoperative follow-up period with the intervention of the mechanical ventilator in patients operated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the present study, this finding will constitute a basis for the study. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the short / long-term mechanical strength and respiratory mechanics values of the patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with 12 mmHg and 14 mmHg intra-abdominal pressure applications.\n\nOfficial Title\nClinicaltrials.gov Title: Evaluation of the Effect of Two Different Intra-abdominal Pressure Applications on Mechanical Power in Cases Undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy\n\n\nSearch Date\n2022/07/10\n\nInclusion criteria\n------------------------\nAges Ages \u2265 18 years Exclusion criteria\n------------------------\nAges < 18 years\n\nGender\n\n------------------------\nMales\n\nGender",

In text mining, the first step is to determine the general terms describing the text, e.g. title, keywords, abstract or headings, and next the more detailed ones with regard to the content of the article - e.g. keywords phrases, which can be the subject of a query for a specific database. It is advisable to find your keywords before creating a paper abstract form, because keywords phrases are used for indexing purposes in many databases. Thus, the main question is to identify the most important keywords for the title.

A number of agents have been tested in cell culture assays and even the majority of the most promising drug candidates have failed in clinical trials. A strategy currently used in medicine and drug discovery to select for drugs with desired properties is to design drugs bearing multiple pharmacophores.

We found that introduction of ethyl substituents into the ester moiety improved antiproliferative activity. We considered that we could improve the antileukemia activity of compound 5 by increasing the length and lipophilicity of alkyl substituents on the N 1 nitrogen atom.

This condition is induced by oral biofilm and exacerbated by increased levels of sex steroid hormones characteristic of pregnancy. Strict bacterial plaque control with both professional and home oral hygiene is essential. Manual toothbrushes require a more specific manual technique for women, while sonic electric toothbrushes, due to their ease of use, might be an excellent for oral individual prophylaxis. Therefore, the question of which type of manual or electric toothbrush might be more effective in reducing gingival inflammation in pregnant women is still unresolved.

Its pathogenesis involves a deficiency of angiogenic or inflammatory factors that impairs neovascularization and contributes to the thrombotic events (6). Management of LV lesions is complex and not well defined. LV thrombosis may arise acute or chronically, can be localized or systemic, and may be transient or persistent (5). The majority of clinical studies have assessed the benefits of systemic anticoagulation (eg, direct oral anticoagulants  or low-molecular-weight heparin) for the management of LV (6). Other therapies have included topical therapies (eg, anti-TNF or cytotoxic drugs), immunosuppression, platelet suppression, or hyperbaric oxygen (4,9). <EOD> Neuronal expression of the glycine transporter 2 in rat brain: An immunohistochemical study\nIt is well known that glycine is one of the transmitters in central nervous system.

This study was carried out at 2 large surgical centers.\n\n\nDESIGN\nProspective randomized study of 2 clinical scoring systems: 1) Pediatric Nutrition Support and Metabolism, Hospitalized Children's Assessment of Nutritional Difficulties (Hospitalized Charts Assessment of Nutritional Difficulties-H CAND-1), and 2) Diphasic Feeds (DIF-) Candidate Index Scoring System for Evaluation of H CAND (DIF-CI).\n\n\nSETTING\nTwo large surgical/intensive care units.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nA consecutive group of 465 hospitalized children aged 1 month to 4 years with a diagnosis of acute, severe malnutrition.\n\n\nINTERVENTION\nChildren were randomly assigned to receive exclusive diphasic feeding (N = 241) or traditional high-calorie diet combined with trophic feedings (N = 224) over a 10-day observation period. At the completion of feeding for 10 days, patients were scored by using H CAND-1 and DIF-CI.\n\n\nOUTCOMES MEASURED\nOutcomes measured at the end of the 10-day feeding period included the number and severity of feeding complications as measured by the presence and severity of refeeding syndrome.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth H CAND-1 and DIF-CI identified patients who developed complications after prolonged fasting before diphasic feeding. However, H CAND-1 was better in identifying patients in less severe refeeding syndromes, whereas DI-F-CI was better in identifying children in more severe refeeding syndromes. H CAND-1 and DIF-CI were also equally in identifying children with mild refeeding syndromes. The DIF-CI was better able to identify severe refeeding syndromes after 10 days of feeding with diphasic feeds.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nH CAND-1 and DIF-CI were both useful in identifying patients in severe malnutrition with severe refeeding syndromes. However, H CAND-1 was better in identifying children in less severe refeeding syndromes, whereas DIF-CI was better in identifying patients with more severe refeeding syndrome after 10 days of diphasic feeding. <EOD> Dental Caries in 951 Adolescent Prisoners, England 2009/10.\nBACKGROUND\nTo determine the prevalence and extent of dental disease in adolescent offenders in England.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPrison staff in three youth offender institutions in England collected data for 951 16-18-year-old prisoners in 2009/10 according to a pre-published protocol.

Liver damage is a complication of burns, which can happen through liver ischemia, reperfusion injury, and hepatoenhancement through local release and inflammatory mediators. The liver is a major pathway of clearance for most drug and toxins compounds and therefore major organ dysfunctions can happen when drugs or solvents are consumed. A variety of physical treatments are used in physical therapy program for the healing burned patients. Some examples are electromagnetic therapy, laser therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and aquatic therapy..\n[/P1]\n\nMajor issues and problems (Mention also those that need more investigation)\n\n| Issue | Problem Statement |\n| --- | --- |\n| Burns occur mostly in the first few years of life. | Liver enzymes are elevated in approximately 75% of pediatric patients with burns, even when they are not exhibiting hepatic symptoms. Liver enzymes in burned patients have shown a high level of variability, making interpretation of these tests difficult. |\n| Burns occur mostly during the hot months (May to September) as is the summer season. | During the summer months children are more likely to spend time in the sun for longer periods, playing and swimming in the pool. Exercising in the sun and/or swimming in the pool without wearing protective sun-block can raise the risk of burn injuries among children. |\n| In Egypt, burns cases reached 30,000.| In Egypt, about 1100 burn cases occur yearly.|\n| The average monthly temperatures in the Egypt are extremely hot; about as high as 40 degrees. | In Egypt, the average monthly temperatures in the summer season are high; averaging about 32C.|\n| Burns occur mostly in the first 3 years of life. | Approximately 75% of pediatric burns occur in the first three years of life. The mortality rate of burns in young children is highest in infants; the mortality rate is 9.5 times higher than in the elderly.\n| Burn injury is responsible for most of the morbidity in children, and it contributes to a large number of physical disabilities and impaired social life activities as the result of scar contracture and loss of function (especially of the hands). |\n| Children have a decreased tendency towards thermo-tolerance which makes them more susceptible to burn injuries; heat-retaining clothing and protecting their skin with clothing during hot weather can aid in preventing burn injuries. |\n| Children, especially infants, have a decreased rate of sweat gland development compared to the elderly, which make them more susceptible to burn injuries; avoidance of overheating with preventive measures such as cool clothing during hot weather can aid in preventing burn injuries. |\n| Burn injuries among children increase in the summer to fall seasons because of lack of children-oriented preventative strategies during these seasons. |\n| Infants have thin skin and poor vascularity which make them prone to burn injuries; they require careful attention while in the summer seasons. |\n| Child-care centers are places of multiple burn accidents.| Children in day-care centers spend more time out of the home where they are exposed to burn hazards like hot beverages and hot food.|\n| Children less than 6 and children above 6 are the major victims for burn accidents. | Children less than 6 years old and those older than 6 have different caregiver needs during summer months. Children less than 6 years old are cared for by the mother while older children are more likely to be in day-care centers during the summer months. Burns in child-care centers can spread to other children through skin and/or clothing contact; having child-care centers with more heat-retaining equipment such as air conditioners and more spacious spaces during hot summer months can decrease the incidence of burn accidents.\n| The incidence of burn injuries in day-care center burns in children less than 6 is greater than that in children 6",

        "summary": "Over 65% of all lung cancer patients experience significant weight loss fuelled by a catabolic state that is represented by enhanced protein breakdown. The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period. The secondary aim is to investigate the feasibility for the subjects to comply with the study protocol. Lastly, the investigators aim to study the feasibility of gathering data on a number of exploratory parameters that may link nutritional intake to clinically relevant outcomes.",

Apoptotic cell numbers were determined from TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL) data. Changes in total DNA and cell number were determined in retinas labeled with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU). Protein levels were determined by western blot. Quantitative PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of specific oestrogen target genes known to be involved in DNA damage responses and apoptosis in these tissues.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOestrogen induced apoptosis in the avian retina. At 4 h, the numbers of retinal cells positively stained for apoptosis were doubled in E2-treated retinas relative to the control. In addition, we found that E2 stimulated DNA synthesis and retinal cell growth, but only after a delay in growth. After 48 h, cell numbers were significantly higher in E2-treated retinas, and this effect was partially blocked by the oestrogen receptor antagonists. Western blot data demonstrated that the oestrogen receptor subtype alpha (ERalpha), was rapidly up-regulated after a 12-h exposure to E2. Expression levels of the ERalpha were inhibited by ICI 182,780 and fulvestrant. The Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-w), tumour necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha), Fas ligand, osteoprotegerin, cyclin E and CDK-2 were significantly up-regulated in E2-treated retinas at 4 h as compared to the control. Although mRNA levels for some of these genes decreased at 24-48 h in the E2 group, their levels remained significantly higher than those in the control group. Expression levels of cyclin d1 and survivin increased significantly after a 24-h exposure to E2. At E2 concentrations equivalent to that of the chick's natural circulating oestrogen, i.e. 3 x 10(-9) mol/l, proliferative cells were also labelled in the control, an observation that supports the idea that there may be a proliferative effect in the retina of oestrogen-signalling components at low doses. When E2 was co-administered with ICI 182,780, levels of cyclin E, cyclin d1, CDK-2, and survivin mRNAs were inhibited.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nE2 may affect retinal cell proliferation and survival during oestrogen synthesis (3 x 10",

In the first part the investigators will be recruiting 10 patients with MDD-AD and 10 Healthy controls, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each participant will be evaluated by a team of experienced psychiatrists and clinicians, administering structured clinical interviews to assess the presence/absence of axis I and II psychiatric disorders (SCID-I and SCID-II) (first visit). Furthermore, in all subjects the degree of depressive/manic dysintomatology will be measured through the use of clinical scales and psychopathological tests such as:the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery- Asberg Depression rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (second visit; within one week of the first screening visit) . Moreover, additional clinical data will beextrpapted from medical records and interviews with psychiatrists (if available). The investigators will also evaluate the suitability of each participant to undergo the multimodal acquisition of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data with a 7T GE scanner. The neuroimaging session, performed during the third visit (within one month of the second visit) will include: T1-weighted image acquisition: to study the volumetric differences of white and gray matter between subjects in the prefrontal-limbic pathway. fMRI: to assess functional connections between prefrontal cortex and limbic system. 1H-MRS: to study glutamatergic neurotransmission within the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The sequences will be optimized thanks to the 32-channel brain coil (NovaMedical), to reduce artifacts and inhomogeneities in images. The second part of the study will involve murine models. More specifically, to assess whether Pcdh9 deficits affect the number and morphology of excitatory synapses, electron microscopic analyses will be performed in Pcdh9-knockout mice. Glutamatergic signaling will also be studied at the biochemical level: the expression levels of all major glutamate receptor subunits (ionotropic and metabotropic) will be investigated by analyzing cortical protein lysates (total lysates) in adult mice (3-4 months). In addition, to identify finer changes in glutamate receptor expression, their intracellular and surface expression will be analyzed using the BS3 crosslinking assay. The investigators will also proceed in the characterization of the interaction between integrin \u03b23 and Protocadherin9 using co-immunoprecipitation analysis from mouse brain: in case of positive results (at least 3 replicates), further analysis will be conducted to study whether overexpression of integrin \u03b23 or protocadherin9 could compensate for defects in synaptic glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs. In this case, experiments on murine models will be perform to determine whether overexpression of integrin \u03b23 or protocadherin9 could compensate for deficits in glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs.. <EOD> Interactions of tau proteins and actin contribute to tau pathologies\n\n\n\n## Figure s2. co-expression of f-actin induces tau-actin binding.

The disease state was then monitored monthly, and re-treatment was continued for another 12 months if necessary.Results: Four patients responded, including complete remission in 3 patients, while 2 patients remained unresponsive. After the 12 months of treatment, we observed improvement in the blood concentrations of inflammatory markers, blood pressure levels, urine protein levels, and the renal function of the kidneys.Conclusion: Our results indicated that a 12-month course of methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and prednisone or mycophenolate as induction therapy is effective in the treatment of lupus nephritis, especially in patients with low levels of antinuclear antibodies.\n\n# Introduction\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with diverse clinical manifestations and an unpredictable disease course, and can range from mild renal pathology to the most aggressive and destructive renal disease of any of the autoimmune diseases. Renal involvement is detected in 20-70% of all SLE patients, and the prognosis of the disease is related to the severity and type of renal involvement. The main renal manifestation is nephritis. The prognosis of the disease also depends on the presence and type of lesions in the kidney. Dermal lupus nephritis (LN) patients have the least severe prognosis, while patients with mesangial proliferation and membranous LN are more likely to have a worse long-term prognosis. Therefore, LN remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among SLE patients.\nThe current treatment of LN has not achieved satisfactory results. The treatment for LN is based on a disease-modifying-anti-rheumatic-drug (DMARD), and combined use of prednisone and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil in children. Although immunosuppressive therapy is effective in treating mild renal lesions, the mortality and recurrence rates are relatively high in severe renal involvement. Refractory LN often fails to improve with conventional treatment, and the use of new drugs has also been limited because of adverse reactions or contraindications.\nBased on the use of intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) and oral cyclophosphamide as treatment, the pediatric rheumatology clinic at the Shanghai Children's Medical Center has created a new treatment regimen for children with refractory multi-system organ disease activity. During the process of treatment and follow-up for patients, we found that some of the patients had refractory LN, and that the children with refractory LN had a good response to treatment that included steroid therapy combined with methotrexate and mycophenolate. In 3 years of treatment and follow-up, the patients' hematuria and proteinuria disappeared. After 1 year of treatment, the concentration of anti-nuclear antibodies decreased.\n\n# Materials and methods\n\n# Ethics statement\nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Children's Medical Center in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

The current study aims to address this issue. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane library were searched up to February 2015, with language and article design restriction as no limitations. To examine whether the prevalence of hip OA in women is higher than in men, we extracted data from relevant epidemiological studies, which were included in 19 out of 14,879 articles (after screening all initially retrieved articles) for meta-analysis. The total number of participants involved in all included studies was 1,310,287, and the total number of participants with hip OA was 490,750 (628,047 hip joints). The combined prevalence of hip OA in women was 2.84% (95% CI 2.01-3.68) and in men 1.96% (95% CI.1.12-2.80). The incidence of hip OA in women was higher than in men (OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.26-2.12, z = 3.617, p < 0.001), and the result was robust in multiple sensitivity analyses. Meta-regression demonstrated that the prevalence of hip OA in women decreased with increasing age (p < 0.001). We conclude that the incidence of hip OA in women is higher than in men, and thus, gender should be taken into account when diagnosing and treating hip OA. A trend showing higher incidence in women might be explained by post-menopause hormonal status.\n\n# Introduction\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is considered as a common chronic degenerative disease leading to joint degradation and chronic pain.

Currently, detection is based on microbiological culture, which although definitive is slow and unsuitable for large-scale or epidemiologic studies. Bacterial detection using fluorescence in situ hybridization has recently been demonstrated to be sensitive, but generally requires cell filtration and hybridization incubation. Using a similar concept, but with a simplified detection approach, we evaluated a non-radioactive and easy-to-perform proximity-hybridization assay for the rapid detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, an enteric pathogen and etiologic agent of foodborne disease. The assay used labeled probes and an immunoassay detection format incorporating a unique signal-enhancement molecule, a peroxidase enzyme substrate, and luminol chemiluminescence as a reporter system. The assay detected E. coli O157:H7 in pure culture and in mixed-microbial suspensions in a 96 well plate format (1 CFU/10 CFU/mL). The detection assay was optimized to take 2 to 4 h to complete, including DNA extraction. Signal intensity correlated well with increasing concentrations of target cells and decreased linearly with the dilution of a mixed-microbial suspension. The assay successfully detected as little as 1 CFU/mL in Escherichia coli O157:H7 mixed with common river waterborne and foodborne microbes, Salmonella enterica, and the foodborne pathogen Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Finally, the assay is sensitive and specific to E. coli O157:H7 in a lake and river water matrix spiked with this strain, and other fecology strain-specific test organisms. The study, as opposed to other pathogenic microbe applied approach is required for human biological detection methods (i assay to assessments for O15710 CFUr organisms study design method, and applied as the assay and detection.

IHNC symptoms cause major changes to basic functions, such as: being unable to talk; severe swallowing problems with a high choking risk; breathing difficulties requiring a hole in the neck (tracheostomy). The manner of death can be highly traumatic and frightening e.g. catastrophic bleeding from the neck. Despite this poor outlook, little is known about patients' needs in the last year of life. However, IHNC patients have more emergency hospital visits compared with other cancer groups. Patients from poorer areas are more likely to die in hospital. Furthermore, head and neck cancer (HNC) units are centralised, with access to specialist services dependent on where the patient lives.\nThe researcher wishes to understand 'stress points' in the patients' journey, where things do not go as planned, identify priorities for change and develop patient-led solutions.\nThere are two main parts to this work, occurring over 21-months across Yorkshire, Northwest and Northeast England.\nA series of up to three interviews with approximately 25 IHNC patients and their families, along with group discussions with healthcare workers involved in IHNC care.

At present, spinal degenerative diseases caused by body degeneration have become the most common type. With the continuous deepening of the research on spinal degenerative diseases and the continuous development, update and promotion of minimally invasive surgery technology and instruments, minimally invasive surgery has attracted more and more attention of spine surgeons due to its advantages of rapid recovery, small trauma and fewer complications. The core of endoscopic spinal surgery is nerve root decompression. The procedure is centered on the nerve roots, which can be damaged with the slightest carelessness. According to statistics, the incidence of nerve root injury under spinal endoscope is 1.8-2.5%. Most of the injuries include the stimulation and edema of the nerve root during the operation, which may lead to postoperative sensory retardation and motor weakness, which will damage the patient's physical function and reduce overall satisfaction. The intraoperative nerve exploration is time-consuming and critical, and the variability of the patient's nerve anatomy will also add difficulties to the operation. A real-time auxiliary intraoperative nerve identification technology is necessary. With the progress of optical technology, fluorescent-guided surgery has shown considerable prospects in assisting in identifying nerves. It has been applied to clinical research of thoracic sympathetic ganglion, facial nerve, phrenic nerve and pelvic nerve.\n\nOfficial Title\n________________\nClinical Application of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging to Assist Identification of Nerve Roots in Endoscopic Spinal Surgery\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nDisc Herniation\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Indocyanine Green<br>* Preoperatively, a single dose of intravenous indocyanine green is administered<br>* Other names: ICG;Device: Fluorescence imaging<br>* Use of a spinal endoscopic fluorescent imaging system to assist surgeons in identifying and protecting nerve roots intraoperatively<br>|\n\nSites\n-----------------\n\nBeijing Chao Xiang Hospital\n\n\n\n| Primary Outcome Measures | Measure Description | Time Frame |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fluorescence imaging rate of nerve roots | Number of the nerve roots with fluorescent imaging in the experimental group/Total nerve roots in the experimental group\u00d7100% | Intraoperative | \n| Fluorescence signal ratio of nerve root to back fluorescence | Nerve root fluorescence intensity/Background fluorescence intensity | Immediately postoperative | \n| Time taken to find the nerve root endoscopically | Time from opening the ligamentum flavum to finding the nerve root in spinal endoscopic procedures | Intraoperative | \n\nSecondary Outcome Measures\n\n| Outcome Measure | Measure Description | Time Frame |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ICG-related adverse reactions |  | Immediately after ICG administration to 30 min after administration | \n| Visual analogue pain scale (Visual analogue scale, VAS) | The VAS pain score uses the VAS scale, with end 0 being no pain, graded 1-4 being mild pain, 5-6 being moderate pain, 7-9 being severe pain, and end 10 being unbearable pain.

        "summary": "Background: Parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) have a tendency to provide insufficient caregiving and often need parenting support to prevent neglect and child removal. However, parents with IDDs are not provided with appropriate support, and there is a lack of evidence-based programmes tailored to these parents' needs. Parenting Young Children (PYC) is a home-based parenting programme developed for parents with IDDs. PYC has shown promising clinical results in interview-based studies, but there is no evidence of its effectiveness. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the PYC programme for improving parenting in parents with IDDs where there is risk of child neglect. The study will include a quantitative evaluation, a process evaluation, and a qualitative evaluation of the children's and parents' perspectives on participating in PYC.\nMethods: The quantitative evaluation will have a multi-centre, non-randomised, comparative study design. Eligible for participation are parents with IDDs who have children aged 0-9 years living at home and who are assessed as needing tailored parenting support. Thirty parents receiving PYC and thirty parents receiving treatment as usual (TAU) will be recruited from Swedish municipal social services. Outcome variables will be examined before and after the intervention, with a follow-up 6 months after completing the intervention. The primary outcome will be goal-attainment in parenting skills, and secondary outcomes will be parental self-efficacy and children's wellbeing. Interview methods will be used to explore the perspectives of parents and children in the PYC group.\nDiscussion: This study is motivated by the need for evidence-based support for parents with IDDs, and it focuses on upholding the centrality of child-caregiver relationships and family preservation, as well as children's rights and the rights of people with disabilities. Social services have expressed ethical concerns with employing a randomized design for this vulnerable group, and this study will therefore evaluate PYC in a non-randomized comparative study.",

The Parent-Child Interaction module focuses on the parent-child relationship and interaction skills such as parents' responsiveness to the child's signals, giving the child attention and encouragement, and supporting prosocial behaviour. The Child Care Skills and Safety module targets safety at home and the parent's caring skills (e.g. food, health, and hygiene). Checklists are adapted to each parent in order to support the PYC practitioner and the parent. The programme is compiled in a manual that includes work tasks",

The PWS type of clinical manifestations (except for a specific body habitus) was due to an apparently balanced  reciprocal translocation carrier state. PWS was excluded due to other chromosomal causes (deletion 15q11-13). Therefore, the karyotype was checked by a molecular cytogenetic approach. A novel complex chromosome translocation , which is apparently de novo, was detected. The clinical features of the patient are compared with the 40 known patients carrying the der(10)t(1;10)(q21.3;p11.2--q11.2). The clinical spectrum in translocation patients with 10p duplication is remarkably varied, but some distinct features are common: body habitus of the facial shape, short stature, abnormal ears, hand malformation, urogenital abnormalities, and mental retardation in the mild form. <EOD> Molecular basis of amylin resistance in transgenic mice expressing a mutant human amylin gene.\nAmylin (AMY) has been implicated as a beta-cell secretory peptide and is present in pancreatic beta-cells. The peptide has been found to be deficient in patients with the neurodegenerative disorder of type 2 diabetes. We report that transgenic mice, expressing a mutant human AMY gene which causes the disease, have a significant defect in glucagon stimulated-secretion of AMY, resulting in pancreatic beta-cell dedifferentiation. These results provide insight into the biochemical defect that accompanies AMY resistance in sporadic type 2 diabetes mellitus. <EOD> \nGastric cancer (GC) remains a highly aggressive neoplasia, particularly at an advanced stage, which often presents several resistances to treatment, being considered one of the major public health problems. One of the hallmarks of cancer is angiogenesis, which allows the growth, invasion, and cancer progression of blood vessels. The development of these vessels occurs mainly in proinflammatory environments. In GC, the proinflammatory environment is present as part of the chronic immune response to inflammation at the host-pathogen level. On the other hand, tumor cells produce cytokines, which, along with the high expression of angiogenic factors, mediates the generation of the angiogenic phenotype of tumor endothelial cells. Thus, this review will focus on the immune-angiogenic environment of the tumor microenvironment, which is related not only to the prognosis and development of GC but also to neoangiogenesis, which is a strategy for successful treatment in patients and may be used as a new target of potential antiangiogenic therapies to treat and prevent progression to the disease. <EOD> Effect of exercise on postmicturition sensation in the neurogenic bladder.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo test the hypothesis that exercise improves bladder sensation in spinal cord injured patients.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRandomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial of exercise and placebo.\n\n\nSETTING\nUrinary clinic, rehabilitation hospital.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nTwelve men who had a spinal cord injury more than 6 mo before entrance and had chronic urinary tract infection.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nSubjects in each phase were exercised or received placebo treadmill exercise following a 2-d placebo run-in period and washout of antimuscarinic and antihistaminic treatment.

Ovariectomized Wistar rats were pretreated with progesterone, administered orally with either 1 or 0.1 mg of the drug, or normal saline for 6 days before sacrificing. The ovariectomized (normal) were used as positive and vehicle (normal saline) as negative control. Following euthanasia, blood and uterine tissue samples were collected for biochemical and histological analyses. A 2-factor fractional (A 2 B 2 ) design was applied, and blood and uterine estrogen concentration and histology were used to predict the estrogenic effect of BCO. The results were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 software. BCO caused a significant increase in blood estro-gen, uterine estrogen concentration, uterine wet weight and uterine index compared with control (P<0.05). The drug showed 19.99 times more potent than normal saline in uterine wet weight and 0.0205 times weaker than estradiol in uterine estrogen concentration. The high and low doses of BCO increased the effector variable to 163% and 165%, respectively whereas, the response factor of estradiol to the two doses of the drug (13.23 and 12.34 g) was very low (P>0.05). The ANOVA for the BCO-induced uterine wet weight was significant and the effect of the drug, 289.2% and 304%, was high. Moreover, the ANOVA for the BCO-induced uterine estrogen concentration showed that the drug effect was high (244.7%), but not significant. In conclusion, BCO displayed significant estrogenic effect, especially, in uterine wet weight, which is very important in the maintenance of pregnancy. The findings suggest that the drug could substitute for the currently used hormonal contraceptives. <EOD> Infections in kidney and liver transplant recipients.\nPatients who undergo kidney or liver transplantation are significantly more likely than are the general population to develop serious infections with serious antimicrobial resistance or for which there is limited antimicrobial treatment options.

Management of infections in kidney and liver transplant patients is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach to antimicrobial stewardship.

Patients filled out a standard form that contained questions regarding urogenital symptoms and proctitis symptomatology. Results of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and uroflowmetric measurements were recorded. Patients with any significant urological disease, including prostate cancer, were excluded from the study. The study population was divided into four groups: (a) No urinary and no proctitis symptoms, (b) urinary symptoms and No proctitis symptoms; (c) No urological symptoms but proctitis symptoms, and (d) urogenital and proctitis symptoms. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0. For the analysis of the data, c 2 tests and Student's t-test were used to compare urological symptoms in the groups as appropriate.Conclusion:An association between proctitis symptoms history and LUTS (voiding and storage symptoms) exists.

LUTS can be simply defined as a combination of symptoms including frequency, urgency, nocturia, weak stream, hesitancy, intermittent flow, painful micturation, straining, incomplete emptying and terminal dribbling   Urinary frequency as a major symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia, Abrams     Medical Management of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Younger Adult Men, Eckstrand  . These symptoms may be related with the physiological changes that are frequently seen in older men and women or may be the results of other systemic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease and cigarette smoking. The symptoms can be classified into \"irritative\" or \"obstructive\", both of which can cause a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.\nSeveral mechanisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of lower urinary tract dysfunctions, and several risk factors for these syndromes have been established. Etiology of LUTS, however, is not always clearly understood, as several systems can be affected by aging. Dysfunctions in the autonomic nervous system as well as altered bladder sensation and detrusor muscle function all contribute to the development of LUTS, and there seems to be a certain bidirectionality of these functions.\nRecent studies have indicated that proctitis is considered",

Glycan rearrangements are orchestrated by N-acetylglucosaminidases, beta 1,4-glycan-branch mannose, and beta-galactoside-specific O-glycan phosphorylases, which are activated by cAMP. CPE-resistant rats, established through successive backcrossing with Wistar rats, showed a 2.4-fold reduction in cGMP levels after CPE administration, compared with those in CPE-susceptible rats without backcross. These results suggested that the rat strain harbored a polymorphism in the Cgt1 gene, which encodes N-acetylglucosaminidase and beta 1,4-glycan-branch mannose, and that the CPE-resistant allele showed lower cAMP-induced activation of N-acetylglucosaminidases compared with that for wild-type rats.

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",

The series comprised 24 children with recurrent congenital dislocation of the hip and with previous attempts at realignment failing to stabilise the hip, or with failed operations. Two children had open reduction of their subluxated hips at the time of the first operation. Sixteen of the 24 children had a good result from their first operation, and the technique was useful in securing an anatomical reduction of the hip when the dislocation could not be reduced by the usual techniques. However, the authors consider that this procedure should be kept as a last resort, except perhaps in the open reduction of a dislocated hip. <EOD> .\nUsing scanner and optical analyser system, we examined serum lipids, apolipoproteins, HDL and its enzymes in 69 schizophrenics at hospital (all men) and 37 men of the control group similar in age and body weight. We found lowered concentration of HDL-cholesterol, HDL-phospholipids, HDL-apolipoprotein A 1, cholesterol ester transfer protein, and higher concentration of triglycerides, and apolipoprotein C in schizophrenics hospitalized for 3-49 years. We found, in schizophrenia, a negative correlation of HDL concentration with severity of illness, with negative psychotics symptoms, and with severity of positive symptoms. These changes could be connected with the decrease in quality of life. <EOD> Interacting quantum particles.\nWe find an expression for the effective forces between interacting electrons through the combination of three methods: {ital ab} {ital initio} Hartree-Fock atomic calculations, Green's function calculation of many-electron binding, and an analysis of the effective local Coulomb forces in the interparticle proximity region. <EOD> Fertilization of mouse eggs in vitro requires a soluble factor in addition to the action of sperm chromatin remodeling complexes\nThe spermatogenesis and oogenesis\u2013specific factor SUN domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2) localizes to nuclear pore complexes in the nuclear envelope. SUN2 dissociates from the nuclear pore membrane during sperm chromatin remodeling but reassociates following fertilization. In this study, we investigate whether the SUN2 function at the outer nuclear membrane is linked to sperm maturation in vitro or sperm chromatin remodeling in vitro. Sperm chromatin remodeling is required to release the histones that form the nuclear proteins during spermiogenesis. In vitro treatments of mouse sperm chromatin remodeling with trypsin and/or with nuclease to eliminate the inhibitory effect of nucleoplasm on chromatin remodeling indicated that chromatin remodeling in vitro is mediated by different proteins compared with in vivo in ejaculated sperm, and the histone component of the sperm core nuclear matrix is a barrier to the chromatin remodeling. Mouse eggs incubated with sperm chromatin remodeling medium preactivated with Ca2+\u2010ATP, trypsin, and nuclease failed to reach metaphase, but Ca2+\u2010induced activation occurred when eggs were washed after activation and incubated with fresh medium or with sperm chromatin remodeling medium without Ca2+\u2010ATP and nuclease. These results indicate that inhibition of the egg by sperm chromatin remodeling involves a soluble factor(s) distinct from the nucleoplasm and not eliminated by the treatment in the experimental in vitro conditions. We found that the SUN2 signal was present with the sperm chromatin remodeling medium, which suggests that SUN2 remains associated with nuclear pore complex components after chromatin remodeling. Our results show that, in vitro, the release of fertilin, which is a sperm surface protein responsible for capacitation and sperm binding to egg vitelline coat, takes place during sperm chromatin remodeling and that this process could",

In fact, insecticides are designed to kill the pests, whereas the pests have evolved mechanisms to counteract this assault. Genetic modification (GM) technology can be used to develop novel insect management strategies by expressing desirable traits in insects, through interfering with their pest potential, and increasing their vulnerability to lethal insecticides. In theory, some insects can be modified to interfere with one or more steps of the insect life cycle, from laying the next generation, making the offspring nonsterile, disallowing reproduction or destroying their genetic information via inducing mutations, thus altering the ability of insects to become pests so that the number of fertile adults is substantially lower than before. GM insects may be also made more vulnerable by expressing mutated genes responsible for detoxifying the insecticides. It is important to realize that a new generation of gene carriers will always emerge due to mutations, selection and natural genetic variation, which may be harmful to pest control because the transgenes may be rendered ineffective. In the present paper, we critically discuss the evolutionary aspects of GM insects, and explore the potential risk for introducing genes into wild insect populations to suppress the pest population.\n\n# Introduction\nBiological insecticides based on naturally occurring insect pathogens and parasites have not been used in a large-scale due to the risk of causing unanticipated harm to non-target organisms. Genetically modified (GM) insects can potentially be reared in a controlled environment and reintroduced back to the field in a timetested manner, and thus it is believed that GM insects would be more environmentally friendly and less hazardous   Biotechnological advances in insect pest control, Armes  . In recent years, the development, testing and licensing of GM pest management technologies in field trials have dramatically escalated, since they have the great potential for combating or avoiding pests in areas where insecticide use is problematic.

To understand how this alteration occurs at the receptor level, we compared the development of GABAergic and glycinergic responses to innocuous hair mechanoreceptive (A\u03b2-fibre) activity in rat lamina I dorsal horn (LIDH) neurones. The responses recorded by whole cell voltage clamp (I GABA or I glycine) were characterized from cell to cell (within anaesthetized rat) by their activation time and voltage dependence. In one group of cells (\u2018naive\u2019), innocuous A\u03b2\u2010fibre\u2010evoked GABA and glycine synaptic currents were not maintained on the same cells. Within 1\u20133 days after dorsal rhizotomy, A\u03b2\u2010fibre input to cells with low spontaneous activity was associated with an increase in inhibition. By contrast, A\u03b2\u2010fibre input to cells with high spontaneous activity was associated with a decrease in inhibition. This increase or decrease could be prevented by tetrodotoxin (TTX). Therefore the activity\u2010dependent increase or decrease in inhibition after dorsal rhizotomy relied heavily on action potentials and was not a reflection of the direct activation of the presynaptic terminals with the somatosensory activity. The activity\u2010dependent changes in postsynaptic response were not limited to the LIDH. Recordings of dorsal horn cells in the spinal cord with the",

Thank you for finishing this assignment!\n\n <EOD> Membrane-tethered C-Terminal PB1 Fragment of Influenza Virus Polymerase Protein PB1 Binds to and Activates the Host RNA Polymerase II Transcriptional Factor c-Fos\nABSTRACT The influenza virus polymerase (P) complex is a heterotrimeric protein composed of PB1, PB2, and PA molecules. Here, we report that, in an earlier study, we had inadvertently cloned what we now call the PB1-C-terminal (PB1-C) protein into our plasmids instead of PA. This protein was transfected into cells along with the influenza virus polymerase, and our data suggested that PB1-C protein could be the missing link required for the polymerase, which lacked certain transcriptional activity, to obtain the same activity as the wild-type P complex. To test this hypothesis, we prepared recombinant PB1 protein, from which the N233 fragment had been removed, and assessed the transcriptional activity in the human HEK293T cells by transient transfection with the recombinant proteins. PB1 protein activated the transcription of a reporter gene, containing the promoter region of the host RNA polymerase II, in the presence of the polymerase. A mutant PB1 protein lacked this ability, indicating that PB1-C protein might have some transcriptional activity. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the presence of active protein kinase-like activity in the PB1-C protein. Further, the PB1-C protein might interact with the DNA-binding host c-Fos protein. Since the PB1-C protein retained PA-binding affinity, the protein was added to a reaction mixture containing the polymerase and c-Fos protein, but the PB1-C protein did not interfere with the interaction between the polymerase and c-Fos. Finally, the PB1-C protein did not affect the c-Fos interaction with the transcriptional factor, cAMP response element-binding protein. These results suggest that PB1-C protein might regulate the host RNA polymerase II activity by binding to c-Fos protein. <EOD> Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.\nHomozygous familial hypercholesterolemia causes accelerated atherosclerosis. The early diagnostic marker for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is xanthomas involving the tendons and tuberous ectasia, and the definitive diagnosis is based upon genetic analysis to determine whether the patients have a homozygous mutation of the low- density lipoprotein receptor (null LDL receptor genotype). Treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia by surgical or pharmacologic therapy is still exploratory and requires validation for safety and efficacy. For high-risk homozygous hypercholesterolemia, a combination of aggressive medical and cardiovascular surgery is recommended. <EOD> Association between physical activity and risk of all caneer, according to type of activity: a prospective large population-based study of 344,008 men and women\n\nBackground: The benefits of physical activity on cancer risk are well established but there is little information regarding whether the effect is the same in men and women, overall and according to type of activity.

        "summary": "Healthcare systems in the United States (U.S.) have long faced the considerable challenge of managing budgetary pressures while at the same time helping people with serious mental illness and/or addiction. One potential way to address this challenge is to offer community-based services for individuals who are high-utilizers of expensive emergency and inpatient psychiatric services. Due to the decentralized nature of California governance, responsibility for mental health services falls primarily to the individual counties. The County of Santa Clara, CA invests significantly in community-based services as well as 24-hour care settings. This County adopted an innovative Pay for Performance (PFP) model and contracted with a new care provider to better meet the needs of this patient population and, in turn, reduce demand on the County's 24-hour psychiatric services. Whether this innovative contracting framework will help individuals who thus far have not responded well to mental health services is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the quality of care for these high-need patients was improved and at a sustainable cost. To this end, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted to determine whether this innovative quality improvement initiative, referred to as Partners in Wellness, was successful at reducing the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric care used by enrollees compared to individuals who concurrently received services from the county. Individuals were randomly assigned to the Usual Care (UC) or Pay-For-Performance (PFP) conditions. The primary outcome of this evaluation was reduction in the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services in the target population.\nthe primary outcome of this evaluation was reduction in the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services in the target population.",

It points out how poverty is commonly understood, and identifies its dimensions and how these are measured. The discussion shows that social vulnerability is a more appropriate concept than poverty to understand the situation of the poor. However, social vulnerability is still measured in terms of income, which only covers one of the multiple dimensions of poverty. The conceptual framework adopted in the Brazilian Project for the Improvement of Quality of Life and Access to Services (PRO-AFASS) is presented and the tools currently being studied to measure the various dimensions of deprivation are described. PRO-AFASS consists of a series of complementary studies that are being undertaken to produce a multidimensional index on social vulnerability and assess strategies to improve access to public services. <EOD> Influence of the Dorsal Root Ganglion on the Extraction and Preservation of Axonal Proteins\nAbstract : After peripheral nerve lesions, nerve endings undergo retraction of axonal sprouting. The effect of lesions of the dorsal root ganglia on axoplasmic enzyme activity in the distal stumps of rat sciatic nerves has been studied. The axonal protein content has been measured using a biochemical and histochemical technique. A significant increase in activity over control levels has been detected on the day after the nerve lesion. Protein concentration is significantly increased 1 day after nerve lesions. The data suggest that there is a loss of material from the nerve fibers after lesions, and that there could be an extracellular supply of axonal components in cases of neurological lesions. <EOD> Acid secretion in patients with duodenal ulcer. Evidence that Helicobacter pylori slows gastrin-induced parietal cell activity by suppressing somatostatin secretion.\nWe studied the in vivo effects of Helicobacter pylori on antral somatostatin (SRIF) and inhibitor of acid-splitting (IAS) output and on the gastric acid response to exogenous human gastrin-I (1-27). In 2 separate studies 15 duodenal ulcer patients underwent intravenous infusion of H. pylori, and SRIF and IAS concentrations and acid output were measured in gastric juice. Increased SRIF output was seen in both groups, and in group A there was a significant increase in gastric IAS output. Gastric juice pH was reduced by Helicobacter pylori to a significant degree, but the rise in gastric juice IAS concentration, an index of gastric acidity, was only 57%, perhaps because of a reduced gastric capacity, which was evident in that gastric output of SRIF was low. The gastric acid response to human gastrin (120 pmol/kg per hour) was measured in the patients before and after Helicobacter pylori infusion. The gastric acid response to gastrin was significantly ( P less than 0.01) reduced in the presence of the organisms. These findings suggest that gastric somatostatin secretion, at least under these conditions, is only partly responsible for the gastrin-induced reduction in acid secretion. On the other hand, Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with parietal cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy in the antral mucosa in association with a significant increase in somatostatin output, an important endocrine factor inhibiting parietal cell activity. <EOD> Nucleo-cytoplast fusion in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells: A preliminary study\n\nBipolar electroporation Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell Nucleo-cytoplast fusion Human tissue Engineering and reconstructive surgery, Mesenchymal stem cells regenerate or restore the damaged tissue at the site of injury by inducing endogenous stem cells to differentiate into multiple lineages or by secreting a variety of growth factors and cell modifiers that regulate cell proliferation and tissue repair. 1 One of the key applications of mesenchymal stem cells, particularly human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSCs), is cell therapy.

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators also hypothesize that the CBT-informed intervention will be more effective than the attitudinal inoculation intervention for increasing COVID-19 vaccination among participants with symptoms of anxiety or depression.",

The subjects were divided into 2 groups: I) 25 patients (32 %) had a TLB (TBI+TLBD), II) 58 patients (78 %) attended the clinic directly after the TBI without a TLB (TBI+TLBD/-). Standardized assessments of attention/psychomotor speed, memory (verbal), executive functions, language functions, sensation and visuospatial functions, depressiveness, quality-of-life (QOL), pain, and neurologic examination were performed within 120 days post injury. Age, time to hospital admission, severity at admission (GCS), and type of TBI (extradural, subdural, intraparenchymal, contusion) had to be considered for evaluation. The Mann-Whitney-U test and ANOVA (independent t test) were applied.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor some parameters no correlational differences could be found between the groups. In contrast, patients with a TLB had better performance than those with no TLB in attention/psychomotor speed, the memory (verbal), the executive functions, language functions and the neurologic examination.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAt least for the first 6 months after TBI the type of TBI, the age and the time from injury to inpatient admission are relevant factors for cognitive outcome. Although it is a cross-sectional-study, the patients with a TLB seemed to have a better cognitive outcome than those with no TLB. <EOD> Phase noise and optical signal fading in optical frequency division multiplexing.\nOptical frequency division multiplexing allows for the encoding of multiple channel functions with the frequency offset of each function as the multiplexed carriers. In the proposed 6.6 Gbit/s 16-channel system with optical carrier-suppressed phase-shift keying (O-CPSK) modulation formats, the coherent optical pulse shaper is directly inserted into the data-transmission system to perform pulse-shaping and frequency offset conversion. Phase noise and signal fading induced by the direct insertion are analyzed and characterized. Experimental results show that the relative coherent pulse-shaping performance, compared to that of the coherent optical pulse shaper in an optical add/drop module, is basically identical. The optical signal fading induced by pulse shaper-transmitter mismatches is also negligible within the time scales studied. <EOD> Genetic Determinants of Skeletal Muscle Insulin Resistance in Non-Obese, Normoglycaemic Individuals\n\nIndividuals, with normal glucose metabolism, who exhibit insulin resistance (IR) in the muscle are at an increased risk of developing T2DM. The underlying mechanisms that determine this intrinsic phenotype remains to be clarified. Here, we have utilised a cohort of non-obese, normoglycaemic individuals (n = 100), to identify genetic determinants of muscle IR. We show that plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, as well as HOMA-IR, are higher in IR groups compared to the IR groups' respective controls. Insulin action in muscle was lower in the IR groups compared to controls, as determined by the insulinogenic index; but there were no differences between the IR and control groups for hepatic insulin resistance as determined by the HOMA-\u03b2%, or in the rate of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal during an O",

PFU for Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) services will be established nationally by 2024. Currently, there is a lack of evidence that measures prospectively the impact of PFU on patients and providers.\nIn January 2022, Guys and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust initiated PFU for patients with HNC. For the first 2 years following treatment, patients treated curatively are followed up according to institutional protocol. At 2 years following completion of treatment, patients who remain disease free, have no significant risk factors for recurrence and no severe treatment-related toxicity are referred to the programme and discharged from routine oncology FU. Patients are reviewed in a nurse-led HNC PFU clinic where they receive personalised survivorship, health promotion and education in identifying signs of disease recurrence with information on the pathway to re-present directly to the services at Guy's Cancer.\nThis mixed methods research project will evaluate implementation factors of this new PFU programme whilst prospectively measuring its effectiveness. A hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness study design will be used to determine the value patients and health care providers (HCP). Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with patients and HCP will be undertaken to evaluate barriers and facilitators, safety, acceptability and user experience. Data will be collected over a 24 month period. All patients who are transferred to the PFU pathway will be eligible to participate, alongside HCP involved in delivering the service.",

Although the outer and middle ear are normal, the sound cannot travel easily to the inner ear, which is anatomically inaccessible. The conductive hearing loss will typically be conductive hearing loss is typically seen in adult males, and is not a concern in children.

The inner ear (cochlea) is a complex sensory organ designed to perceive sound. The  sensory nerve fibers travel directly from the cochlea to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain. These fibers cannot regenerate; therefore, when they are permanently damaged, such as an acoustic trauma or ototoxically, they will result in permanent sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n    The sensory nerve fibers are myelinated nerve fibers that carry sound information to the brain.

The quality of spinal anesthesia has been reported to be improved by using additives Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective \u03b12-adrenoreceptor agonist that has been introduced to anesthesia. It produces dose-dependent sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia without respiratory depression. Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase agent, which inhibits the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetyl cholinesterase; administration of Neostigmine through intrathecal route apparently activates the descending pain inhibitory system that relies on spinal cholinergic interneuron. Study conducted to evaluate whether neostigmine given by intrathecal route with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia can provide prolongation of sensory blockade duration as effective as dexmedetomidine given by the same route and in compination with same drug with lower cost, more stable hemodynamics and comparable side effects.

The uptake of p-hydroxybenzoate exhibits a lag of half-life of 4\u20135 min at 370 C. The effect is eliminated by preincubation with 10\u20133m-p-hydroxybenzoate or with 0-1mm-p-aminobenzoate. 2. A similar effect is also obtained with asparagine or L-leucine supplied during preincubation; other substrates or phosphate are without effect. The decrease in initial activity is not accompanied by a comparable decrease in final activity. 3. There are two kinetic components to the uptake of p-hydroxybenzoate, with apparent Km'S of 0.09 mm and 2.62 mm at 37\u00b0 C in unincubated slices, or 0.03 mm and 0.32 mm after 5\u201310-min preincubations. Preincubation with the organic substrates inhibits only the high affinity transport component. <EOD> The Effect of High Intensity Interval Training on Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor and C-Reactive Protein in Women with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial\nABSTRACT Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has an increasing prevalence throughout the world. The purpose of this study is to compare two exercise protocols, aerobic (AG) and interval training (IG), on insulin resistance, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and BDNF as well as BDNF-IR in women with diabetes. Methods Using a randomized controlled clinical trial design, 185 diabetic and non-diabetic women with BMI (\u226530 kg m\u22122), age (18\u201345 years) and normal blood pressure were selected and randomly allocated into 3 control (CG), aerobic training (AG), and interval group (IG), 62 in each group. ACR in AG and IG was performed once for 16 weeks and 20 sessions 5 days a week on a treadmill and on a bike with 50\u201370% HRmax. The interval training group did 30 s exercise, 15 s pause and the aerobic group performed one-minute exercise, one-minute pause. Blood samples and body composition were measured at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks. BDNF, CRP, IL-6, and insulin also were analyzed. Results The effect of exercise training on anthropometric indices, cardiopulmonary and vascular parameters, insulin and lipids are all in the normal range. BDNF significantly higher in the interval group (p = 0.05) compared to the other groups at the end of the 16th week. Insulin has significant relationship with BDNF-IR in the three groups; whereas, CRP in both the AG (p = 0.01) and IG (p = 0.03) has a negative relationship with BDNF. Conclusion High-intensity interval training significantly improves BDNF and inflammatory factors in diabetic women. It is recommended that this form of exercise be practiced. <EOD> A case report of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum following vaginal delivery complicated by maternal sepsis\n\nIntroduction: Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare necrotizing soft tissue infection caused by the necrotizing bacterial toxins'",

We know that AF is associated with an increase in the scarring of the heart, the left atrium and it is thought that this scarring may be one of the drivers for this abnormal heart rhythm. The nature of this scarring in humans has been subject to limited study and generally only by indirect means such as cardiac MRI scans or measuring the voltage of the tissues. During cardiothoracic surgery, tissue from the left atrium is removed as a part of the procedure. This tissue is normally disposed of, but we would propose to consent patients to collect it to allow it to be analysed.

In the present study, we report the incidence and outcome of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. From March 2020 to May 2020, we evaluated 656 patients with proven COVID-19 at our tertiary care hospital; 7 patients (1.06%) were found to be clinically diagnosed as having cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without any congenital anatomical abnormalities. These patients were subsequently evaluated by detailed medical history, routine laboratory testing, electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, computed tomography scan of the head, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, lumbar puncture and cerebral venous sinus angiography. They were then managed based on clinical and radiological findings and treated symptomatically including steroids, anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs and immunoglobulins. Six patients with CVST survived. One patient died despite maximal supportive therapy. COVID-19 infection should be recognized as a prothrombotic state and appropriate anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy should be incorporated into the treatment to decrease the risk of thromboembolic events. Further research is needed to validate a higher incidence of this thrombotic phenomenon with this new disease.\n\n# Introduction\nThe present pandemic of coronavirus disease has been shown to be associated with thrombotic complications in infected patients.

There is also evidence showing that in most patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), the CSA of the carpal canal is greater than a hypothetical threshold value for normal individuals. In this study, we evaluate whether ultrasonographic measurement has any specific predictive value as means for diagnosing CTS. <EOD> Corrosion-resistant electrocatalyst with a bimetallic nanoparticle cluster.\nThe rational design of heterogeneous catalysts for practical renewable energy technologies is limited by the lack of structural understanding of the intermediates during the catalytic reactions. To bridge this gap, we synthesized a 3D intertwined network (INT) structure as an electrocatalyst using an organic molecule and metal salts with a large excess of Na2S2O8 to promote a controlled co-reduction and reaction under extremely mild conditions. 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTD) was employed as a cointercalator to generate a high surface area, which enables a precise investigation of the catalytic activity. The network structure and the specific coordination environment with the cointercalator enabled an excellent chemical stability of the intertwined network at 125 \u00b0C for 48 h and 100 \u00b0C for 24 h. We investigated the effects of chemical composition, structural characteristics, and thermal stability on the catalytic performances of the as-prepared INT by in-situ electrochemical X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The intertwined network structure with a controlled degree of alloying in the heterostructure showed 4.4-fold higher durability than a Ni(OH)2 single crystal as a representative of a bulk conventional catalyst. In addition, the optimized heterostructure showed a significant improvement in the electrocatalytic activity and thermal stability, which was attributed to the reduced surface defects and the high cointercalator coverage in the INT structure. This approach provides a new methodology for the development of highly stable, robust electrocatalysts from existing state-of-the-art materials. <EOD> Association between body mass index and preeclampsia severity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nBACKGROUND\nExcess maternal weight has been associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia (PE) and severe maternal morbidity with an increased risk of preterm birth.

We estimated the prevalence of depressive symptoms and its correlates among elderly persons (aged \u2265 60 years) residing in urban India using nationally representative data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used the two-stage cluster sampling method to randomly select 72,250 persons from 640 clusters in rural (314) and urban (326) areas of all 29 States and 6 Union Territories of India. A total of 45,411 respondents with complete observations were included in this study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe weighted prevalence of depressive symptoms was 11.4%. Persons living in the northeast had a 1.21 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.26) times higher prevalence, persons widowed or divorced had a 1.23 (95% CI: 1.15-1.30) times higher prevalence, those with a history of heart disease had a 7.1% (95% CI: 6.0-8.3) higher prevalence, persons with one to three chronic conditions had a 1.53 (95% CI: 1.39-2.70) times higher prevalence, and participants who had depressive symptoms also had an 8% (95% CI: 2-14) higher likelihood of living alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNearly half of the elderly persons who have depressive symptoms in India are living alone.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe current study provides a clear insight into the prevalence of depression in later life in India after nearly a decade, along with a multitude of risk factors associated with depression in old age.

Both opioid receptors and CYP2B6, the enzyme responsible for the first step in 6\u2010AM metabolism, are differentially regulated by morphine and 6\u2010AM; therefore, understanding the association between the genes that encode or regulate either protein may help further unravel how morphine use alters opioid and other substance use and dependence. This report investigated the genetic association of the opioid system with heroin addiction in 360 European American heroin addicts and 687 European American controls using a candidate gene approach. An additional goal was to assess the contribution of genetic variation in the human \u03bcopioid receptor (OPRM1) on both self\u2010reported measures of past week heroin use in 258 addicted individuals and toxicological detection of this drug and related metabolites in blood from individuals (N=47) who sought emergency treatment for acute opioid intoxication/overdose. We identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1799971, in the OPRM1 gene, that contained the highest association with heroin addiction (P=1.9 \u00d7 10\u22124; OR, 1.73; CI, 1.30\u20132.32). This locus is adjacent to the SNP rs6267, which contains the common D349G polymorphism that has been linked with altered human OPRM1 expression and function. We investigated this putative functional polymorphism in 477 individuals and found that the G allele was associated with both increased addiction liability (P=0.02; OR=3.8; CI, 1.3\u201312.4) and increased past\u2010week heroin use (P=0.001; d=0.87; CI, 1.40, 2.25).

(2)\u00a0Four implants with an interimplant distance of 3.6 and an implant/abutment diameter ratio of 1.0. (3)\u00a0Four implants with interimplant distance of 2.3\u00a0mm and an implant/abutment ratio of 1.4. (4)\u00a0Six implants with an interimplant distance of 3.6\u00a0mm and an implant/abutment ratio of 1.5. The study was conducted in two steps: (a):\u00a0In the experimental model made in resin and in the \u00b5CT bone scan, the implants received a diameter of 5.0\u00a0mm and a length of 12\u00a0mm. Then, the resin model was scanned by micro-CT, and the \u00b5CT bone scan was co-registered with CT. This process gave 2D and 3D images. (b):\u00a0Three provisional screwed connections were assembled with two interimplant distances, 3.6 and 2.3\u00a0mm. To simulate the physiological condition of the mouth, a weight of 100\u00a0g was loaded 2\u00a0cm above the implants. A static axial load of 130\u00a0N was imposed for 6\u00a0s. Finite element analyses (FEA) were performed in order to determine the maximum principal stress (psi) of the abutments and their implants.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results revealed that the implants with short interimplant distance showed lower stresses than the implants with long interimplant distance. The 2.3\u00a0mm interimplant distance and the provisional implant with 4\u00a0mm diameter showed the lowest stresses with the lowest variation, and were considered the most suitable for clinical application in the implant/abutment ratio of 1.4.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe maximum stress observed in the 2.3\u00a0mm interimplant distance model was 21\u00a0MPa. Therefore, these implants can be recommended in cases of partial restorations, as they are shown to be suitable for clinical application. <EOD> Evaluation of a new radiographic progression criteria (TiMER) on radiogroups of rheumatoid arthritis patients\nObjectives The aim of this study was to evaluate a new radiographic progression criteria (TiMER method) in a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients starting a first therapy either with anti-TNF blockers or synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (sDMARDs). Methods 137 anti-TNF treatment na\u00efve RA patients were prospectively included in this study. A conventional radiological scoring was performed at inclusion (time T0) and after 12\u2009months (T1). All joints were counted on total number of radiographies. Joint progression >0.513\u2009unit of Sharp van der Heijde score (SHS) was considered as significant erosion progression (EPS). Results The EPS rate at T0 was 22.8% in the biologics group and 25.0% in the synthetics. At T0 and according to EPS, a significant difference was found between the two treatment groups (p\u2009= 0.0005), with a more severe erosion score in RA patients under synthetical treatment. EPS evolution at T1 was not significant between the two treatment groups (p\u2009= 0.49).

Synthesis and antifungal evaluation\u2020 \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Experimental procedures and characterization data. CCDC 997079 and 997080. See DOI: 10.1039/c8ra0\n\nImidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivative possessing a thione moiety exhibited excellent antifungal activity (MIC 1.5-6.25 mg mL \u00c01 ) in vitro against Candida, Aspergillus species. Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-thione-derivatives displayed potent inhibitory activity against C. albicans 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (GND) with Ki values of 1.2 to 14.7 mM.\n\n# Introduction\nImidazo-pyridine scaffold has attracted signi\ue103cant attention owing to its wide range of biological and pharmaceutical activities. 1 Compounds containing this scaffold exhibit activity as platelet activating factor (PAF) 2 and thromboxane A2 3 antagonists, inhibitors for histamine N-methyltransferase, 4 histamine H(3)and H(4) 6 receptors, phosphodiesterase-IV inhibitors 7 and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine was also reported to show antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, and Microsporum nanum. 9 Imidazopyridine derivatives exhibit excellent fungicidal activity against C. albicans and Aspergillus species. 3j 10 In fact, an imidazo pyridine-based chlorine molecule has been used as a commercial antifungal agent. Herein, we report an investigation into the synthesis of a new class of antifungal agents involving substitution of the pyridine nitrogen with a thione moiety to impart additional reactivity. The imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-yl-1H-imidazoles were readily prepared from the reaction of bis(chloromethyl) azoliums with sodium formate. 12 Reaction of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-formates 4 with hydrazines generated novel series of imidazo[1,2-a] 5 pyridine-2-thiones, containing a formyl function, and in situ addition of this formyl function to sodium azide afforded the target compounds 6 (Scheme 1). In fact, we discovered that an imidazo[1,2a]pyridine nitrogen bearing a 2-thione moiety exhibited a higher antifungal activity than the 3-pyridylamine compound.\n\n# Results and discussion\nThe target imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives were rationally designed to target a fungi-speci\ue103c C. albicans 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (GND). Thus, the reaction of 5-(tosylmethylene)-2-formyl imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 4a 12 with hydrazines in dioxane, followed by aqueous work-up of the reaction mixture, afforded the desired synthetic targets, imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-thiones 6a and 6b and pyridine-2-thione 7, in 47-75% yields. Compounds 6 were generally isolated as white solids and 1 H NMR spectra showed that the 2-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-thiones 6a and 6b had a singlet peak at 8.87 and 8.83 ppm for the azomethine protons, respectively.

        "summary": "Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by cardiac abnormalities compromising the ability of the heart to provide a blood supply adequate to the metabolic needs of peripheral tissues. ADHF is characterized by systemic and pulmonary fluid retention, with weight gain, peripheral edema, needing diuretic therapy. Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide. The researchers will perform a spontaneous, prospective, randomized trial aiming at investigating the effect of combined furosemide-induced diuresis and automated matched dehydration, compared with standard furosemide administration in ADHF patients with fluid overload.",

However, the incidence and risk factors of lung cancer in patients with pulmonary fibrosis with incidental finding of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension have not been studied. Therefore, we performed a retrospective cohort study of newly diagnosed pulmonary fibrosis (IPF or non-IPF) with incidental finding of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension from January 2005 to December 2018. There were 1657 participants (1049 IPF, 568 non-IPF, and 44 pulmonary embolism), and the median follow-up was 4.2 (interquartile range, IQR: 2.5\u20137.4) years. Lung cancer incidence rates in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and incidental pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and without embolism or hypertension were 1.1, 1.7, 1.3, and 0.6 cases per 10000 person-years, and the corresponding adjusted hazard ratio was 1.24 (95% CI 0.55\u20132.83, P = .60). After multivariate analysis, lung cancer occurred more frequent in non-IPF group (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.21\u20133.00, P = .005), and it was associated with older age (HR per 10-year increment 2.40, 95% CI 1.19\u20134.88, P = .013) and female sex (HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.26\u20135.73, P = .011). Lung cancer was more frequent in non-IPF patients than those in IPF group (HR 2.76, 95% CI 1.20\u20136.35, P = .017). Therefore, there were no statistically significant differences in risk of lung cancer among patients with pulmonary fibrosis and incidental pulmonary thromboembolism or pulmonary hypertension. <EOD> Mild cognitive impairment and dementia: the importance of modifiable risk factors\nModifiable risk factors for dementia include physical activity, smoking, diet, sleep, hearing and vision problems, and social deprivation.

Methods:-In this series, 1\u00a0\u00d7 107\u00a0HCC tumor cells were suspended in 120\u00a0\u03bcL RPMI-1640 medium and implanted by ultrasound guided intrasplenic injection method into the spleen of Balb/C male mice (n\u00a0=\u00a010). The tumor size was measured with ultrasound every week. The samples were frozen in optimal cutting temperature medium and stained by various histological methods. The tumor cell line was confirmed through electron microscopic examinations. Results: Transplanted HCC cells in\u00a0 vivo, similar to parent nontransplanted HCC tumor cells in\u00a0vitro, were found to be of hepatocellular origin having morphological features and electron microscopic characteristics of hepatocytes. The HCC grafts reached a size with features of fibrogenesis in\u00a0vivo following about 4\u00a0weeks. The livers of recipient mice showed chronic hepatitis with fibrotic changes.

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent. We propose that rintatolimod/durvalumab-combination therapy is feasible and may induce synergistic anti-tumor immune responses in PDAC.",

        "summary": "The potential benefits of exercise for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and pain have been well documented in the scientific literature. Psychiatric, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are examples of conditions that impact the health and quality of life of the population. Due to the effects provided by exercise, it can modify the natural course of these diseases. This concept is important to justify the efforts made by government bodies committed to promoting exercise, such as the WHO. However, the habitual practice of physical activity following the primary guidelines may be hampered by some factors, including those that support the physiological repercussions of exercise on the body, such as muscle pain. In this sense, an important complicating factor such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), present in the post-exercise recovery period, can impair adherence and permanence in physical activity programs, thus representing a considerable barrier to exercise promotion. They can also severely impair the performance of high-level athletes. Flavonoids, present in plants, but also in foods of the human diet, are known to have several biological properties, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Currently, there are still few studies that have evaluated the effects of flavonoids on the development and evolution of DOMS in humans.",

It is an increasingly common cause of cutaneous injury and complications in the clinical setting. Although injection of cocaine to the thigh is the most frequent anatomic location, injection into the back, chest, and extremities are also reported. Implantation and abscesses are among the more common cutaneous complications of IM cocaine use. In addition to these common complications, rare complications have also been described and include vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and other ulcerations, necrotizing fasciitis (NF), arterial thrombosis, and septic arthritis. The authors review the cutaneous clinicopathological spectrum of cocaine injection and report on a patient with PG due to cocaine intramuscular injection. <EOD> .\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine the influence of anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative substances upon the wound healing capacity in an experimental burn trauma. The substances tested in the present study were alpha-ketoglutaric acid and vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid).\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nOne hundred forty-four rats were burned with 1/2 of the total body surface to make the lesions comparable. The animals were divided into four groups: 1) burn, no treatment; 2) burn/ alpha-ketoglutaric acid, 10 mg; 3) burn/alpha-ketoglutaric acid, 100 mg; 4) burn/alpha-ketoglutaric acid, 300 mg. After a latency period of 3 days, the lesions were covered with occlusive, polyurethane film for the following 3 days. As in group 1 a positive control (burn) and in group 2 a negative control (untreated burn) were formed. The treatment groups 3 and 4 had to be treated twice daily with aqueous alpha-ketoglutaric acid solution. The wound healing capacity was measured. After 4 weeks a histological analysis was done by light microscopy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe most favorable values for the percentage of re-epithelialization were found in the treatment groups 10/300 and 100/300 mg, as compared to the two negative control groups (untreated burns).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn optimal treatment with alpha-ketoglutaric acid was found in the concentrations of 100 and 300 mg/kg body weight. It can be assumed that the observed effects are due to the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activity of alpha-ketoglutaric acid. <EOD> Implications for cancer drug development\n\nCancer is a disease that continues to pose a formidable problem for public health and for medical science. Although great advances in cancer therapy have been made over the last century, the therapeutic landscape in oncology has remained fundamentally unchanged. Many cancer types still lack an effective cure or therapy for incurable disease. We propose a novel way forward, based at the interface between mathematics, biology and medicine. The implications of this way forward are significant and broad, embracing the future of both cancer biology and general biology, and perhaps, biology as a whole. Although the proposed future of general biology is perhaps not the main thrust of our argument here, it is certainly noteworthy, and deserves thought and action.\n1. The standard way to treat cancer has remained fundamentally unchanged for decades. This is because the standard way is designed for only the rare case of local and early cancer, when the standard approach has its best chance of cure. When the cancer is regional and advanced, or metastatic and late, a number of other therapies are available but none has a cure, and none is curative. However, we believe that the standard way is now a weak relic, increasingly irrelevant.\n2. Recent advances have exposed weaknesses and redundancies in the standard therapeutic approach. Increasingly, these weaknesses and redundancies may limit the generalizability of the cure for local and early cancer. Instead, those weaknesses",

        "summary": "For children with severe cerebral palsy (CP) in whom other options are insufficient, intrathecal baclofen (ITB) treatment could be an option. Literature provides some evidence for the effect of ITB, however we notice that not all children benefit equally. Furthermore long term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with CP have not yet been described in literature. To improve selection for ITB physicians need to know which factors influence outcome on the long term. In order to accomplish these goals prospectively, real life data over a long period of time, and from a large cohort are needed.\nThe investigators will therefore conduct a prospective observational cohort study using the Netherlands CP register to collect data over a period of 4,5 years. The Netherlands CP register is an innovative register for data collection which was developed between 2016 and 2020 in a unique collaboration between children with CP, their parents, researchers and health care professionals.\nAll children and adolescents with CP, who start ITB treatment in the Netherlands under the age of 16, diagnosed with spastic or dyskinetic CP, are eligible for inclusion in the study.\nThe primary outcome measure is goal attainment scaling (GAS) in which achievement of individual goals can be quantified. Factors that potentially influence outcome including spasticity, dystonia, scoliosis and complications will be secondary outcome measures.\nMeasurements will be done before initiation of ITB, after 3 months, after 1 year and after 2 years.\nStatistical analysis will include effect size Cohen's d for all outcome measures. To assess which factors are possibly associated with GAS T-score outcome at follow-up multiple regression analysis will be conducted.",

Is there an effect of ITB on spasticity and/or dystonia?\n[**] 3. What factors influence treatment success after ITB treatment in the long term?\nBackground: As most cerebral palsy (CP) is resistant to therapy, medical innovations will only take part in optimizing functional outcome in these patients. Intrathecal baclofen (ITB), a central nervous system (CNS) de-excitator, may be such an innovation to influence functioning in children with CP. ITB allows continuous, intrathecal administration of baclofen. CNS symptoms that are treatable with high dosages of oral baclofen are difficult, if ever possible, to treat with ITB. ITB may be beneficial in children with severe CP with intractable spasticity, dystonia, spasmodic and/or unpredictable, painful lower limb tremor (PLMT), dysarthria or scoliosis refractory to conventional physical therapy. Currently, only a small subset of children with CP is eligible for ITB therapy. The medical potential of ITB will only be unleashed when we have a better insight into predictive factors for the effect of ITB in CP. Insight in predictive baseline characteristics influencing treatment outcomes and side effects would allow tailoring interventions to patients with ITB. In adult CP patients, we have studied which baseline demographics and clinical factors might be predictors of treatment outcomes after ITB, as is for example an effect of spasticity on the effect of ITB. We showed that a higher dystonia score before ITB was associated with less improvement in the domains of daily life after starting ITB. Moreover, the level of dystonia decreased under ITB in adult males with CP. We wondered whether similar results are found in children with CP treated with ITB. Moreover, as no data on factors affecting treatment outcome are available, we also aim to study which other baseline demographics and clinical factors might be predictors of treatment outcomes after ITB, and in particular factors affecting treatment outcome in the domains of daily life. This is the first study that systematically investigates which baseline factors affect treatment outcomes in children with CP treated with ITB. This study will answer the question of what are the short- (3, 12 and 24 months), medium-(1 year) and long-term (2 years) effects of ITB on personal treatment goals as assessed using the GAS in children with CP. It will also study which baseline demographics and clinical factors might be predictive for treatment outcome in domains of daily life (i.e. self care, mobility, life at home and occupation).\n\nIntroduction to the Study\n- The study aims to investigate baseline factors associated with effect of ITB treatment in children with spastic hemipleig CP, dyskinesia or choreoathetotical CP. This study will answer the question of what are the effects of ITB on personal treatment goals, after 3,12,24 months, and on which clinical outcomes.\n\nObjectives (3-5 objectives): - First objective: What are the short-,medium- and long-term effects of ITB compared to baseline on personal treatment goals? - Second objective: Which factors are associated with effect of ITB in personal treatment goals?\nOutcome Measures | S2 File\n- The primary outcome measure is improvement in personal treatment goals (assessed by goal attainment scaling [GAS]) measured after 3,12 and 24 months.\n- The secondary outcome measures are: 1. The effect on spasticity according to the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS, as soon as possible and at each interval of 3 months) and the selectivity scale (SMISC; at baseline and 12 months) and improvement of spasticity and/or dystonia according to the Tardieu Scale (at baseline and 12 months) and Clinical Global Impression Scores (CGI-S and CGI-C, assessed at 3, 12 and 24 months).\n- Other secondary outcome measures include the following:\n- The effect on dystonia according to the Tardieu Scale and the Bar-ill Brady Scale\n- The effect on muscle tone and muscle spasms according to the Modified Ashworth Scale,",

This was supposed to be a conclusion.\n\n# Background\n=====================\n\nIn conclusion, the study sought to investigate the efficacy of Nordic walking as a primary preventive intervention for older adults at risk of falls. In comparison to traditional exercise programs, Nordic walking has been found to have several advantages: It may have the potential to effectively reduce the fear of falling, it can be practiced safely by individuals with various chronic conditions, and it is more cost-effective than traditional exercise programs. It has been observed that the fear of falling impacts the quality of life of older individuals, as it can restrict their activity levels and limit their willingness to engage in social activities and travel. Thus, Nordic walking programs for older adults at risk of falls are important to evaluate as they have the potential to improve the quality of life of this vulnerable population. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Nordic walking to serve as a valuable resource to meet the physical, psychological, and social needs of older adults at risk of falls.\n\n# Implications\n====================\n\nThis study aims to investigate the efficacy of Nordic walking as a preventive intervention for older adults at risk of falls. Nordic walking is a low-cost option that may have potential to improve the quality of life of older individuals who are at risk of falling. This is especially important to consider in the United States, where falls are a leading cause of injury and mortality among older individuals. With an aging population and an increased risk of falls, it is essential to consider the development and implementation of cost-effective preventive interventions. The implementation of Nordic walking programs, if shown to be effective, has the potential to benefit a broad range of individuals, as Nordic walking has been found to be a safe exercise option for individuals of various ages and health conditions. Furthermore, these programs can be implemented as a primary preventive method to reduce the fear of falling in the target population. The fear of falling impacts the quality of life of older individuals, as it can lead to social isolation and limit their ability to engage in physical activities. Identifying Nordic walking as a primary preventive intervention for individuals at risk of falls has the potential to improve their quality of life. Thus, Nordic walking may serve as a valuable resource for addressing the physical, psychological, and social health-related needs of older individuals at risk of falls.\n\n## [/END]\n\n# Conclusions\n=====================\n\nThrough the results of this study, we expect to establish Nordic walking as an effective preventive intervention for older adults at risk of falls. This will contribute to an accumulative body of evidence that Nordic walking is a safe and effective activity",

        "summary": "Fiber colonoscopy, as a terminal examination method for lower gastrointestinal diseases, often brings varying degrees of pain, discomfort, tension, and anxiety to patients. Therefore, currently in clinical practice, intravenous anesthesia is often chosen to reduce discomfort. At present, intravenous propofol and fentanyl are most widely used in clinical practice, but intravenous general anesthesia can lead to hemodynamic fluctuations and an increase in anesthesia related complications such as prolonged hospital stay after surgery. Propofol and remifentanil have the characteristics of fast onset, short duration of action, and rapid awakening. The purpose of this study is to observe the efficacy and adverse reactions of remifentanil combined with low-dose propofol in patient-controlled analgesia and sedation during colonoscopy, in order to explore the safety and effectiveness of this method.",
        "model_output": "[/INST]\n <EOD> Sustained Release of a New Active Ingredient in a Polymeric Microspheres System\nAbstract\u2014 Thiazolobenzotriazole (TIBO) has been used as an active substance in the form of the TIBO\u2010laurate ester, known as TIBO\u2010L. For the local delivery of TIBO\u2010L to the vagina, a novel microspheres system has been prepared using a controlled porosity method with a polymeric core. Using acrylic porogenic beads as a template, polymeric particles, with a controlled size, size distribution and porosity, were obtained. By a co\u2010extrusion process in a three head extruder, poly (bis\u2010lactide) microspheres containing the TIBO\u2010L were produced, the drug being encapsulated in the inner layer. The surface of the microspheres was subsequently covered with a hydrophilised membrane to avoid any drug loss during the storage period. The release of the active ingredient from both types of microspheres, i.e. with open porosity and encapsulated in a porous polymeric layer, has been studied by a release\u2010rate measurement cell, designed for high viscosity materials. The results show a burst effect during the first three days, followed by a slow sustained release. The drug release from both types of microspheres was correlated with the particle density of the core, the extent and the rate of the water uptake by the microspheres. The release\u2010rate profile was not significantly altered during the storage period of six months. <EOD> 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 treatment in multiple myeloma: a novel approach using the VDRE and miRNA targeting\nAbstract Although multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease, it may be possible to significantly improve treatment by targeting genes and pathways not currently being affected using the current agents/targeted therapies. We have targeted the gene for VDR, the receptor for metabolite of vitamin D3 (25-OHD3) in MM cells using DNA plasmid or VDR siRNA treatments. Treatment was then followed by transcriptional profile analyses of genes that are up- and down-regulated using RNA array. We found that treatment of MM with either 25-OHD3 or VDR siRNA induced the expression of genes which mediate the apoptosis of myeloma cells such as, BID, CASP3, and PMAIP1 in myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples. To further understand the mechanism/s by which VDR treatment inhibits cell growth in MM and to determine if there is a causally relationship between VDR expression and the regulator microRNA genes (miRNA), we conducted a transcriptome association study and found that the expression of certain transcription repressors are positively correlated with the expression of vitamin D-mediated genes, while three other microRNA isoforms are negatively correlated with certain transcription repressors in vitamin D-regulated genes. We then treated MM cells and primary patient samples with 25-OHD3 followed by RNA array analyses and found that genes that are involved in the differentiation of myeloma cells, like MITF, NKX3\u20131, and SOST were significantly up-regulated. Our findings suggest that vitamin D3-mediated anti-myeloma activity that is involved in the expression of tumor suppressor genes and microRNA genes.  <EOD> Detection of Tuberculosis: Molecular Diagnosis.\nTuberculosis (TB) remains the leading infectious disease cause of death in the world and the second leading cause of death from infectious disease. Rapid and early diagnosis of TB with appropriate bacterial load determination is the critical component of clinical decision making. The introduction of molecular diagnostic techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has improved our capabilities. Although the World Health Organization recommends a diagnostic algorithm based on clinical and radiological studies supported by mycobacterial culture and sensitivity testing, these methods are slow and lack sensitivity. The addition of molecular methods for detection in the diagnostic algorithm improves detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria, provides prognostic information, can predict resistance to a key TB drug isoniazid, and can be used to track outbreaks. The utility of these techniques has been most evident in",

This clinical study intends to further prospectively verify the accuracy of this prediction model in rectal cancer patients. In this study, we plan to enroll 200 patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer by pathology and MRI, who undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) and total mesorectal excision (TME) and develop RAII during NCRT or within 1 month. We will follow up the occurrence and progression of radiation-induced intestinal injury within 1 year after TME. Expression levels of immune factors will be detected in pathological tissue after TME and applied to the prediction model to predict the chronicization of RAII. Based on the clinical diagnosis of chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury, the area under curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity of this prediction model in predicting the chronicization of RAII will be evaluated.

This 2.6 kb transcript, dubbed D-APC, which was amplified using degenerate primers, appears to result from splicing of alternative transcripts from the gene previously described. The pattern of transcript expression for D-APC is not identical to that of Caenorhabditis elegans APC during late embryogenesis. This suggests that APC may play multiple roles during development in different organisms and that there may be distinct forms of APC. <EOD> Fascioloides magna tegumental antigens modulate host cytokine responses to a LPS challenge: comparison of intravenous, rectal and oral routes of exposure\n\nLuminescent bacteria (LuxS) were detected in the hepatic parenchyma, hepatic vasculature and biliary tree. Additionally, the luminescent biliary ducts were visualized in all groups. These data suggest that the biliary tree is a possible portal of entry and/or a reservoir for O. felineus, in cases of high parasite burden. Moreover, the data presented here also support the use of the hamster model to assess the protective effect of vaccine candidates.AbstractPurpose: The prevalence of opisthorchiasis and the distribution of opisthorchiasisassociated cholangiocarcinoma are increasing in the Asia-Pacific region. Clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of opisthorchiasis-associated antigen (Ov-16) is a safe and efficacious strategy to reduce levels of liver fluke infections. These results support the need for improved methods to detect, define and monitor parasite burden. Methods: Using an ultrasound scan (6.7-13.5-MHz linear intraoperative end-fire array transducer), O. viverrini and its associated larvae were detected in the liver, biliary system and peritoneal cavity. Intravital imaging with bioluminescent light (Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI)-O. viverrini) was utilized to assess parasite dissemination in BALB/c mice; additionally, it identified the sites of larval activity within individual organs and intravascular compartments of the vasculature.

        "summary": "Psychotic disorders are associated with high levels of distress, limitations in quality of life, and a high risk of chronification for those affected. The treatment guidelines recommend combining the pharmacological treatment with psychotherapeutic methods, starting already in the acute phase. At the same time, there is little research evidence on which mechanisms of psychotherapy are most effective and best feasible for the acute setting. Therefore, we want to run a pilot study to test specific psychotherapeutic interventions for patients with psychosis on acute psychiatric wards.\nThe method of Motivational Interviewing is a well-known and established interviewing technique, which originally comes from the treatment of addictive disorders. In our study, it is used to strengthen the therapeutic alliance between patient and practitioner already in the acute phase of the disease, to increase adherence, and thus to achieve the overall goal of better integrating patients with pronounced positive symptoms into treatment. This appears to be extremely important, as non-adherence represents one of the greatest risks for chronification of the disease. The intervention will subsequently be evaluated in comparison to treatment as usual.",

A meta-analysis showed a large effect size of motivational interviewing on substance use and readiness to change [2], which can be transferred into the acute phase of psychosis. Although this method is well accepted in many psychiatric settings, it is not routinely practiced. Especially in the acute inpatient unit with patients severely affected by psychosis, this procedure has never been tested and its implementation in regular psychiatric care is lacking.\n\nAims\n-------\n\nAim of the study is to investigate whether motivational interviewing in acutely ill inpatient patients with psychosis can enhance therapeutic alliance, adherence to treatment and psychological self-efficacy.\n\nEligible patients will receive four brief sessions of motivational interviewing and adherence to treatment, self-efficacy as well as therapeutic alliance will be assessed at different time points. To test whether therapeutic alliance is associated with adherence to treatment and self-efficacy, multiple regression analyses will be computed. Furthermore, comparisons between the MI and the control group will be performed to detect effects between the intervention and a supportive conversation.\n\nIn addition, we will conduct interviews to examine physicians' and psychologists' attitudes towards motivational interviewing. \n\nAims of the CBT\n-------\n- To improve the patients\u2019 personal resources to recover. A first aim is to create an empathic and supportive contact between patient and therapist. The therapist should listen carefully, accept the patient without any prejudices and be supportive and encouraging. This is important as we hypothesize that this enhances therapeutic alliance and subsequently adherence to treatment with a consequent improvement in psychotic symptoms, adherence to treatment and self-efficacy.\n\n- To help the patient to learn coping strategies with the challenges they encounter at this time in order to improve self-management skills. \n\n- To increase the patient's motivation to change and give him/her the opportunity to talk about his/her ambivalence about the use of medication.\n\n- To educate the patient about medication side effects or unwanted effects.\n\nInclusion and Exclusion criteria\n--------------\n- Acute inpatients unit of the Psychiat-\n\nExpected Outcomes\n=============\nThe expected study outcomes will be:\n\n- Enhanced therapeutic alliance\n- Increased adherence to treatment\n- Improved psychological self-efficacy\n- Enhanced therapeutic relationship and non-supportive clinician input by the patient (BARS)\n- Improved subjective medication adherence (BARS)\n\n- Improved therapeutic relationship and negative symptoms by clinician (STAR-C)\n- Improved therapeutic relationship and negative symptoms by patient (STAR-P)\n\n- Improved therapeutic relationship and positive clinician interaction by clinician (STAR-C)\n- Improved patient motivation for psychotherapy\n\nTimetable\n---------------\n\nStart\n=========================== [=]\n\n\nFirst patient, first recruit\n-----------------------------\n\n[*] date and number of signed and witnessed informed consent, date of enrolment\n\n\nExposure\n\nPatient-facing\n------------\n\nVisits\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\nData\n-----------\n\nTiming in days\n\n    (1) 0, at recruitment (baseline)\n\n    (",

CIN is a hallmark of human cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Analyzing CIN of the DNA extracted from cast-off cells in bile samples seems a promising method for diagnosing, monitoring, and predicting the prognosis of biliary tract carcinoma patients. CIN can be assessed using experimental techniques such as bulk DNA sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or conventional karyotyping. However, these techniques are either time-consuming or non-specific. The investigators here intend to study whether a new method named Bile Ultrasensitive Chromosomal Aneuploidy Detection (BileCAD), which is based on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, can be used to analyze CIN and microbial infection analysis thus help diagnosing and treating biliary tract carcinoma patients.",

The current therapeutic options for both lung cancer subtypes are limited due to the lack of effective delivery of drugs and drug molecules to the tumors in the lung. RNA interference (RNAi) strategies targeted at specific key mutations and oncogenes are promising for overcoming the present limitations in lung cancer therapy. However, a challenge with this approach, as well as with other nonviral nucleic acid delivery systems, is low delivery efficiency into the cells, with low cell internalization of delivered DNA/RNA due to their size and susceptibility to degradation, coupled with nonspecific interactions with the airway epithelium. In this paper, we describe pH-responsive polymeric nanoparticles for efficient delivery of siRNA for effective lung gene silencing. These nanoparticles with a core-shell architecture in which siRNA was encapsulated to prevent its degradation into the small bronchial airways before cellular entry have a size of 500 nm. After entering the endosome, proton-activated, pH-sensitive polymeric nanoparticles responded to the low pH of the endosome through protonation of an amino linker, releasing the siRNA into the cytosol. We have demonstrated that the pH-responsive polymeric shell provides a better siRNA delivery performance compared to nonresponsive particles. <EOD> PDZ-SLiM: a PDZ domain surface for specific interactions with short (<15 residue) peptides\nAlthough protein\u2013protein interaction modules, such as SH3, WW, and PDZ domains, typically bind to peptides of 10\u201330 residues, increasing evidence indicates that these modules also interact with short peptides of fewer than 15 residues. While short peptides are generally not able to mimic the full recognition sequence of long peptides, many have nonetheless been shown to interact with their domain modules through a single specific interaction site, often referred to as a short linear motif (SLiM). In this study, an algorithm was used to derive specificity scores for every residue in a series of 230 PDZ domains, and from these, 251 PDZ domain surface sites for specific short peptide-binding sites were identified. These binding sites were termed PDZ-SLiMs. PDZ-SLiM specificity scores on the domain surface could predict short peptide specificity in the majority of cases. Many PDZ-SLiMs were located in close proximity to the pSer-binding pocket of the PDZ domain, an observation that could explain why short peptides are often involved in a wide range of signaling pathways. However, a significant fraction of PDZ-SLiMs were located away from the peptide-binding pocket, which could be important for a number of biological functions, such as membrane organization, protein\u2013protein interaction networks, and targeting proteins to specific localizations. <EOD> Slow and fast muscle metabolism during prolonged exercise.\nEnergy turnover as measured from the recovery of isotopically labelled substrates was increased progressively during 1 h of prolonged moderate (30% VO2 max) cycle ergometer exercise with both fast (biceps brachii) and slow (medial gastrocnemius) leg muscles of nine volunteers (mean age 31 years). The increase in muscle metabolism was greater in slow than in fast muscle. Slow muscle turned over more carcass glucose, amino acids and fatty acids than fast muscle. The turnover of muscle glycogen and intramuscular lipids was decreased progressively to a similar extent in both muscles. The results show that the energy metabolism of",

Flavonoids, naturally found in many plants, have been identified as potentially effective for a variety of pathological conditions, including cancer. In this study, we tested chrysin and naringenin, flavonoids isolated from Citrus fruits, for their ability to inhibit Akt, Erk1/2 and Bcl2 as a method for their potential use to treat glioma.Methods: In vitro glioma cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V staining and flow cytometry and by the detection of the cellular apoptotic markers Bcl2, Bax, and caspase-3. The kinase activity of Akt and Erk1/2 was examined using an antibody-based assay and Western blot analysis.Results: Both chrysin (10 \u22126 , 10 \u22125 , or 10 \u22124 M) and naringenin (200, 400, or 800 \u00b5M) significantly induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in 9L glioma cells.

        "summary": "Schizophrenia represents a significant contributor to the global burden of disease, with this burden disproportionately impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In India, the burden due to schizophrenia is further exacerbated by low access to effective psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting recovery, rehabilitation, and community tenure, as well as inadequate attention to managing co-occurring chronic medical conditions that result in significantly reduced life expectancy among those living with schizophrenia compared to the general population. A major driver of these alarming gaps in access to care for persons with schizophrenia in India is the limited capacity within primary care settings aimed at addressing the complex co-occurring mental health, physical health, and functional needs of this patient population. There now exists strong evidence demonstrating that community programs delivered in primary care and leveraging psychosocial interventions combined with linkage to specialty psychiatric services are effective for supporting treatment and recovery of schizophrenia in low-resource settings. We will leverage our existing collaboration and robust research infrastructure in both rural and urban settings in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, India to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate whether the use of a digital platform offers added clinical benefit and can support integration of this task shared care for schizophrenia into routine primary care settings. We will address the following aims: 1) evaluate whether the use of the mindLAMP digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness of task-shared community-based psychosocial rehabilitation (COPSI) for individuals with schizophrenia, and 2) determine whether the addition of mindLAMP to the delivery of the COPSI program has an impact on implementation metrics when compared to delivery of COPSI alone.",

They were divided into acute appendicitis group and non-appendicitis group. Clinical, US, three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US), computed tomography (CT), and radiological diagnosis were compared in differentiating acute appendicitis. Clinical features, US, 3D-US, CT and radiological diagnosis had high accuracy (>75%). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of clinical diagnosis were all low. US had no significant differences (P>0.05) in terms of 84.9-89.8% sensitivity, 78.6-86.2% specificity, 78.9-87.6% positive predictive value, 86.0-90.0% negative predictive value, 71.5-79.5% diagnostic accuracy and 2.71-3.81 likelihood ratios (LR) for acute appendicitis diagnosis (acute appendicitis group versus non-appendicitis group). 3D-US had higher sensitivity (91.5%) and lower specificity (53.3%) than US, resulting in 90.4-91.1% of diagnostic accuracy with positive LR of 1.86-2.48 and negative LR of 0.08-0.17 (acute appendicitis group versus non-appendicitis group). The accuracy of US combined with 3D-US, CT, and radiological diagnosis was higher than US and 3D-US. US and 3D-US can accurately diagnose acute appendicitis by observing the size of appendix, wall thickness, and diameter of appendix lumen. The use of 3D-US is recommended to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, while US combined with other methods is more accurate than US or 3D-US alone if the results are similar.\n\n# Introduction\nAppendicitis is one of the most common causes of emergency care and surgical admission, accounting for about one million appendicitis-related hospital visits per year, of which 90.0% is acute appendicitis in the United States. Clinical study showed that abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa (RIF) is considered the typical symptom for appendicitis patients. However, it is not absolute. When acute appendicitis attacks, RIF pain is accompanied by nausea and vomit in 70.0% of patients, and accompanied by pain in lower right quadrant of abdomen in only 20.0% of patients. In addition, 2.5-30.0% of patients had abdominal pain and 2.5-49.0% had nausea or vomit, but had no abdominal pain in 12.0% and lower right quadrant tenderness in 66.0%. This is partly why the gold standard diagnostic method of appendicitis is surgery because the pathophysiology of this disease is not well understood. Without early and efficient treatment, rupture and perforation will ensue after 1-2 days, which leads to increased morbidity rate and mortality rate. Since 1914, ultrasound (US) examination for acute appendicitis has been conducted by several different surgeon groups, but it was unable to find specific US features of appendicitis. Since 1978, US was gradually applied in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis clinically, with reported sensitivity of 80.0-90.0%, and specificity of 80.0-95.6%.

        "summary": "Cardiac transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy with an inexorably progressive clinical course and poor prognosis. The disease is caused by misfolding of the liver-derived precursor protein transthyretin as a result of an acquired wild-type variant (ATTRwt) or as a hereditary mutant variant (ATTRm). Application of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides greater anatomic resolution, enabling the assessment of amyloid burden within individual left ventricle segments.This study aims to describe the pattern of regional myocardial distribution of 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanedicarboxylic acid (DPD) SPECT uptake among patients with ATTRwt and ATTRm. It will investigate the clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic, including left ventricle longitudinal strain profile in ATTRwt and ATTRm. Moreover, we will evaluate the presence and extent of DPD cardiac uptake among asymptomatic ATTRm variants carriers.This is a prospective multi-center observational study. The study, after obtaining prior written informed consent, will include consecutive patients who have Grade 1-3 cardiac DPD retention in scintigraphy. In addition, first-degree relatives of patients with ATTRm are going to be enrolled. Patients are going to undergo TTR gene sequencing to assess the presence of pathogenic variants associated with ATTRm. Both planar scintigraphy, SPECT and speckle-tracking echocardiography will be reviewed and interpreted using visual and quantitative approaches.",

Characteristics of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus and Infection of Host Cells. Viruses 2022, 14, 998. https://doi.\n\n# Introduction\nThe Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) is an economically devastating pathogen of livestock animals belonging to the genus Pestivirus and family Flaviviridae   BVDV viremia monitoring in cattle following treatment with bovine viral diarrhea modified-live..., Sivula  . BVDV is further subdivided into two subtypes, biotypes 1 and 2 (BVDV1 and BVDV2), based on antigenic, genomic, host specificity, and biological characteristics. Furthermore, the subtype 1 virus exists either as cytopathic or noncytopathic, while the subtype two virus is cytopathic   Biological characterization of two bovine viral diarrhea virus subtype 1 isolates with..., Kim  . Two subtypes of BVDV exhibit differences in pathogenicity; the noncytopathic BVDV (nbpBVDV) is known as a biotype 1 virus and is noncytopathogenic because of its inability to replicate in cell culture in contrast to the cytopathic BVDV (cpBVDV). However, ncpBVDV (biotype 1) has tropism for the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), while the cpBVDV (biotype 2) has tropism for epithelial cells in different organs such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts. It is also capable of targeting the endothelium of the blood vessels and leukocytes   Molecular biology and pathogenesis of bovine viral diarrhea virus, Salvati  . However, it is not clear why the ncpBVDV has tropism for leukocytes and the cpBVDV towards epithelial cells.\nSeveral host immune responses are mounted against pestivirus infection; however, it still remains unknown how pestivirus modulates the innate immune response of the host. The initial responses of the innate immune system against pestiviruses include type I interferon production mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signal-dependent kinase (MAVS) sensing of viral dsRNA during infection   Biology of pestiviruses, Enders  . Furthermore, interferon-inducible genes such as MxA, OAS-1, and IFIT-5 are essential for the induction of multiple antiviral responses   Early innate immune responses to bovine viral diarrhea virus, Hern\u00e1ndez     Bovine viral diarrhoea virus induces the delayed expression of IFN-stimulated genes, Davies  . BVDV can also circumvent these IFNmediated antiviral responses by downregulating the induction of interferon-stimulated genes   Figure 1: Schematic diagram displaying the interferon-mediated innate immune responses against pestiviruses     Interplay between pestivirus and the type I interferon response, Peterhoff  .\nSeveral studies have highlighted the infection kinetics of pestiviruses in animals. Bovine Pestiviruses (BPVs), for instance, infect the macrophages of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes within 2-4 h, and it takes about 14-24 h to develop clinical signs. Subsequently, it enters the spleen and inactivated cells from the spleen are infected by viruses   Early innate immune responses to bovine viral diarrhea virus, Hern\u00e1ndez     Immune parameters in Pestivirus infection, Guti\u00e9rrez-G",

        "summary": "Approximately 65, 000 hip fractures occur in the United Kingdom (UK) each year, and more than 99% are repaired by surgery. Roughly half of patients receive spinal anaesthesia, where a small amount (usually less than half a teaspoonful) of local anaesthetic is injected into the lower back, around the nerves that go to and from the hip.\nLow blood pressure is very common during surgery (at least > 30%, depending on definition), and appears to be linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery.\nThere are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. National guidelines recommend that lower doses are given, but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately or often enough.\nThe Anaesthesia Sprint Audit of Practice (ASAP) 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.5 mls of spinal anaesthesia is given, and the investigator has been using this amount in Brighton since 2011. Recently, the investigator has reported a way of transferring vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (e.g. in Coroner's investigations: approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery).\nHowever, analyzing such observational data should also allow the investigator to describe accurately how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (e.g. the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, the investigator hopes to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery, potentially improving people's survival and recovery after hip fracture.",

The methods compared were the use of serially diluted, pooled sera, the use of individual canine serum samples diluted to a defined end dilution, and the use of canine serum samples pooled at 4 log10 antibody titers.

Additional experimentation will be required to substantiate the observed positive effects. <EOD> Infection in Children With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Review.\nBoth the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are rising worldwide, including in pediatric populations. It is no longer uncommon for children with IBD to require lifelong immunosuppression due to the complex immunological defects in the gastrointestinal tract that are involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. This, along with the use of other immunosuppressant medications, puts children with IBD on a higher risk of infection, and the infectious disease risk in this population is increasingly recognized. While it has long been established that immunosuppressants confer a risk of serious infections, there has been concern about increased infections in adults with IBD, but not children. Here we review the risks of infection in children with IBD and discuss the epidemiology of infection in pediatric patients and the evidence supporting increased risk in this population. <EOD> .\nWe determined the concentration of 18 elements in serum of 34 subjects of an area close to La Coru\u00f1a who were all exposed to high levels of nickel since the 50s to be able to assess them as an integral element of the Environmental and Occupational Health Monitoring System of La Coru\u00f1a (MSEOACor). Serum metals were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry using an Atomscan Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer with a 120-discharge tube with the double air-acetylene flame and slit monochromators of 3 lines in the spectra. We detected 18 elements: V, Cr, Cd, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Mo, Ni, Al, Hg, Zr, Ce and Pb. We determined a reference study group from the general population of Galicia, comparing the concentration of metals in serum of exposed subjects with the reference group to find out if the serum levels of the exposed group differed from the reference group. Finally, the values found were compared to the data of another similar study group which had a reference group which had not been exposed to these metals in the last 30 years. The statistical study on these results has been applied by computing Student test. At first, we considered V, Cu, Zn, Pb, Hg, Al, Mo, Ni and Cd since they are essential elements, Mn since it is very important to evaluate the toxicity of nickel, Fe for the same reason and Co which is a tracer of other compounds. We consider As, Co, Rb and Cr of interest due to some reports of these in the environment. The results are discussed through the comparison between the two study groups, exposed and non-exposed. For every element except for Al, the concentration in the exposed group had p < 0.05 or p < 0.01. We discuss the possible sources of the differences between both groups.

The age at presentation ranged from 1 to 82 years. Hearing loss was the usual presenting complaint, even though tinnitus, balance symptoms and dizziness were the main clinical feature in 30 patients. The underlying pathology was reported in 42 patients but eight had no identified cause. Trauma was a reported cause in four cases. Men had a higher incidence of middle ear abnormalities and cochlear degeneration. However, there was no relationship between sex and cochlear or vestibular abnormalities.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe clinical and audiological features of the perilymph fistula overlap with many other diseases including acute audiovestibular and vestibular disorders. Thus clinical judgement and experience is essential. <EOD> Tympanoplasty: a preliminary report.\nFifty two patients were operated during the period March, 1989 to September, 1993 for various types of tympanoplasties and their records analysed. Nineteen patients were from a tertiary level teaching hospital; the remaining 33 were referred to the Unit as a last resort from peripheral level hospitals by ENT Unit Head, Department of Surgery, M. D. U., T. B. Hospital, Roorkee where they were not operated either for various reasons and lack of expertise or facilities. There were 35 males and 17 females, mean age of 35.5 years and 59% in 3rd Decade. All cases of chronic middle ear disease and hearing loss were included in the study except those having coated and mutilated tympanum and labyrinthitis (3 cases), cerebellopontine angle tumour and neurogenic deafness (7 cases) and deafness due to congenital anomalies and labyrinthitis. All patients had the basic preoperative investigations, namely Otoscopy and Audiometry. Preoperative pus was obtained in 53% patients. The results, although not too significant in a small series are encouraging and indicate the need of this type of training at district level hospitals. It is hoped that this teaching program will improve the present unsatisfactory situation. <EOD> .\nOn the basis of an intensive 11-year-examination the authors determined the frequency of the disease. In 6268 examined children the age incidence amounted to 0.3%, the hereditary predisposition is 35%. Epilepsy is very frequently associated with congenital malformations (60%). An epileptic seizure frequently recurs. The course of the disease in the first five years is unfavourable in 70% of the children. <EOD> Interleukin-2 therapy and Hodgkin's disease.\nIn summary, high-dose IL-2 did not have a positive clinical effect in patients with advanced refractory HD. In addition, it was accompanied by a number of hazards, two of which-one being myocardial infarct/death and the other possibly being pulmonary edema--needed to be prevented by rigorous patient selection and close observation and aggressive medical therapy. In contrast, the therapeutic index of IL-2 therapy may in fact be higher in patients who are not pretreatment refractory to chemotherapy. At this point, two open IL-2 trials for patients with pretreatment refractory progressive or relapsed HD are ongoing in NCI. If one or both trials proves positive, then IL-2 therapy will be available as second- or third-line treatment for this indication. This is an important accomplishment, and it appears to represent the first agent active against this disease with acceptable toxicity and minimal myelosuppression. <EOD> LIP",

We aimed to assess prognostic factors of survival and trends in cancer\u2010specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was designed using data from the SEER database from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2017. Patients were grouped into 3 cohorts for each year based on 3 stages: localized, regional, and distant stage. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify prognostic factors for survival among patients with colorectal cancer. Results: The total sample was comprised of 293,861 patients, including 219,759 patients (74.61%) at localized stage; 340,328 (117,070  at regional stage; and 379,451 (156,753  at a distant stage in 2013 to 2017, respectively.

Conclusion: Cancer\u2010specific mortality, which may be related to tumor or metastasis invasion, has increased in colorectal cancer patients. A better prognosis may have led to increased cancer\u2010specific survival. <EOD> .\nOn the basis of clinical and pharmacological experience a method for psychiatric diagnosis is described by using combined doses of 5-HTP and imipramine. The test involves a systematic clinical evaluation 3, 6 and 12 h after a single oral dose of imipramine (50 mg or 100 mg) and 150 mg of 5-HTP on the first day, and 150 mg of 5-HTP and 50 mg of imipramine on the second day. A rating of \"mild\" to \"excellent\" response is used for the psychosocial behaviour of drug treated patients. The results are interpreted according to the pharmacological interactions induced by the combined use of these drugs. In the presence of a good relationship between the clinical result and the drug interaction, a definite diagnosis is possible. The method was applied on a group of patients hospitalized for schizophrenia, and on a group of female patients hospitalized for anxiety neurosis and depressive neurosis. The results suggest the existence of a distinctive profile of depressive and anxious-paranoid patients among schizophrenic patients, which are clearly recognizable for the clinician by a simple test. <EOD> Cucurbituril-induced isomers of a series of 1,10-phenanthrolines in aprotic organic solvents.\nCucurbituril (CB) hosts the series of 1,10-phenanthrolines P1H (R = Me, Et, iPr, and Bn) and P2H (R = Cy, Me, Et, iPr, and Bn) to form the 1:1 inclusion complexes P1H@CB (1) and P2H@CB (2) in protic solvents, and P1H@CB (3) and P2H@CB (4) in aprotic solvents.

        "summary": "Electro fetal monitor monitoring in the antepartum and intrapartum periods is one of the most important responsibilities of midwives, who have important roles and responsibilities in maintaining and managing the health of women and newborns before, during and after delivery. Although midwives receive training on EFM monitoring with classical methods before graduation, they may experience problems in EFM monitoring in the clinical field after graduation. For this reason, midwife students should have the knowledge, skills and self-efficacy about a good level of EFM monitoring during their undergraduate education. In recent years, simulation-based education in the field of health has increased rapidly. This method creates an opportunity for health professionals, students, patient assessment, interaction and holistic care without compromising patient safety, and develops participants' critical thinking, clinical decision making and problem solving skills.\nIn this context, it is very important to evaluate the EFM trace in the antepartum and intrapartum periods, to determine the possible risks, to plan, implement and evaluate the interventions, to provide the emergency crisis management in a short time without affecting the fetal health, and to increase the self-confidence of the midwives.\nThe research was planned quantitatively in the form of randomized control-intervention of the scenario-based realistic simulation method, to increase the satisfaction and self-confidence levels of midwifery students in learning, to evaluate the simulation design and educational effectiveness, in EFM management. The research will facilitate midwifery students to intervene with the patient in a shorter time, with confidence and with sufficient clinical skills, and patient safety will be increased. It will also allow for the reduction of erroneous clinical practices and malpractices.\nThis research aims to evaluate the effect of high-fidelity simulation teaching method on knowledge, satisfaction and self-efficacy of midwifery students in EFM follow-up.",

We measured the concentration of methaemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation immediately after exposure in 16 men who ingested 1.2%, 3.75%, 6.67% and 7.5% formaldehyde solution and compared them to a control group of subjects who only ingested water. Twelve of 16 subjects who ingested the formaldehyde became affected with a rise in methaemoglobin concentration higher than the control group. Methaemoglobinaemia was more severe in the 7.5% formaldehyde group when compared to 1.2%, 3.75% and 6.67% groups. A significant decrease in oxygen saturation was observed in the 1.2% group and less significant decreases in all formaldehyde groups with higher increase observed in the 7.5% group when compared to the control group. We concluded that formaldehyde solution can cause methaemoglobinaemia, with a significant decrease in arterial oxygen saturation dose-dependent fashion. <EOD> Exposure of Chinese college athletes to potentially harmful activities and substances\n\n\n\n# | introduction\nChina's Ministry of Education and State General Administration of Sports have issued policies prohibiting college athletes from having hazardous hobbies (such as smoking, hanging out at night, or consuming alcohol), excessive exercise, or the consumption of energy drinks or caffeine.

Radio frequency cautery is shown to be a faster and more efficient method to use if the surgeon is willing to risk the possible complications that may be associated with this method. Although the use of an ultralow-setting carbon dioxide laser is shown to be a safer procedure and provides better hemostasis, use of the laser is time consuming due to the small tissue lesions that are created. However, for lesions that are small in size, surgical precision is paramount, and use of a low setting is beneficial due to the small diameter of the necrotic regions that are created. <EOD> The GHSR is involved in the modulation of lipid metabolism in rats after a high-fat diet\n\nBackground and Aims: The liver plays a critical role in regulating energy metabolism, including cholesterol biosynthesis. However, the metabolic mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear. The expression levels of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) in skeletal muscle and its influence on whole-body metabolism have been reported previously. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of the GHSR in the regulation of liver lipids and glucose metabolism by using a high-fat diet (HFD) induced NAFLD rat model. Methods: Liver damage in HFD induced rats was evaluated by histologic and biochemical assessments. We analyzed hepatic lipid accumulation and the expression levels of Ghsr in rat livers of normal, HFD, and HFD plus intracerebroventricular melanotan-II (i.c.v.-MTT) (HFD/MTT) groups to assess the function of the GHSR in the liver. Metabolic cage, indirect calorimetry, and the insulin tolerance test were conducted to evaluate lipid and glucose metabolism. The expression levels of key enzymes that participate in lipid metabolism were measured using western blotting. Results: We showed that MTT, an agonist of the GHSR, decreased lipid deposition in rats that were fed HFD. Additionally, the expression levels of Ghsr in liver sections were decreased in rats that were fed HFD. The expression levels of key enzymes that participate in lipid metabolism showed opposite trends in the HFD/MTT group compared with the HFD group, indicating an improved metabolic profile. Overall, our study demonstrated that blocking the activation of the GHSR can improve lipid homeostasis in rats fed an HFD. Conclusion: We found that MTT, an agonist of the GHSR, can protect against liver injury while improving lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in HFD animals. MTT may be a potential treatment for NAFLD by acting on the brain liver axis.\n\n# Introduction\nThe gastrointestinal tract can sense and produce incretins such as glucagonlike peptide-1(GLP-1)and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) when eating the meal 1 .

However, we do question the authors' interpretation of their results. In our opinion, some of the authors' conclusions regarding the safety of treatment can be misleading and erroneously reassuring to patients, clinicians, and investigators. We suggest that a more careful analysis of the results would be helpful to all of those who work with HIV-infected adolescents. This is particularly important as a consequence of the unique study population and the unique characteristics of the treatment regimen.\nThe AAA study population differs very clearly from other study populations of HIV-infected individuals. Adolescents who are already diagnosed as being infected with HIV, while they continue to develop, have usually already been exposed to a considerable amount of psychological distress because of knowing they are infected with a potentially lethal disease and they are in the process of adjusting to the psychological distress associated with disclosure of being HIV-infected. If they have a close relationship with the adult caregiver or parents, even more so because of the stigma of AIDS, they generally face not only fears associated with their own health, but also with their families. With regard to the specific characteristics of the AAA study population, we are also concerned that, by enrolling both those who are infected \"perinatally\" (presumed infection being at birth) and those who are infected \"postnatally\" (presumed infection during the subsequent development of the immune system), the \"perinatal\" group will probably respond differently psychologically and behaviorally to the adolescent population as a whole. The impact of exposure to HIV, including any family discord that this infection causes, may not be readily apparent in AAA until a late phase of adolescence, when the cognitive and social development of the participants is fully functional. This may mean that these participants may show signs and symptoms of HIV-induced distress in a later phase of adolescence than those participants who were infected \"postnatally.\" The latter group will already have attained a very high level of adaptation to the HIV-infected status.\nAs regards the treatment regimen, we agree with the investigators, except that we do not feel that it is particularly advantageous to participants because of its nonmodern nature. We are therefore concerned that using this treatment regimen is disadvantageous because it does not maximize the chances for survival and because its possible consequences, such as significant toxicity, can easily be missed by clinicians and researchers. Because of its unique characteristics, namely, the use of a toxic drug at low dosage (zidovudine) and the absence of a protease inhibitor, the treatment regimen of the AAA study cannot be expected to be tolerated as well by participants as the treatments currently recommended (1). As a consequence, there is a substantial chance that the adolescents in the study would prematurely have switched to another treatment that was more acceptable to them-and would certainly have resulted in higher rates of viral suppression and lower clinical and immunological progression, with substantially better long-term outcomes. Moreover, because this treatment regimen is not standard-of-",

In this study, the experimental group who received music therapy in palliative care services was evaluated. The participants listened to the relaxing music playlist which was composed of instrumental music containing elements such as nature sounds (foggy forest, ocean waves, babbling stream) as well as music pieces composed specifically for this study. 5% of lavender oil was used in the aromatherapy and aromatherapy inhaler group. Data were collected three times with a questionnaire consisting of four parts before and after music, at the beginning of every music session, at the beginning of every aromatherapy session and after five minutes of aromatherapy, after listening to the music at the end of the session, and at the beginning of the third, fifth, and seventh days. The data obtained in the study showed that both aromatherapy and music effectively reduce pain, anxiety, and vital parameters, improve sleep quality and mood, and increase positive states. However, this study has a number of limitations, such as only male patients being included in the study, not randomly grouping the patients, only evaluating in five days, etc. All study results should be evaluated by considering these characteristics.\n\nThe study also shows that aromatherapy and musical stimuli can have a positive impact on pain control in palliative patient by reducing anxiety and improving vital parameters and states like sleep quality and mood.\n\nThe patients with a cancer diagnosis undergoing palliative treatment who are experiencing anxiety, stress, and pain have a high level of psychologic and somatic distress. Aromatherapy and music therapy can be effective in reducing anxiety, reducing pain and controlling the state.

Hereby, we aimed to reveal the role of different diagnostic modalities in preoperative and postoperative management of a rare lesion of the sphenoid sinus. Paraganglioma of the sphenoid sinus has not been described, and the presented case is a rarity. A 21-year-old man was presented with complaints of headaches and fatigue. Physical examination, cranial computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging showed a right lateralized lesion of the sphenoid sinus. A biopsy confirmed a paraganglioma pathologically. Due to the difficulty and risk of the total resection of the lesion, adjuvant radiotherapy was planned. The treatment was well-tolerated, and follow-up visits were planned. Paragangliomas of the head and neck region are rare tumors, and paragangliomas of the sphenoid sinus are rarities of head and neck region, and these neuroendocrine neoplasms may remain clinically undetected until they are detected during radiological investigations performed for unrelated conditions. Computed tomography may be superior to magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis of paragangliomas and can be a part of postoperative radiographic followup. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice.

In this sense, here we explore the in silico hypothesis based on a previous study that suggests inhibiting COVID-19 entry by interfering with the binding site of the virus in the host cell. Thus, we applied an in silico docking analysis to investigate the interactions between the membrane protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its partner the Spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2. The obtained results strongly suggest that this interaction of the two proteins is inhibited by ACE2 chemical groups at the N terminal (aa 1-615).

The most obvious examples of endothelial dysfunction include changes in vasoregulation, coagulation, and adhesion. The vasoactive properties of endothelial cells are closely regulated and mediated primarily by two distinct and opposing vasoactive agents. Nitric oxide is a major mediator of endothelium-derived vasodilatation, and endogenously produced prostaglandins enhance endothelium-dependent vasoregulation. The cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 induce an endothelium-derived hyperconstriction, leading to vasoconstriction. The mediators of endothelium-dependent vasoregulation and the endothelial inflammatory response are interlinked and interdependent. This is most notably seen in the acute and chronic effects of IL-1 on the vascular endothelium. The acute effects of IL-1 include hyperconstriction and release of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), whereas the chronic actions of this cytokine impair EDHF/nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation. IL-1 induces an acute inhibition, and a chronic impairment, of EDHF, which is mediated, at least in part, via inhibition of endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity. In addition to the effects on constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity, IL-1 also induces an acetylation of cyclooxygenases and may modulate vascular prostaglandin production. The cyclooxygenase pathway, in turn, may contribute to a loss of vascular prostaglandin activity in IL-1/tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-treated endothelial cells. Thus, interrelationships between endothelial cell mediators result in amplification of the initial vasoactive response. Recent evidence suggests that IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 modulate endothelial function in vivo. This provides further evidence that these proinflammatory cytokines mediate cellular injury through modulation of cellular function. <EOD> Clinicopathological Study of Gastric Adenomas\n\nBackground: Gastric adenoma is an uncommon precancerous lesion of gastric cancer.

A strong bias was observed in the correlation of ADCC assays and treatment outcomes-for example, in the ADCC assay with HL60 cells and rituximab, the FcgammaRIIIa 158-Val/Val patients showed improved clinical response and prolonged time without relapse (P < 0.05), demonstrating the importance of CD16(V158) in rituximab-based therapy. Importantly, these trends were also evident in the FcgammaRIIa (V131) polymorphism allele, known to be relevant for type I interferons, vaccination, and viral infection, suggesting the presence of a general biological feature that is common to the immunological processes required for immunity and cancer thrombi and for tumor cells targeting with antibodies. <EOD> Acute Renal Failure Complicating Surgery for Blunt Injuries to the Kidney\nSurgical treatment of blunt injuries to the kidney is associated with a higher incidence of posttraumatic acute renal failure compared to surgery for penetrating kidney injuries or nonoperative treatment of blunt kidney injuries. The factors most likely to increase the incidence of postoperative acute renal failure are: 1) the volume of blood lost. 2) the duration of ischemia; and 3) the presence of other injuries or risk factors. Acute renal failure is more likely in those with multiple organ injury, major soft tissue injury, vascular injuries and injuries to the liver. An understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of acute renal failure in trauma patients and the principles of renal replacement therapy allow the intensivist to evaluate the renal function in this complex clinical group, intervene early in the course of posttraumatic renal impairment, and manage complications related to acute renal failure. <EOD> Genetic Characterization and Sequence Analysis of Virulence Plasmids from Diverse Salmonella enterica Isolates\nABSTRACT Salmonella enterica is a major cause of food-borne illness worldwide, and genetic elements carried on virulence plasmids promote pathogenicity by contributing genes involved in pathophysiological functions. The genes on these plasmids are found not only in clinical isolates but also in a variety of S. enterica serotypes. To gain insight into the genetic structure of the plasmids, comparative sequencing was performed on 22 plasmids from Salmonella isolates from clinical, animal, and food origins. A total of nine plasmids were analyzed, carrying the iro and rck genes and their associated promoters, and the SPI-1 and SPI-2 virulence factors identified. The iro and rck systems, also called enterobactin synthesis genes, are linked to genes in the SPI-2 plasmids. The SPI-1 plasmids carry two genes, sopE and sopB that encode two effector proteins involved in Salmonella invasion, and the SPI-1 virulence plasmid has no other genes on it. The S",

In the US, about 52,480 people will be diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2017.\n\nRisk factors\n==================\nBladder cancer can affect people of any gender but is more common in older males than in older females. It can be associated with smoking cigarettes or having cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or pelvic radiation.\nHow HER2 works in cancer\n=======================\n\n\nCells normally make proteins that help them grow and divide into new cells. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a growth factor protein receptor. HER2 is activated by a growth factor called HER2-Neu. When activated, it can either increase or decrease the growth rate of cancer cells, depending what other molecules are around.\nWhat is HER2-Neu?\n====================\n\n\nA growth factor receptor is a receptor that a growth factor (protein) attaches to to trigger cancer cell division. There are several different ways (different paths) in which cancer cells can be activated by a growth factor. This means that if one path is targeted then cancer cells may activate and grow through another path, becoming resistant to treatments that target the first path.\n\nOther targets for cancer drugs\n==============================\n\n\nMolecules known as monoclonal antibodies are immunotherapy drugs that block a growth factor or a growth factor receptor like HER2-Neu from working to make more cancer cells. HER2-Neu is the growth factor for HER2. Because it is also a protein, monoclonal antibodies can be made to fit snugly in a specific cancer protein like HER2-Neu. They stick inside a tumor, and make sure that this molecule is blocked from working, stopping the signals inside and outside of your cancer cells. This blocks the cancer cells from growing.\nWhat is Disitamab Vedotin?\n======================\n\n\nDisitamab vedotin (paclitaxel (Taxol) conjugated to a monoclonal antibody that blocks growth factor receptor HER2 or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a drug that targets the pathway for growth factor HER2-Neu. It may help reduce the number of cancer cells and increase the number of good healthy cells in your tumor.",

Crohn's disease can lead to nutrient deficiencies and has unpredictable flare-ups and remission periods. During the remission phases, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms can persist in 50% of patients, for which no satisfactory treatment is available yet.\nChitin-glucan is prebiotic, obtained by extraction, isolation and purification from a fungal resource: the mycelium of Aspergillus niger (a microscopic fungus of the Ascomycetes family) of which it composes the cell walls.

Do not explain how you summarize it.\nInput Text: A Novel Biomarker for Response and Prognosis of HBV-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\nDetailed Description\n---------------------------------------------\nResidual tumors and early recurrence/metastasis after radiotherapy (RT) compromise the patient survival with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Timely detecting residual/recurrence/metastasis and the clonality is required to implement salvage therapies properly. The major unmet needs of radiotherapy to HCC are the difficulties in early evaluating response by images and timely detection of intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis. Thus, an accurate and personalized biomarker for response prediction and disease monitoring is demanded. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA (ctDNA) has garnered attention as a promising biomarker in cancer patients. However, in HCC, the detection rate is low (9-21.2%), mainly due to the limited prevalence of traditional somatic mutations and the difficult separation of ctDNA fragments from normal cells. The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing RT. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of salvage therapies. The investigators will first use our previously collected serum samples and surgical/biopsied tissues from HBV-related HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases. The same junction clones from pre-post-RT serums and surgical tissues will be confirmed and the copy number changes of vh-DNA be correlated with RT response and disease-control status.

According to Park and Folkman's (1997) Meaning-Making Model, the process of meaning making functions as a coping mechanism. It helps individuals adapt challenging experiences into their lives, ultimately assisting in their psychological adjustment to stressful situations. Based on this theoretical model, principles from meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), literature reviews, interviews with breast cancer patients, and expert consultation, an 8-week online individual psychological intervention was developed. It was aimed at facilitating the finding of new meanings in the experience of breast cancer and promoting psychological well-being. It includes psycho-educational, cognitive, existential, and behavioral components explicitly focusing on the meaning-making process. This intervention is called the Meaning Centered Coping Program (MCCP). The main purpose of this study was to test whether the MCCP was an effective intervention program for women diagnosed with breast cancer. For this purpose, the study sample consisted of women with stage I, II, and III breast cancer. Then, participants were randomly assigned to the MCCP group and the wait-list control group. A number of reliable and valid measurement tools were used to compare the MCCP group with the waitlist control group and to examine the effect of the program.

A case report of successful induction of abortion and delivery of the viable fetus with rapid induction to remission after successful chemotherapy\nSummary. An acute myeloid leukaemia affecting a 43\u2010year\u2010old woman 10 days postpartum is described. Hydroxycarbamide 2.5\u2003g, 3 times daily was administered until a remission was achieved before the 36th week of pregnancy and at the 25th day post\u2010partum. The remission was maintained for 36\u2003months. Induction of labour was achieved with oxytocic infusion 5\u2003mU 2\u2003h\u20101, after abortion was induced. To maintain patency of the fetal circulation and pulmonary vasculature, after fetal lungs were seen on echography, the patient also received 6 units of fresh frozen plasma prior to inducing the abortion. The fetus, delivered vaginally, was healthy. Subsequent cytogenetic analysis of the placental tissue was normal. After termination of vaginal delivery, one of the twins became clinically ill and was transfused with red cells, the other remained healthy and was discharged the same day, 7\u2003days postcaesarean section. The ill baby died 5\u2003days later. <EOD> Inhibition of the proteasome modulates endothelial activation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo\n\nBackground: The proteasome, and in particular its catalytic subunit \u03b25, is indispensable for the angiogenic potential and metastatic potential of tumor cells, indicating that the proteasome is a novel therapeutic target for metastatic disease. However, the role of the proteasome remains to be defined in nonshedded cell types such as endothelial cells used in angiogenesis assays.

Physiological concentrations function as cellular signalling molecules involved in the regulation of many key physiological processes. The nervous system is susceptible to oxidative stress due to its high consumption of oxygen, its susceptibility to iron, and high polyunsaturated fatty-acid content in membrane phospholipid. The present study is an attempt to study the effects of ROS using in vivo experimental model. The study deals with the role of superoxide dismutase, catalase and malondialdehyde as an index of lipid peroxidation following treatment with different experimental antioxidant on the methamphetamine treated rats. The level of MDA is reduced on treatment with different experimental antioxidants. Lipid peroxidation occurs in the hippocampus and cortical regions of rat brain which is reduced after administration of vitamin C and N-acetyl-cysteine. <EOD> The effect of maternal depressive symptoms on child behavior in healthy and asthmatic samples: examining mediation and moderation effects by caregiving behaviors and maternal psychological distress.\nBACKGROUND\nPrior studies have suggested that high levels of maternal depression may be related to higher rates of child behavior problems. This relationship has been examined in healthy and clinical populations of children, but these studies have not incorporated caregiver factors as moderators and mediators of this relationship.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMothers of healthy (n = 341) children and asthmatic (n = 105) children completed measures of depressive symptoms, caregiving behaviors, and child behavior as part of a 2-year cross-lag study of depressive symptoms, caregiving behavior, and child behavior in healthy and medically ill children.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMothers of healthy and asthmatic children reported significant increases in observed negative caregiving behavior (i.e., rejecting emotional communication) as mothers reported higher levels of depressive symptoms. There were no differences, however, in reported positive caregiving behaviors (i.e., teaching emotional communication) in mothers of healthy and asthmatic children. Children of mothers who reported higher levels of depressive symptoms displayed more externalizing behavior problems later, even after controlling for initial levels of behavior problems.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFindings from the current study suggest that observed patterns of caregiving behavior may partially explain longitudinal increases in child behavior problems, observed both as a function of initial levels of child behavior problems as well as observed increases of behavior problems related to high levels of depressive symptoms in mothers. <EOD> A rapid assay for quantifying endogenous inhibitor(s) of rat liver microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase and esterases.\n1.

The increase of the admittances rate from 1 to 3 cases per month during the period 1965-69, and the rise of the number of the hospitalized patients from 25 to 31 per year are noted. The increase of the hospitalization has been attributed to the increase of the frequency of the appendicitis and in a less extent of the acute gastroduodenal ulcer. The average age of the patients suffering from appendicitis and gastroduodenal ulcer has been also increased during the recent years. The decrease of the average age was especially notable in the patients with the appendicitis and suppurative gastroduodenal ulcer. As far as the emergency surgery is concerned, it has been a cause of increasing admittances rate of the surgical patients. The hospitalization of some of these patients has been rather short due to the insufficient medical care in the postoperative period and so the average duration of the hospitalization has been inhibited. <EOD> FDA Approves Vactosertib To Inhibit mTOR Pathway\n\n\n\n# Background\nRenal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is a malignant type of kidney tumor.

However, it also increases the risk of ischemic complications in patients. The current standard dual antiplatelet regimen is considered crucial in reducing thrombotic events. Nevertheless, some patients exhibit resistance to antiplatelet drugs, which puts them at a higher risk of thrombotic events. In clinical practice, there is a lack of standardized platelet function testing and consensus on adjusting antiplatelet drug programs. This study conducted a multi-center, prospective cluster randomized controlled trial to investigate whether antiplatelet adjustment therapy guided by light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) detection can decrease the occurrence of ischemic events after stent implantation in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

Several lines of evidence suggest that I(T) may also play a role in neural progenitor activity and neural stem cell (NSC) lineage determination. I(T) is selectively and densely distributed in the stem and progenitor cell populations of the neurogenic niche in the dorsal subventricular zone, dentate gyrus, and spinal cord. Because of these findings, we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of I(T) should lead preferentially to loss of neural progenitor cells. This inhibition may be most appropriate for slowing progenitor cell proliferation as opposed to complete suppression of NSC proliferation. We directly tested this premise by performing a colony forming assay in the presence and absence of mibefradil. T-type calcium channels are composed of three subunits (alpha1G, alpha1H, and alpha1I); hence, we reasoned that the specific role of each of the three T-channel subunits might be determined by selective knock-down with shRNA lentiviral constructs. We show that while alpha1G knock-down suppresses both total cell numbers and NSC numbers, alpha1H knock-down results in increased progenitor cell numbers. These results suggest that I(T) in the adult neurogenic niche is important for proliferation and likely plays a role in the control of cell cycle duration. <EOD> A Study of the Mental Health of Children\nThis paper is based on a survey of 326 children, aged 11 through 14 years (156 males and 170 females), admitted to a general outpatient clinic for juvenile psychiatric disorders, and was completed in 360 visits (182 males and 178 females) which spanned 18 months.

Despite being proven benefits of both approaches for selected patients and despite the fact that mortality rates have been comparable over time for both techniques, atherosclerotic processes leading to coronary stenosis are still an important source of morbidity and even mortality in this population. Therefore, this review will summarize the epidemiology regarding the development of coronary artery disease after CABG or PCI and discuss the mechanisms underlying it.\n\n# Introduction\nAccording to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease alone remains the leading cause of death worldwide despite great advances in medical and surgical cardiac care. This is also true for Austria, with a total death number of approximately 45,000 patients related to cardiovascular complications in 2018. Furthermore, 81% of overall deaths in Austria are a result of cardiovascular disease   The Austrian burden of cardiovascular diseases: fatal and non-fatal outcomes. A description..., Manz  .\nCoronary artery disease can be treated noninvasively or invasively. With noninvasive treatment, most recently with the introduction of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) into clinical practice, the intervention remains intraluminal. In contrast to this, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) involves the bypassing of the coronary artery in question which is usually achieved using harvested arteries or veins.\nOver the years, there have been important advances in surgical techniques and an ever-growing expertise in the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Because of these advances, mortality has significantly declined over the years. For example, mortality for CABG was reported to be 11.6% in 1970 in a publication of the University of Toronto experience   Thirty thousand cardiac operations, Tatoulis   but declined to only 1.33% in patients with predominantly three-vessel disease in a large randomized control trial (RCT) between 1997 and 2000   Coronary artery bypass graft surgery versus percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with..., Mohr  .\nThis dramatic mortality decline has caused a shift in focus from CABG to percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).

This raises the question whether the long-term outcome of this shift (more PCI procedures while CABG is being replaced) has been comparable",

Though anaesthesia is usually thought to be safe and necessary to improve health, concerns remain the effects that the drugs used may have on brain development in children and the potential long-term consequences for health. The two techniques used to keep someone asleep during anaesthesia are either giving the appropriate drugs through a small plastic tube into a vein or introducing different drugs into the lungs in gas form.\nGene expression is the process by which instructions in DNA are used to make products such as proteins. Anaesthetic drugs may change how a child's genes are expressed\u037e a process called epigenetics. Studies have shown that different anaesthetic drugs can cause epigenetic changes in animals and affect the processing ability of their brains.\nThis study will focus on children aged under 3 undergoing general anaesthesia for planned hypospadias surgery (a developmental condition where the look and function of the penis may not be completely normally). Participants will either receive their general anaesthetic in gas form or through directly into their veins - both techniques are commonly used. A small blood sample (between 1 and 2 teaspoons) will be collected at the start and end of the operation whilst under anaesthetic. Samples will be analysed to look for any changes in signals on DNA (epigenetic changes) and other markers. Further analysis may then look at other measures of gene expression and additional processes/markers that could be affected.\nThere is relatively less medical research carried out in children and this work will show whether this type of study is possible in this age-group and provide information for future trials.

In contrast, bullous lesions on the lower lip had histological features of porphyria cutanea tarda, and a skin biopsy specimen demonstrated epidermal atrophy and dermal fibrosis with colloid bodies within the epithelioid histiocytes. Electron microscopic demonstration of immune-type complexes in ulcer fluid demonstrated immune-type complexes.

Although this proliferation has been postulated to cause ductopenia, the exact mechanisms mediating cholangiocyte proliferation remain unknown. We investigated the role of interleukin 8 (IL-8) in primary human hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in vitro. We found that the recombinant IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner stimulated cholangiocyte proliferation. Antisense IL-8 oligonucleotide markedly inhibited the proliferation. Northern blot analysis showed that IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b2 were mainly expressed in cholangiocytes. In patients with PBC, the cholangiocytes showed more intense expression of IL-8 but not of GRO1, RANTES, macrophage-derived chemokine, eotaxin, and IP-10. In addition, the levels of urinary IL-8 in patients with PBC were significantly higher than those in controls. Furthermore, the IL-6 level also tended to be higher in the urine of patients with PBC than in the urine of controls. Our results indicate that IL-8 plays a significant role in cholangiocyte proliferation in patients with PBC",

Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",

Rats received either pretraining (Pretraining) or no pretraining (No Pretrng) on a fixed ratio-10 (FR-10) schedule with two levers. In the acquisition phase, animals were then trained alternately for 60 min/d and extinguished in 30-min sessions with either i.v. cocaine (3 mg/kg) or i.v. saline following presentation of the previously reinforced lever. Rats receiving cocaine acquired responding more rapidly than did saline controls; however, no differential responding was observed in sessions without reinforcement during pretraining. Subsequently, subjects received injections of the dopamine D1 receptor-preferring antagonist SCH 23390 (0, 0.16, 0.8, 4, or 20 micrograms/kg) in combination with saline or cocaine and subsequently trained and extinguished as previously. During fixed-time responding (40-s timeout), SCH 23390 attenuated responding maintained by discrete cues, tone/light compound signals, and two lever presses. However, SCH 23390 did not affect responding on FR-10 schedules or during extinction regardless of the type of reinforcer used to train initial responding (\"acquisition effects\") or responding in the subsequent extinction phase. SCH 23390 also attenuated responding on FR-20 schedules. These data suggest that activation of mesocortical dopaminergic mechanisms may be necessary for responding to be maintained solely by discrete signals. <EOD> Interventions for preventing ovarian cancer in women with pelvic inflammatory disease.\nBACKGROUND\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) affects 1-10% of women globally. It is not clear whether PID increases the long-term risk of ovarian cancer and what the options are for primary prevention. One option could be to promote and ensure appropriate follow-up of women (e.g. those at increased risk because of previous laparoscopies) following pelvic inflammatory disease to prevent subsequent ovarian cancer. The other could be the use of preventive strategies following the treatment of PID to lower the risk of ovarian cancer.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo conduct a systematic review on the benefits and harms of interventions (e.g. prophylaxis) used to prevent ovarian cancer subsequent to pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe used the standard method of the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group to search for published and ongoing randomised trials in electronic bibliographic databases. The most recent search was run in January 2015. We searched the World Health Organisation's International Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov using the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform as the primary source. We checked the reference lists of retrieved reports.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised trials of women at increased risk of PID or at increased risk of ovarian cancer subsequent to PID.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently selected studies and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We planned to analyse and present dichotomous outcome data using risk ratios or odds ratios (OR.) as effect size measures for each type of analysis.

        "summary": "After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma.",

In particular, the disordered vascularity of the liver leads to uneven perfusion and is one variable that can be controlled with a single intra-arterial injection of calcium chloride. This study used modified liver injection to prepare the human liver for islet isolation. Six human livers were obtained from patients with an average donor age of 39 +/- 19 years. The mean cold ischemic time was 13 +/- 3 hr. The liver was perfused in a single-pass fashion. All donor livers were assessed for their bile output and the total number of islets was estimated using a method of islet recovery. The average total number of islets extracted from six human livers was 469,039 +/- 86,655. The average yield from single human pancreases was 145,877 +/- 66,898 islet equivalents. This method of perfusion and injection of calcium chloride prior to islet isolation was found to increase the total number of islet equivalents by 4-5 fold. Using this modified protocol for islet isolation in human livers, we found an average islet recovery of 22% +/- 6.1%. Thus, this improved human islet isolation procedure can be used to obtain greater numbers of islet equivalents and increased the transplantation success of islets. <EOD> .\nThe article analyses the results of 61 treatment of patients with pulmonary carcinoids. The authors came to a conclusion that the application of combined treatment was of the highest effectiveness for the pulmonary carcinoids. Lung resection was made only in 42% of patients. <EOD> Changing trends in anatomic liver resection: comparison of early and late post-Cure rates\nABSTRACT Introduction: Improvement in perioperative care for patients undergoing major surgery in the last decade has contributed to an increase in liver resection surgery. Aims: To study whether there is an increase in overall post-operative complication and mortality following anatomic liver resection (ALR) between two consecutive decades. Methods: All 551 consecutive partial hepatectomies between January 1981 and December 1999 were reviewed for type and timing of operation, resection and complication. All resections were classified according to anatomic anatomic hepatic resection (Brisbane 2000) system, and results analyzed for mortality and morbidity. Results: One hundred anatomical liver resections performed between 1981 and 1990, and four hundred and twenty-seven between 1990 and 1999. There was no significant change in the mean age and gender of patients undergoing partial hepatectomy. The majority of anatomical liver resections were performed by experienced surgeons. The most common hepatectomies in the early period were wedge resection 43%, and bisegmentectomies 24.8% in the late period. Overall hospital mortality was 24%, but was significantly lower after the late period 15.2%, P 0.01. Mortality increased with type of hepatectomy. There was no difference in mortality in the second half of the review period between experienced and inexperienced surgeons 10% and 12% respectively, P = 1.00 Conclusions: Anatomic liver resection can be performed with low mortality and morbidity by experienced hepato-pancreato-biliary surgeons. The introduction of improved anesthetic care and postoperative management has reduced the mortality",

        "summary": "Preterm infants, 1 in 12 Canadian births, are at a significant increased risk of poor health outcomes, resulting in high healthcare burden. Parents of these infants report lower self-efficacy and worse mental health when compared to parents of term infants. There is an urgent need to use effective ways to improve parental self-efficacy and associated parent psychosocial and infant health outcomes. To improve parent and baby outcomes, the investigators will build on an existing eHealth solution to create Chez NICU Home+ (CNH+), which offers web-based, parent-targeted, interactive educational tools, virtual communication, and text message support during a baby's NICU stay. We will evaluate whether Chez NICU Home+ improves parental self-efficacy (primary outcome), parent psychosocial, and infant health outcomes in parents of babies requiring a NICU stay, and the implementation (ease and uptake) of Chez NICU Home+ in multiple sites. This study will be a multicentre implementation study, with a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial across four Canadian NICUs. At the beginning of the study, data regarding current care will be collected from all sites to determine a baseline. Following baseline data collection, every five months one of the sites will start using the Chez NICU Home+ solution. A total of 800 parents and their babies, who are expected to stay at least 5 days in the NICU, will be recruited. Parents will complete a survey on psychosocial adjustment and infant outcomes when the study begins, as well as at 14 and 21 days after enrollment, at infant discharge from the NICU, and at 6 months post-discharge. Infant health and development outcomes will be collected at discharge, 6 and 18 months post-discharge via health records. The investigators predict that Chez NICU Home+ will be a positive, interactive care option, combining virtual parent education, tailored communication, and support, which will improve parental self-efficacy and parent psychosocial and infant health outcomes, and have long-term benefits for families.",

Besides previously described linear \u03b2-hydroxyaspartic acid (\u03b2-HA) containing peptides, we found a rare occurrence of circularized \u03b2-turn structures with a non-proteinogenic amino acid \u03b2-HA-L-tryptophan, which is found in the structurally more complicated and rigid protein core of phaselicin A. The \u03b2-turn in the structural core of phaselicin A consists of a set of three \u03b2-HA units that are linked to its hydroxyamino acid moieties by hydrogen bonds, resulting in a stabilized circularized \u03b2-turn. In addition, there were \u03b2-HA-L-tryptophan units, which were structurally incorporated into various turns that were linked to \u03b2-strand and \u03b2-sheet motifs in phaselicin A. The hydrogen bonding network between the amino and hydroxyamino acid moieties of \u03b2-HA and the tryptophan indole moiety of \u03b2-HA-L-tryptophan may serve as a structural scaffold that rigidifies the protein turn architecture in phaselicin A. Also novel is that most of the structural elements observed in phaselicin A were not observed in previously described \u03b2-HA-containing peptides. In contrast to other \u03b2-hydroxyaspartic peptides, phaselicin A contains a unique hydroxyamino acid motif consisting of four asparagines in the N-terminus region that constitute structural features for a circularized \u03b2-turn. The unique circularized \u03b2-turn structure of phaselicin A, resulting from a combination of \u03b2-HA and \u03b2-HA-L-tryptophan, may have a significant role in the anticancer and antimicrobial activity of this protein. <EOD> The Association between Chronic Widespread Musculoskeletal Pain and Cognitive Function in Community-Dwelling Elderly: The Framingham Heart Study Offspring\nObjective. Chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain (CWMP) may compromise cognitive function. In this study, we attempted to clarify the association between CWMP and the Mini-Mental State Examination-2 (MMSE-2). The MMSE-2 is a simple cognitive test, and recent studies indicate that the MMSE-2 is as accurate as the original MMSE in measuring cognition in this population. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional analysis among 2,683 participants of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). CWMP was defined using a self-administered questionnaire. The MMSE-2 was administered in-person. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to determine the association between CWMP and the MMSE-2. Results. There were 888 participants with CWMP and 1,795 participants without CWMP. The mean MMSE-2 score was 1.9 lower for participants with CWMP compared with those without CWMP. Participants with osteoarthritis (OA) also had a lower mean MMSE-2 score than those without OA (1.1 lower) and those with no osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis ever (OARAE) (0.7 lower).

CHS was defined as cerebral hyperperfusion (CH) with clinical symptoms such as unilateral headache, convulsions, hemiparesis/hemiplegia, visual disturbances, ataxia, aphasia, while CH could be a disastrous outcome causing complication after carotid revascularization if not managed properly and timely.\nThis is a single-center prospective cohort study to investigate the risks of CH after carotid artery stenting. All patients with severe carotid artery stenosis underwent carotid arterial ultrasonography and dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) test by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) before operation. The postoperative carotid ultrasound and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) results are also needed.

Therefore, it is possible to predict the occurrence of CHS by the evaluation of cerebral autoregulation (CA) before CAS and early preventive measures should be taken for patients with poor cerebral autoregulation to obtain the best prognosis.\n\n2.\n\n\nThe article published in Nature Neuroscience showed that transcranial doppler could not assess the function of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA), but also could not predict the CHS for patients with chronic internal carotid artery stenosis. However, the cerebral blood flow velocity derived from the transcranial doppler of patients with chronic carotid stenosis is abnormal. Therefore, transcranial doppler can be used to assess dCA by cerebral blood flow velocity monitoring, and the dCA parameters will be more accurate.\n\n3.\n\n\nIn addition to transcranial doppler, more and more methods have been evaluated to evaluate cerebral autoregulation after CAS, the methods include: continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), transcranial electrical stimulation, the methods are more convenient and reliable than transcranial doppler.\n\n4.\nThe results indicated that the CA parameters derived from transcranial doppler can be evaluated easily and effectively. It is expected that the preoperative evaluation of patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing CAS in this way can help to prevent and reduce the occurrence of CHS in advance.\n\n5.\n\nThe data is valuable to this study and the evaluation of CA based on transcranial doppler can be beneficial to prevent and reduce the occurrence of CHS for patients with carotid artery stenosis.\n\nDear Editors, Please check the figures in and .

        "model_output": "[/INST]\n\n <EOD> Identification of novel protein complexes from affinity purified interacting proteins in rat liver.\nWe developed a method to identify protein complexes in rat liver. Affinity-purified protein complexes were obtained using anti-alpha-tubulin antibody- and anti-HMG-17 antibody-coupled Sepharose beads, and these were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. It was found that various proteins were eluted by anion exchange chromatography; subsequently, protein spots were cut out from a preparative gel and subjected to analysis by nano-LC-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). In a control sample, protein spots present in 15 protein bands were identified. From the results of LC-MS, 50 and 22 protein spots were identified in affinity-purified complexes that bound to anti-alpha-tubulin antibody and anti-HMG-17 antibody, respectively. The interaction partners (i.e., tubulin and dynein) were recovered from control samples; however, the other proteins recovered here did not bind to anti-alpha-tubulin antibody in previous studies. Moreover, protein spots that were common in both samples appeared to be the same protein. Thus, this research identified several protein complexes related to microtubules in the liver and also identified several proteins that participate in tubulin-containing complexes with unidentified functions. This study also provided insight into the functions of other components of tubule-containing microtubule-related complexes, thus establishing a method used to examine the function of proteins in the liver in detail. <EOD> Pharmacological Analysis of the Bitter Taste in Rabbits\nThe rabbit's ability to taste bitter substances was described 100 years ago. We tried to verify these results using different compounds and to compare the sensitivity threshold with that in a normal human and in a rat. We also investigated the ability of normal rabbits to adapt to the gustatory irritant phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). Sixteen normal rabbits were examined. The number of the bites, the intensity of reaction, and the taste duration were analysed according to the substances used (sodium salts, alkaloids, amines, organic bases). Different solutions of caffeine, PTC, and tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) were used to determine the relative taste threshold values. The order of the threshold strength of the solutions was as follows: sodium chloride > PTC-base > potassium chloride > sodium hydrogen carbonate > PTC-acid > PTC/NaOH > TEA/NaOH. The threshold values for PTC (63\u201096 \u03bcmol) and TEA (62\u2010360 \u03bcmol) in rabbit and rat are almost identical. The threshold values for caffeine (Petri dish) are significantly different (2600 \u03bcmol, rabbit; < 4 \u03bcmol rat). The rabbit has a normal taste for the bitterness. Like the rat but unlike humans, it is not able to distinguish PTC\u2010base from PTC\u2010acid. <EOD> Isolation and functional characterization of a novel mouse uteroplacental AMP\u2010activated protein kinase\nThe AMP\u2010activated protein kinase (AMPK) has diverse cellular functions, including the regulation of cellular energy homeostasis, and is central to cell growth and differentiation. To further understand the role of AMPK in the uteroplacental\u2010A unit of mammalian pregnancy, this study evaluated the expression pattern and functional role of AMPK in the placenta. We demonstrate, for the first time, using RNase protection assays in mouse placenta at various stages of pregnancy, that expression of all three catalytic alpha (\u03b1) subunits of AMPK (\u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13) were maintained throughout pregnancy. The levels of both catalytic \u03b11 and \u03b13 subunits were similar to the levels of the constitutively expressed catalytic \u03b12 subunit. The alpha\u2010inhibitor (\u03b1\u2010inhibitor) 2 subunit encoded by the Prkaa2 gene, the major isoform found in mouse placenta, and was expressed as early as implantation (E6.5) and remained at relatively constant levels throughout the remainder of gestation.

Complications associated with these surgeries include hematoma and seroma. Prior studies in orthopedics, plastic surgery, and trauma have shown significant reduction of bleeding and ecchymosis with the use of tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA is a synthetic amino acid that blocks plasminogen conversion to plasmin, to stabilize clot formation. The intravenous (IV) efficacy in reducing hematoma rates has been established in implant-based breast reconstruction, as well as in reduction mammaplasty. However, there are currently no studies investigating the use of IV TXA in patients undergoing GAM.\nThe investigators propose a single-center, prospective randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in decreasing hematoma and seroma rates for top surgery patients at UCSF. Patients will be randomized into two groups, an experimental group receiving IV TXA and a control group that will not receive IV TXA.\nPatients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) at a concentration of 1g/10ml over a period of 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction. Patients will be excluded if they have a history of coagulopathy, bleeding disorders or prior chest surgery. Demographic data, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes will also be recorded and analyzed.

We used two\u2010dimensional difference gel electrophoresis to identify proteins whose abundance correlates with 0.03% sucrose to inhibit or 2.5 mm ethylene to stimulate root hair in Arabidopsis thaliana L. cv. Wassilewskija (Ws) roots compared with corresponding untreated roots. The 14-3-3 protein  was one of 26 root hair growth-specific proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the three spots representing 14-3-3 were downregulated by ethylene and upregulated by sucrose. We also confirmed sucrose\u2019s promotion of changes in phosphorylation of 14-3-3 as well as its promotion of protein\u2013protein interactions with the sucrose-dependent phosphoproteome using Western blotting and Co-IP, which showed that sucrose reduces 14-3-3 phosphorylation and increases 14-3-3/fasciclin a (FAS) interactions, whereas ethylene increases 14-3-3 phosphorylation and reduces 14-3-3/FAS interactions. Finally, we used phospho-peptide affinity chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry to find that sucrose inhibits and ethylene promotes the interactions of FAS with phosphorylated 14-3-3.

Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy drug that damages DNA and may kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Shorter treatment without anthracycline chemotherapy may work the same as the usual anthracycline chemotherapy treatment for early-stage triple negative breast cancer.",

        "summary": "The proposed project seeks to achieve four objectives that will, collectively, evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP-1) -a model for a home visitation and case management program for parents who used substances during pregnancy. First, the proposed project aims to estimate the causal impact of PCAP-1 on preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. Second, the project will estimate PCAP-1's effectiveness in achieving other program goals: parent recovery, parent's connection with needed comprehensive community resources, and preventing future children from being exposed to drugs and alcohol prenatally. Third, the project intends to estimate any cost savings from the perspective of the state. Finally, causal evidence of program effectiveness across the prior three objectives would enable PCAP-1 to be rated according to strength of evidence on relevant federal registries (i.e., FFPSA and HOMEVEE). All four objectives will be pursued by leveraging an ongoing randomized control trial (RCT) of PCAP with substantial backing from public and private partners, including the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OK's Title IV-E agency). This quasi-experimental project will recruit 40 new participants to receive PCAP-1 services and will use data on participants from the existing trial for the control group. This extension of the original RCT is efficient and highly feasible, drawing upon and adapting an existing evaluation framework and protocol. This design will facilitate an unbiased estimation of one-year program effectiveness while also enabling a comparison of the differential effectiveness of PCAP-1 and the original three-year PCAP model as a secondary benefit. Moreover, given that the population PCAP serves are disproportionately poor and low-income and PCAP is designed to be culturally competent and relevant, PCAP-1 harbors the potential to address inequities in child welfare outcomes, substance use disorder treatment services, and child and family well- being by improving outcomes for these families. With a strong backing by state agencies and community partners, the evaluation of PCAP-1 will contribute to a knowledge gap in the field for in-home program models serving a highly vulnerable population with high rates of child welfare involvement and use of foster care.",

To date, over 900 potential vaccines are at different stages of preclinical and clinical evaluation, and over 200 early vaccine candidates have reached clinical evaluation phase I. Among those, 18 different types of COVID-19 vaccine candidates are currently at Phase II/Phase III clinical trial stage. All these candidates share the similar challenges of being fast tracked and developed for an emerging viral disease.

On 7 January, the virus causing this pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), which was termed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). On 11 February, the virus was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)   The species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it..., Gorbalenya  . Later on 17 March, the WHO named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 . Since then, it quickly spread worldwide and led to increasing number of fatalities. Hence, WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and subsequently declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 20 August 2020, about 19 612 081 individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with about 731 655 deceased and 12 88",

        "summary": "Admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is well-recognized to be extremely distressing and stressful for the patient and family. As medical research and technology have advanced more and more children in the PICU are surviving, however in turn incurring new and persistent impairments across physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains of health. This phenomenon is often referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments not only impact the patient but parents have also been found to have poor emotional health outcomes following discharge from the PICU.\nConsistently, parents/caregivers of children admitted to the PICU report their primary concerns to be 1) the overwhelming physical environment of the PICU, 2) uncertainty about the child's survivorship and outcomes, 3) relationships and communication with staff, and 4) feeling helpless. Additionally, research has shown that caregiver-perceived stress during the child's hospitalization positively predicts post-traumatic stress three months after discharge for parents/caregivers (Nelson et al., 2019), which may translate into higher risk and duration of post-traumatic stress in their children. Therefore, providing an in-hospital outlet such as a PICU Journal for patients and families to express their subjective experiences may help bridge the gap between perception and reality as a means of buffering against post-traumatic responses. Conceptually, a semi-structured journal intervention may integrate the therapeutic aspects of journaling while also providing pertinent information and serving as an advocacy and communication tool. Prior research has demonstrated the use of a PICU Journal is feasible for implementation and has been well-received by families of children in the PICU (Herrup et al., 2019).\nTherefore, the aims of this mixed-method study are to 1) examine the relationship between this journaling intervention and the perceived stress, care engagement, symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and the development of PICS in parents of children hospitalized in the PICU, and 2) examine the relationship between parent participation in this intervention and the development of PICS-p in children, and 3) assess the feasibility of this intervention from key stakeholders.",

The summary should capture the key aspects of the trial. <EOD> .\nThe present study reports two pregnant women, one with cervical cancer and the other with uterine choriocarcinoma, who developed postpartum metastasis to the liver after a normal vaginal delivery. The cervical cancer patient underwent a C-section because of spontaneous premature rupture of the membranes, while the patient with uterine carcinoma delivered the girl normally through a normal vaginal delivery. Six months after the delivery both patients developed metastasis in the right lobe of the liver. Both patients had elevated CEA, CA19-9, and CA125. Ultrasound and computed tomography findings revealed hepatic metastases, indicating the prognosis was poor. The two patients did not want further treatment after being informed about their condition and the prognosis. Here we report two cases of aggressive course after vaginal delivery in patients with advanced cervical cancer and uterine choriocarcinoma. The relationship between normal and abnormal delivery and metastasis is discussed. <EOD> Rational design of a highly functional electrode by incorporating a 3D nanoprinted carbon nanotube sponge network with a redox-gated organic semiconductor hydrogel.\nMaintaining a desirable 3D structural architecture is a crucial prerequisite to develop high performance devices. In the meantime, functionalizing the structure to obtain controlled release and switchable properties has great potential in sensing, actuators and therapies. However, there are still challenges in controlling each specific requirement separately without interfering with the others. Here, we report for the first time the rational design and synthesis of a 3D functional hybrid electrode system consisting of vertically aligned carbon nanotube sponge (VACNS) as a matrix and redox-gated organic semiconductor (OSC) hydrogel, PTz-S, as fillers. The VACNS has an amalgam nature in which the carbon nanotube is wrapped at high density, resulting in highly conductive sponge properties. VACNS is grown in situ by a facile pyrolysis methodology, which is easily scalable over a large scale, and its 3D structure is well-preserved after its integration with the hydrogel to support enhanced sensing performance, low detection limit (50 fM) and excellent selectivity. Moreover, the redox gated organic hydrogel is sensitive to the reductive species (thiols/amines), and shows the electrochemical response (electrocatalytic H2O2 reduction or redox reaction of hydrogel polymer backbone) with a stable electrochemical detection rate after five successive cycles. <EOD> Influences of Lignin Hydrothermolytic Degradation and Fractionation Conditions on 13C Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Relaxation.\nLignin samples have been successfully analyzed by 13C solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR), but lignin-lignin interactions, which lead to low-intensity resonances, prevent easy identification of structural features of lignin. This is a major hindrance to characterize lignin in solid samples, which are the most available material on lignin research. Here, we propose a systematic strategy in lignin hydrothermolytic degradation and fractionation conditions that allows lignin solubility enhancement and improves 13C SSNMR intensities, making possible to analyze solid native lignin materials in unprecedented fashion. Hydrothermal degradation leads to enhancement of solubility by cleaving \u03b2-O-4 and \u03b5-O-4 bonds. Fractionation by increasing temperature conditions (pH 11 at 60\u00b0C and pH 12 at 100\u00b0C) allowed increasing lignin solubility (up to 121 mg/mL at pH 12 and 100\u00b0C), and also provided a better resolution of lignin signals in 13C SSNMR spectra. On the basis of a thorough comparison of solid and soluble lignin samples, we found that 13C SSNMR is highly sensitive to lignin structural modifications, in particular the solubilization conditions and degradation degree",

To test the association between anticoagulant treatment and thromboembolism among patients with both diseases, we included data from the Cancer Registry of Norway on all 496 270 patients born between 1919 and 2000 residing in Norway at some point from 1995 to 2013. Of these patients, 73 943 (14.7%) had a cancer diagnosis during the study period and concomitant atrial fibrillation; 15 294 (2.06%) had an acute, non\u2010embolic venous thromboembolic event during follow up, 50 073 (67.2%) had oral anticoagulant treatment during follow up, 18 707 (25.3%) had no anticoagulant treatment and 17 510 (23.5%) had intermittent anticoagulant treatment. By inverse probability of treatment weights we calculated a propensity\u2010score\u2010based comparison group of 299 600 patients with cancer and no atrial fibrillation. Using these weights, compared to having no cancer, having cancer was associated with a 3.1 (95% CI 3.0\u20133.1) hazard ratio (HR) for venous thromboembolism, and having atrial fibrillation was associated with a 4.4 (4.1\u20134.7) HR for venous thromboembolism. In the cancer\u2013atrial fibrillation cohort, with patients receiving oral anticoagulants, intermittent treatment reduced the occurrence of venous thromboembolism by 25% (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67\u20130.82) and the major bleeding risk by 33% (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.60\u20130.76).

Following the percutaneus coronary revascularization (PCR) group (n = 53) and the conservative group (n = 50) were observed for 42 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFollowing 6-month control, patients of the surgical group (n = 53, mean age 52.4 +/- 6.1 yrs. and left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) 56.9 +/- 7.7%) showed a decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) from 10.3 +/- 3.26 mmol/l to 7.74 +/- 3.41 mmol/l (p < 0.01) and in HbAlc level from 7.96 +/- 1.14% to 6.66 +/- 1.02%; (p < 0.02). Patients in the conservative group (n = 50, age 55.2 +/- 6.89 yrs. and LV EF 58.8 +/- 8.4%) revealed no changes in serum glucose and in HbA1c levels. There was no difference in fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels between both treatment groups at six-month control. The risk factors, including elevated cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and decreased HDL cholesterol showed a statistically significant difference between the PCR group and the conservative group. At that time, the PCR group showed a lower Framingham score (51.8 +/- 19.04) compared with the conservative group (61.3 +/- 16.94). No deaths were registered in both groups during the 42-month follow-up period.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n(1) The restoration of coronary patency in the PCR group was not associated with a decrease in blood glucose and HbAlc levels compared with the conservative group of patients with coexistent NIDDM and CAD during 6-month observation period. (2) There was no difference in serum C-peptide and insulin levels in both treatment groups and no difference in HbAlc levels at the six-month control. (3) After 6-month observation, the PCR group was associated with significantly decreased Framingham score. <EOD> The use of glycerol in the treatment of dehydration: an outdated therapy?\nThe use of glycerol for the treatment of dehydration in infancy has not been well studied and its use is considered outdated.

Spatial neglect prevents them from functioning independently, and their needs in the hospital and at home are greatly increased. An effective treatment for spatial neglect is 10 days of visuomotor training while wearing optical prisms (PAT), however many clinicians [fail to diagnose spatial neglect and use this approach. In this study, the investigators will develop a brain scanning test that could objectively identify the Veterans with spatial neglect after stroke who are the best candidates to receive PAT and recover their ability to function.

Do not write a full-length paper; keep the text short.\nFor the second part, your task is to summarise, in English, the results section of the study. Your summary may not be in the original order, but you should provide information about the most important findings the study presented.\n\nBackground and Purpose\n-----------------\nRationale:\nSpatial neglect (SN) impairs the ability to orient to and act within the left hemifield and space, causing significant distress and disability for survivors of stroke. The extent of deficit can be rated objectively using computerized bisectional tasks. Prism adaptation therapy (PAT) is a promising adjunct treatment, improving SN deficit in up to 2/3 patients. A limitation of PAT is an objective, clinician-applied clinical biomarker of PAT responsiveness is lacking. The investigators have discovered that Aiming SN, an objective behavioral marker, reliably predicts PAT responsiveness and improves post-PAT functional outcome. The innovation of this study is that the study examines behavioral and neuroimaging predictors of Aiming SN, allowing to personalize SN rehabilitation.\nBackground:\nThe innovation of this study is that the investigators will examine and integrate [e.g. PAT treatment, behavioral and brain MRI predictors of Aiming and where spatial neglect, as well as brain white matter tracts and functional brain networks.]\n\nMethods\n===\nRandom assignment: This study is to examine SN behavioral, clinical and brain imaging predictors of behavioral treatment response, including the association between right brain neural networks, and SN. Methods: In a sample of 180 right brain stroke survivors (120 with SN, 60 without), the study assessed SN and functional (FIM) recovery post-PAT. The hypothesis is that neuroimaging, behavioral and neural predictors will explain SN treatment response, including the association between right brain networks, and SN. Methods: 90 Veterans with right brain stroke (60 SN; 30 without SN) in the study received, with sham control, PAT for 1-2 weeks (single masked), with subsequent assessment. Findings to date: Brain network predictors, and the interaction between network and individual therapy responsiveness, predicted PAT treatment response in a pilot study. For Veterans with spatial neglect and right brain hemisphere stroke, pretreatment (baseline) right frontal to post-central gyrus cortical thickness measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) predicted posttreatment PAT responsiveness, while left frontal to right subcortical corticospinal tract (CST) length also predicted posttreatment behavioral improvement in Veterans with spatial neglect. Conclusions: The investigators' findings demonstrated that cortical thickness of brain regions connected to behavioral PAT were associated with SN treatment response.\n\n\n[/INST] Summary of methods and results by the Centre Hospitalier Valida\n\nMethods\n===\nBackground and purpose:\nObjective: 45 Veterans with right brain stroke, of whom 25 had SN, underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. The investigators analyzed diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from voxels using tract-based morphometry. Their hypothesis was that regional changes, particularly in the frontal lobe and ipsilesional arcuate fasciculus fiber tracts, underlie spatial neglect behavior, which is improved by PAT. Methods: Veterans completed 10 PAT sessions of 100 trials each. A masked therapist examined participants' paper-pencil drawings using four assessment tools: two computerized line-bisection task tools, a paper and pencil, and the Catherine Bergego Scale. They also assessed functional outcome using the FIM instrument. Results: The investigators found that before therapy, Veterans with SN responded normally to all assessment tools; however, Veterans had a normal response to only two out of three tests after receiving PAT. PAT improved Aiming SN, reducing the severity of Aiming SN by 12.3 points (p = 0.0117), whereas Veterans retained a normal response to two out of three tests",

The subsequent analysis will be done with digital PCR, due to its low detection limit. The mutational results of each patient's samples will be compared with those obtained from the corresponding tissue biopsies. This step will allow the team to determine the robustness and reliability of the liquid biopsy. The grading of the tumor, as well as the confirmation of the diagnosis, will be obtained from the histological data.\nWith the inclusion of more patients in the future, and with the optimization of the mutations investigated, the investigators want to standardize the protocol for the diagnosis of gliomas with liquid biopsy.

In addition, using fewer hospital resources should allow a more accurate and rapid diagnosis of the pathology, and therefore, start the more personalized therapeutic stage earlier.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] <EOD> The in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative effects of dietary fatty acids can differ according to cell type and context\nAbstract A wide range of dietary fats are consumed globally and their influence on tumour cell growth has been a topic of some debate. This study aimed to ascertain the impact of various polyunsaturated fatty acids (UFA) and saturated fatty acids (SAFA) on the proliferation of human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cells and murine hepatocytes (BNL CL.2). In vitro data demonstrated that HT-29 cell proliferation was inhibited by >70 % (P < 0\u00b705) by UFA over the course of 90 h. However, in contrast, UFA had no effect on hepatocyte growth. In vivo data revealed that a high SAFA diet promoted mucin-type O-glycosylation (P < 0\u00b705), inhibited (P < 0\u00b705) hepatic lipid accumulation and prevented body weight gain in obese mice as compared with the other diet groups. In this study, in vitro data indicate that UFA inhibit HT-29 cell viability in a dose-dependent and sustained manner, while in vivo data suggest that dietary UFA can protect against weight gain and potentially promote healthy cellular composition in both non-transformed hepatocytes and established colon tumour cells. <EOD> Translational Regulatory Elements in the 5' Untranslated Region of the Human c-myc Gene\nThe c-myc transcript is present in a wide range of normal and malignant cells and is expressed at different levels and temporal patterns relative to cell proliferation, differentiation or quiescence, and transformation. The level of c-myc mRNA was found to be transcriptionally regulated in fibroblasts and lymphoid cells. However, in mature primary T cells, in HeLa and K562 erythroleukemia cells, and in myeloid cells, c-myc mRNA appeared to be subject to post-transcriptional regulation. In mature T cells and HeLa cells, this post-transcriptional regulation was mediated by translational repression and was found to be regulated by cytokine signals. In a mouse erythroleukemia cell line (HIT), the increase in c-Myc protein production in response to erythroid differentiation was correlated with an absolute increase in c-myc mRNA stability and a decrease in the steady-state level of translation of the c-myc transcript. Further studies of this regulatory element in the 5' untranslated region of c-myc transcripts (5'UTR) using a heterologous translocation strategy that involved exchanging the mouse \u03b2-globin 5'UTR with the human c-myc 5'UTR in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) demonstrated that the 5'UTR of c-myc is responsible for translational repression of c-myc mRNA in HIT cells. This repression could also be relieved by cytokines that regulate c-myc mRNA and protein expression in HIT cells. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of translational repression of c-myc mRNA observed in HIT cells and HeLa and mature human primary T cells is the same. <EOD> Etiological Factors associated with Osteochondropathy in Dogs: a Review of Historical Exposures and Present Day Characteristics\n\nThe goal of this paper was to summarize the epidemiological studies of the developmental etiology of osteochondropathy (OCD) in dogs in response to a series of questions raised within the Veterinary Pathology community.

The answer to 4 was to provide a review of the 36 papers published since 2000 concerning etiology of OCD as a baseline for further research. A review was made of the historical and clinical records for the age and breed incidence of OCD. To answer the overall question, the available evidence points to a genetic basis. Diseases",

Quemliclustat has the potential to decrease the amount of adenosine, allowing the immune system to recognize and act against the cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

You can also have complex motions in between those extremes.\n\nFlapping wings are common in vertebrates as a form of flight, especially in birds and bats. They're also found in insects (especially beetles and locusts) and some extinct dinosaurs such as pterosaurs and modern birds are capable of both flapping and powered flight.\n\nWings can move in many ways (e.g. up and down, front to back, and side to side) during a flapping motion. And the size and complexity of wings vary enormously. You can have a single, very tiny wing, such as the hind wings of many insects. You can also have multiple wings on both sides of the body, like with bat wings or wingspans so large they make the body look tiny by comparison like with an airplane or a bird.\n\nHere I'd like to explain the motion based a single, big wing:\n\n![](https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/public_content/media/gallery/birds/BIRD-RSPB11091512034563626/RSPB-110973558BRAZE-07046%20-%20bird%20in%20Flight.png)\n\nA bird wing flaps up, down, forwards, backwards, and side to side. The reason for this is that this is what's required of a wing in order to generate enough lift to support the animal when it's flying. You can view this in more detail in the [video section](video/flapping-wings/).\n\nWhat it looks like when studying the motion of a single wing is a kind of \"snake-like\" motion, where the wing tip moves back and forth from the body (the head is attached to the shoulder bone, or coracoid).

Here, we combined computational (exposure models) and experimental (in vitro assays) methods to elucidate the relationship between PM emission characteristics and heart and vascular diseases. We analyzed the associations between PM emissions and cardiac and vascular endpoints by examining the concentrations in each organ. We constructed a computational model of PM exposure and the heart and vascular disease and used its predictions to evaluate the exposure\u2013response relationship between the PM mass and heart and vascular disease by comparing these predictions with epidemiological results. We show that the predictions of the concentration in the heart and vascular organs exhibit high correlations with disease-specific indices. Furthermore, the computational model predictions of the mass of the PM emitted from various emission sources and the concentration in the organs are in good agreement with epidemiological studies investigating the heart and vascular diseases in individuals. Our results indicate that epidemiological studies support the use of the computational model and suggest that computational model predictions can be applied to epidemiological studies in relation to the health impact evaluation of disease burden when PM emissions and disease endpoints are obtained for the computational model input. <EOD> A novel methodological approach to assess the efficacy of interferon alpha in the management of severe COVID-19 patients\nSARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent for COVID-19, emerged in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread around the world, resulting in a global pandemic. Despite the availability of the vaccines for severe COVID-19 patients, the role of immunomodulatory therapy with an interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) is yet to be fully understood. Current studies investigating the effects of IFN-\u03b1 in COVID-19 patients have shown inconsistent results. Such a poor outcome could be mainly attributed to a lack of standardized methods. As such, in this study, we have introduced the innovative method that assessed the efficacy of IFN-\u03b1 in management of patients with severe COVID-19. <EOD> The Cutting-Edge of Cardiac Surgery: Robotic Approach or Hybrid Operation (Hybrid).\nThe evolution of surgical equipment and techniques always represents an ongoing challenge of surgery, being one of the major driving forces of modern surgical practice. Such practice is characterized by continuously improving safety and quality of care and outcomes, which are mostly associated with reduced morbidity and mortality, and also by the improvement in patients' quality of life. The last decades have been focused on the introduction of newer materials and technologies into surgery, which are considered as the cutting-edge of surgical practice. The evolution of the robotic equipment into the surgical field occurred, in our view, as one of the most interesting and challenging issues in the last decade. The adoption of the robotic technique in surgery (such as laparoscopic, thoracoscopic, endoscopic, urologic, and cranial and spinal surgery) was initially associated with the introduction of the surgical Da Vinci robot (Intuitive Surgical, Mountain View, CA), which represents the first commercial robotic system used in surgery, and then, with the evolution of the use of the surgical robot and other types of robots recently applied in surgery. Robotic surgery is characterized by the application of an improved \"eye-hand-eye\" technique, and this represents one of the major innovations in surgery. In addition, the robotic technique is characterized by the ability to work as a single surgeon. At the beginning, to perform such a surgical technique, the robotic team consisted of the surgeon and his assistant. However, after introduction of the robotic surgical system to the surgical community, robotic surgeon has to work alone using the console and the robotic tools. The application of this approach reduces the complications associated with long time robotic approach; therefore, robotic technique was able to decrease all of the \"complications in robotic surgery\". Hybrid operation is one of other innovations in surgery, with the potential usefulness to improve the results of surgical procedures. Hybrid surgery should be defined as a combined technique, characterized by the association of the open surgery and endoscopy/robotic elements.

The efficiency of the method is examined and studied theoretically and experimentally to demonstrate the results. The main features of the method are the following points. (1) Both one- and two-dimensional problems for an infinite slab can be tackled with the same method, and the result is the same. (2) By the method it is possible to avoid numerical instability for wide photon escape range in a p-i-n structure; this instability sometimes occurs in conventional methods. (3) The method is extremely simple, not only analytically but also in its computer-time requirements. (4) The method is especially suitable to lasers operating with an external resonator, and the calculated and experimental results agree quite well. <EOD> Exploring the role of pharmacist counselling in the adherence of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in a cohort of HIV patients at Muhimbili national hospital in Tanzania, 2nd February\u2014July, 2021\nIntroduction Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a cornerstone in the management of HIV infection. Despite the introduction of new second and third line drug regimen with better efficacy and safety, poor adherence still exists. The objective of this study was to examine the role of pharmacist counselling in improving adherence to ART. Methods This was a prospective descriptive study where 165 HIV patients from infectious ward were recruited for pharmacist counselling during their 6 month in-hospital follow-up. The pharmacists provided counselling focusing on dosage, time of ART, food intake, side effects of ART, and how to manage side effects, and on how to manage drug-drug or drug-food interactions. Patients were followed for 1 year, and ART adherence was assessed based on clinical and laboratory evaluation and reported side effects. Patients were divided into two groups, group I (counselled group) who received ART adherence counselling by a pharmacist and group II (non-counselled group) who received their drugs only without counselling.

This contrast between the social and the academic, or perhaps between the practical and the theoretical, is not so much surprising as it is regrettable, for in many respects the physiological processes of degradation and stabilization, with their myriad consequences, have been the bedrock upon which contemporary medicine is founded. Yet, unfortunately, they are so often considered by health science practitioners to be something of a second class citizen--a conceptual anomaly that has permeated, to a considerable degree, the whole structure of biological medicine. The time has surely come for this dichotomy to be erased: not from our consciousness but from our medical vocabulary. We owe it to our patients. <EOD> Exophytic hepatocellular carcinoma mimicking gastric submucosal tumor: a case report\n\nBackground: To describe the differential diagnostic challenges of exophytic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mimicking gastric submucosal tumor (SMT). Case presentation: A 67-year-old Chinese man presented with dizziness. Gastroscopy revealed a gastric submucosal tumor with the surface of the tumor being erosion and ulceration accompanied by active hemorrhage. The endoscopic ultrasound examination indicated the mass was originated from the submucosa and the gastric wall, and color Doppler imaging showed the color flow signals in the stromal lamina were weak, which was consistent with the characteristics of high-risk areas of gastrointestinal submucosal hemorrhage. Consequently, combined with the history of hepatitis, the patient was diagnosed with HCC. After admission, the blood test indicated the patient had elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein level (\u03b1-FP) and no other significant abnormal indexes, suggesting liver cancer. Then, he underwent gastric cardia hemostasis by endoscopy, and gastroscopy indicated that the surface of the submucosal mass was active hemorrhage and ulcer formation. However, it was difficult to determine whether the gastric epithelium invading was cancerous or gastric ulcer based on the results of pathological and immunohistochemistry examination. After admission, the blood test indicated the patient had elevated serum \u03b1-FP level and no other significant abnormal indexes, suggesting liver cancer. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with stage IIa of hepatocellular carcinoma, which was managed with transarterial chemoembolization and followed-up for 6 months, and no evidence of recurrence was noticed. Conclusion: Exophytic HCC with no obvious imaging features mimicking gastric SMT is a critical condition. Combined with clinical history, endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound and tumor markers is helpful to distinguish lesions before surgery.\n\n# Background\nGastric submucosal tumor (SMT) is a frequent incidental finding in gastroscopy. The majority are benign, while a minority are malignant tumors. Exophytic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is defined as HCC arises exclusively above the liver surface and protrudes into the gastrointestinal tract. Here we report an unusual and challenging case diagnosed as HCC mimicking gastric SMT based on the examination of endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, pathological and immunohistochemistry.

In the current study, we sought to improve the diagnostic value of contrast echocardiography in this context.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween 2011 and 2013, 30 patients with a suspicion of PVT based on a transthoracic or transesophageal (TEE) echocardiographic examination were referred to our study. Color Doppler was performed at rest first. Translation index of aortic valve thrombus during diastole was measured. Definitions were set to diagnose PVT based on TEE data. Echocardiography was then continued using Levovist injection during the cardiac cycle. Images of the cardiac structures were then evaluated. Images of the aortic valve leaflets and cusps were analyzed at peak ventriculo-aortic valve flow and aortic diastole using color Doppler and power Doppler. The ratio of the aortic to ventricular flow velocities was calculated as an average of three consecutive cycles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn six patients, PVT was diagnosed based on the Doppler studies (including Doppler color), and this was confirmed by surgical data (n=3) or pathology (n=1). A ratio of > 1.6 of average of three consecutive cardiac cycles (p  2.0 at diastole and > 300 cm(2) LAA thrombus load were predictive factors of PVT based on a multivariate analysis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAccording to the current study findings, Doppler examination, including contrast, provides additional information for evaluation of patients with PVT compared with the color Doppler examination solely. <EOD> BMP-2 induces epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and endows colorectal cancer cells with invasive ability\n\nBackground: Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is a secreted growth factor with a wide variety of biological functions, including regulation of bone development and tissue repair, and differentiation of somatic cells into chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and adipocytes. Increasing reports suggest that BMP-2 plays an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Here, we report that BMP-2 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and endows colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with an invasive phenotype. Methods: Expression of BMP-2 was analyzed with real time-quantitative PCR and Western blotting in 25 pairs of human CRC tissues and matched normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect BMP-2 expression levels in tissue microarrays of 108 paraffin-embedded CRC tissues, and its correlation with clinicopathological features was analyzed. A co-immunoprecipitation assay was employed to investigate the interaction between Smad 1/5/8 and Smad 2. Transfection of a vector encoding a BMP-2 short hairpin RNA (BMP-2 sh-RNA) into HCT 116 and SW480 CRC cells significantly reduced intracellular production of BMP-2 compared with the control group. After transfection, cellular function assays (e.g., colony formation, CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, and Transwell invasion assay) were performed to investigate the impact of BMP-2 down-regulation on its biological effects. EMT-related markers were investigated by Western blotting. Results: IHC results showed that the positive rates of BMP-2 expression in human CRC were significantly higher",

Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is present even in first\u2010episode patients, and some patients with psychosis have premorbid subthreshold symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine cognitive functioning in first\u2010episode patients with schizophrenia, their siblings and a normal control group. This study compared cognitive functioning in first\u2010episode patients with schizophrenia, their siblings, a control group of a college/university population, and a group of patients with major depressive disorder. Methods. Cognitive functioning was assessed with neuropsychological tests in 55 patients with schizophrenia, 41 siblings and 59 healthy controls. The patients had a duration of illness of <5 years. Fifty\u2010four patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, who were medicated for the full period of the study protocol, were the contrast group. Results. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly poorer performance than the first\u2010degree siblings and the controls, and also those with major depression had significantly poorer performance compared to siblings. Siblings had significantly poorer performance than controls in psychomotor speed, delayed recall, verbal and visuospatial working memory, attention, perception and problem\u2010solving. Furthermore, within the patient group, the patients who had an earlier onset age of disease had poorer performance than those whose onset age was older. Conclusion. Patients with schizophrenia, their siblings and patients with major depressive disorder all showed cognitive impairments. Within the patient group, duration of illness duration was found to be associated with impaired cognitive functioning. <EOD> Preference for low-calorie versus high-calorie drinks on mood: A within-subjects placebo-controlled trial.\nIn order to maintain body weight/shape, it is recommended to avoid beverage consumption. This advice is difficult to follow since an effective beverage on mood has yet to be found. The present study is based on the \"liking\" and \"wanting\" motivational dimensions of craving. Participants consumed a low- versus a commercially available high-calorie beverage in a single and counterbalanced session in order to assess liking, wanting, and mood. Twenty-seven female participants consumed three 250\u00a0ml bottles of a commercial high-calorie (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and low-calorie (n\u00a0=\u00a013) beverage, each separated by 20\u00a0min and the respective taste intensity matched (n\u00a0=\u00a027). A rating scale was used to assess both beverages preference, wanting and mood every 5\u00a0min over 30\u00a0min during the beverages consumption.

VOC is most commonly treated with opioids and NSAIDs. However, new research is demonstrating that opioids in addition to virtual reality (VR) is more effective at reducing the experience of pain and pain nerve signals compared to opioids alone. Numerous research studies have demonstrated that VR reduces the experience of pain during painful medical procedures in children, such as venipuncture and burn wound dressing changes.\nThe study aims to add VR to standard of care medical treatment for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease who present to the pediatric emergency department in VOC.

As such, they represent promising targets for fertilization strategies aimed at achieving sustainable agriculture as well as crop production under climate change. Here, we first illustrate how the structure of bacterial communities is shaped according to soil management practices and nutrient availability. Second, we synthetize the interactions involved between plant species and soil microorganisms and highlight the potential of soil biological communities as biological control agents towards pests and pathogens. Third, we point out the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship since microbial groups show different growth rates according to taxonomic level. Finally, we synthetize our knowledge of bipartite food webs and their interactions to present biotic networks as an emerging tool to assess complex interactions within agro-ecosystems.\n\n# Introduction\nAgricultural soils harbor a vast range of organisms. Soil is the largest terrestrial biome and holds around three times, in dry weight, the biomass of the aboveground portion of vegetation   Soil organic carbon and its stability: Theoretical aspects *, Wiesmeier  . Soil microbial communities are important for ecosystem functioning and plant growth in many ways since they contribute to soil fertility, nutrient cycles, ecosystem productivity and plant root colonization by nutritional and physical mechanisms. Microbially derived inputs such as carbon source, nutrition, and plant hormones are vital for the development, stress tolerance, growth, reproduction, and survival of crop and beneficial microorganisms and soil animals. These interactions between soil microorganisms and plants are critical for fertilization strategies aimed at achieving Sustainable Agriculture and Crop production   Soil biology for the 21st century-a review, Bower  .

It is then urgent to implement management strategies favoring plant growth and health, such as soil microbial diversity management, to sustain yield as well as to reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture by promoting the efficiency of the agrosystem. Moreover, sustainable soil fertility management requires that management systems be robust under a variety of perturbations, including climate change.\nPlants and microorganisms often interact within the soil   Microbially mediated plant functional traits, Fries     Plant species and soil type cooperatively shape the structure and function of..., Berg   and several types of interactions have been reported between these two groups [see overview in   Microbe-mediated plant traits are key to understanding soil communities and their functions, Schweitzer   ].

Depending on the extent of the cleft palate, the degree of functional loss varies, but both eating, hearing, speech, bite and appearance can be affected.\nPatients treated for isolated or combined cleft palate may suffer from velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), which means difficulties in closing the passage between the oral and nasal cavities during speech. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is associated with hypernasality, audible nasal air leakage and weak articulation, which might lead to difficulties with communication and social stigmatization.\nThe most common form of speech-improving surgery is a posterior based velopharyngeal flap, creating a bridge between the palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall to more easily compensate for the abnormal airflow through the nose during speech. However, surgical management of VPI is challenging, with variable success rates reported in the literature. In a retrospectively based questionnaire study on patients who underwent surgical treatment of VPI, 30% experienced only a small speech improvement or no improvement at all. In addition, postoperative speech impairment have also been reported, as well as perioperative bleeding and postoperative sleep apnea. Thus, selecting the patients who benefit most from speech-improving surgery is therefore of great importance.\nThe aim with the current study is evaluation of speech function through patient- and parent-response outcome measurements following surgical treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency in children with isolated or combined cleft palate.",

Puerarin has been shown to be a potent anti\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010fibrosis drug; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study is set out to determine the regulatory role of puerarin in pulmonary fibrosis and explore the potential molecular mechanisms. Histopathological staining and lung collagen content assays were performed to evaluate the effects of puerarin on pulmonary fibrosis. Meanwhile, to further understand the mechanism of puerarin improving pulmonary fibrosis, macrophage polarization, levels of serum inflammatory factors, and pro\u2010/anti\u2010inflammatory gene expression in lung tissues were detected. Our results showed that puerarin mitigated bleomycin (BLM)\u2010induced pulmonary fibrosis, alleviated histopathological changes in lungs and suppressed the deposition of lung collagen content. Puerarin reduced the total number of macrophages, enhanced the M2 phenotype marker expression and weakened the M1 phenotype marker expression while increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator\u2010activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u2010\u03b1) pathway\u2010related protein expression. Meanwhile, puerarin decreased the level of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2), interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), and increasing TGF\u2010\u03b2 content in both serum and lung tissue. Importantly, puerarin reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NF\u2010\u03baB, and activated PPAR\u2010\u03b1. However, the PPAR\u2010\u03b1 inhibitor GW6471 blocked the anti\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010fibrotic roles of puerarin, while the overexpression of PPAR\u2010\u03b1 activated GSK\u20103\u03b2. The level of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (p\u2010GSK\u20103\u03b2) was increased while the p\u2010GSK\u20103\u03b2 level was decreased when PPAR\u2010\u03b1 was inhibited and activated. These results suggested that puerarin might ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis by promoting M2 macrophage differentiation, and this might involve the PPAR\u2010\u03b1\u2010GSK\u20103\u03b2 axis. <EOD> Effects of treadmill-walked exercise and voluntary swimming on biochemical and physiological indices including stress hormones of dairy cow.\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the effects of treadmill-walked exercise and voluntary swimming (VS) on serum cortisol (CORT), glucose (GLU), cholesterol (CH), triglyceride (TG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 in bloodstream and milk of dairy cow.

Then, in phase II of the study, 120 AUD patients will be randomized into three groups of intervention in a 1:1:1 ratio (Lactobacillus sp. probiotic, ACT and placebo group; n = 40 per group). The participants in probiotic and placebo groups will then consumed the Lactobacillus sp. Probiotic and placebo 1 sachet once a day of probiotic and placebo, respectively for 12 weeks. While participants in ACT group will undergo training for ACT one session per week for 8 weeks. Outcome assessments will be performed across four time points, such as t0 = before intervention began, t1 = 8 weeks after intervention began, t2 = 12 weeks after intervention began, and t3 = 24 weeks after intervention began. The primary outcomes to be measured are the degree of alcohol craving, alcohol withdrawal, and severity of alcohol use disorder. While the secondary outcomes to be assessed are severity of comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms, serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1), changes in ERP on EEG monitoring, and fecal microbiota content.",

        "summary": "Hysterectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide, with more than 400,000 hysterectomies performed annually in the United States. As a consequence, even uncommon complications can affect large numbers of patients. Among potentially life-threatening events, vaginal cuff dehiscence complicates 0.14-1.38% of procedures, and any vaginal cuff complications (dehiscence, hematoma, bleeding, infection) are estimated to affect 4.7-9.8% of patients. In this scenario, any preventive strategy can provide clinically relevant benefits. Regarding colporrhaphy, only the adoption of a laparoscopic approach instead of a vaginal approach is supported by high-quality evidence. Our group demonstrated that the laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff after total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces the incidence of vaginal cuff complications.\nAmong other potentially effective interventions, the use of barbed sutures was associated with a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence than the standard suture. In a recent meta-analysis, the use of barbed sutures has been associated with a pooled incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence of 0.4% versus 2% after a traditional vaginal suture. However, this evidence is limited because most pooled studies were retrospective, and only two were randomized controlled trials. Moreover, these two randomized controlled trials had a very small sample size and were not powered to detect clinically relevant differences. On that basis, despite the promising utility of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the choice of the type of suture is not evidence-based but still guided by personal opinions, as well as by the preference and habits of the operators.\nTherefore, this study aims to investigate whether the laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure with barbed suture determines a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence and complications than conventional sutures after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

While the mechanisms of allograft rejection and infection are well described, the cause and pathogenesis of CAD remain unclear. Because recent advances in lung transplantation have increased the lifespan of this procedure, new therapeutic modalities are needed to reduce rejection and CAD related death. The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in the pathobiology of lung transplantation and to explore its potential as a novel immunomodulatory agent. In both animal models of lung rejection and in explanted lungs, S1P and S1P receptor agonists decrease allograft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans, and CAD. S1P and its analogs offer promise as antirejection, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic agents. These findings warrant further exploration and the development of therapeutic agents that mimic S1P actions in lung transplant patients. <EOD> Changes in N-glycans in human milk from before to 6 month of lactation\n\nBackground Human milk is a complex biological fluid with a significant dynamic change of its major macromolecules as lactation progresses to support the infant's continuous growth and development. To gain insight in the effectiveness of human milk as functional food, we investigated the N-glycan profile in human milk samples from 24 Chinese mothers collected before and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 months after birth.Methods N-glycans were released from human milk samples by using peptide-Nglycosidase F (PNGase F) and analysed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry under high resolution and high accuracy (LC-HRMS) for identification and quantification of potential structural changes. The molecular structures of N-glycans released from human milk samples were elucidated based on the molecular mass using high resolution mass spectrometry to annotate the main structures. The relative abundance of the detected structures was characterised in samples obtained from different sampling time points and their evolutions analysed by LC-HRMS quantification.ResultsThere was an overall increase of relative abundance of high-mannose type N-glycans, decreased relative abundance of high-mannose hybrids and low-mannose hybrids, an increase of relative abundance of complex-type N-glycans, and decrease of that of high-fucosylation N-glycans as lactation progressed. For N-glycans detected in human milk throughout the first 6 months of lactation, those with the most significant change included mono-and biosialylated complex and",

Although a number of studies have provided support for this hypothesis, neuroimaging studies have produced inconsistent results, suggesting either hypo- or hyper-reactivity to rewards in gambling addiction. These inconsistencies have been the subject of intense debate, but remain unexplained to this day, hampering our understanding of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction. Objectives Primary objective: This project will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional, respectively. Secondary objective: This project will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers. Study design The primary hypothesis will be tested using cognitive tasks performed by participants in an fMRI scanner. In order to assess striatal reactivity to reward, the investigators will use fMRI combined with a reward task. The investigators will use fMRI combined with a facial emotion recognition task to measure the reactivity of the amygdala to emotional stimuli. These tasks will allow the investigators to establish the brain phenotypes characterizing impulsive and emotional gamblers, and test the hypothesis that these phenotypes are diametrically opposed in these two sub-populations. The secondary hypothesis will be tested by combining fMRI measures with behavioral measures from everyday life (EMA). In concrete terms, gamblers will be followed longitudinally for up to 4 weeks, and will receive short questionnaires 3 to 4 times a day on their smartphones to assess their gambling behavior (number of hours spent gambling, amount of money spent...) as well as their emotions (positive and negative). These measurements will enable the investigators to test the hypothesis that the brain phenotypes described above are capable of predicting the relationship between emotions and gambling behavior in everyday life. Study population This study will focus on individuals with gambling problems. This category includes individuals suffering from gambling addiction as defined by the DSM-5, and individuals suffering from problem gambling, just below the DSM-5 diagnostic threshold. Extending recruitment to individuals with problem gambling should facilitate recruitment, while taking into account that there is a continuum of gambling problems.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nTesting the Interplay of Gambling, Emotion and Reward\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nEligibility Criteria\n\n\n\n* **Study Plan**\n- The objective of fMRI studies is to record brain activity in response to various stimulations (e.g. auditory and vision) or behavioral tasks (e.g. decision-making) as participants are lying in an fMRI scanner.

        "summary": "Laparoscopy has become an indispensable part of modern surgery. Vision is an important and defining element of laparoscopy and significantly affects the outcome of an operation in regard to time, mistakes and precision. Several new imaging systems have become available for laparoscopic surgery, including three-dimensional (3D) high-definition (HD), and two-dimensional (2D) ultra-high-resolution (4K) monitors. In experimental and clinical settings, several studies have been published in recent years suggesting that 3D systems present a number of potential benefits for surgeons and patients compared to the conventional 2D systems. The 3D HD system significantly reduces operation time and blood loss, and additionally shortens hospital stay. However, the performance of 3D systems against the new, ultra-high-definition 4K systems is barely known and highly controversial. There is a paucity of studies comparing these two imaging systems in clinical settings. The goal of this clinical trial is to compare 2D 4K versus 3D HD imaging systems in a complex bariatric surgery, more precisely a gastric bypass operation. The investigators aim to investigate the hypothesis stating that the use of the 3D HD system yields a significant improvement in operating time compared to a 2D 4K system in bariatric laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, in order to give a comprehensive overview of the comparison of 2D 4K and 3D HD laparoscopy in a clinical setting, the investigators will assess the workload of the surgeon as well as the intraoperative and postoperative complications including the hospitalization time.",

We report a patient who received allogeneic CD34+ cell transplantation for malignant lymphoma; he became azoospermic and had de novo gonadal dysplasia after transplantation. A 21-year-old man with malignant lymphoma underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplant at the age of 24. He developed a second neoplasm, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), in the thigh 27 months after the first surgery. He was treated with chemotherapy and, 6 months later, his lymphoma regressed. He underwent autologous blood stem cell transplantation for malignant lymphoma when he was 30 years old. When he was 33 years old, the same dose of the second line chemotherapy was performed for recurrent lymphoma. He was azoospermic 3 months before transplantation and the first round infection monitoring tests  revealed he was completely negative for infectious agents including syphilis, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology, and the second round monitoring showed the same results, therefore, he underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

The clinical trials have been conducted for patients with ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma . Moreover, in a study reported by , Huaier granule was also proved to improve the quality of life in Stage III/IV breast cancer patients. In view of the lack of effective treatment for stage I ovarian cancer patients, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer patients after surgery, we plan to carry out a pilot clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Huaier granule as an adjuvant treatment for such patients. (The trial protocol has been reviewed by the expert committee of Guangzhou institute of oncology and has been accepted )\n\n### Questions of interest\nThe results of this study could answer the following questions:\n\n### Primary question\n\n### Exploratory questions\nWhat are the biomarkers associated with Huaier granule as an adjuvant treatment for stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer patients after surgery?\nWhat are the gene levels in plasma from patients with stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer and healthy women before and after 4 weeks of Huaier granule treatment?\nIn patients with stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer, is the level of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) different upon Huaier granule treatment?\nDoes Huaier granule reduce the symptoms of patients with stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer after surgery?\n\nRationale\n\n### Rationale\n\nStage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer is a malignant tumor originating in the ovary or peritoneum of the female reproductive organs and can be spread to other parts of the body via metastasis or direct invasion. The high incidence of recurrence causes heavy harm to the patients and results in a low quality of life for the patients. In recent years, many studies of adjuvant therapy for stage I ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer have tried to lower the morbidity and mortality of patients with the surgery alone. After surgery, all patients with stage I ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer have undergone cytoreductive surgery and cytoreductive surgery + peritoneal chemotherapy. However, the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer is still poor, and there is still no effective therapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines indicate that ovarian cancer patients need to undergo regular examination every 3 months for 2 years after the diagnosis as a part of the follow-up.\n\n### History of Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment for stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer\nMany Chinese medical physicians and scholars have proposed many methods of treating stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer, such as Huai ER granule , Longdan Xiegan Tang, Sijunzi decoction, and Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu decoction. And in order to improve the recurrence rate and survival rate and quality of life of patients, these treatments have been carried out with the treatment of stage I ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer. The research results show that Huaier granule as adjuvant treatment for the treatment of stage I primary ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, and fallopian tube cancer can effectively increase the recurrence rate and prolong the life time of patients.\n\n### Literature review\nWe searched for clinical studies in clinical trial registries such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, as well as the China biomedical literature database",

Exudate volume is a valuable prognostic criterion in the treatment of burns. Volume and concentration of proteins in the exudate vary with the extent of the lesion. Maximum exudate production occurs 24-48 hours after the burn, and falls thereafter. 2. Exudate volume does not seem to be influenced by diet, but, instead, by variations in the protein content of the exudate. 3. Administration of antibiotics in prophylactic dosage does not influence the volume of exudate. <EOD> Immunohistochemical expression of T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis inducing factor (TRIM/MIC) in malignant lymphomas.\nOBJECTIVE\nT-lymphoma invasion and metastasis inducing factor (TRIM/MIC), one of the metastasis-associated antigens, has a possible role in the progression of malignancy. This study was performed to evaluate the correlation of TRIM/MIC with lymph node (LN) metastasis in various categories of malignant lymphomas.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifty-one cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 3 cases of Hodgkin disease (HD) were examined immunohistochemically for TRIM/MIC. Each of the cases had been classified according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The expression of TRIM/MIC was scored semiquantitatively on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 3.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTRIM/MIC had a higher expression in NHL than in HD (p < 0.5) and its expression was higher in cases with LN metastasis than in cases without LN metastasis. The expression of TRIM/MIC was also higher in the follicle center and diffuse large cell types of NHL than in other categories of NHL (p < 0.05) and its expression was closely linked with LN metastasis in NHL. The pattern of immunostaining was diffuse but with a granular or diffuse cytoplasmic staining.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings suggest that TRIM/MIC may have a possible role in LN metastasis of malignant lymphoma through the disruption and the migration of various tumor cells. <EOD> Is there a role for chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer?\nChemotherapy has traditionally played a major role in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. At present, however, the role of chemotherapy is confined to treatment of metastatic (stage IV) epithelial ovarian cancer and for patients with suboptimal surgical debulking. Although optimal debulking (residual disease < or =20%) is associated with better prognosis than suboptimal debulking (>20% residual disease, 5-year survival 44.6% versus 19.8%) (Darcy et al. J Clin Oncol 2000;18:2168\u201376), this is often only achieved by extensive surgery. In the absence of randomized data, various retrospective multicenter studies have compared outcome of patients who were suboptimally debulked. The results have not revealed consistent benefits in disease-free survival or overall survival with platinum-based multidrug chemotherapy. The same outcome can be observed in patients who were optimally debulked. Prospective trials have shown a significant survival benefit with the use of platinum-based chemotherapy (platinum-based treatment vs. non\u2013platinum-based treatment: 2-year survival 30%\u201365% vs. 0%\u201350%) (Vassilakos et al.

Specifically, the investigators will test whether efavirenz produces CYP2B6 genotype dependent unanticipated DDIs with CYP2B6 (methadone) and CYP1A2 (tizanidine), leading to lack of efficacy or increased toxicity. Healthy volunteers genotyped for CYP2B6*6 and *18 alleles will be grouped in to three genotype predicted phenotype groups: 20 normal metabolizer (NM) (CYP2B6*1/*1); 20 intermediate metabolizer (IM) (*1/*6, or *1/*18); and 20 poor metabolizer (PM) (*6/*6, *6/*18 or *18/*18).

Methods: The clinical characteristics, ICH characteristics, and outcomes (OS and disease-specific survival ) of the 138 patients, including 96 melanoma patients and 42 nonmelanoma patients, who were treated with antineoplastic agents (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or intracerebral radiation) within 2 weeks before intracerebral ICH were retrospectively analyzed. All 25 melanoma patients and 10 non-melanoma patients treated under compassionate-use programs with intracerebral talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) were also evaluated. Results: The most common intracerebral metastases presentations were hemorrhage (62%) and mass effect (42%). Melanoma patients with hemorrhagic metastases on average had lower LDH and higher KPS and MSH scores/ratios than nonmelanoma patients. Tumor pathology, LDH, KPS and MSH scores, CSF, and antineoplastic agents did not predict OS. In melanoma patients, KPS, MSH scores, CSF, and tumor pathology did not predict DSS, but hemorrhagic presentations predicted improved DSS (p = 0.04). Intracerebral anti-PD1/PDL1 agents did not predict OS or DSS, but intracerebral radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy predicted improved DSS (p = 0.03, p = 0.008, and p = 0.038, respectively). T-VEC predicted improved OS (p = 0.017) and DSS (p = 0.006) but not ICH recurrence rate (10% vs. 6%). Conclusion: Patient characteristics, especially tumor pathology, did not predict melanoma patient OS. Antineoplastic agents predicted improved DSS in melanoma. CSF tumor burden did not predict OS but did predict DSS.

There are 37 genes, which code for essential functions, including complex I of the oxidative phosphorylation system, in the mitochondrial genome. Some of these genes are also located in the nuclear genome. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has some important characteristics, including its maternal transmission, that make it useful for resolving paternal relationships. Paternity testing using mtDNA polymorphism relies on the variation of a set of highly polymorphic regions of the mtDNA, so-called hypervariable regions (HVRs). These loci may differ significantly in length, mutation rates, and number of variations across species but share properties in terms of mutation and polymorphism rates.\nMitochondria participate in many vital biochemical processes and are involved with cellular respiration, biosynthesis of macromolecules, and energy metabolism; therefore, any alteration in mitochondria may lead to damage. mtDNA evolves under a specific mode relative to the nuclear genome, i.e., mtDNA is characterized by its rapid evolutionary rate and maternal mode of inheritance. The mtDNA diversity in populations can be characterized by calculating genetic indices, measuring genetic variation, and calculating genealogical characteristics. The evolution of sequences is related to the rate, and the accumulated sequence variations can be measured using the average pairwise difference (APD). The use of APD values may reveal genetic differentiation and evolutionary history more completely than the use of simple sequence length variation (SVL) or nucleotide diversity (\u03c0) values. A high level of genetic diversity is found for many Drosophila species in certain chromosomal regions of the mtDNA. A high genetic differentiation may appear from neutral gene diversity caused by DNA demographic history with low gene flow. In addition, the mitochondrial recombination rate and asymmetric mating system (or inbreeding level) may influence mtDNA genetic variation. The evolutionary history of mtDNA haplotypes reflects the historical migratory movement of the populations.\nDrosophila melanogaster is a very important laboratory model; it has a worldwide distribution, has adaptive evolution to different conditions, is easy to rear in the laboratory, and provides several methods for manipulating its genome. Therefore, this species is used as a model for ecological and evolutionary studies and for testing genetic variants in humans.\nWe selected two short mtDNA regions: 1030-782 (CoxI) and 7866-24 (CytB), and we analyzed the 396-bp region between them (CoxI_III region) using 695 sequences from the NCBI Nucleotide dataset. We analyzed the sequences for variation on the nucleotides according to the geographical origins of the populations, and then, we analyzed the genetic differentiation of these populations. Finally, we evaluated the evolutionary relationship between the populations by constructing a phylogeographic network based on these sequences. The analysis of the sequences showed a low level of genetic variation among these populations and provided useful information for studying the origin and evolution of this species.\n\n# Materials and methods\n\n## Mtdna sequence data\n\n## Sequence accesion\nThe GenBank accession of D. melanogaster mtDNA was KP582085 (GenBank accession of D. melanogaster CoxI mtDNA was KP582085). The data set used to construct the sequence phylogenetic trees was accessed from the NCBI repository [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/ input.fcgi?CMD = enteraccession&Accession=KP58208",

All patients with clinical stage T1-T4N0-N1M0 amenable to radical cystectomy with curative intent and FloRIN reconfiguration were included. The sample size for a non-inferiority trial was calculated for different endpoints. Preoperative work-up included chest and abdomen contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. Main exclusion criteria were: 1) presence of one or multiple tumor metastases at preoperative staging; 2) histopathological confirmation of bladder tumor at the level of prostatic urethra; 3) treatment without curative intent (cT4b, salvage or palliative cystectomies); 4) presence of urethral stricture. After preliminary multidisciplinary evaluation, patients were randomly assigned with 1:1 ratio to the mono-J stent placement or the stentless group. For the present study, only patients with a minimum 6 month-follow up were evaluated. Patient demographics, including ASA score and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), peri- and postoperative features including operative time, conversion rate, estimated blood loss (EBL), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain intensity scale, length of hospital stay (LOS) early (\u226430 days) and delayed (>30 days) complications rate, and pathological data were thoroughly gathered.\nFollow-up schedule included blood analysis and CT scan performed three months after surgery, then every 6 months from the first to the third postoperative year, followed by annual imaging assessment according to individual risk profile, as postulated by the EAU guidelines. In case of newly diagnosed postoperative hydronephrosis, only patients with grade > 2 or symptomatic were assessed as functional failure. All eligible patients were offered the possibility to undergo neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy before RARC. Patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, cN+ disease and those presenting with severe cardiovascular morbidity or high preoperative creatinine levels, strongly contraindicating cisplatin administration, underwent immediate radical cystectomy. The enhanced recovery after surgery protocol (ERAS) was regularly applied. Suitable patients underwent a nutritional assessment with a specific immune-nutrition, 7 days preoperatively.",

        "model_output": "[/INST] <EOD> Risk Assessment in Malignant Melanoma\nIn spite of significant progress of melanoma epidemiology and understanding, melanoma causes significant morbidity and mortality. According to the SEER database, the average 5-year survival for patients diagnosed with melanoma is 87%; however, 75% of melanoma deaths occur within the first year after diagnosis, suggesting that significant progress in melanoma diagnosis was realized long ago. Current diagnostic and treatment options, as well as the role of risk assessment, are reviewed in this article, and the value of risk groups as well as new risk assessment tools are discussed. Further, there is evidence that a number of melanoma risk factors, including chronic sun exposure, hereditary mutations, and family history, confer higher risk of second primaries. The risk of second primaries and their features are different according to family history and UV-related risk factors. An accurate assessment of the skin and the development of a practical cancer risk prediction tool may improve early detection and prevention, ultimately reducing overall cancer burden. <EOD> Examining the Effects of Concentric Versus Eccentric Training on Knee Biomechanics and Physiology: Clinical Reasoning\nBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE\nClinical and biomechanical research provides little consensus with respect to the optimal training protocol for exercise rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It is imperative to determine the effects of training protocol on knee biomechanics in order to optimize physiological responses (knee laxity, pain, strength, functional endurance) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction/repairs. The objective was to examine ankle, knee, and hip mechanics during strength training, and knee laxity in the sagittal plane during strength training.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTen ACLR subjects (7 males, 2 females; mean age, 18 years ; right dominant leg, 90%). Strength training was performed at 75% of 1 repetition maximum, and muscle activation was monitored with EMG. Strength testing was performed with concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) training, and knee laxity was assessed during concentric contraction in the sagittal plane.\n\n\nRESULTS\nKnee extension moment was higher during ECC than CON (p=.000). Ankle abduction moment showed greater magnitudes during CON than ECC (p = .002) and higher ankle moments were recorded for ECC than CON (p=.001).\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nAs strength increased, the subjects were able to increase knee moments during CON and ECC training. Significantly larger ankle moments were created in the external rotation plane with CON, and larger ankle abduction moments were created in the internal rotation plane during ECC (p=.002), which may assist individuals after ACL injuries in controlling knee laxity in the sagittal plane during landing phases.\n\n\nIMPACT\nKnee extension and abduction moments were greater during ECC and CON, respectively, strength training at 75% of 1 repetition maximum intensity. The results provided better understanding of biomechanical changes associated with concentric and eccentric training methods at 75% of 1 rep maximum. <EOD> The PEPFAR era - 15 years of investment, impact, and promise.\nThe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) launched in 2003 when AIDS was an escalating crisis. The US government response led to dramatic increases in both the investment and the impact and to the development of a robust delivery system to support patients in low-resource countries. PEPFAR was instrumental in increasing HIV prevention and treatment services and in expanding a delivery network that includes a substantial public-private coalition to support global HIV prevention and treatment efforts. Today the program has become a platform for a series of new commitments to global health issues. This supplement to AIDS contains 13 articles that describe the success of the PEPFAR program and of the international community in terms of AIDS prevention, treatment, and treatment delivery systems, as well as the importance of adolescents and their role in HIV infection control.

Both groups had standard post-operative pain medication protocols set before the study as per the Institution Standards. There was no post operative pain medication that was given for the study, and no doses were changed based on study participation. Patients in the bupivacaine group had 20cc of 0.25% subpectoral bupivacaine (Marcaine) injected into the fascia of the Pecs major under direct vision upon completion of the procedure. Patients in the control group underwent subpectoral saline 20cc injections. Both groups underwent their procedure with their assigned intervention, and post-operative pain control was otherwise standardized with the anesthetic team. All pain scores and length of stay were collected at time of post-operative follow up 1 week after surgery in the plastic surgery clinic.\n\n\nOutcomes\n==========\nStudy success was determined based off of the pre-determined primary clinical aim. Pain scores for these patients were reported at their 1 week PACU visit and their 4 week follow up visit. Patients recorded a daily Pain score daily for 4 weeks. Patients were also given a log to record prescription narcotic pain medication they were taking. There was increased post operative pain control for the patients undergoing 20cc of subpectoral bupivacaine injections into the Pec Major muscle fascia.\n\n\nDesign\n========\nSubpectoral injections of 20cc of bupivacaine, a local anesthetic, were given to one cohort of patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty, and a sham control group had 20cc of saline injected. Standard post operative pain medication regimens were followed for all patients, as was our institution's standard surgery protocol. Subpectoral bupivacaine can provide better post operative pain control for patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty, and there was no difference in length of stay. Post operative narcotic use was decreased in patients given subpectoral bupivacaine..\n\n\nConclusion\n============\nSubpectoral injections of 20cc of bupivacaine provide greater post operative pain control than subpectoral injections of 20cc of saline in patients undergoing bilateral reduction mammaplasty. The use of a subpectoral bupivacaine block provides this extra pain control without increased length of stay or post operative narcotic use, and is a safe and successful means of improving post operative pain control when used along with our standard pain protocol  <EOD> Dual-Responsive DNA Probes Based on Hairpin and Tail for Ultrasensitive Bioanalysis.\nFluorescence-based DNA sensors have emerged as an attractive class of nanomaterials due to their excellent biocompatibility, facile functionalization, and adjustable structure. However, it is still a challenging to design DNA probes with highly specificity towards target and excellent performance in sensitivity detection. Herein, we developed a hairpin-based probe (HBP) and its tail (THP) to form an antisense pair (H-T hybridization) for fluorescent detection. This probe pair has three critical advantages over commonly used probes, i.e., (i) high affinity to target strands, (ii) easy surface immobilization, and (iii) dual signal outputs, including fluorescence (from the HBP stem) and color (from the THP stem) change upon binding with the target strands. As a proof-of-concept, we designed a DNA platform based on three DNA probes (H, H2, and H1),",

These diseases occurred, as a rule, after exposure to chemicals and pollutants of various kinds. Most of the emergence of so-called \"new\" diseases was reported within a short time lag. It is unclear which of these new diseases and syndromes are man-made and which are biological phenomena. But many diseases which were already described in prehistory and in the medical literature of ancient Egypt, antiquity, Greco-Roman times or in the Middle Ages--are in connection with environmental pollution. For example, the ancient symptom of the \"stone poisoning\" of the liver may be connected with chlorine (PCP), the ancient symptom of \"marsh fever\" may be connected with mosquito breeding grounds, the ancient symptom of \"skin itching\" may be connected with fungicides, \"pesticide poisoning\" with organophosphorus compounds, \"malaria epidemic\" with oleander, \"the poison of Samburu\" and other syndromes with oil poisoning. Other \"old diseases\" described in pre- or early post-historical documents (e.g. the symptom of \"nuclear poisoning\") may be artificially induced under modern chemical and technological progress. <EOD> .\nThe authors present a case of bilateral adrenal myelolipomas of spontaneous occurrence in a 45-year-old female patient.

Doxorubicin is in a class of medications called anthracyclines. Doxorubicin damages the cell's DNA and may kill cancer cells. It also blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair. Liposomal doxorubicin is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained inside very tiny, fat-like particles. Liposomal doxorubicin may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of the drug. Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also enhance the activity of chemo- and radiotherapy. There is some pre-clinical evidence in animal models that combining peposertib with liposomal doxorubicin can shrink or stabilize certain types of cancer for longer than either drug alone, but it is not known if this will happen in people.

However, there is limited evidence on its clinical benefits. This study was designed to determine if there is a protective effect associated with IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) against neonatal complications.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted among women attending postpartum visit at a hospital in a region of Maputo province, Mozambique, from July 2006 to December 2009. The incidence of malaria, adverse birth outcomes, and infant's health was analyzed.Results: Among this population of 800 women, there were: 9.6% of them attended postpartum visit early (within 2 months); the median age was 22 years old; 147 (18.4%) of participants had low birth weight (LBW); 167 (20.9%) had premature newborn (PBN) and only 2 (0.3%) had neonatal death. Anemia during pregnancy has been documented in 51.3% of 569 women. Neonates of mothers that had received IPTp with SP were healthier than others: LBW occurred in 15.4% in comparison to 20.6% among those who did not have this. The admission to the nursery because of respiratory difficulties occurred in 14.1% of neonates whose mothers did not receive IPTp with SP, compared with only 7.3% in the other group, thus showing a protective effect.Conclusions: The prevalence of LBW remained higher than recommended by the WHO. The use of IPTp with SP was associated with improved newborn health. There is a need for more effective prevention of malaria in pregnancy. This type of study may support the decision-makers on continuing to promote the use by pregnant women of IPTp as an important strategy for prevention in pregnancy.\n\n# Background\nIn most developing countries, the main causes of morbidity and mortality are infectious and the most affected are children (under 5 years of age).

It is difficult to diagnose as a result of the absence of a definitive diagnostic test. We aimed to compare immune graft histopathological characteristics in grafts that have developed to the chronic rejection stage with those that have not.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBetween January 2010 and December 2015, 143 grafts were included in chronic rejection cases. All of the pathology specimens were examined for lymphocytic microinfiltrations, arterial inflammation and fibrous intimal thickening. These clinical pathologic variables were also compared with the biopsy and clinical follow-up data for 155 kidney recipients (control group), 2 in each case. Data were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics software (Version 17.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA). The Fisher's exact test was used to compare the qualitative variables. To compare the quantitative variables, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney nonparametric test was employed. The significance threshold was accepted as 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of male-to-female ratio (65.9% female vs. 56.7% male) and the mean age of the patients at the time of the kidney transplantation (25.7 vs. 26.9, p= 0.118). No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in other features. When the grafts that progressed to the chronic rejection stage were compared according to their immunologic profile, the cases of microinfiltration (p=0.002) and intimal fibrosis (p=0.012) were significantly more in the chronic rejection group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA better long-term renal outcome was seen in patients receiving calcineurine inhibitor cyclosporine and cyclosporine neoral; mycophenolate mofetil alone, in contrast, increased the risk of chronic rejection. <EOD> Intrathecal Baclofen in Children: A Single-Center Review of Clinical Experience in the Last Decade and Current Practice in Switzerland.

Histological analyses of the region were performed to resolve the borders between these two structures, to identify other areas and nuclei that may be included with the septal nuclei, and to investigate the topography of individual HDB/DBB neurones. Our studies reveal that only the first set, the HDB, continues to the medial septal nucleus (MS), which is well\u2010defined and contains a subdivision of dense cellularity (MS dense). <EOD> Membrane fluidity and surface charge of intracellular organelles in human breast cancer correlated to histological tumour grade and ploidy\nBreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with respect to biologic behaviour and response to therapy. An indication of malignancy grade is often obtained from an examination of tissue morphology, and in cancer research the use of immunohistochemical staining has offered further insight into the progression of tumours. Changes in plasma and intracellular membrane fluidity or in surface charge of cancerous cells may play a role in cancer progression. The purpose of the present study was to compare membrane fluidity and surface charge of the three main intracellular organelle membrane components isolated from 22 mild (grade I, II, or II) and seven moderate or severe (grade III, IV, or IVa) human breast carcinomas, to determine whether any differences in membrane physicochemical properties exist between malignant tumour grades and normal controls. Tumour grade was evaluated histologically after removal from the breast, and cytometric analysis (cytogram and image cytometry) of the membrane fluidity and surface charge of rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria was performed. Fluorescence polarisation measured membrane fluidity. Fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2010labelled dextran measured surface charge. Significant differences were found in membrane fluidity and surface charge between mild and moderate or severe tumour malignant grades. Membrane fluidity was generally decreased. The mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum showed an elevated membrane fluidity compared to the Golgi apparatus. The endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus exhibited an increase in membrane fluidity and in surface charge with the progression of tumour malignant grade. The mitochondrial fluidity increased from normal controls to grade I\u2212II tumours to grade III\u2212IV tumours. An initial increase in surface charge followed by a decrease with the progression of tumour grade was demonstrated for mitochondria. The fluidity and the surface charge of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane also showed a decrease with increasing histologic tumour grade, although they decreased at a much slower rate than did those of the Golgi apparatus membrane. No differences in cell cycle analysis were apparent. The data suggests that intracellular membrane alterations (loss of lipid, and changes in membrane fluidity and surface charge) are an important part of cancer progression. Fluorescence polarisation and image cytometry techniques may thus represent useful diagnostic tools for future tumour marker studies. <EOD> Clinical significance of 123I\u2010MIBG scintigraphy in the evaluation of neuroblastoma\nThe clinical usefulness of metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I\u2010MIBG) scintigraphy and the relationship between 123I\u2010MIBG uptake and clinicopathological features of neuroblastoma were investigated in 37 patients with neuroblastoma (24 with stage III and stage IV neuroblastoma and 13 with stage I and stage II neuroblastoma).

        "summary": "Smartphones are the technological devices of our age that are constantly evolving and whose use is becoming more widespread day by day. Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing quick access to transactions, providing ease of use and sometimes as a status indicator, can pose a risk of addiction when used uncontrolled. Since young people are more intertwined with technology and use smartphones more, they are at greater risk of addiction and the problems that addiction can cause. Poor sleep quality is an important problem that can occur with smartphone addiction and negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Smartphone addiction and the problems it causes are an important public health problem that threatens the whole society, especially young people. In solving this problem, it is among the duties of nurses to teach individuals healthy lifestyle behaviors instead of problematic behaviors. A road map is needed to facilitate the behavior change process. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is widely used today to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which targets interventions appropriate to the individual's stage of change, is used as a guide that facilitates behavioral change. TTM is a model that contributes to change, accelerates it, and supports individuals considering change. In addition to TTM, another method that is more frequently used and contributes to change, especially in addicted individuals, is the motivational interviewing method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and aims to reveal the individual's internal motivation. It is thought that the university years, which are an important period in terms of developing and maintaining health-protective and preventive behaviors, will both increase students' health responsibility and protect them from health-threatening behaviors with the healthy lifestyle behaviors acquired during this period. In line with all this information, this study was planned to determine the effect of the Transtheoretical model and motivational interview-based online intervention program on smartphone addiction and sleep quality levels in nursing students who are in the smartphone addiction risk group.",

It is unclear whether the relatively low number of reported cases of COVID-19 in people with CF (pwCF) is due to enhanced infection prevention practices or whether pwCF has protective genetic/immune factors. This study aims to prospectively assess the proportion of pwCF, including both adults and children with CF who have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a two-year period. This study will also examine whether pwCF who have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 have a different clinical presentation and what impact this has on their CF disease. The proposed study will recruit pwCF from paediatric and adult CF centres in Europe. Serological testing to detect antibodies will be performed on blood samples taken at month 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 with additional time-points if bloodwork is available via normal clinical care. Clinical data on, lung function, CF-related medical history, pulmonary exacerbations, antibiotic use, and microbiology and vaccination receipt, will be collected during routine clinical assessments.\nAssociations will be examined between sociodemographic and clinical variables and serologic testing. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical outcomes and analyze end-points will be examined to explore any age-related or gender-based differences, as well as a subgroup analysis of outcomes in lung transplant recipients and pwCF receiving CFTR modulator therapies. As pwCF receive COVID-19 vaccination a comparison of the development and progression of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pwCF following natural infection and vaccination SARS-CoV-2 over time will be performed.",

Materials and methods 75 symptomatic women with an obstetric history of at least one previous cesarean section underwent color Doppler transvaginal ultrasonography. The diagnosis of placenta accreta was based on the assessment of the placenta by TVU (1) at insertion (intramural or non-intramural), (2) by depth of invasion into the myometrium and 3D-TVU images. The histological examination of the placenta served as the gold standard for comparison. Results We confirmed that TVU at insertion and the assessment of placental depth into the myometrium was accurate (AUC: 0.919, p\u2009<\u20090.0001; AUC: 0.841, p\u2009=\u20090.0007). Accuracy of depth of placenta insertion for the different types of accreta was high (accuracy ranged from 0.779 to 0.933 for intra- or extra-myometrial placental implantation (p\u2009<\u20090.05), from 0.695 to 1.000 for placenta increta (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and from 0.954 to 1.000 for placenta percreta (p\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively. With 3D-TVU, we achieved improved accuracy especially for the assessment of depth of placenta insertion (AUC: 0.908, p\u2009<\u20090.0001; in particular for the depth placenta accrete (AUC: 0.865, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and increta (AUC: 1.000, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). 3D-TVU was also superior to TVU for the assessment of the depth of placenta accreta in patients with multiple pregnancies. Conclusion Our results confirm that 2-D and 3-D TVU imaging allow an accurate characterization of the nature and the severity of the disease. While 2-D TVU is considered to be a sufficient tool for characterization and diagnosis of the condition, 3D-TVU could have higher value for assessing placenta accreta in certain clinical situations. In combination, 3D-TVU and 2-D TVU could be complementary tests to pre-operatively decide, which is the most suitable approach for optimal obstetric result. <EOD> Correlation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Level with Tumor Sidedness, Size, and Differentiation in Patients with Colorectal Cancer\n\n   Vascular endothelial growth factor and colorectal cancer, Yoo     Vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor type-1/ fibroblast growth..., Kitadai     Intra-tumoral vascular endothelial growth factor expression in colorectal cancer: a survival analysis..., Caro   \n\n# Methods\nThirty-nine patients with CRC who underwent curative operation from 2005 to 2006 in the Catholic University of Korea Seoul St. Mary's Hospital were included in the study.

This study will look to explore how efficacious personalised insights and recommendations are, based on genetic and lifestyle information, at improving the health and wellbeing of NHS employees. It will also explore how sustainable these recommendations are for long-term change. Recruitment of NHS staff as participants will take place across multiple NHS trusts including Bradford Teaching Hospital NHS Trust and Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust.\nFollowing consent to partake in the trial, participants will be asked to complete a pre-trial questionnaire which will explore health and wellbeing interests and motivations, perceptions of genetic testing, and a baseline measure of mental and physical wellbeing using a standardised and validated questionnaire (5-item World Health Organisation Well-being Index (WHO-5)). This, and all further questionnaires, will be completed online.\nParticipants will undertake a DNA test provided by FitnessGenes, free of charge. This test will require participants to provide a saliva sample via a spit test. This sample will then be analysed at an ISO-accredited laboratory and results provided back to the participant within 2-3 weeks. While awaiting the results, participants will have access to lifestyle traits calculated using questionnaire data collected when creating a FitnessGenes account.\nOnce their genetic data is added to a participant's FitnessGenes accounts, they will be asked to spend two weeks exploring this information. A questionnaire will then be completed to reassess participant's wellbeing measures and any changes in their perceptions of DNA testing. At this stage, some semi-structured interviews may be conducted, to those who consent to this, to gain further insight.\nA 3-month follow up will be completed to assess whether the platform has had any long-lasting impacts on participants' health and wellbeing.",

Thus far, such diagnosis in the immunosuppressed patient, such as patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relied heavily on chest computed tomography (CT) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), an invasive approach bearing many caveats. Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are compounds that could be detected in exhaled air, and have shown some potential in the non-invasive diagnosis of various conditions, including IPA.\nIn this prospective longitudinal study we aim to compare the VOC profiles of patients diagnosed with AML (baseline) to the profile of the same patient diagnosed with IPA later on, and to the post recovery profile in the same patient. This approach should resolve many of the issues plaguing prior attempts at VOC based IPA diagnosis, mainly the lack of properly designed controls.\nSamples will be collected from consenting patients using Tedlar bags, and analyzed using thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). VOCs detected will be digitally analyzed to construct different classification models, with predictive performances compared to the clinical diagnosis using the accepted methods will be assessed by binary logistic regression.",

If pain is not controlled, it increases the frequency of postoperative pulmonary complications and postoperative morbidity. It can even cause chronic pain in the future. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the gold standard method in the treatment of pain after thoracotomy. Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is known as the most effective method after TEA. The fact that TPVB has fewer side effects than TEA increases the use of TPVB. There is no consensus on the dose of analgesia in studies. In the literature, volumes between 20 ml and 30 ml are frequently used for TPVB in recent years. This study, it was aimed to compare the efficacy of 20 ml, 25 ml, and 30 ml volumes of TPVB with local anesthetic at the same concentration (0.25% bupivacaine) on postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thoracotomy.",

This article discusses these other types of studies and the findings associated with them.\nRandomised controlled trial design:\n- Researchers randomly assign people to receive different treatments or to be exposed to different conditions.\n- Researchers track the results and compare those receiving the new treatment in comparison with the treatment.\n- The outcomes for both groups are compared - researchers are able to compare data to determine whether or not the treatment is equally as effective.\n- This type of research usually follows a long-term goal to gather the most effective and cost-economical treatments.\nRandomised controlled trial method:\n- People are allocated into a treatment group.\n- The researchers analyze the data to determine how well this group of participants responded to the treatment.\nResearchers usually conduct randomised controlled trials to test a new treatment for a disease condition or risk factor associated with that condition. Usually, several hundred or thousands of study participants are involved before researchers discover a truly effective treatment.\nObservational studies:\n- An observational study involves a pre-experiment, clinical trial for the treatment's effectiveness.\n- Observational studies allow researchers to track patients with a natural experiment to control outcomes.\n- They also track a population - this allows the researchers to monitor the natural experiment effects, which include the environment surrounding the patients and the lifestyle and genetics of the patient.\n- The patients typically do not have to follow a strict procedure to participate in an observational study.\nFor example, researchers usually conduct studies investigating a drug, the effects of a drug, and the adverse effects of a drug.\nOther terms related to the study\n==============\n\nSummary: [/INST]\n[INSERT FIGURE ABOUT STUDY PLAN]\nRefer: [/REF]\nThe term randomized controlled trial refers to a way to determine the safety and effectiveness of various treatments in clinical trials.\n[INSERT SUMMARY ACTIONS] <EOD> Prognostic factors related to the postoperative course of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer: a study on 73 patients.\nThe present study deals with prognostic factors in 73 patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma subjected to extended liver resection with hepatic replacement, portal vein resection, or both. The resection ranged from local excision of a few lesions to complete extrahepatic metastasectomy. The majority of patients had a moderately preserved, usually one-sided, liver. The liver metastases were located to the liver parenchyma and the subphrenic and the peritoneal pericaval areas. Patients with synchronous liver metastases seemed to be in some special category of patients compared with those with metachronous liver metastases. In synchronous cases, the disease recurred in the peritoneal cavity in 7 of 18 patients, and liver resection was repeated two or three times in some of these patients. Numerically the highest mortality was found in one-sided resections with a 5-year actuarial survival rate of 34%. The overall postoperative mortality of 29% was mainly attributable to wound infections. <EOD> \nThe human microbiome can affect many functions in our body, among others also the energy metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract and may be an important indicator in disease states and may be helpful for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms.

In animals, such environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity is most pronounced and best studied in sperm, which show changes in morphology and physiology under different environmental conditions. Most studies on these phenotypic effects have focused on one environment, and so it is still unclear if sperm phenotypes are dependent on specific pre-mating conditions, or if sperm phenotypes are general responses to a given environmental condition, independent of whether these conditions were encountered before or after copulation.Results:Using different pre-and post-mating treatments, we investigated whether environment-dependent phenotypic variation of sperm can be caused by a single maternal effect or requires a two-step environmental response through different pre-mating and post-mating environments. We show that the sperm phenotype is altered after exposure to a pre-mating environment; however, the same sperm phenotype can differ after exposure to an identical environment during the post-mating environment.Conclusion: This leads us to conclude that sperm responses are dependent on maternal, pre-mating phenotypes (single maternal effect), but also on environmental changes during ontogeny (both maternal and post-mating environment).\n\n# Background\nAs a result of increased human environmental change and population growth, it is becoming more important to study phenotypic responses to environmental variation.

However, little information is available on the HIV infection and awareness in industrial areas, especially among women. Methods: A cross-sectional survey among 2,831 voluntary clients aged 18 to 59 was conducted in two industrial cities, Xinxiang and Xinzhou in 2008. These two sites represent the low/moderate HIV infection prevalence and high/moderate infection prevalence areas of the country, respectively (average 220/1220 per 100,000 individuals tested in Xinxiang and Xinzhou during 2003-2007). Demographic characteristics, risk behaviors, HIV infection status and knowledge on modes of transmission were collected by a structured questionnaire. Results: The infection and awareness rates among clients were low in both sites (average 0.46% and 63.5% in Xinzhou, and 0.12% and 65.5% in Xinxiang). The prevalence and awareness rates among men were higher than the rates among women (average 0.76% and 76.7% in men, in comparison to 0.09% and 58.9% in women in Xinzhou; 0.26% and 70.4% in men in comparison to 0.04% and 51.5% in women in Xinxiang), in each site with different population structure and distribution patterns of the AIDS risk groups. Heterosexual transmission and unknown ways of transmission were the major routes of HIV infection. Compared to Xinxiang, clients in Xinzhou were younger, more likely to be single or widowed, MSM as risk factor, unemployed, have more unprotected sexual behavior, have limited HIV educational and prevention knowledge; also, more of them could not correctly identify the most appropriate mode of HIV transmission.Conclusions: Although prevalence was still low, HIV infection could still emerge. HIV infection was less likely to be noticed, and sexual transmissions predominated. Prevention efforts were needed to focus on women especially the low-income single or widowed with limited education, to improve awareness of this epidemic.\n\n# Background\nAIDS, as an emerging infectious disease, was first reported in China in 1985 with infections spreading rapidly over the years. According to the Fifth National China AIDS Epidemiological Survey, the prevalence of HIV infection among voluntary counseling clients, mostly MSM and IDUs, was already 3.0% nationally, and 7.7% in large cities. By 2007, a total of 491,550 people had been infected with HIV and 84,780 had died due to AIDS in China, accounting for 12 million people worldwide, becoming the second largest after Africa   Global HIV/AIDS prevention: the China experience, Huang  .\nThe current AIDS epidemic in China has been driven mainly by HIV sexual transmission and IDU, especially among MSM and IDUs, spreading from eastern coastal cities to middle and western areas. The HIV epidemic in China can be further classified into two sub-groups.

There is some evidence that communication between community diabetes clinic staff and general practitioners could be improved; there is a clear need to improve this co-ordination of care. <EOD> The impact of patient race and sexual orientation on perceptions of clinicians who serve rural populations\nAbstract Prejudice against rural patients and clinicians who serve them influences the delivery of and access to health care. A telephone survey sample of 306 rural adults recruited from 48 small rural hospitals in the lower Mississippi River Valley was used to investigate the impact of patient race and sexual orientation on perceptions of clinicians in rural practices. The study sample was 59% white, 40% African American; 30% heterosexual; and 70% gay or lesbian. Findings revealed no statistical differences based on patient race and sexual orientation. Overall, the majority of patients\u2014both white and African American and straight and gay or lesbian\u2014would not choose a different doctor or wait longer to see a doctor if they thought the clinician would not care for them because of these demographic factors. <EOD> Gastric volvulus causing abdominal compartment syndrome in adults: a surgical emergency.\nGastric volvulus may cause death if not diagnosed and treated promptly. The mortality of surgical treatment of gastric volvulus ranges between 19 and 83%. Early operation is the only way to decrease the mortality of gastric volvulus. We present two patients with gastric volvulus caused by abdominal adhesions, one of which had simultaneous adrenal tumour excision as well as simple cholecystectomy. One of the adhesive bands caused gastric volvulus and the other one caused stenosis of the duodenal bulb, which has not been reported yet. We would like to remind clinicians on this entity, as abdominal compartment syndrome caused by gastric volvulus requires early exploratory laparotomy and reduction. We would like to emphasise that abdominal compartment syndrome with gastric volvulus can be managed only by early abdominal decompression and reduction. Patients can be managed by simple decompression and reduction during the early phase of the disease. <EOD> Aortic root dilatation in patients surviving a systemic arterial aneurysm.\nOf 152 patients after successful repair of an aneurysm of systemic artery only five were older than 50 years. The aneurysm was located in aorta in 109 cases, in iliac arteries in 36, in pulmonary artery in 3 only. All the patients were examined for aortic root dilatation in follow-up between 1959-1986. There was no dilatation of aortic root in case of congenital",

        "summary": "Although effective evidence-based interventions have been developed for alcohol and cannabis use disorders, it is still unclear which individuals respond best to treatment. A recent model known as the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) proposes that assessing for differences in three neurofunctional domains (executive function, incentive salience, and negative emotionality) could allow for a stronger neuroscience-based framework for understanding heterogeneity in response to addiction treatments but this has never been tested prospectively. In this study, we will recruit two groups: (1) participants with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and (2) participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD). Participants will undergo thorough baseline assessments of each of the three ANA domains prior to evidence-based treatment for their respective disorders. Individuals with AUD will be treated with 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for AUD plus optional pharmacotherapy guided by a pharmacotherapy algorithm. Individuals with CUD will be treated with 12 weeks of CBT + motivational enhancement therapy for CUD. The primary objective of the study is to assess whether baseline ANA measures are associated with changes in drug consumption and craving over treatment.",

The interactions between the cancer cells and the bone marrow microenvironments are complex. However, detection of malignant myeloma cells in MM tissue biopsy specimens remains difficult. Here, we used a multicolor immunofluorescence staining panel, including a panel of myeloma-associated markers (HLA-DR, CD38, CD138 and CD 19), normal plasma cell markers (CD38, and CD138), a leukocyte common antigen (CD45), and markers of malignant plasma cells (CD19, CD56, CD39, CD82, and CD44, the myeloma cell surface antigen Ki-67, and the cancer stem cell markers CD133 and CD326) to detect myeloma cells in MM tissues. Immunoperoxidase staining with diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as a secondary antibody to detect malignant myeloma plasma cells and CD19(+) B lymphocytes and leukocytes, while immunofluorescence staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used as a secondary antibody to detect other leukocyte common antigen+ cells in MM tissue biopsies. Analysis of clinicopathologic data including serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum immunoglobulin, serum immunofixation electrophoresis, cytology, cytogenetics, FISH, PET/CT, bone radiograph, as well as bone marrow biopsy and immunohistochemistry was done for correlation. The results showed that immunostaining with the immunofluorescent method improved the detection of myeloma cells in MM biopsy specimens. Therefore, it is feasible to enhance the detection of myeloma cells and immune markers in MM tumors and tissues by applying multicolor immunofluorescence staining followed by high-resolution analysis with high-resolution microscopy. A large set of antibodies targeting myeloma-associated and lymphocytic epitopes may be used as part of the antibody panel to enhance visualization of MM neoplasms in tissues. Our studies with a large set of antibodies targeting myelomas-associated markers may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of MM. <EOD> .\nThe purpose of this study was to identify the relationship of emotional status-adjustment of the child, personality function of the parent and the attachment mode of the child to behavioral disorders during development of 2-year-olds.

The placebo effect of manipulative therapy for patients with chronic low-back pain: protocol for a randomized controlled trial. 2014 Aug 14. 2014.\n\n\nBackground: \n* The placebo effect is defined by  as \"the positive treatment effect when administering a placebo to patients\"\n\n* According to , the placebo effect can be produced during two types of medical intervention: one based on an active intervention, such as drug intervention, and another not based on active intervention, such as manipulation - physical treatment, surgery, and complementary treatments.\n\n* Based on the results of earlier studies, the mechanisms that are used in the placebo-controlled randomized trials to increase the effects of the interventions are: attention to the symptoms by the patient (attention effects), the belief in the drug effectiveness by the patient (placebo effects), and the improvement in the doctor-patient communication (nocebo effects).\n\n* In a clinical trial that was published in 2012, investigated the effect of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) in patients with chronic low-back pain. The results of the trial showed that SMT was more effective when a positive message was given concerning the treatment before the intervention when compared to a neutral message (the same type of effect was observed when compared to a negative message or when compared to the SMT without a message). The study concluded that the results confirm the importance of contextual factors to the effect of SMT.\n\n* In a clinical trial that was published in 2013, investigated whether SMT was effective in patients with chronic low-back pain when a placebo effect was induced after the treatment by the participants (placebo-induced patients). When compared to the findings of the previous trial, the findings of the study showed that the placebo effect, that was observed when a positive message was given before the intervention, did not have any effect when the positive message was introduced after the intervention (there were also no differences between the neutral information or the negative messages). \n\n* In a recent meta-analysis,investigated whether a positive belief towards SMT is predictive to the efficacy of SMT in the long-term, and concluded that a positive belief is positively associated with the outcomes of SMT.\n\nBased on these results, the present research protocol aims to study the effects of a positive expectation in the SMT provided to patients with chronic low-back pain.\n\nClinical Relevance:\n\n1) Although clinicians could produce the placebo effect intentionally, as well as the nocebo effect; non-cognitive-behavioral aspects are considered to be the main source of the placebo effect.\n2) The mechanisms used by the clinicians to produce the placebo effect and nocebo were:\n&ndash; to avoid any discord related to the diagnosis and treatment provided (when related to a chronic condition)\n&ndash; to avoid mentioning any information in relation to a pain originating from a specific cause\n&ndash; to avoid mentioning the duration of the proposed intervention\n\n3) The placebo effects produced by the intervention in relation to chronic pain may be divided as:\n&ndash; effects produced by the patients to the clinical relationship (personalized therapeutic relationship \u2013 patient-clinician interaction)\n&ndash; effects produced by the perception of the treatment (perception of the symptoms, perception of the therapist\u2019s intention in relation to the health and the clinical outcomes)\n&ndash; effects produced by the therapeutic relationship\n&ndash; effects produced by the therapeutic relationship or by the patient's characteristics\n\n4) In a research that was published in 2011, the placebo effect in SMT was considered to be a possible key element to the effectiveness of SMT (a study that was published in 2013 studied a positive belief in SMT to optimize the chronic effect of a placebo-sugly\n\n__________________________ patient\n_________________perceut to the findings in the efficacy of the intervention the study___________________ outcomes findings of the efficacy: a specifically, in the patient:\nThe patient/s findings the context-Valence, The Study Questions of chronic low-back pain studies that can be",

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide and second leading cause of cancer death. Most CRCs arise from a polyp, developing through two major precursor lesion pathways: the traditional adenoma-carcinoma pathway, and the serrated neoplasia pathway. This provides opportunities to prevent cancer by removing its precursor lesions. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of precancerous polyps with colonoscopy and detection of early-stage CRC, which has been demonstrated to reduce CRC incidence and mortality effectively, making CRC one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer.\nCurrent guidelines in China recommend starting CRC screening uniformly at age 50 in average-risk individuals. However, a one-fits-all approach to determining CRC screening starting age may be not conducive to personalized screening, especially in the developing countries with scarce health resources. The incidence of early-onset CRC (CRC diagnosed before the age of 50) has shown a continuous increasing trend worldwide, spurring the US Preventive Services Task Force to recommend initiating average-risk CRC screening at age 45 instead of 50. Furthermore, different populations may benefit from even earlier screening, and CRC incidence may differ on the basis of population characteristics and CRC risk factors. For individuals younger than 50 years old, earlier screening based on risk factors may address this concern.\nPrevious studies have recommended earlier starting age of CRC screening combined with risk factors such as but not limited to sex, age, family history, lifestyle and comorbidity. Some upper gastrointestinal diseases have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasms, which may be related to the destruction of gastric acid barrier function and long-term use of pump proton inhibitors. Compared with colonoscopy examination, individuals were more willing to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination for gastric cancer screening, especially among the younger, potentially utilizing the EGD to guide earlier colonoscopies for patients at increased risk. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the association between esophagogastric histopathology and colorectal neoplasms in patients under the age of 50 and whether these risks factor could be combined with to guide earlier CRC screening.",

This replication involves the formation of replicative forms of HDV RNA and HDV genomic RNA (3.6 kb) that are derived from dimeric and monomeric forms of subgenomic and genome-length HDV RNAs, respectively, which are transcribed in vitro by HDV large antigen. In this study, we identified a single substitution (T894A) in the HDV RNA polymerase (RP) that conferred ability to form replicative forms of HDV RNA and genomic RNA from a monomeric template. The mutated T894 in the active-site domain of large antigen (amino acids 876 to 904) was in contact with one of the two arginine residues (R900 and R902) previously reported to be absolutely essential for RNA synthesis in vitro. Thus, our results indicate that a small difference in active-site domain conformation contributes to RNA replication in vitro. <EOD> Osteoid osteoma of the cervical spine: an unusual location.\nAlthough classically reported as a lesion of long bones and the distal aspect of the femur, an increasing number of cases of osteoid osteoma in unusual locations are being reported.

        "summary": "Under normal conditions, pain arises as a consequence of the activation of nociceptive afferents (small fibers) by an external stimulus with sufficient intensity to potentially cause tissue damage. This peripheral activation is processed as perception of pain by the central nervous system. In order to reliably evaluate the state of the nociceptive system in both clinical and experimental settings, standardized tests are essential. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a set of tests used to measure the intensity of a stimulus that produces a specific sensory perception in a subject. For example, if we gradually apply pressure, the point where the sensation changes from pressure to pain is called the pressure pain threshold. This type of test can be performed with different types of stimuli, including hot and cold stimuli or mechanical stimuli. Although these tests have been shown as reliable in healthy volunteers and pain patients, they are subjective in their nature, since they are based on a conscious evaluation of tested subjects. Likewise, these measures show substantial variability due to differences in the application of the tests by individual examinators. In short, even though the method is quantitative, its methodological characteristics make it subjective and dependent on both the operator and the subject under study. Moreover, contrasting results have been recently found regarding the measurement variability when repeating the QST at intervals of days. Thus, it is essential to investigate and develop new QST alternatives to obtain objective markers that may potentially contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind chronic pain conditions.",

These could be evaluated, for example, with an instrument such as the EP-Q. |\n| Risk factors\n\nInformed Consent Statement\n============================\n\nAs the research involves a non-pharmacological intervention, it is important that all patients participating in it understand all the processes that will take place in each part of the experiment and what the aim of the research is in order to ensure their collaboration. For that, it is essential to formulate an informed consent which will include adequate content and language. We therefore suggest that the contents are described so that they are understandable to the average person. We are of the opinion that one of the fundamental parts of the content of a consent is a justification of why the research will be carried out. This justification is considered a positive motivating element to carry out the research; in addition, it is considered mandatory by different research commissions. For this reason, we will begin by writing the contents of the information to be included in the informed consent and the justification that could be required for it to be approved by the REB. If the information is not sufficient or the REB requires more information, we suggest you add relevant contents to the informed consent.\n\nConsiderations to Write the Informed Consent:\n\nIn addition, there is also a section of questions on the nature of this type of study, in which we would like to consider the following:\n1. Researchers: who and where they are, what you study, what is the scope and the objective\n\n## Institution: is it an organization in the health area and what kind of institution,\n  in the case of a hospital, is it private or public and how many health personnel are included.\n  In the case of a university, specify in which faculty it belongs and to which department.\n3. Study: name, design and brief description\n4. Risks and benefits:\n  This section describes the risks and benefits for subjects of this proposed research.\n    What are the benefits for them if they participate? (For example, if they participate they can learn about their pain and discomfort and they will help to understand the pain pathophysiology). On the other hand, what are the risks? (For example, pain if you are exposed to an electric stimulus; in some cases, this study can be a little painful and the subject should be aware of this).\n    The risks and benefits are analyzed depending on the study and how the study is conducted and we will include them in the consent.\n    Example for a behavioral study to evaluate pharmacological pain responses:\n    As you know, this study aims to evaluate the role of a molecule that can block pain nerve impulses. The evaluation of pain requires in most cases a nerve stimulation and that the subject feels pain, although some stimulations are almost imperceptible to the person. Also, in many of these tests the body is exposed to a magnetic static field which would not have a harmful effect, but some subjects are sensitive to static magnetic fields and sometimes they can feel uncomfortable. If these sensations are tolerable for you, it is possible a study with slight discomfort and minor risks.\n6.

The purpose of the present work was to study the effects of different hydrolyzed protein diets and their combination with antimycotics on skin pigmentation. Three groups of hamsters received the diets; first, the control diet (C), in which the protein source was from whole ground corn 69%; second, the F diet, in which the protein source was completely hydrolyzed with Alcalase enzym 900; and third, the F + Z diet with the addition of zinc oxide 2%. The animals in the Z group were fed the C diet and topically received 2 mg/cm 2 of zinc oxide. The fourth group was under UV irradiation every third day for 3 wk to study the capacity of F, F + Z, and Z diets and albaconol (Antibic) to protect the skin against UV radiation. The skin of hamsters fed with C diet showed an important pigmentation after UV exposure compared with Z group. The pigmentation was increased in hamsters fed F and F + Z diets, while the group that received Z showed no alteration of skin color. This data indicates that the diet F + Z improves the skin pigmentation with some advantage compared with F diet and that albaconol also protects the skin from phototoxic effect of UV. <EOD> Effect of the COVID\u201019 Pandemic on Surgical Resident Education\n\nThis project was exempt by the institutional review board.
