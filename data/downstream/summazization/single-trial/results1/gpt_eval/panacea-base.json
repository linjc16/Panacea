        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",
        "model_output": "1. Nociplastic pain (NP) is a form of pain that is often associated with a variety of physical and psychological symptoms. 2. Patients with chronic migraine (CM), fibromyalgia (FM), and vulvodynia (VU) tend to present with common psychosocial features, such as central sensitization, trauma history, personality traits and defensive styles. These features are often associated with poorer management of pain and worse prognosis. 3. The researchers hypothesize that CM, FM, and VU may be grouped by a number of specific psychosocial factors that could be useful in providing a better understanding of the symptoms associated with NP, and consequently could be useful in implementing more effective interventions. 4. For this purpose, the researchers propose to develop a study that will assess the presence of specific psycho-social clusters in patients with CM, FM, and VU, and will try to identify the most suitable intervention strategies.This will make it possible to define the characteristics of each cluster, to develop specific tailored interventions, and to use them as a therapeutic strategy.\nPatient population: Patients with CM, FM, or VU participating as clinical sample. Control group (no chronic pain condition): 2nd year psychology students (not selected) or people from the general population with no medical history. No previous diagnosis of chronic pain conditions. Inclusion criteria: age range 18-65 years education > 5 years diagnosis of FM according to Wolfe, 2016 diagnosis of CM according to Olesen, 2017 diagnosis of VU according to Bornstein et al., 2016 Exclusion criteria severe psychiatric disorders and/or cognitive impairment difficulties in comprehension/expression in Italian history of other chronic pain disorder(s) history of other neurological disorders besides migraine\n\n\nPrimary study hypothesis\n=================\nDefine the most common psychological clusters in patients with pain of nocurplastic origin.\n\nStudy design\n=================\nA descriptive, multi-center, open, uncontrolled study will be conducted on 150 patients with FM or CM or VU, compared to 50 controls (without previous diagnosis with chronic pain conditions) will be conducted.\n\nStudy objectives\n=================\n1.

These will be assessed through online questionnaires. A questionnaire will then be administered to collect epidemiological data (e.g., age, education level, previous diagnosis of chronic pain).\nTo identify the presence of the main psychosocial clusters, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire. A total of eleven psychosocial variables will be taken into account; the following are: (1) central sensitivity index; (2) traumatic experiences index; (3) personality traits; (4) defense mechanisms; (5) mental pain; (6) environmental sensitivity; (7) environmental hypersensitivity; (8) sensitivity to social rejection; (9) physical pain; (10) sexual pain; (11) depression; (12) anxiety; (13) psychosomatic symptoms; (14) health perception; (15) quality of life; (16) alexithymia; (17) perceived social support; (18) pain-related sexual disorder; (19) pain-related sexual dysfunction; (20) sexual satisfaction.  Finally, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the level of satisfaction with the treatment received for pain. The investigators expect that the results of this study will be of great interest to the scientific community. They will help to develop more effective interventions for patients with chronic pain conditions. Additionally, they can help to identify the most appropriate treatment for each patient.\nThe investigators also hope that this study will help to improve the quality of life of patients with chronic pain conditions.\n\nStudy population\n=================\n150 women with chronic pain conditions (FM, CM or VU) and 50 women with no previous diagnosis of chronic pain conditions",

        "summary": "Aim: This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of two types of mattresses with different support surfaces used in bedridden patients.\nMethod: The sample of this quasi-experimental study consisted of 60 patients according to the inclusion criteria. A group I and group II of 30 patients each were formed from the sampled patients. For the patients in group I, a bed with a cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was used. For the patients in group II, a viscoelastic mattress was used. The data of the study were collected with the ''Patient Identification Form'', ''Braden Scale'', ''Pressure Wound Observation Form'' and ''Wound Measurement Chart''. Number-percentage distributions, Chi-square, Fisher's Exact Probability Test and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to evaluate the data.\nImplications for Clinical Practice: It was determined that the support surface used affected the pressure sore size and the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature created smaller sized wounds in the sacrum, trochanter, malleolus and heel regions. In the sacrum, scapula, and heel regions, although not statistically significant in terms of wound stage and the number of patients who developed pressure sores, it was seen that the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was more effective.",
        "model_output": "Patient education and awareness about the use of these mattresses is important and has been published by the manufacturer. Patient education and awareness programs may also help with a gradual shift from the traditional use of low air-loss beds to the use of massage beds. This, in turn, will reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in nursing homes. Patient education about this may include providing information about pressure sores, their risk factors, and their prevention, as well as the importance of using a pressure sore prevention device.\n\nInput Text: Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Studies in Healthy Subjects of BI 412 (Humanized Anti-IL17a Monoclonal Antibody)\n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and the potential for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) associated with chronic oral 412 (dose range: 2 to 900 mg) administration for 12 months in healthy, non-smoking male and female subjects from the United States and elsewhere. This was a Phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study with 9 cohorts. Subjects received 2 to 900 mg of study drug daily for up to 12 months in capsular formulation and were randomly allocated in 9 cohorts: 6 cohorts with ascending doses (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 900 mg; N=60 across all cohorts), and 3 cohorts at a dose level of 6, 30, and 900 mg (N=30 across all cohorts) based on PK and PD analyses from earlier cohorts. The first 6 subjects recruited in the initial cohort were selected to enable evaluation of safety, tolerability, PK, and PD in this pilot cohort. The first 2 subjects in the first cohort received BI 412 in a blinded fashion (placebo), while the remaining 4 subjects in this cohort and all subjects from the subsequent cohorts received BI 412 and were unaware that they were receiving active drug.\nDose adjustment considerations in subjects with renal function abnormalities as well as treatment guidelines were based on available pharmacological data (e.g. IL-17 levels). Patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr, by Cockcroft-Gault formula) \u2264 80 mililiters/minute were not eligible for enrollment. Adequate kidney function and no history of kidney disease at the time of assessment was a requirement for enrollment in the study. Subjects with moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction as well as active, clinically significant infection including tuberculosis, herpes zoster, and hepatitis B virus or C virus were not eligible for enrollment. Pregnant or lactating female subjects were also excluded from the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential and males not willing to practice effective methods of contraception after consent and until 30 days after the subject stopped treatment with BI 412 were not eligible for enrollment.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nPharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Studies in Healthy Subjects of BI 412 (Humanized Anti-IL17a Monoclonal Antibody)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHealthy Volunteer\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: BI 406\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Healthy individuals, as determined by a physical examination, full blood count (with or without reticulocytes), urea, electrolytes, creatinine (only if creatinine > 1.2 mg/dl), aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT), total bilirubin, blood glucose, and urinalysis Results of a complete medical history within 90 days prior to screening Healthy individuals, determined by medical history and physical examination, who may be taking oral contraceptives at the time but who have committed to practicing birth control with an effective method of contraception, which includes both a condom and spermicidal foam, or to abstain from sexual activities during the study and for 30 days after taking the last dose of study medication Normal cardiac resting 12 lead electrocardiogram",

        "summary": "Hospitalization, medical interventions to be performed, and uncertainties specific to surgical intervention create a certain level of anxiety in the patient. It is known that being in the hospital negatively affects the coping mechanisms of the patient. In the pre-surgical period, the nurse's practices that will facilitate the patient's coping with the situation and managing his anxiety have a positive effect on anxiety during and after surgery and on anxiety-related symptoms. For these reasons, it is aimed to determine the effect of virtual reality on pre-surgical anxiety in this study.The hypothesis of the study is that watching videos with virtual glasses will reduce preoperative anxiety.",
        "model_output": "The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of virtual reality on preoperative anxiety in abdominal surgery patients. It is known that abdominal surgery patients have high preoperative anxiety levels. In addition, the development of technology, especially the use of smart devices in daily life, makes it possible to try different solutions for the treatment of anxiety in preoperative patients.\n\nIt is known that the most stressful period for individuals before surgery is the preoperative period, at least as much as the postoperative period due to the fear of surgical treatment. During this process, due to fear of unknown treatment and fear of anesthesia, the patient's concerns increase even more and can cause stress-related symptoms (Duncan et al., 2017). Excessive anxiety, which may cause complications, must be avoided in order to avoid negative outcomes such as increased pain and muscle tension, prolonged recovery from anesthesia and anxiety. In recent years, the use of virtual reality glasses has come to the fore to reduce preoperative anxiety. A meta-analysis found that the use of virtual reality glasses significantly reduced preoperative anxiety in children and their caregiving parents, and had long-term results in terms of decreasing stress and maintaining calmness (Schuh et al., 2018). The positive effect was observed especially in the group with high anxiety scores, and a significant reduction in negative emotions was observed in the group without virtual reality glasses (Bailey et al., 2019). In the study conducted by Moss-Magnier et al. which is related to the research problem of our study, they found that a large part of the patients preferred virtual reality glasses more than watching a documentary before laparoscopic surgery (Moss-Magnier et al., 2009 ). In addition, a study conducted by El-Boghdady et al. in Egypt showed that patients using virtual reality glasses experienced less negative emotions and had a better surgical experience (El-Boghdady et al., 2020).\nAlthough the literature showed that there are positive results in terms of reducing preoperative anxiety with the use of virtual reality glasses, there is no scientific study conducted in our country on the effect of virtual reality glasses on reducing preoperative anxiety. Since it has been observed that the use of virtual reality glasses reduce preoperative anxiety in surgical patients, it is necessary to conduct an original research to contribute to science. It is envisaged to collect both objective and subjective data in this study. After the patient is taken to the surgical unit, the digital video to be watched will be watched for the first time in the placebo group, in the intervention group with virtual reality glasses, and in the control group, the measurements will be measured with the visual anxiety scale and the stress level will be measured with the smart bracelet in both groups. At the end of the measurements, the smart bracelet will be stored by taking the name and mobile number of the participant. It is expected that the preoperative anxiety level in the placebo group will decrease only due to the normalization and adaptation process, while in the intervention group, it will be seen that the preoperative anxiety level decreases to a greater extent by the use of virtual reality glasses.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe effect of virtual reality on anxiety management before general surgery\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAnxiety\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Behavioral: Watching video with virtual glasses\n* Behavioral: Watching video without virtual glasses\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Aged 19 and over Patients who will undergo general surgery Patients who agreed to participate in the research Exclusion Criteria: Patients with physical and mental disability History of a visual disease Patients who had surgery in the last 6 months Any medical condition that prevents the use of virtual reality glasses Not included in the informed consent process To be diagnosed with one or more acute anxiety disorders (i.e. generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or specific phobia) History of chronic anxiety disorders History of alcohol and substance abuse in the last 12 months in the last 12 months History of using psychotropic drugs in the last 4 weeks History of suffering from schizotypic disorder History of suffering from bipolar disorder History of suffering from a personality disorder (personality with cluster A, B or C disorders) A history of psychotic symptoms such as disordered behavior, delusion and hallucination Inability to communicate due to an auditory problem.\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nMinimum Age: 16 Years\nMaximum Age: 70 Years",

Affecting approximately 2.5 million individuals around the world and seen mostly in young adults, MS can cause different levels of disability in functional activities, cause limitations in social and professional life, and impair quality of life. Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that develops on the basis of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Nutritional habits and physical activity are important environmental factors. These can be effective in the course of MS and change the quality of life. Compatibility of nutrition with the Mediterranean diet and providing adequate physical activity may be beneficial in increasing physical and mental well-being in general, and therefore the quality of life of the person.\nIn our country, there is not enough information about the ongoing nutritional habits and physical activity levels of MS patients in their daily lives, and quality of life studies are limited. Our limited knowledge on these issues narrows the possibility of movement in an area that can be corrected in MS patients and thus have a positive impact on their quality of life.

        "summary": "An overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by frequent en nightly voiding, small bladder capacity and the occurrence of sudden urge to void, with or without urinary incontinence. The prevalence of OAB with bothersome complaints is around 11% in women and 9% in men with an increasing incidence with age. OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed. Depending on the patient's characteristics and the physician's preference intravesical injections of Botox or the implantation of a sacral neuromodulator (SNM) can be considered.\nBoth options are equal and effective, but many individual differences exist in preference. Regarding outcome, some factors have been described to prefer one therapy above the other, for example in case of concomitant fecal incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections,\u2026 The personal preference of doctors and patients has been investigated, but currently no study has focused on therapy preference in a culturally and linguistic divers (CALD) population. The latter broadly describes a population with ethnical, cultural, religious and/or language characteristics and is a general accepted measure of diversity.\nIn the current study, the investigators aim to describe the different (dis)advantages of both second line treatments for OAB in a discrete choice experiment. The study population will consist of a diverse group of patients with OAB from different hospitals. The goal is to investigate if CALD patients make a different choice in treatment and what factors contribute to that decision in order to provide more tailored information regarding the treatment options in the future. Taking a patient's context into account in the shared decision making between a patient and physician increases therapy compliance and satisfaction of the chosen treatment.\nThe total questionnaire will consist out of general demographic info, the EQ-5D, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)-OAB and the discrete choice questionnaire in which patients make a choice between two fictional treatment options consisting of a combination of different therapy characteristics.

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",
        "model_output": "This is a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized control trial involving premature neonates born between 23 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks gestational age. The trial will take place in four Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) within the Rady Children's/University of California, San Diego network, including Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego, Jacobs Medical Center, Scripps La Jolla (Rady NICU) and Rancho Springs (Rady NICU). The investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no). The investigators set the alpha error rate at 0.05 and power at 80%. To achieve a 50% reduction in the CPAP weaning failure rate, they aimed to enroll a total of 80 infants < 28 weeks and 50 infants 28-30 weeks (130 infants in total). Consent will be obtained after the eligible infant has been extubated or has been stable on NIS (defined as CPAP/NIMV/NIPPV- all modes of pressure reliant respiratory support) for over 72 hours. NIS is delivered via occlusive (Fischer & Paykel [F&P]) or non-occlusive (RAM TM/Nioflo TM) interfaces at any pressure and oxygen need. A standardized maintenance/weaning protocol will be implemented for the treatment group (standardized NIS wean) while the control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices.

Fistulae complicating diverticulitis are the result of a localized perforation into adjacent viscera, and occur in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease[2]. The types of fistulae include colovesical, colovaginal, colotubal, coloenteric, and colocutaneous fistulae[3]. Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely, accounting for 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease[4]. Herein we describe a case of a fistula connecting the sigmoid colon with the left flank-lower lumbar area, due to diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon[5].\nA new over-the-scope clip system, called OTSC (Ovesco Endoscopy, T\u00fcbingen, Germany), appeared on the market about 3 years ago[6]. The system consists of a nitinol clip loaded at the tip of the endoscope that can capture a large amount of tissue and compress the lesion until healed[7]. Results from animal models and initial clinical use support the efficacy of OTSC closure in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding; its role in the management of iatrogenic perforations in humans is less defined, and reports on its use in treating colorectal postsurgical leaks and fistulas are anecdotal [8].

        "summary": "Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer generally have favorable outcomes and how well they do depends on the specific details about the patient and their cancer. How well they do isn't as related to the kinds of treatment they get. However, there are significant side effects for the various types of treatments they may get. Because these patients generally have favorable outcomes no matter the kind of treatment, reducing side effects should be a priority when choosing their treatment.\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate whether a new blood test called a Circulating Tumor DNA test (ctDNA test) can decrease the number of people that require radiation after surgery. This blood test is often elevated in people when they are diagnosed with head and neck cancer. There are studies that show that cancer most often returns when this blood test is positive after treatment. This study will test patients' blood before and after surgery. In cases where the test is negative after surgery, people on the study will not receive radiation unless they are considered high risk based on surgery findings. The hope is that radiation and its potential side effects can be limited to only people that need the treatment.",
        "model_output": "Rationale(s): Rationale: The incidence of oropharynx cancer (OPSCC) has historically been low, and even more uncommon are cases occurring in younger adults (age 30-50) and in females. More recently, the incidence of oropharynx cancer (OPSCC), particularly at sites where human papillomavirus (HPV) is the predominate causative agent, has dramatically increased over the last several years.\nTreatment for locally advanced OPSCC consists of definitive radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy. Local treatment outcomes have dramatically improved in the last 20-30 years with overall survival with locally advanced OPSCC nearly 80-100%. Local treatment modality is dictated by the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) with definitive treatment for OPSCC confined to primary tumor site or neck disease based on clinical staging. Adjuvant radiation therapy has been demonstrated to decrease local failure rates for OPSCC. The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy in cases with positive surgical margins has been questioned as patients with positive surgical margins also tend to have microscopic extracapsular extension (ECE) and are more likely to present with node-positive disease.\nRisks: Risks: In addition to common acute toxicities, their favorable overall survival potentially places these patients at increased risk for developing long-term treatment-induced side-effects. Therefore, it is important to establish novel management approaches that maintain excellent current clinical outcomes while effectively reducing acute and long-term side effects. The SAVAL study tests the hypothesis that patients currently recommended for surgery (TORS) and have positive ctDNA will be offered registration for the study prior to surgical resection.\nStudy Goals and Objectives: Study Goals and Objectives: The goal of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients currently recommended for surgery (TORS) and have positive ctDNA will be offered registration for the study prior to surgical resection. After TORS, all patients will have ctDNA drawn within 2-14 days post operatively. Combined with pathological criteria, all patients will be stratified into one three risk groups; low risk, intermediate risk, high risk. The low risk group will be observed (no radiation) per standard of care (SOC). The intermediate group (intermediate pathological features and negative ctDNA) will also be observed (no radiation) per the experimental arm. The high risk group will receive adjuvant treatment (RT +/- chemotherapy) per SOC.\n\n\nStudy Design Assessment Schedule\n-----------------\n| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |\n| --- | --- |\n| Experimental: Experimental Observation<br>Requires the following criteria: Pathological T1-3 N1-2 with negative surgical margins Absent or microscopic extracapsular extension(ECE) (\u22641mm) ctDNA positive pre-operatively and negative post-operatively This group will undergo observation on the experimental arm of the study. They will be monitored for toxicity, Quality of Life (QoL) and outcomes evaluation. Suspected locoregional recurrence (LRR) based on physical examination, imaging or increasing ctDNA will undergo completion of workup at the discretion of the University of Maryland Head and Neck tumor board.

There is a need to better quantify this symptom burden and explore effective interventions to optimize patients\u2019 medical and psychosocial management. As technology evolves, the opportunities for digital technologies to play a role in symptom management are becoming increasingly apparent. The feasibility and potential efficacy of a digital health intervention to augment symptom and symptom-related management in individuals with multiple myeloma is not known and will require a dedicated prospective investigation. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of such an intervention and to preliminarily explore its impact on patients' symptom burden, health self-efficacy and overall well-being. This is a prospective study of individuals with multiple myeloma to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of digital health coaching and its potential to augment existing standards of care for patient support. Patients will be enrolled and will complete all assessments at baseline, 30, 60 and 90 days after consent. A digital health coaching intervention will be provided to all patients.

        "summary": "In intensive care unit, dyspnea, the distressing and fearful awareness of breathing, is frequent and harmful. To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

        "summary": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the commonest nerve compression syndrome in the upper limbs, and carpal tunnel decompression is one of the most prevalent upper limb surgical interventions. Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients.

        "summary": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between normal aging and early dementia, characterized by memory deficits without functional impairment. Cognitive decline prevalence is increasing in older adults, impacting independence and quality of life. Motor dysfunctions, often overlooked in MCI, contribute to these limitations. Action Observation Therapy (AOT), a rehabilitation approach involving observing and imitating motor gestures, promotes brain plasticity through the mirror neuron system. While AOT has shown effectiveness in various populations, its application in MCI is understudied. This study aims to investigate the effects of AOT on cognition, upper and lower limb function, daily activities, gait, and balance in MCI patients. It also compares outcomes when patients observe therapists or MCI individuals with similar characteristics. Primary objectives include comparing AOT efficacy between these groups and a control group. Secondary objectives focus on upper limb functionality, daily activities, balance, cognition, and gait.",
        "model_output": "Background\nThe term MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) refers to the transitional state between normal cognitive changes associated with aging and very early dementia. It is a disorder characterized by impairments in both short-term and long-term memory, but without functional deficits. MCI is considered a precursor to dementia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that in 2014 there were 5.0 million adults with cognitive impairment (CI) in the population aged 65 years and older, and it is projected that by 2060, this number will increase to nearly 14 million . A study by G\u00f3mez on sentinel health networks in Spain describes a prevalence of MCI among individuals aged 65 years and older ranging from 14.5% to 17.6% , which increases with age. Another study reports a prevalence of 11.6% in individuals aged 65 to 69 years, which rises to an average of 22.9% among those aged 85 years and older. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 9 Spanish studies on different types of dementia showed a prevalence ranging from 3.2% to 12.3% in individuals aged 70 years and older, with higher prevalence in women and increasing with age.\n The diagnosis of MCI can increase the likelihood of individuals requiring admission to specialized care centers. Gait and balance impairments are common in individuals with dementia, including slower gait speeds, decreased stride length, altered swing time, among others. However, these motor alterations are often overlooked when addressing CI . Balance impairment combined with gait deficits significantly increases the risk of falls, with approximately 60% of individuals with CI experiencing falls annually, twice as frequently as cognitively intact counterparts . Individuals with CI are also more prone to falls resulting in injuries, with up to a three-fold increase in the incidence of hip fractures compared to those without CI. Recognizing and addressing this connection between cognitive and motor deficits is crucial . A systematic review from 2018 concluded that combining physical training with cognitive training in a functional context can help mitigate some aspects of CI. Therefore, the evidence supports that cognitive intervention should be concurrent with physical exercises rather than separate . Action Observation Therapy (AOT) involves observing a motor gesture performed by another individual and then imitating the same movement. This technique has been developed as a physical rehabilitation approach that promotes brain plasticity by activating the mirror neuron system . Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of action observation learning. A study conducted with children with cerebral palsy, presented by Naura et al. , showed that motor learning through observation is more effective and provides more evident benefits when subjects learn from other patients with the same condition but less severity, compared to learning from a therapist or another person without motor impairment. However, these results have not been corroborated in older patients or those with CI. The current literature includes various studies consistently demonstrating that AOT is an effective way to learn or improve specific motor skills. Buccino's work summarizes several studies that have employed AOT, including one in which the intervention was carried out with healthy individuals to imitate a motor action in a new environment for them. Another study showed that AOT facilitates motor learning and the construction of a motor memory trace in adults and in patients who have had a stroke. In another study, it was demonstrated that, in healthy adults, AOT is superior to motor imagery as a strategy for learning a complex motor task, at least in the early phase of motor learning. Buccino concludes that these results can have significant implications in educational activities, sports training, and neurorehabilitation. Specifically in the field of pathology, evidence exists regarding the application of AOT for upper limb rehabilitation in patients who have had a stroke. A pilot study by Yu-Wei Hsieh concluded that AOT resulted in improvements in most outcomes, suggesting it as a promising alternative to contemporary bilateral arm training interventions (i.e., active control intervention) for subacute stroke patients . In a randomized controlled pilot study by Mancuso et al., it was proposed that AOT is a promising treatment for functional recovery and upper limb function in individuals with moderate to severe upper limb impairment following a stroke. AOT could become a useful strategy in stroke rehabilitation programs, as it improves functionality of the paretic upper limb and allows for regaining maximum independence in ADL . Evidence also exists for AOT in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, spec",

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine",

The investigators' hypothesis is that the time in seconds it takes to complete a central venous line placement with ultrasonographic guidance using an ultraportable ultrasound device (SONOSite\u2122 Xporte) will be significantly reduced compared to conventional ultrasound. The investigators' hypothesis is that the incidence of first-line central venous line placement failures, as defined as the need to attempt another placement, will be significantly reduced when using an ultraportable ultrasound device (SONOSite\u2122 Xporte) compared to conventional ultrasound.

Treatments will be scheduled once per week. Component-based training includes graded and structured practice of three components of somatosensation (i.e., tactile object recognition, texture discrimination and proprioception), including finger recognition tasks, hand recognition tasks and proprioceptive tracking tasks. Component-based practice will be complemented by occupation-based practice tasks (i.e., self-chosen activities of daily living) to enhance transfer to a functional context.

        "summary": "Sepsis, characterized by severe organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated immune response to infection, is often life-threatening in clinical settings. Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.

NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

It is proposed to structure the teaching of clinical medicine in the emergency department of the Brest University Hospital through a multi-professional and interdisciplinary team. This emergency situation clinical teaching method will be structured around an Emergency Care OSCE planned at the end of the internship. An emergency structured clinical examination (ECOS) is a clinical teaching and evaluation method based on a practical case. The emergency structured clinical examination is the cornerstone of the acquisition of the basic clinical skills of junior clinicians. It is a tool based on clinical situations of various complexity which are confronted with a simulator in order to structure, evaluate and document the clinical skills of the various actors in the emergencies. Its aim is to ensure that patients receive the same standard of care and are treated in the best conditions, whatever the period of the day and the place of consultation may be. It provides a framework in which junior clinicians can learn and assess their clinical skills in real time in a standardized and safe situation.The development of clinical skills requires the implementation of clinical cases as part of the daily emergency department activity.

The patient physical and psychological sufferings in ALS are immense, and apart from Riluzole, there is no effective treatment. Care of advanced ALS have an estimated cost of 4-8 million NOK per year. Perhaps the most challenging topic of ALS care is the decision to extend ventilation support into the stages of disease that require treatment both during day and night. In these cases, treatment is clearly life-sustaining and although quality of life may be maintained, the burden of caregiving imposed upon family or health care workers is huge, regardless of tracheostomy (TIV) or non-invasive (NIV) modality.\nThe present study is a longitudinal questionnaire study in Norway measuring overall quality of life, health-related quality of life, and disease-specific quality of life in ALS patients, partners and children before and after the introduction of life sustaining ventilation support. The investigators aim to increase the knowledge on how life-sustaining ventilation support with NIV or TIV affects the quality of life in ALS patients, life partners and children.

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",
        "model_output": "Neurologic deficits in acute and peri-acute chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) occur in many patients and the timing and severity of recovery of these deficits has been poorly understood. cSDH is a collection of blood accumulating between the brain surface and the tough dura mater outer coat of the brain. The dura mater and the underlying brain do not expand as the subdural hematoma enlarges and as the associated mass effect develops. To alleviate the associated increased intracranial pressure and to prevent seizures, surgery is indicated once a certain size of hematoma is reached. The surgical evacuation cures the symptoms related to the mass effect of the hematoma; however, many patients experience cognitive deficits related to the brain itself. It has been proposed that the subdural hematoma promotes the release and spread of cytotoxic excitatory neurotransmitters (such as potassium and glutamate) which triggers neuronal injury/death. This can be observed using Electroencephalography (EEG) as spreading depolarization (SD) waves. SD waves correlate with spreading cortical dysfunction that is associated with the impairments in cognitive function. SD waves have been detected in acute and peri-acute traumatic brain injury but have not been assessed in chronic subdural hematoma specifically.  \nThe primary hypotheses is that 40% of patients will experience SD events that will correlate with a decline in Markwalder or Glasgow Outcome Scores within 72 hours after surgical evacuation of cSDH and that the presence of SD waves predicts a more significant decline in MMSE, MoCA and SDMT. A better knowledge of the neurological recovery in cSDH has implications for the timing and selection of patients for rehabilitation post acute subdural hematoma evacuation.",

Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials on the inflammatory component of the disease, reducing the annualized relapse rate by 46% and the rate of new T2 lesions by 80% compared with interferon-\u03b2 1a.\nThe use of anti-CD20 agents, including ocrelizumab, is associated with an infectious risk that increases with duration of exposure, part of which is due to the development of hypo-gammaglobulinemia in relation to cumulative dose.\nSeveral reports suggest a persistent effect of anti-CD20 drugs in MS, with no resumption of inflammatory activity after discontinuation:\nDuring the development of ocrelizumab, at the end of phase 2, after having received 3 or 4 semi-annual cycles of ocrelizumab, a safety period with a therapeutic window of 18 months was planned, before re-administration in the extension study. During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

        "summary": "Mortality following elective colorectal cancer surgery range between 2.5-6% and increase for the elderly and frail patient regardless of T-stage. Around 80% of the patients who present with a colon cancer and is in a condition where surgery is possible will be offered resection of the tumor. A part of the colon is always removed together with the lymph nodes in order to ensure that cancer cells are not left behind. The risk of lymph node metastasis is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. The overall risk of lymph node metastases is less than 20 % in patients with early colon cancer. This indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer have no benefit of additional resection besides local tumor excision. The alternative to resecting a larger part of the bowel is to make more focused surgery only resecting a small part of the bowel part through a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. This new organ sparing approach is called Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS). The investigators aimed to examinate the hypothesis that organ preserving approach (CELS) provides superior quality of recovery in elderly frail patients with small colon cancers when compared with standard surgery in RCT.",

Although many older patients can cope with surgery and achieve complete cancer eradication, 30 % of elderly patients do not. In these patients oncological outcomes are often impaired and the patient experiences a long-lasting recovery from surgery. In order to improve postoperative outcomes and patients experiences we have designed a new surgical approach, where we combine the advantage of minimally invasive surgery with an organ sparing principle. The combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection makes it possible to remove 82% of the tumour with an intact colon while the surgeon is spared the dissection of the superior mesenteric vessels. Compared to standard resection, this procedure reduces the extent of the surgical resection, minimizes the trauma in the body, and thereby reduces the risk of postoperative complications. CELS will be tested in an elderly colo-rectal cancer population, comparing CELS with standard resection. Primary objective is to evaluate the patient-reported outcome postoperatively 3 months after the randomized surgical intervention. Secondary objectives are patient reported outcome up to 30 days postoperatively, assessment of health related quality of life and assessments of long-term oncological outcomes, hospital readmissions, rate of secondary surgery, length of hospital stay, 30-day mortality, duration of surgery, blood loss and rate of complete resection margin.\n\n\nStudy Investigators and Keywords\n=================\nDorte Lund Sorensen, MD, PhD, Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Rakhi Kundra, MBBS, Ph.D., Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Steen Husted, MD, Ph.D., Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Bo St\u00e6rfeldt, MD, Ph.D., Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Peter Garmo, MD, PhD, Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Aage Sorensen, MD, Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Henning E.

        "summary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",

Patients in Group 2 (PDT) will receive PDT with conventional ET with the use of diode laser at 660 nm, fluence of 1W for 10 s, with an optical fiber coupled to the equipment that will remain in the apical third of the canal for 10 seconds for photo-sensitisation. Patients in Group 3 (PDAT) will receive photo-activated disinfection (PDAT) using the same setting as for PDT but for 20 seconds. The irrigation protocol and the medicaments used will be the same for all the groups.

Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.\nThe research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.\nThe study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care. Contributed by the sociostructural elements and necessities, black market amphetamine and ketamine have not only emerged in the regime for decades, but also have become a lucrative business. Their recreational uses are also sometimes accompanied by real necessities and needs; black markets cater to the needs but guidance on the usages is based on word-of-mouth stories without professional medical assistances. There is one case the Principal Investigator (PI) collected, that one person, possibly under depression contributed by PTSD, took relatively high dosage of amphetamine and went into a state of psychosis with overwhelming persecution mania. The study protocol, Psychiatric Orders in Psychoanalytic Treatment of ASD, is therefore designed for an evidence-based approach in treating complex psychiatric disorders with psychoanalytic guidance.",

She showed multiple symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia (PDA), and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Her symptoms include: i) Fear of public areas; ii) Tachycardia, panic attacks, and dizziness; iii) Fear of public speaking; iv) Excessive worrying, and crying. In the context of anxiety-driven behaviors, it is interesting to note the participant\u2019s recent experience of a traumatic event: On the 20th of February 2023, around 1:15 AM, two individuals attempted to break into her home. The traumatic experience, combined with a suspected case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), is a factor that would likely lead to a worsening of her condition. The participant has been referred to specialized anxiety treatment. No medications have been prescribed for the time being. Treatment: The participant was referred for both short-term (3-months) and long-term (1 year) treatment. She is currently undergoing a 15-session weekly treatment using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmaceutical treatment using SSRI and SNRI. The participant undergoes psychoanalytic assessment, psychiatric testings, and medical assessment. Psychiatric Testing: Differentiated evaluation according to DSM-5 criteria. The participant is tested using DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria, the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV ADIS-IV, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ADIS-IV, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview MINI, and the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-16). Medical Assessment: The participant had a routine ECG test and was referred for laboratory blood analysis with clinical chemistry profile. Lab blood analysis included blood samples with blood counts, coagulation measures, and liver function. Mild hypercholesterolemia was found at 7.4 mmol/L (normal range: 3-7.8 mmol/L), and the participant was referred for cardiovascular screening and examination. Medication: The participant was offered a combination of SNRI duloxetine 20 mg/night in Jan. 2023, and 50 mg/d in Mar. 2023. The dosage was adjusted based on her personal reactions (mood change, side-effects, and physical/mental stamina) to the medication. An SSRI dosage of 50 mg/d in Aug. 2023 was chosen instead of increasing the dosage of duloxetine. The participant was also using 12 tablets of SSRI (Lupin Sertraline",

Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

        "summary": "Background: Following acute brain injury (ABI), patients are monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) where providers rely on frequent neurological examinations (neurochecks) to assess for neurodeterioration. Serial neurochecks are part of guideline recommendations, but there is equipoise between hourly (Q1) and every-other-hour (Q2) evaluation. In the ICU, care-related awakenings occur frequently, but it is unclear if differential neurocheck frequencies result in differential sleep, providing the scientific premise for this proposal.\nPopulation: Twenty-two patients (N=11 per group) who have undergone elective aneurysm coiling will be enrolled. On post-operative day (POD) 0, patients will be screened and approached for informed consent if they do not meet exclusion criteria, e.g., prior intracranial injury, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, mechanical ventilation. Patients with elective aneurysm coiling are being chosen because they require ICU level of care following their intracranial procedure, but do not have structural brain injury or ongoing sedation needs that might impact sleep measurements.\nMethods: Usual care: Patients are monitored every 15-30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-procedure, then Q1 or Q2 for up to 24 hours. If these patients remain stable, they are discharged home on post-operative day (POD) 1. Proposed Intervention: Enrolled patients will be randomized to Q1 or Q2 neurochecks following the institutionally required 6 hours of stable neurological and vascular checks. Once randomized, patients will undergo placement of electroencephalogram (EEG) with video, electrooculogram, and chin lead. The video EEG will be in place for at least 8 hours to include the overnight (10PM-6AM) time period. Following completion of the recording, the signals obtained will be reviewed by a blinded polysomnographic sleep technician for sleep characteristics including quantitative assessments of wakefulness, deep (N3) sleep, REM sleep, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation and arousals. On POD1, patients and their nurse will fill out the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire to rate subjective sleep quality.",
        "model_output": "Rationale: Neurocritical care patients are often awakened for neurological examinations after craniotomy for elective or emergent reasons. There are no data regarding the frequency of neurological examinations that would facilitate sleep. Objective: The objective is to compare the effect that varying frequency of neurological examinations has on both sleep in hospitalized neurocritical patients and patient recovery and neurological outcome. We hypothesize more frequent neurological examinations will increase sleep efficiency at the expense of time spent awake or time spent in a more profound sleep stage (e.g. deep sleep), thus, there will be less recovery in patients awakened more frequently. Methods: This will be a prospective, randomized study of consecutive patients enrolled at 9:00 pm on the first post-operative night and continued until discharge to the hospitalist service. Patients will be randomized to the group that is awakened for neurological examinations every hour or every other hour. An overnight sleep study (polysomnogram) will be performed on the same first night following surgery and again on the following 2-4 nights at the discretion of the clinical team. Polysomnograms will be scored using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) international scoring manual.\nResults: This study was presented and discussed at Society of Critical Care Medicine Critical Care Congress, February 16-19, 2019, San Diego, California. There were no published data presented in scientific journals at the time of this submission. Discussion: This is the first study to compare the effects of varying the frequency of neurological examinations on sleep quantity and quality in critically ill neuroscience patients after neurosurgery.

It is a well-known factor that indicates a poorer prognosis and outcome for patients who have undergone surgical removal of the cancer. In such cases, it is recommended to combine chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery.\nAs the number of cases of HNSCC related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) is increasing, treatment approaches have shifted towards using radiation therapy as the primary treatment method instead of surgery. This raises an important question about the significance of ENE observed through imaging tests (referred to as iENE) and its impact on the prognosis. Unfortunately, this question remains unanswered.\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study across multiple medical institutions. The investigators will gather data including scan results, histopathology reports, and data from patient charts from individuals who have been treated for head and neck cancer. The aim is to analyze and correlate the findings between the pathological evidence of ENE and the imaging results, while also assessing the prognostic value of iENE. Additionally, the investigators will explore the influence of HPV status on these factors.\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, the investigators hope to establish standardized criteria that can assist radiologists in accurately identifying ENE through imaging tests.

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",
        "model_output": "Background and Aims:\nDiabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is a common and severe complication of diabetes. Bedside blind bone biopsies (BBB) are a simple, safe, and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete DFU healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological BB. In addition, BBB can be performed in patients who have not yet received antimicrobial treatment and before definitive diagnosis of DFO. Our hypothesis is that BBB is non-inferior to conventional BB in DFO outcomes and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO. Aims: \nTo compare the clinical efficacy and safety of both procedures. To compare the microbiological culture results between the two procedures. Main and Secondary Outcomes: \nThe main objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of bedside blind bone biopsy, compared to conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological), on DFO remission without surgery at 1 year. The secondary objectives are to: (i) compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy (ii) compare microbiological culture results between groups (iii) compare the safety of both procedures. Methods: A single-centre open-labelled, randomized non-inferiority controlled trial comparing the clinical, microbiologic and safety outcomes of bedside blind bone biopsy and conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological). \nRandomisation, Blinding, and Implementation: \nRandomisation will be open-labelled, controlled, and non-inferiority, with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients with DFO will be asked to participate in the study and, if they accept, they will be registered. Registration includes the acquisition of informed consent, inclusion and exclusion criteria fulfillment, baseline evaluations, and randomization. Both patients and the clinician responsible for patient care cannot be blinded. The intervention will take place in the patient\u2019s room; therefore, patients will not be unaware of the intervention type. An external statistician will be responsible for data safety, as well as for the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of the data by the principle investigator. All researchers will remain blinded until all results are published. Ethical considerations will be considered throughout the study, especially during the design phase. In the event of a conflict of interest, no team member other than the first author will be involved in the article's publication. A copy of the data set will be provided if requested by journal. Statistical Analysis: \nThe sample size was determined to assess the non-inferiority of BBB over CCBB. Using the published results1, a one-side (superiority) test with a non-inferiority margin of 20%, power of 90% and type 1 error of 5% would include 152 participants (76 in each arm). This non-inferiority margin was determined based on the primary published trial in 20181 which reported a DFU remission rate without surgery at 1 year of 50.5% in the bedside blind bone biopsy group. We plan to enroll at least 350 patients. To account for losses due to withdrawals or loss to follow-up, we planned a minimum sample size of 350 patients. This target enrollment will give us a total of 1150 patients across two groups of which approximately 55% will be allocated to either BBB or conventional bone biopsy. For the analysis of the main outcome, we will use a one-sided 0.05 Fisher\u2019s exact test, with the non-inferior hypothesis being established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less than 20% with respect to the DFO remission rate without surgery. The secondary outcome is the need for surgery. The non-inferior hypothesis will be established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less than 20% with regard to the need for surgery. In both cases, the non-inferiority margin corresponds to the non-inferiority margin chosen for the main outcome. These non-inferiority hypotheses apply whether the study is considered as superiority or not; therefore, there are no superiors or non-inferiorities hypotheses. If the non-inferiority hypothesis is not met, the superiority hypothesis cannot be verified.

        "model_output": "\u03b2-TrCP2 is a novel protein that directly controls \u03b2-catenin, a key regulatory protein that mediates the Wnt signaling pathway. Mutations in Wnt genes and activating mutations in \u03b2-TrCP2 have been linked to several cancers, including colon cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer. In this study investigators will explore the potential role of inhibiting \u03b2-TrCP2 in human colon cancer. The study will be in the form of a randomized clinical trial comparing a \u03b2-TrCP2 inhibitor-RK2-001 to placebo in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The study is limited to subjects with mCRC, K-RAS tumor status and no active CNS metastases who are not candidates for curative therapy. Subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio, stratified by tumor KRAS status and number of prior fluoropyrimidine adjuvant treatments. The study will consist of the screening and baseline periods; the treatment period that is 56 days; and a follow-up safety assessment period. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of RK2-001 compared with placebo on duration of objective response (measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of RK2-001 compared with placebo on progression-free survival (according to RECIST Version 1.1) and overall survival in subjects with measurable disease.\n\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\n\u03b2-catenin overexpression plays a major role in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) disease. It is also well recognized that over-activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is tightly linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which is a characteristic feature of metastatic disease. Wnt signaling pathway is controlled by a multi-protein complex comprising \u03b2-catenin, APC, Axin and GSK3\u03b2. Tumor suppressor genes (e.g., APC) or mutations in GSK3\u03b2 tend to lead to over-activation of \u03b2-catenin and consequentially, to cancer formation. Thus, inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway would have tremendous potential in treating many cancers. Since \u03b2-catenin directly controls the Wnt signaling pathway, inhibiting \u03b2-catenin has become an attractive strategy to treat tumors mediated by the Wnt signaling pathway. In contrast to inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway, which often leads to compensatory changes in the cell to sustain \u03b2-catenin activity, inhibiting \u03b2-catenin directly eliminates any \u03b2-catenin activity and consequentially, the Wnt signaling pathway that needs constant \u03b2-catenin activity to sustain. Recently, we have reported that \u03b2-TrCP2 is a novel protein that regulates \u03b2-catenin activity via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Therefore, inhibiting \u03b2-TrCP2 will result in increasing \u03b2-catenin activity and consequentially, the Wnt signaling pathway. Over 20 different cancers have been reported to over-express \u03b2-TrCP2. Using \u03b2-TrCP2-deficient human colon cancer cell lines, we have shown that inhibiting \u03b2-TrCP2 prevents \u03b2-catenin degradation and inhibits Wnt signaling. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that inhibition of \u03b2-TrCP2 will block \u03b2-catenin degradation and increase Wnt signaling, leading to inhibition of tumor growth in patients with colon cancer. This hypothesis can be tested by investigating whether \u03b2-TrCP2 inhibition has an anti-tumor activity in patients with mCRC. The study investigators plan to conduct a randomized dose-finding study with a fixed dose (250 mg, twice daily) and then a randomized dose escalation study. In this study investigators will explore the potential role of inhibiting \u03b2-TrCP2 in human colon cancer. The study will be in the form of a randomized clinical trial comparing a \u03b2-TrCP2 inhibitor-RK2-001 to placebo in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

Approaching the different dimensions of PSR calls on a dozen essential components: workload, autonomy, social support, burnout, anxiety, efforts made, rewards, work addiction, investment, etc. a specific questionnaire which usually contains 20 to 30 questions, so that having an overall view of PSR using the current reference questionnaires (Karasek, Siegrist, etc.) represents a total of more than 300 questions. The response time is thus incompatible with current medical practice (passage in the waiting room before the occupational health medical examination) and leads to a majority of non-responses during anonymous questionnaires on the Internet. On the other hand, these validated questionnaires were carried out by different people and are very heterogeneous between them, including in their formulation, so that the respondents have the impression of disorganization and anarchy. There is therefore a need for short, quick and uniform questionnaires. EVAs offer the incredible advantage of meeting these criteria: speed, uniformity, precision.

In an attempt to attenuate the loss of hard and soft tissue after tooth loss, alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) immediately after complete tooth extraction could minimize the need for ancillary ridge augmentation or soft tissue grafting. Different techniques and barrier membranes has been proposed to achieve the sealing of extraction socket.\nAim:\nTo investigate the effect of different techniques and barrier membranes for the soft tissue contour and morphological change of alveolar ridge after ARP\nMethods:\nThe study was designed as a randomized controlled trial and recruited patients, who require ARP for the purpose of implant placement or prosthodontic rehabilitation. After the tooth extraction, patients were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: ridge preservation with a xenogeneic bone substitute and (a) spontaneous healing (control), (b) covered with a free palatal graft, (c) or covered with pedical palatal graft, (d) covered with a collagen membrane, (e) covered with a non-resorbable high-density polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks following tooth extraction and ARP, clinical profilometric and radiographic evaluations were performed to analyze the change of hard and soft tissue contour.

The \u03b2-glucan is identified as a main component of BLEX 404. Not only with therapeutic potential on several types of cancer, BLEX 404 has also shown the potential to improve hematopoiesis, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, and the cytotoxicity activity of immune cells in recent animal studies. Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity.

In patients with advanced lung cancer, brain metastases are a common source of pain, and they also reduce life expectancy. Currently, stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS) is the main therapeutic option for the treatment of brain metastases in patients with advanced lung cancer. However, not all patients respond to SRS and the disease is often recurrent. New strategies to treat patients with MBM and with brain metastases recurrence are required. The investigators propose Liraglutide, a glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) agonist that acts on the brain, can prevent the development of brain metastases in patients with lung cancer. Previous studies have shown the efficacy of this medication in reducing or preventing the risk of brain metastases. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that Liraglutide may act on the gut-brain axis with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses in the brain. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liraglutide and its effects on the gut-brain axis in patients with lung cancer with MBM or with brain metastases recurrence. The investigators believe that Liraglutide may act on the gut-brain axis, thus preventing or delaying the development of brain metastases.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPhase II, multicenter, controlled, clinical trial. Patients with advanced lung cancer and not eligible for stereotactic radiotherapy due to the multifocal and multicentric nature of brain metastases will benefit because all patients with lung cancer will be offered to be randomized to the study. The trial will include patients with advanced lung cancer, treated or without treatment with immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy, with brain metastasis or with brain metastasis recurrence. Imaging will be performed at enrollment. Patients who develop new brain metastases during the follow-up of the trial will also be evaluated. The primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients who develop new brain metastases during the follow-up of the study in the group of patients treated with Liraglutide compared with the group of untreated patients. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Trial subjects will be selected from all eligible patients at the Oncology and Radiotherapy Department of the Hospital de Santa Creu i Sant Pau-Institut de Recerca Sant Pau (IR-SP) and the Institut Catal\u00e0 d'Oncologia (ICO).

The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). In the case of rehabilitation of older patients post-COVID-19, we do not know what the course of recovery for these patients will be, and what treatment/approaches will deliver the best outcomes.\nPersons that are recovering from a COVID-19 infection, and admitted on a geriatric ward for early rehabilitation, or geriatric rehabilitation ward or facility, can be included in the study. They will receive routine, usual care; participation in this study will not affect their rehabilitation care. Routine care data will be collected from their electronic patient files at admission to geriatric rehabilitation, and at discharge. This also includes some data about their premorbid status. In addition, study participants will be called six weeks and six months after discharge from rehabilitation and asked some questions about their recovery. There is no risk association with participation in this study. Data will be anonymously collected in an online database.\nThe primary aim of this study is to get insight into the course of recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe. Mainly, we are interested in functioning in activities of daily living (ADL-functioning) such as toileting, bathing, dressing, etc., and in quality of life. The second aim of this study is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organization of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive. Therefore, we collect data on the types of care provided and the professionals involved. Moreover, we collect some patient characteristics such as year of birth, gender, date of admission and date of discharge; and data about complications such as delirium, pain, post-traumatic stress syndrome, hospital readmissions, and mortality. Our hypothesis is that most patients will show recovery during geriatric rehabilitation and in the six months after.

To estimate the degree of inflammation (the immune system response to injury) and its changes over time in severe TBI patients and the effect and timing of acetaminophen use on their inflammatory response in the first days after the injury.\n\n2. To assess the impact of acetaminophen use on the level of the protein called \u03b2-Trace Protein (\u03b2-Tp; a substance which indicates the severity of TBI in patients with a good initial outcome) in the first 72 hours after the injury.\n\n3.

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

        "model_output": "----------------- Dementia is an umbrella term associated with the decline of a person\u2019s ability to think, remember and perform daily functions. Studies show these symptoms are more prevalent in patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factor. In addition, patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those without cardiovascular disease. Many of these patients have mild cognitive decline, which can be prevented with cognitive stimulation therapy. Cognitive stimulation therapy is a 14-week program, developed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and proven to help older adults with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The purpose of the project is to recruit 2,000 patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to test whether dementia patients who have cognitive stimulation therapy will score higher on a cognitive assessment than those without therapy. The project will also test whether the acceptance rate of cognitive stimulation therapy is greater than 60% among healthcare-referrals. The results of the project will help patients with dementia and MCI receive improved and accessible healthcare services.\n\n\nExplanation of the methods and analyses (Protocol): -----------------\nBackground Dementia is an umbrella term associated with the decline of a person\u2019s ability to think, remember and perform daily functions (NIH 2019). Dementia is common in older adults. It is estimated 39 million people are living with some form of \u201cdementia\u201d worldwide. Dementia has become the costliest condition to treat\u2014with 1 trillion in worldwide costs (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics 2021). With aging populations the prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are projected to rise throughout the next century (World Health Organization 2020). These statistics reflect a serious public health problem. The NIH and several other U.S. agencies are engaged in finding new ways to treat dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Amyloid Treatment and Prevention Initiative; https://www.alzheimers.org/research/clinical-trials-and-treatments/clinical-trials-and-you/amyloid-treatment-and-prevention-initiative). Dementia is often a result of cardiovascular disease (Gilbertson et al 2012). It also often co-occurs with metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (Rajan, et al 2019). While many are aware of this link, what remains unexplained is why this association exists. One possible link to this association is the development of blood coagulation (Raz and Yassuda 2019). The end product of this cascade is the formation of a clot (Yassuda 2008). Clotting of blood in the brain leads to a condition known as a \u201cstroke.\u201d Cognitive Impairment is defined as a change in a person\u2019s ability to function normally in daily situations. These changes are categorized as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. There are many forms of dementia: Alzheimers disease (the most common), vascular dementia, or a combination (dementia with mixed-features). Dementia with mixed-features is the second most common type of dementia. It is common for individuals with dementia to have multiple types of dementia. MCI and dementia are common conditions among older adults (Al-Kandari, et al 2019). It is estimated 16% (Gitlin et al 2005) of individuals with MCI are likely to progress to Alzheimer\u2019s disease within 4 years. When MCI is associated with physical impairment due to cerebrovascular disease, the risk of progression to dementia increases four-fold (Jacobsen, et al 2005). Among individuals who received care for a dementia-related diagnosis in 2013, 16.1% died compared to 8.8% of the general U.S. population (Johnson et al 2017). The high prevalence and mortality rate of dementia are significant public health problems. Most public health interventions have a preventive focus. This includes the promotion of physical exercise, brain stimulation and/or cognitive training. Research shows that cognitive stimulation is beneficial for patients with MCI and mild dementia (Martin et al 2009, Livingston et al",

GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores.

It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10.

        "model_output": "Background: Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the most common intra-abdominal surgical emergencies. Despite this, there is a paucity of evidence to guide the management of these patients. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of non-operative management (NOM) of ASBO for children with favorable clinical characteristics. A trial of NOM allows time for an assessment of clinical improvement as non-operative measures are administered to correct the imbalance of ileus. When initiated at the right time, this is successful up to 80% of the time according to the recent literature. Previous literature on NOM has focused on general principles of management including non-operative resuscitation, pain control, decompression of distended loops on physical examination, gastric decompression, and a low-residue diet. More recently, studies have suggested a potential role for enteral contrast administration (ECA). ECA may have utility in identifying complete small bowel obstruction. In adult literature there is Level 1 evidence supporting the use of enteral contrast in patients presenting with adhesive small bowel obstruction. The authors of those publications recommend the use of an enteral water soluble contrast followed by post contrast imaging. There have been no studies published to date reviewing the use of an enteral contrast challenge specifically in children with ASBO. Although there is some evidence to support the use of contrast at the decision to operate (DTO), there is no Level 1 or 2 evidence to support the use of early contrast. The addition of contrast imaging may aid in the management of children with ASBO by assisting in the decision to perform surgery, particularly when an enteral challenge can be administered with minimal risk. Objective: To study the effect of the use of an enteral contrast challenge for the management of children with ASBO, on the incidence of surgical intervention, as well as complications from contrast exposure in children with ASBO. Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study across nine sites that enrolled patients from May 2020 through September 2022 .

Data were collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tool hosted at the University of Colorado. Patient groups were evaluated including those who received enteral contrast and those who did not. Comparisons were made between those who received contrast and those who did not. A subset analysis was performed among patients who received enteral contrast. Comparisons were made based on type of contrast agent used and final osmolality of contrast administered. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between contrast and need for operation adjusting for age, body mass index for age z-score (or weight for height z-score for patients under 24 months of age per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards), volume of contrast administered, and number of previous laparotomies (< 3 v. \u22653). A second subset analysis was performed based on whether a contrast challenge aided in the management of an ASBO when comparing children who underwent an enteral contrast challenge and required an operation with those who required an operation with no prior contrast challenge.\n\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nUse of a Water Soluble Contrast-Based Protocol to Assist in the Management of Pediatric Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nSmall Bowel Obstruction, Contrast Media Adverse Reaction\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Diagnostic Test: Enteral contrast challenge\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: children 1-20 years diagnosed with an adhesive small bowel obstruction by an attending pediatric surgeon and underwent a trial of nonoperative management (NOM) on hospital admission Exclusion Criteria: peritonitis suspicion of inccerated or internal hernia active intra-abdominal malignancy inflammatory bowel disease less than four weeks since the most recent abdominal operations pneumatosis pneumoperitoneum known contrast allergy\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nMinimum Age: 1 Year\nMaximum Age: 20 Years\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nAll\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n-----------------\nNo\n\nStudy Plan\n================",

        "model_output": "Background\n-----------------\n\nOverview\n\nCrohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which generally manifests in the second or third decade of life and can persist for a long period. In the Netherlands, there are currently 66,440 people with chronic intestinal disease, of which 9,014 people suffer from Crohn's disease. Patients with Crohn's disease frequently present with episodes of severe abdominal pain and disabling diarrhea with blood and mucus. Complications such as stricture formation, fistula formation, and abscesses can contribute to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. In addition, the disease places a financial burden on our health care system and its patients. Patients require long-term management and there is currently no cure. For most patients, treatment will begin with mesalamine and corticosteroid use is often necessary when symptoms progress. If symptoms persist, the use of immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate is suggested. For patients not improving sufficiently, biologics (e.g. anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab or ustekinumab) are used as a last resort. There is currently no cure and in some patients, the disease can persist for a long time and treatment will need to be adjusted regularly to ensure that symptoms remain under control.\n\nTNF\n\nTumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) plays an important role in the inflammatory process of Crohn's disease, as well as the formation of complications such as strictures or abscesses. Targeting TNF-\u03b1 can reduce the burden of disease through reduced inflammation, reduced stricture formation and reduced abscesses. The first biologics to target TNF-\u03b1 was infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to TNF-\u03b1 and prevents its interaction with the TNF-\u03b1 receptor. The efficacy of infliximab was studied in a number of studies, including a phase III trial by Sandborn et al (2007) where infliximab was shown to be superior to placebo. In this study, the treatment with infliximab resulted in significantly higher remission rates and significantly fewer episodes of abdominal pain, disabling diarrhea, and hospitalization. Other studies showed similar results (Hanauer et al (2003); Feagan et al (2005); Sands et al (2003)).\n\nIFX monotherapy, IFX and immunosuppressive therapy\n\nIn a number of studies, the efficacy and safety of infliximab was studied, focusing on different doses of infliximab and the use of additional immunosuppressants. In these studies, patients received either 10 mg/kg every 2 months or 5 mg/kg every 2 or 8 weeks. The treatment schedules studied also included a loading dose of 5 mg/kg at the start of treatment. The results suggest that a higher loading dose and higher maintenance doses achieved better results, with higher remission rates and better response to therapy. The efficacy and safety of infliximab in combination with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine was also studied. A systematic review by Schnitzler et al (2013) showed that the use of combination therapy was associated with a better response to treatment, as shown by higher remission rates, higher rates of clinical remission and a quicker time to remission. There was no evidence of increased side effects and toxic effects with the use of combination therapy.\n\nAim of the study and research questions\n\nAs there is currently uncertainty as to whether infliximab monotherapy is as effective as infliximab in combination with azathioprine in the induction therapy for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease, this study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab monotherapy with infliximab in combination with azathioprine during induction therapy. Additionally, the study aims to study the following:\n\n\u2022 The efficacy and safety of infliximab monotherapy\n\u2022 The efficacy and safety of infliximab in combination with azathioprine\n\u2022 To what extent concomitant treatment with azathioprine or methotrexate improves the efficacy and safety profile of infliximab\n\u2022 The relationship between HLA",

        "model_output": "Bronchiectasis are defined as irreversible dilatations of the bronchial tree. Patients suffer from chronic cough, sputum production and recurrent airways infections. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and specifically forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a common modality used to estimate lung disease progression and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on PFTs, reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. Although all individuals perform spirometry testing using the same maneuver, there is some possibility that this maneuver can induce bronchoconstriction in some of the patients with bronchiectasis which may be improved by bronchodilators administration or by performing the testing prior to administration bronchodilators. Despite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis, the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations. According to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society statement, the proper way to demonstrate BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most resent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered positive BDR. While many factors may influence BDR, some can influence the results of the spirometry evaluation alone or in combination with bronchodilators administration. Theoretically, in patients with bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry can potentially cause changes in lung function, for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in patients with bronchiectasis might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Secondary objectives will be to assess if BDR is associated with age, gender, specific bronchiectatic disease, baseline FEV1, and other clinical factors such as sputum cultures, IgE levels, eosinophil levels, computed tomography (CT) score, family history of asthma.",

        "model_output": "1. Introduction:\nChronic migraine (CM) is a common form of headache that affects an estimated 3.6 million people in the United States (US). This type of headache can be debilitating and, at times, causes patients to miss work and school. While some people are affected by CM infrequently throughout their lives, other people experience these headaches more often and are considered to be chronic migraineurs (CMs). CM affects both genders and has been shown to have a negative impact on patients\u2019 quality of life and overall well-being. The current medical treatment of CM involves acute and preventative treatment modalities. Preventative treatments include medications that are typically used to treat depression, seizures, and hypertension. As such, these drugs pose an increase risk of cardiovascular disease, sedation, and renal toxicity. In spite of these risks, acute and preventative drug treatment strategies are still considered to be the predominant methods used to treat CM. Unfortunately, as with any drug, the effects from acute and preventative drug treatments are highly patient specific. Therefore, some patients may respond positively to the drug, while other patients may not respond to the drug or have mild to moderate side effects. One particular area where significant advancements are still needed is the field of patient-specific treatments.\n3. Personal significance:\nOur research group has a long history of studying migraine headaches and chronic migraine. The group has used a variety of research methodologies including clinical studies and psychophysical pain testing. As a result of this history, one of our group\u2019s researchers (J.G.) has encountered patients with CM many times during his career. These encounters brought to his attention the high prevalence of migraine headaches, as well as their negative impact on patients\u2019 quality of life. Our research group has been invited to serve as part of a team at Emory University that is charged with developing and testing alternative treatments for patients with CM. This new role provided J.G. with the opportunity to expand his thinking and focus on the potential effects of hormonal treatments on pain perception.  This line of enquiry and associated research questions grew out of a long history of experience working at Emory University and seeing patients with different migraine headaches including CM. Although CM has been shown to affect patients differently, little is known about how gender identity impacts pain perception and the potential treatment outcomes for these patients. Therefore, the current proposal represents the first step towards exploring the possible relationship between gender identity, hormone status and pain sensitivity among patients with CM. This type of research is important because the information that we learn from these studies can influence both the prevention (prior to the onset of a headache) and treatment of CM.\n4. Research history:\nThe field of neuroscience has witnessed a rapid increase in its understanding of the central and peripheral nervous system. Advancements in pain research were a direct result of these technological advancements, and neuroscientists were among the first researchers to understand how these technologies could be used to further their studies. The scientific methods and technologies that have been used to study pain perception include non-invasive brain imaging, pharmacologic modulation, psychophysical testing, and behavioral assessment. Our group has used a variety of these methods including brain imaging and psychophysical testing to examine pain perception in patients with migraine headaches. One of our major research discoveries has been that patients with migraine headaches show deficits in pain tolerance compared to healthy participants. Furthermore, these deficits have not been shown to be related to differences in brain activity (as indicated by brain imaging). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that deficits in pain tolerance may be directly related to differences in endogenous pain modulation systems. To test this hypothesis, we examined differences in pain tolerance among 4 groups of patients: controls, non-painful CM, painful CM, and patients with migraine headaches. Our results showed that these patients exhibit different levels of endogenous pain modulation, which could explain their observed differences in pain tolerance. Furthermore, our results showed that the presence of a migraine headache alone can reduce pain tolerance among these patients.\n5. Scientific objectives:\nOur primary scientific objective will be to understand how gender identity, hormonal status and pain perception are related among patients with CM. This relationship has never been investigated, which is a major scientific shortcoming in the CM literature. In order to address these issues, we propose to use a variety of scientific methods and technologies including brain imaging and psychophysical pain testing. The information that we learn from these studies can be used to develop and test alternative treatments for patients with CM. Furthermore, our research proposal will provide our team of investigators with important information about the relationship between gender identity, hormonal status and pain perception among patients with CM",

The only palliative treatment for respiratory failure is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which compensates failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea, improves quality of life and increases life expectancy. In ALS patients, the persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy). This study evaluates the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort in ALS patients with persistent dyspnea treated with NIV.",
        "model_output": "------------------\nIntroduction\nWhen the respiratory failure of ALS approaches, the persistence of dyspnea is often perceived as one of the major determinants of suffering induced by this disease. The only treatment capable of improving respiratory distress, prolonging the survival of ALS patients and alleviating suffering is non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Numerous therapeutic approaches have been evaluated in the past in order to alleviate dyspnea independent of its treatment (vasopressors, corticosteroids, cannabinoids, antidepressants, intravenous lidocaine, but also thoracic paravertebral injection of a bupivacaine local anesthetic, transcranial electrical stimulation). It has been suggested that virtual reality (VR) applied to ALS patients treated by NIV could reduce the feeling of respiratory effort and allow breathing to sound less labored, thus relieving dyspnea 1). A randomized controlled study involving 80 ALS patients treated with NIV has shown that VR can reduce the feeling of respiratory effort (40% improvement) and dyspnea intensity (12% improvement), thus increasing the quality of life of patients by improving sleep and preventing the premature use of NIV . 1.\n\nConcepts about the pathophysiology of dyspnea in ALS 2).\n\nALS patients develop the symptoms of respiratory failure only when there is a loss of function of respiratory muscles with an imbalance of ventilation / perfusion. Dyspnea in these patients is mainly sensory in nature, corresponding to the perception of the afferent information from the respiratory receptors and the central nervous system and not to a cardiopulmonary deficit. This dyspnea is characterized by a predominance of the affective component (dyspnea is experienced as undue), which is not linked to any organic alteration, but rather to the difficulty that ALS patients have in maintaining their autonomy and in particular their self-respect. 2)\nApart from dyspnea, ALS patients often experience anxiety, which results in anticipatory anxiety and an inability to remain calm and at rest. 3).\nAlthough the sensory component of dyspnea is the main target of current therapeutic approaches, it should be noted that they are based on symptomatology and no mechanism of action has been identified. 4).\n\nCurrent therapeutic approaches are based on the use of bronchodilators (bronchodilators), sedatives (hypnotics such as benzodiazepines) and NIV, without addressing the emotional aspects. Currently, there is no standardized way to measure dyspnea. The Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire is widely used for the evaluation of dyspnea. It consists of 30 items, 12 of which are specific to respiratory dysfunction. Each question is marked on a numerical scale from 0 to 10. The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 300. MDP questionnaires were administered to 34 ALS patients treated with NIV. The average score of these patients was 166 . 5).\n\nProblems related to the measurement of dyspnea.\n\nMDP questionnaires are used by clinicians to determine the effectiveness of dyspnea treatments in clinical trials. However, the results are variable even when the symptoms appear to be the same. We believe that this is due to the emotional aspect of the disease, the lack of involvement of the patient in the choice of his care program, and the place where the measurement of dyspnea is performed and therefore the psychological context in which he finds himself. There are differences between the way dyspnea is perceived at home, where the patient is in a private environment, and during the medical consultation, where the patient feels the influence of the medical environment, the clinician and the presence of his entourage in an unfamiliar place , even if this visit is programmed and scheduled within the routine of his disease. Another aspect to consider is the impact of this measurement on the patient\u2019s psychological condition. The evaluation by questionnaire of the dyspnea felt may change the way it is perceived, thus further exacerbating the problem. Although MDP questionnaires are commonly used, they are criticized for a number of reasons. First of all, the use of an ordinal scale makes the data inconsistent. Secondly, the wording used to explain the scale is not always self-explanatory and clinicians often have to adapt to the patient\u2019s level of understanding. In this study, patients have the option of completing the questionnaire at home",

        "summary": "The control of antibiotic resistance requires a reduction in inappropriate prescriptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics (amoxillin-clavulanate (AMC), fluoroquinolones (FQ), third-generation cephalosporins (C3G)), particularly for urinary tract infections treated in primary care. Several studies have reported the positive impact of antibiotic susceptibility testing performed on urine cultures on the appropriate use of antibiotics.\nThe selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing , defined as the restriction of the list of antibiotics mentioned in the report according to the antibiotic resistance profile, would allow, according to observational studies, a reduction of 25 to 70% of the initial prescriptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics and a 20% rate of antibiotic de-escalation (=reduction of the antibacterial spectrum of an antibiotic treatment after re-evaluation).\nThe objective is to assess the impact of disseminating a selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing on the dispensing of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) for E. coli positive urine cultures in adult women, compared to the dissemination of a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing.",
        "model_output": "2020 marks the tenth anniversary of the WHO 'antibiotic resistance' action plan. Although this plan was quickly adopted by several countries, the rate of antibiotic prescriptions has generally continued to rise in parallel to the emergence of bacterial resistance. In particular, there is a lack of evidence regarding interventions that may support GPs in better targeting their antibacterial prescriptions. In primary care, antibiotic prescriptions often rely on urine culture results. Due to the time it takes a laboratory to analyze these cultures and return their results to GPs, many patients receive treatment based on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Loire Atlantique and Maine et Loire districts (France), with a primary care cohort of women presenting with a Escherichia coli urinary tract infection (UTI). Each patient will be attributed to either the intervention arm, receiving a targeted antibiotic susceptibility testing result, or to the control arm, receiving a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing result. Outcomes of interest are broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing in the same primary care practice and rate of de-escalation (=a shift from broad-spectrum to narrower-spectrum antibiotic therapy). The investigators hypothesize that targeted antibiotic susceptibility testing will reduce the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing and that these reductions will be sustained after one year.\n\n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Observational Study\nObservational Study Model:: Cohort\nTime Perspective:: Prospective\nTarget Number of Participant:: 600\nCohort/Group Number:: 2\nCohort/Group Description:: The cohort contains 2 groups of 300 (300 patients in the intervention arm and 300 patients in the control arm)\nCohort/Group Label:: experimental group (intervention arm)\nCohort/Group Label:: control group (control arm)\nBiospecimen Collection & Archiving:: Not collect nor archive\nBiospecimen Description:: \n\n\nInclusion Criteria\n=================\nStudy Population Description:: Women\nSampling Method:: Patients who have a positive urine culture and a urine culture is associated with a prescription of antibiotics and an antibiotic susceptibility testing are eligible for the study\nSex:: Female\n\n\nExclusion Criteria\n=================\nPatients who have reimbursements for antibiotics prescribed by different healthcare providers in the 14 days before antibiotic susceptibility testing\n\n\nTarget Number of Participant: 600\nCohort/Group Label:: women\nCohort/Group Description:: Women with at least one E.coli positive urine culture and associated with an antibiotic susceptibility testing result and antibiotic prescription\nCohort/Group Label:: controls\n\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\nHow is the study designed?\n-----------------\n\nDesign Details\n\nPrimary Purpose: Other\nAllocation: Randomized\nIntervention Model: Parallel Assignment\nMasking: Double\n\n\nArms and Interventions\n\n| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |\n| --- | --- |\n| Experimental: intervention group<br>This arm includes women who receive a targeted antibiotic susceptibility testing result | Other: Dissemination of a selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing<br>* For each E. coli positive urine culture analyzed by LabOuest, GPs will receive an antibiotic susceptibility testing report, with the list of antibiotics restricted according to four E. coli susceptibility profiles, with an emphasis on narrower-spectrum antibiotics.

        "summary": "The purpose for this research is to create a MyChart-enabled virtual coach that assists obese patients lose weight prior to ventral hernia surgery. Researchers intend to show how the use of a virtual coach is more effective in preoperative weight reduction prior to ventral hernia repair over usual care. Correspondingly, this may lower unplanned hospital readmissions. For this clinical trial, where randomization is not possible, the study team will implement the use of propensity score matching that sorts individuals into different study arms as if randomly assigned. The primary outcome is the average net amount of time-dependent weight change per group over six months. Secondary outcomes are for the intervention group, patient satisfaction with the virtual coach and for both groups, quality of life. In addition, areas of social and economic disadvantage will be identified that may contribute to higher obesity rates. Machine learning (ML) modeling will be used to determine the important features for weight lost over the course of the study. The impact of this work will be to demonstrate efficacy and realized workflow efficiencies within a hospital-based surgery clinic.",
        "model_output": "Background: Ventral hernias (VH), defined as bulges in the abdominal wall, occur in 1 in 200 individuals. VH present a lifetime risk to the patient, resulting in morbidity, mortality, and quality of life decrease. VH are exacerbated when a patient is obese based on the individual\u2019s BMI. Weight reduction has shown to reduce the rate of re-herniation in patients undergoing elective ventral hernia repair. However, only 0.1-5% of the patients lose weight successfully prior to their scheduled VHR. Previous methods used to help with weight loss have not been successful. Studies suggest that the use of behavioral coaching may significantly enhance an individual\u2019s ability to successfully lose weight when compared to self-motivation alone. New technologies like virtual weight loss coaches have the potential to offer a cost-effective, scalable intervention for obese VHR patients to lose weight. The success of a virtual weight loss coach also heavily depends on the amount of interaction or engagement a patient has with the coach, as a lack of engagement results in greater than 80% of weight loss programs to fail. \n\nGiven this lack of success with the current interventions for weight loss in obese hernia patients, we propose using the MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach, and to test whether the virtual coach will increase overall weight loss as compared to the standard weight loss program (standard preoperative weight loss tools) or other intervention methods. In addition, given the lack of studies measuring whether patient engagement with the virtual coach translates to increased weight loss, we propose a secondary analysis to determine if a virtual weight loss coach increases the degree of patient engagement, as we hypothesize that this will lead to more weight loss in our subjects. \n\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nDoes a Virtual Coach Offer a Better Solution for Weight Reduction in Ventral Hernia Patients With Obesity?\n\nDescription\n-----------------\nHypothesis: The MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach will lead to the most weight loss in patients undergoing elective ventral hernia repair compared to patients using current standard preoperative tools or other weight loss programs. The overall purpose for this study is to determine if the MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach increases the total amount of weight loss when compared to standard preoperative tools. In addition to looking at the degree of weight loss, we hypothesize that the most successful intervention will also result in higher levels of patient satisfaction and will lead to more patient engagement when compared to a less successful intervention. Subjects will be recruited from the in-office and hospital-based clinics at UT Southwestern Medical Center and will be recruited by all members of The Division of Plastic Surgery and The Division of General Surgery. Subjects who fit each inclusion criterion will have the option to enroll in the study, which is a randomized trial. A total of 160 subjects will be needed to ensure adequate statistical power to measure any differences in the weight lost within each group and between each of the three study groups. Randomized enrollment will occur across three different groups, each with 53 subjects. We will record patient information such as demographics, BMI, and type of hernia repair. We will perform measurements on patients both preoperatively and 6 months post-op. Study enrollment will occur on the last scheduled pre-op visit, which will typically be 1-2 months prior to surgery. Participants will attend a total of four study visits, 2 of which will be virtual visits (pre-op and post-op), the other two will occur in-person with the research team. During the first two encounters, we will gather baseline information, patient demographics, and BMI of each subject. We will then give each subject a study code that will remain anonymous throughout participation in the study, as well as a phone number that will be directly in contact with the participant\u2019s assigned coach for the duration of the study. We will explain to each subject their respective methods of weight loss and guide them accordingly for the remainder of the study. The subject will be given the virtual coach number, login information, and directions on how to use the Mychart enabled virtual coach. Subjects assigned to the Standard group will be given a reference list for the most common obesity-related diet and exercise plans and a paper calendar where they will track their weight progress and diet/exercise plan compliance. Subjects will also have the opportunity to use their own pre-op weight loss program. \n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nDoes a Virtual Coach Offer a Better Solution for Weight Reduction in Ventral Hernia Patients With Obesity?\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nObesity, Ventral Hernia\n\nParticipation",

Participants will be allocated to receive either nebulized MSC-secreted extracellular vesicles twice a day (BID) for 5 days as the test group or nebulized saline solution twice a day for 5 days as the control group. Researchers will compare the test and control groups to evaluate the safety and efficacy of extracellular vesicles in combination with standard therapy.",
        "model_output": "1. Research Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (nebulized) combined with conventional therapy for the treatment of moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 patients through a multicenter, randomized controlled, single-blind clinical trial. Our main goals revolve around developing a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that can be widely utilized to efficiently ameliorate the clinical symptoms of patients with moderate pulmonary and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and mitigating the clinical symptoms of patients with critical pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2. Research Design: (1) The study adopts a multicenter, randomized controlled, single-blind trial design. (2) A total of approximately 101 participants will be enrolled in the trial. (3) The control group will receive nebulized saline solution twice a day (BID) for 5 days, while the experimental group will receive 5ml of nebulized umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles twice a day (BID) for 5 days. (4) The safety and effectiveness of the treatment plan will be evaluated by comparing the differences in symptom remission time, improvement of serum inflammatory markers, changes in lung lesions on CT as well as be hospitalized time and nucleic acid turn time of two groups during and after treatment. 3. Innovation of the trial: This is the first multicenter randomized controlled single-blind trial with clinical efficacy evaluation through pathogenesis studies on the application of stem cell-derived exosomes for coronavirus disease 2019 treatment. The outcome of this study can provide clinically valuable data for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in the future and also provide a methodological reference for the future conduct of multicenter and large-sample studies on stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of various diseases. A systematic approach for standardizing manufacturing processes has also been established, and the obtained extracellular vesicles will be stored for future basic studies (such as disease pathogenesis, immunotargeted drug delivery, and toxicity studies). 4. Outstanding characteristics of the trial: (1) Compared with other clinical applications of stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of various diseases, this trial provides a more systematic approach to the development and research of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, which can promote the development of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle production technology and provide support for the production of new drugs for clinical treatment. (2) Compared with other clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, by selecting patients with moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 infection, the results of this trial are more directly applicable and can provide direct evidence that stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles can effectively reduce lung injuries and improve patient outcomes. 5. Risk and side effects evaluation: (1) According to the literature review on the efficacy and side effects of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of COVID-19 infection and the known side effects of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes, we conclude that the adverse reactions of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of COVID-19 infection remain unclear, and there are no reported cases of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes to treat patients with COVID-19 infection. (2) During the study period, participants will be closely monitored and their vital signs, lung function, laboratory tests, and adverse events will be investigated to ensure their safety during the study period. (3) The specific details of the trial monitoring and risk management will be formulated as part of the trial, and the investigators will also conduct regular safety and tolerability assessments of the trial. In the event of any adverse events that occur during the study period, the investigators will promptly provide appropriate medical care to the participants and report the event to the Drug Safety Committee and the Drug Administration Committee in time. 6.
