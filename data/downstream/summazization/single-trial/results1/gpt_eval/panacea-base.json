        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",
        "model_output": "1. Nociplastic pain (NP) is a form of pain that is often associated with a variety of physical and psychological symptoms. 2. Patients with chronic migraine (CM), fibromyalgia (FM), and vulvodynia (VU) tend to present with common psychosocial features, such as central sensitization, trauma history, personality traits and defensive styles. These features are often associated with poorer management of pain and worse prognosis. 3. The researchers hypothesize that CM, FM, and VU may be grouped by a number of specific psychosocial factors that could be useful in providing a better understanding of the symptoms associated with NP, and consequently could be useful in implementing more effective interventions. 4. For this purpose, the researchers propose to develop a study that will assess the presence of specific psycho-social clusters in patients with CM, FM, and VU, and will try to identify the most suitable intervention strategies.This will make it possible to define the characteristics of each cluster, to develop specific tailored interventions, and to use them as a therapeutic strategy.\nPatient population: Patients with CM, FM, or VU participating as clinical sample. Control group (no chronic pain condition): 2nd year psychology students (not selected) or people from the general population with no medical history. No previous diagnosis of chronic pain conditions. Inclusion criteria: age range 18-65 years education > 5 years diagnosis of FM according to Wolfe, 2016 diagnosis of CM according to Olesen, 2017 diagnosis of VU according to Bornstein et al., 2016 Exclusion criteria severe psychiatric disorders and/or cognitive impairment difficulties in comprehension/expression in Italian history of other chronic pain disorder(s) history of other neurological disorders besides migraine\n\n\nPrimary study hypothesis\n=================\nDefine the most common psychological clusters in patients with pain of nocurplastic origin.\n\nStudy design\n=================\nA descriptive, multi-center, open, uncontrolled study will be conducted on 150 patients with FM or CM or VU, compared to 50 controls (without previous diagnosis with chronic pain conditions) will be conducted.\n\nStudy objectives\n=================\n1.

These will be assessed through online questionnaires. A questionnaire will then be administered to collect epidemiological data (e.g., age, education level, previous diagnosis of chronic pain).\nTo identify the presence of the main psychosocial clusters, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire. A total of eleven psychosocial variables will be taken into account; the following are: (1) central sensitivity index; (2) traumatic experiences index; (3) personality traits; (4) defense mechanisms; (5) mental pain; (6) environmental sensitivity; (7) environmental hypersensitivity; (8) sensitivity to social rejection; (9) physical pain; (10) sexual pain; (11) depression; (12) anxiety; (13) psychosomatic symptoms; (14) health perception; (15) quality of life; (16) alexithymia; (17) perceived social support; (18) pain-related sexual disorder; (19) pain-related sexual dysfunction; (20) sexual satisfaction.  Finally, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate the level of satisfaction with the treatment received for pain. The investigators expect that the results of this study will be of great interest to the scientific community. They will help to develop more effective interventions for patients with chronic pain conditions. Additionally, they can help to identify the most appropriate treatment for each patient.\nThe investigators also hope that this study will help to improve the quality of life of patients with chronic pain conditions.\n\nStudy population\n=================\n150 women with chronic pain conditions (FM, CM or VU) and 50 women with no previous diagnosis of chronic pain conditions",

        "summary": "Aim: This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of two types of mattresses with different support surfaces used in bedridden patients.\nMethod: The sample of this quasi-experimental study consisted of 60 patients according to the inclusion criteria. A group I and group II of 30 patients each were formed from the sampled patients. For the patients in group I, a bed with a cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was used. For the patients in group II, a viscoelastic mattress was used. The data of the study were collected with the ''Patient Identification Form'', ''Braden Scale'', ''Pressure Wound Observation Form'' and ''Wound Measurement Chart''. Number-percentage distributions, Chi-square, Fisher's Exact Probability Test and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to evaluate the data.\nImplications for Clinical Practice: It was determined that the support surface used affected the pressure sore size and the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature created smaller sized wounds in the sacrum, trochanter, malleolus and heel regions. In the sacrum, scapula, and heel regions, although not statistically significant in terms of wound stage and the number of patients who developed pressure sores, it was seen that the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was more effective.",
        "model_output": "Patient education and awareness about the use of these mattresses is important and has been published by the manufacturer. Patient education and awareness programs may also help with a gradual shift from the traditional use of low air-loss beds to the use of massage beds. This, in turn, will reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in nursing homes. Patient education about this may include providing information about pressure sores, their risk factors, and their prevention, as well as the importance of using a pressure sore prevention device.\n\nInput Text: Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Studies in Healthy Subjects of BI 412 (Humanized Anti-IL17a Monoclonal Antibody)\n\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nBrief Summary\n-----------------\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and the potential for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) associated with chronic oral 412 (dose range: 2 to 900 mg) administration for 12 months in healthy, non-smoking male and female subjects from the United States and elsewhere. This was a Phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study with 9 cohorts. Subjects received 2 to 900 mg of study drug daily for up to 12 months in capsular formulation and were randomly allocated in 9 cohorts: 6 cohorts with ascending doses (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 900 mg; N=60 across all cohorts), and 3 cohorts at a dose level of 6, 30, and 900 mg (N=30 across all cohorts) based on PK and PD analyses from earlier cohorts. The first 6 subjects recruited in the initial cohort were selected to enable evaluation of safety, tolerability, PK, and PD in this pilot cohort. The first 2 subjects in the first cohort received BI 412 in a blinded fashion (placebo), while the remaining 4 subjects in this cohort and all subjects from the subsequent cohorts received BI 412 and were unaware that they were receiving active drug.\nDose adjustment considerations in subjects with renal function abnormalities as well as treatment guidelines were based on available pharmacological data (e.g. IL-17 levels). Patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr, by Cockcroft-Gault formula) \u2264 80 mililiters/minute were not eligible for enrollment. Adequate kidney function and no history of kidney disease at the time of assessment was a requirement for enrollment in the study. Subjects with moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction as well as active, clinically significant infection including tuberculosis, herpes zoster, and hepatitis B virus or C virus were not eligible for enrollment. Pregnant or lactating female subjects were also excluded from the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential and males not willing to practice effective methods of contraception after consent and until 30 days after the subject stopped treatment with BI 412 were not eligible for enrollment.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nPharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Studies in Healthy Subjects of BI 412 (Humanized Anti-IL17a Monoclonal Antibody)\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHealthy Volunteer\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: BI 406\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Healthy individuals, as determined by a physical examination, full blood count (with or without reticulocytes), urea, electrolytes, creatinine (only if creatinine > 1.2 mg/dl), aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT), total bilirubin, blood glucose, and urinalysis Results of a complete medical history within 90 days prior to screening Healthy individuals, determined by medical history and physical examination, who may be taking oral contraceptives at the time but who have committed to practicing birth control with an effective method of contraception, which includes both a condom and spermicidal foam, or to abstain from sexual activities during the study and for 30 days after taking the last dose of study medication Normal cardiac resting 12 lead electrocardiogram",

        "summary": "Hospitalization, medical interventions to be performed, and uncertainties specific to surgical intervention create a certain level of anxiety in the patient. It is known that being in the hospital negatively affects the coping mechanisms of the patient. In the pre-surgical period, the nurse's practices that will facilitate the patient's coping with the situation and managing his anxiety have a positive effect on anxiety during and after surgery and on anxiety-related symptoms. For these reasons, it is aimed to determine the effect of virtual reality on pre-surgical anxiety in this study.The hypothesis of the study is that watching videos with virtual glasses will reduce preoperative anxiety.",
        "model_output": "The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of virtual reality on preoperative anxiety in abdominal surgery patients. It is known that abdominal surgery patients have high preoperative anxiety levels. In addition, the development of technology, especially the use of smart devices in daily life, makes it possible to try different solutions for the treatment of anxiety in preoperative patients.\n\nIt is known that the most stressful period for individuals before surgery is the preoperative period, at least as much as the postoperative period due to the fear of surgical treatment. During this process, due to fear of unknown treatment and fear of anesthesia, the patient's concerns increase even more and can cause stress-related symptoms (Duncan et al., 2017). Excessive anxiety, which may cause complications, must be avoided in order to avoid negative outcomes such as increased pain and muscle tension, prolonged recovery from anesthesia and anxiety. In recent years, the use of virtual reality glasses has come to the fore to reduce preoperative anxiety. A meta-analysis found that the use of virtual reality glasses significantly reduced preoperative anxiety in children and their caregiving parents, and had long-term results in terms of decreasing stress and maintaining calmness (Schuh et al., 2018). The positive effect was observed especially in the group with high anxiety scores, and a significant reduction in negative emotions was observed in the group without virtual reality glasses (Bailey et al., 2019). In the study conducted by Moss-Magnier et al. which is related to the research problem of our study, they found that a large part of the patients preferred virtual reality glasses more than watching a documentary before laparoscopic surgery (Moss-Magnier et al., 2009 ). In addition, a study conducted by El-Boghdady et al. in Egypt showed that patients using virtual reality glasses experienced less negative emotions and had a better surgical experience (El-Boghdady et al., 2020).\nAlthough the literature showed that there are positive results in terms of reducing preoperative anxiety with the use of virtual reality glasses, there is no scientific study conducted in our country on the effect of virtual reality glasses on reducing preoperative anxiety. Since it has been observed that the use of virtual reality glasses reduce preoperative anxiety in surgical patients, it is necessary to conduct an original research to contribute to science. It is envisaged to collect both objective and subjective data in this study. After the patient is taken to the surgical unit, the digital video to be watched will be watched for the first time in the placebo group, in the intervention group with virtual reality glasses, and in the control group, the measurements will be measured with the visual anxiety scale and the stress level will be measured with the smart bracelet in both groups. At the end of the measurements, the smart bracelet will be stored by taking the name and mobile number of the participant. It is expected that the preoperative anxiety level in the placebo group will decrease only due to the normalization and adaptation process, while in the intervention group, it will be seen that the preoperative anxiety level decreases to a greater extent by the use of virtual reality glasses.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe effect of virtual reality on anxiety management before general surgery\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nAnxiety\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Behavioral: Watching video with virtual glasses\n* Behavioral: Watching video without virtual glasses\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Aged 19 and over Patients who will undergo general surgery Patients who agreed to participate in the research Exclusion Criteria: Patients with physical and mental disability History of a visual disease Patients who had surgery in the last 6 months Any medical condition that prevents the use of virtual reality glasses Not included in the informed consent process To be diagnosed with one or more acute anxiety disorders (i.e. generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder or specific phobia) History of chronic anxiety disorders History of alcohol and substance abuse in the last 12 months in the last 12 months History of using psychotropic drugs in the last 4 weeks History of suffering from schizotypic disorder History of suffering from bipolar disorder History of suffering from a personality disorder (personality with cluster A, B or C disorders) A history of psychotic symptoms such as disordered behavior, delusion and hallucination Inability to communicate due to an auditory problem.\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nMinimum Age: 16 Years\nMaximum Age: 70 Years",

Affecting approximately 2.5 million individuals around the world and seen mostly in young adults, MS can cause different levels of disability in functional activities, cause limitations in social and professional life, and impair quality of life. Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that develops on the basis of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Nutritional habits and physical activity are important environmental factors. These can be effective in the course of MS and change the quality of life. Compatibility of nutrition with the Mediterranean diet and providing adequate physical activity may be beneficial in increasing physical and mental well-being in general, and therefore the quality of life of the person.\nIn our country, there is not enough information about the ongoing nutritional habits and physical activity levels of MS patients in their daily lives, and quality of life studies are limited. Our limited knowledge on these issues narrows the possibility of movement in an area that can be corrected in MS patients and thus have a positive impact on their quality of life.

        "summary": "An overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by frequent en nightly voiding, small bladder capacity and the occurrence of sudden urge to void, with or without urinary incontinence. The prevalence of OAB with bothersome complaints is around 11% in women and 9% in men with an increasing incidence with age. OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed. Depending on the patient's characteristics and the physician's preference intravesical injections of Botox or the implantation of a sacral neuromodulator (SNM) can be considered.\nBoth options are equal and effective, but many individual differences exist in preference. Regarding outcome, some factors have been described to prefer one therapy above the other, for example in case of concomitant fecal incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections,\u2026 The personal preference of doctors and patients has been investigated, but currently no study has focused on therapy preference in a culturally and linguistic divers (CALD) population. The latter broadly describes a population with ethnical, cultural, religious and/or language characteristics and is a general accepted measure of diversity.\nIn the current study, the investigators aim to describe the different (dis)advantages of both second line treatments for OAB in a discrete choice experiment. The study population will consist of a diverse group of patients with OAB from different hospitals. The goal is to investigate if CALD patients make a different choice in treatment and what factors contribute to that decision in order to provide more tailored information regarding the treatment options in the future. Taking a patient's context into account in the shared decision making between a patient and physician increases therapy compliance and satisfaction of the chosen treatment.\nThe total questionnaire will consist out of general demographic info, the EQ-5D, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)-OAB and the discrete choice questionnaire in which patients make a choice between two fictional treatment options consisting of a combination of different therapy characteristics.

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",
        "model_output": "This is a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized control trial involving premature neonates born between 23 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks gestational age. The trial will take place in four Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) within the Rady Children's/University of California, San Diego network, including Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego, Jacobs Medical Center, Scripps La Jolla (Rady NICU) and Rancho Springs (Rady NICU). The investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no). The investigators set the alpha error rate at 0.05 and power at 80%. To achieve a 50% reduction in the CPAP weaning failure rate, they aimed to enroll a total of 80 infants < 28 weeks and 50 infants 28-30 weeks (130 infants in total). Consent will be obtained after the eligible infant has been extubated or has been stable on NIS (defined as CPAP/NIMV/NIPPV- all modes of pressure reliant respiratory support) for over 72 hours. NIS is delivered via occlusive (Fischer & Paykel [F&P]) or non-occlusive (RAM TM/Nioflo TM) interfaces at any pressure and oxygen need. A standardized maintenance/weaning protocol will be implemented for the treatment group (standardized NIS wean) while the control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices.

Fistulae complicating diverticulitis are the result of a localized perforation into adjacent viscera, and occur in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease[2]. The types of fistulae include colovesical, colovaginal, colotubal, coloenteric, and colocutaneous fistulae[3]. Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely, accounting for 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease[4]. Herein we describe a case of a fistula connecting the sigmoid colon with the left flank-lower lumbar area, due to diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon[5].\nA new over-the-scope clip system, called OTSC (Ovesco Endoscopy, T\u00fcbingen, Germany), appeared on the market about 3 years ago[6]. The system consists of a nitinol clip loaded at the tip of the endoscope that can capture a large amount of tissue and compress the lesion until healed[7]. Results from animal models and initial clinical use support the efficacy of OTSC closure in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding; its role in the management of iatrogenic perforations in humans is less defined, and reports on its use in treating colorectal postsurgical leaks and fistulas are anecdotal [8].

        "summary": "Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer generally have favorable outcomes and how well they do depends on the specific details about the patient and their cancer. How well they do isn't as related to the kinds of treatment they get. However, there are significant side effects for the various types of treatments they may get. Because these patients generally have favorable outcomes no matter the kind of treatment, reducing side effects should be a priority when choosing their treatment.\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate whether a new blood test called a Circulating Tumor DNA test (ctDNA test) can decrease the number of people that require radiation after surgery. This blood test is often elevated in people when they are diagnosed with head and neck cancer. There are studies that show that cancer most often returns when this blood test is positive after treatment. This study will test patients' blood before and after surgery. In cases where the test is negative after surgery, people on the study will not receive radiation unless they are considered high risk based on surgery findings. The hope is that radiation and its potential side effects can be limited to only people that need the treatment.",
        "model_output": "Rationale(s): Rationale: The incidence of oropharynx cancer (OPSCC) has historically been low, and even more uncommon are cases occurring in younger adults (age 30-50) and in females. More recently, the incidence of oropharynx cancer (OPSCC), particularly at sites where human papillomavirus (HPV) is the predominate causative agent, has dramatically increased over the last several years.\nTreatment for locally advanced OPSCC consists of definitive radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy. Local treatment outcomes have dramatically improved in the last 20-30 years with overall survival with locally advanced OPSCC nearly 80-100%. Local treatment modality is dictated by the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) with definitive treatment for OPSCC confined to primary tumor site or neck disease based on clinical staging. Adjuvant radiation therapy has been demonstrated to decrease local failure rates for OPSCC. The benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy in cases with positive surgical margins has been questioned as patients with positive surgical margins also tend to have microscopic extracapsular extension (ECE) and are more likely to present with node-positive disease.\nRisks: Risks: In addition to common acute toxicities, their favorable overall survival potentially places these patients at increased risk for developing long-term treatment-induced side-effects. Therefore, it is important to establish novel management approaches that maintain excellent current clinical outcomes while effectively reducing acute and long-term side effects. The SAVAL study tests the hypothesis that patients currently recommended for surgery (TORS) and have positive ctDNA will be offered registration for the study prior to surgical resection.\nStudy Goals and Objectives: Study Goals and Objectives: The goal of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients currently recommended for surgery (TORS) and have positive ctDNA will be offered registration for the study prior to surgical resection. After TORS, all patients will have ctDNA drawn within 2-14 days post operatively. Combined with pathological criteria, all patients will be stratified into one three risk groups; low risk, intermediate risk, high risk. The low risk group will be observed (no radiation) per standard of care (SOC). The intermediate group (intermediate pathological features and negative ctDNA) will also be observed (no radiation) per the experimental arm. The high risk group will receive adjuvant treatment (RT +/- chemotherapy) per SOC.\n\n\nStudy Design Assessment Schedule\n-----------------\n| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |\n| --- | --- |\n| Experimental: Experimental Observation<br>Requires the following criteria: Pathological T1-3 N1-2 with negative surgical margins Absent or microscopic extracapsular extension(ECE) (\u22641mm) ctDNA positive pre-operatively and negative post-operatively This group will undergo observation on the experimental arm of the study. They will be monitored for toxicity, Quality of Life (QoL) and outcomes evaluation. Suspected locoregional recurrence (LRR) based on physical examination, imaging or increasing ctDNA will undergo completion of workup at the discretion of the University of Maryland Head and Neck tumor board.

There is a need to better quantify this symptom burden and explore effective interventions to optimize patients\u2019 medical and psychosocial management. As technology evolves, the opportunities for digital technologies to play a role in symptom management are becoming increasingly apparent. The feasibility and potential efficacy of a digital health intervention to augment symptom and symptom-related management in individuals with multiple myeloma is not known and will require a dedicated prospective investigation. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of such an intervention and to preliminarily explore its impact on patients' symptom burden, health self-efficacy and overall well-being. This is a prospective study of individuals with multiple myeloma to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of digital health coaching and its potential to augment existing standards of care for patient support. Patients will be enrolled and will complete all assessments at baseline, 30, 60 and 90 days after consent. A digital health coaching intervention will be provided to all patients.

        "summary": "In intensive care unit, dyspnea, the distressing and fearful awareness of breathing, is frequent and harmful. To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

        "summary": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the commonest nerve compression syndrome in the upper limbs, and carpal tunnel decompression is one of the most prevalent upper limb surgical interventions. Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients.

        "summary": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional state between normal aging and early dementia, characterized by memory deficits without functional impairment. Cognitive decline prevalence is increasing in older adults, impacting independence and quality of life. Motor dysfunctions, often overlooked in MCI, contribute to these limitations. Action Observation Therapy (AOT), a rehabilitation approach involving observing and imitating motor gestures, promotes brain plasticity through the mirror neuron system. While AOT has shown effectiveness in various populations, its application in MCI is understudied. This study aims to investigate the effects of AOT on cognition, upper and lower limb function, daily activities, gait, and balance in MCI patients. It also compares outcomes when patients observe therapists or MCI individuals with similar characteristics. Primary objectives include comparing AOT efficacy between these groups and a control group. Secondary objectives focus on upper limb functionality, daily activities, balance, cognition, and gait.",
        "model_output": "Background\nThe term MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) refers to the transitional state between normal cognitive changes associated with aging and very early dementia. It is a disorder characterized by impairments in both short-term and long-term memory, but without functional deficits. MCI is considered a precursor to dementia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that in 2014 there were 5.0 million adults with cognitive impairment (CI) in the population aged 65 years and older, and it is projected that by 2060, this number will increase to nearly 14 million . A study by G\u00f3mez on sentinel health networks in Spain describes a prevalence of MCI among individuals aged 65 years and older ranging from 14.5% to 17.6% , which increases with age. Another study reports a prevalence of 11.6% in individuals aged 65 to 69 years, which rises to an average of 22.9% among those aged 85 years and older. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 9 Spanish studies on different types of dementia showed a prevalence ranging from 3.2% to 12.3% in individuals aged 70 years and older, with higher prevalence in women and increasing with age.\n The diagnosis of MCI can increase the likelihood of individuals requiring admission to specialized care centers. Gait and balance impairments are common in individuals with dementia, including slower gait speeds, decreased stride length, altered swing time, among others. However, these motor alterations are often overlooked when addressing CI . Balance impairment combined with gait deficits significantly increases the risk of falls, with approximately 60% of individuals with CI experiencing falls annually, twice as frequently as cognitively intact counterparts . Individuals with CI are also more prone to falls resulting in injuries, with up to a three-fold increase in the incidence of hip fractures compared to those without CI. Recognizing and addressing this connection between cognitive and motor deficits is crucial . A systematic review from 2018 concluded that combining physical training with cognitive training in a functional context can help mitigate some aspects of CI. Therefore, the evidence supports that cognitive intervention should be concurrent with physical exercises rather than separate . Action Observation Therapy (AOT) involves observing a motor gesture performed by another individual and then imitating the same movement. This technique has been developed as a physical rehabilitation approach that promotes brain plasticity by activating the mirror neuron system . Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of action observation learning. A study conducted with children with cerebral palsy, presented by Naura et al. , showed that motor learning through observation is more effective and provides more evident benefits when subjects learn from other patients with the same condition but less severity, compared to learning from a therapist or another person without motor impairment. However, these results have not been corroborated in older patients or those with CI. The current literature includes various studies consistently demonstrating that AOT is an effective way to learn or improve specific motor skills. Buccino's work summarizes several studies that have employed AOT, including one in which the intervention was carried out with healthy individuals to imitate a motor action in a new environment for them. Another study showed that AOT facilitates motor learning and the construction of a motor memory trace in adults and in patients who have had a stroke. In another study, it was demonstrated that, in healthy adults, AOT is superior to motor imagery as a strategy for learning a complex motor task, at least in the early phase of motor learning. Buccino concludes that these results can have significant implications in educational activities, sports training, and neurorehabilitation. Specifically in the field of pathology, evidence exists regarding the application of AOT for upper limb rehabilitation in patients who have had a stroke. A pilot study by Yu-Wei Hsieh concluded that AOT resulted in improvements in most outcomes, suggesting it as a promising alternative to contemporary bilateral arm training interventions (i.e., active control intervention) for subacute stroke patients . In a randomized controlled pilot study by Mancuso et al., it was proposed that AOT is a promising treatment for functional recovery and upper limb function in individuals with moderate to severe upper limb impairment following a stroke. AOT could become a useful strategy in stroke rehabilitation programs, as it improves functionality of the paretic upper limb and allows for regaining maximum independence in ADL . Evidence also exists for AOT in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, spec",

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine",

The investigators' hypothesis is that the time in seconds it takes to complete a central venous line placement with ultrasonographic guidance using an ultraportable ultrasound device (SONOSite\u2122 Xporte) will be significantly reduced compared to conventional ultrasound. The investigators' hypothesis is that the incidence of first-line central venous line placement failures, as defined as the need to attempt another placement, will be significantly reduced when using an ultraportable ultrasound device (SONOSite\u2122 Xporte) compared to conventional ultrasound.

Treatments will be scheduled once per week. Component-based training includes graded and structured practice of three components of somatosensation (i.e., tactile object recognition, texture discrimination and proprioception), including finger recognition tasks, hand recognition tasks and proprioceptive tracking tasks. Component-based practice will be complemented by occupation-based practice tasks (i.e., self-chosen activities of daily living) to enhance transfer to a functional context.

        "summary": "Sepsis, characterized by severe organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated immune response to infection, is often life-threatening in clinical settings. Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.

NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

It is proposed to structure the teaching of clinical medicine in the emergency department of the Brest University Hospital through a multi-professional and interdisciplinary team. This emergency situation clinical teaching method will be structured around an Emergency Care OSCE planned at the end of the internship. An emergency structured clinical examination (ECOS) is a clinical teaching and evaluation method based on a practical case. The emergency structured clinical examination is the cornerstone of the acquisition of the basic clinical skills of junior clinicians. It is a tool based on clinical situations of various complexity which are confronted with a simulator in order to structure, evaluate and document the clinical skills of the various actors in the emergencies. Its aim is to ensure that patients receive the same standard of care and are treated in the best conditions, whatever the period of the day and the place of consultation may be. It provides a framework in which junior clinicians can learn and assess their clinical skills in real time in a standardized and safe situation.The development of clinical skills requires the implementation of clinical cases as part of the daily emergency department activity.

The patient physical and psychological sufferings in ALS are immense, and apart from Riluzole, there is no effective treatment. Care of advanced ALS have an estimated cost of 4-8 million NOK per year. Perhaps the most challenging topic of ALS care is the decision to extend ventilation support into the stages of disease that require treatment both during day and night. In these cases, treatment is clearly life-sustaining and although quality of life may be maintained, the burden of caregiving imposed upon family or health care workers is huge, regardless of tracheostomy (TIV) or non-invasive (NIV) modality.\nThe present study is a longitudinal questionnaire study in Norway measuring overall quality of life, health-related quality of life, and disease-specific quality of life in ALS patients, partners and children before and after the introduction of life sustaining ventilation support. The investigators aim to increase the knowledge on how life-sustaining ventilation support with NIV or TIV affects the quality of life in ALS patients, life partners and children.

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",
        "model_output": "Neurologic deficits in acute and peri-acute chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) occur in many patients and the timing and severity of recovery of these deficits has been poorly understood. cSDH is a collection of blood accumulating between the brain surface and the tough dura mater outer coat of the brain. The dura mater and the underlying brain do not expand as the subdural hematoma enlarges and as the associated mass effect develops. To alleviate the associated increased intracranial pressure and to prevent seizures, surgery is indicated once a certain size of hematoma is reached. The surgical evacuation cures the symptoms related to the mass effect of the hematoma; however, many patients experience cognitive deficits related to the brain itself. It has been proposed that the subdural hematoma promotes the release and spread of cytotoxic excitatory neurotransmitters (such as potassium and glutamate) which triggers neuronal injury/death. This can be observed using Electroencephalography (EEG) as spreading depolarization (SD) waves. SD waves correlate with spreading cortical dysfunction that is associated with the impairments in cognitive function. SD waves have been detected in acute and peri-acute traumatic brain injury but have not been assessed in chronic subdural hematoma specifically.  \nThe primary hypotheses is that 40% of patients will experience SD events that will correlate with a decline in Markwalder or Glasgow Outcome Scores within 72 hours after surgical evacuation of cSDH and that the presence of SD waves predicts a more significant decline in MMSE, MoCA and SDMT. A better knowledge of the neurological recovery in cSDH has implications for the timing and selection of patients for rehabilitation post acute subdural hematoma evacuation.",

Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials on the inflammatory component of the disease, reducing the annualized relapse rate by 46% and the rate of new T2 lesions by 80% compared with interferon-\u03b2 1a.\nThe use of anti-CD20 agents, including ocrelizumab, is associated with an infectious risk that increases with duration of exposure, part of which is due to the development of hypo-gammaglobulinemia in relation to cumulative dose.\nSeveral reports suggest a persistent effect of anti-CD20 drugs in MS, with no resumption of inflammatory activity after discontinuation:\nDuring the development of ocrelizumab, at the end of phase 2, after having received 3 or 4 semi-annual cycles of ocrelizumab, a safety period with a therapeutic window of 18 months was planned, before re-administration in the extension study. During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

        "summary": "Mortality following elective colorectal cancer surgery range between 2.5-6% and increase for the elderly and frail patient regardless of T-stage. Around 80% of the patients who present with a colon cancer and is in a condition where surgery is possible will be offered resection of the tumor. A part of the colon is always removed together with the lymph nodes in order to ensure that cancer cells are not left behind. The risk of lymph node metastasis is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. The overall risk of lymph node metastases is less than 20 % in patients with early colon cancer. This indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer have no benefit of additional resection besides local tumor excision. The alternative to resecting a larger part of the bowel is to make more focused surgery only resecting a small part of the bowel part through a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. This new organ sparing approach is called Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS). The investigators aimed to examinate the hypothesis that organ preserving approach (CELS) provides superior quality of recovery in elderly frail patients with small colon cancers when compared with standard surgery in RCT.",

Although many older patients can cope with surgery and achieve complete cancer eradication, 30 % of elderly patients do not. In these patients oncological outcomes are often impaired and the patient experiences a long-lasting recovery from surgery. In order to improve postoperative outcomes and patients experiences we have designed a new surgical approach, where we combine the advantage of minimally invasive surgery with an organ sparing principle. The combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection makes it possible to remove 82% of the tumour with an intact colon while the surgeon is spared the dissection of the superior mesenteric vessels. Compared to standard resection, this procedure reduces the extent of the surgical resection, minimizes the trauma in the body, and thereby reduces the risk of postoperative complications. CELS will be tested in an elderly colo-rectal cancer population, comparing CELS with standard resection. Primary objective is to evaluate the patient-reported outcome postoperatively 3 months after the randomized surgical intervention. Secondary objectives are patient reported outcome up to 30 days postoperatively, assessment of health related quality of life and assessments of long-term oncological outcomes, hospital readmissions, rate of secondary surgery, length of hospital stay, 30-day mortality, duration of surgery, blood loss and rate of complete resection margin.\n\n\nStudy Investigators and Keywords\n=================\nDorte Lund Sorensen, MD, PhD, Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Rakhi Kundra, MBBS, Ph.D., Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Steen Husted, MD, Ph.D., Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Bo St\u00e6rfeldt, MD, Ph.D., Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Peter Garmo, MD, PhD, Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Aage Sorensen, MD, Clinical Investigator - Gastrointestinal surgery; Surgical procedures for gastrointestinal cancer; Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) resection - Colon Cancer; Henning E.

        "summary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",

Patients in Group 2 (PDT) will receive PDT with conventional ET with the use of diode laser at 660 nm, fluence of 1W for 10 s, with an optical fiber coupled to the equipment that will remain in the apical third of the canal for 10 seconds for photo-sensitisation. Patients in Group 3 (PDAT) will receive photo-activated disinfection (PDAT) using the same setting as for PDT but for 20 seconds. The irrigation protocol and the medicaments used will be the same for all the groups.

Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.\nThe research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.\nThe study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care. Contributed by the sociostructural elements and necessities, black market amphetamine and ketamine have not only emerged in the regime for decades, but also have become a lucrative business. Their recreational uses are also sometimes accompanied by real necessities and needs; black markets cater to the needs but guidance on the usages is based on word-of-mouth stories without professional medical assistances. There is one case the Principal Investigator (PI) collected, that one person, possibly under depression contributed by PTSD, took relatively high dosage of amphetamine and went into a state of psychosis with overwhelming persecution mania. The study protocol, Psychiatric Orders in Psychoanalytic Treatment of ASD, is therefore designed for an evidence-based approach in treating complex psychiatric disorders with psychoanalytic guidance.",

She showed multiple symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Panic Disorder With Agoraphobia (PDA), and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Her symptoms include: i) Fear of public areas; ii) Tachycardia, panic attacks, and dizziness; iii) Fear of public speaking; iv) Excessive worrying, and crying. In the context of anxiety-driven behaviors, it is interesting to note the participant\u2019s recent experience of a traumatic event: On the 20th of February 2023, around 1:15 AM, two individuals attempted to break into her home. The traumatic experience, combined with a suspected case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), is a factor that would likely lead to a worsening of her condition. The participant has been referred to specialized anxiety treatment. No medications have been prescribed for the time being. Treatment: The participant was referred for both short-term (3-months) and long-term (1 year) treatment. She is currently undergoing a 15-session weekly treatment using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmaceutical treatment using SSRI and SNRI. The participant undergoes psychoanalytic assessment, psychiatric testings, and medical assessment. Psychiatric Testing: Differentiated evaluation according to DSM-5 criteria. The participant is tested using DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria, the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV ADIS-IV, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ADIS-IV, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview MINI, and the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-16). Medical Assessment: The participant had a routine ECG test and was referred for laboratory blood analysis with clinical chemistry profile. Lab blood analysis included blood samples with blood counts, coagulation measures, and liver function. Mild hypercholesterolemia was found at 7.4 mmol/L (normal range: 3-7.8 mmol/L), and the participant was referred for cardiovascular screening and examination. Medication: The participant was offered a combination of SNRI duloxetine 20 mg/night in Jan. 2023, and 50 mg/d in Mar. 2023. The dosage was adjusted based on her personal reactions (mood change, side-effects, and physical/mental stamina) to the medication. An SSRI dosage of 50 mg/d in Aug. 2023 was chosen instead of increasing the dosage of duloxetine. The participant was also using 12 tablets of SSRI (Lupin Sertraline",

Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

        "summary": "Background: Following acute brain injury (ABI), patients are monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) where providers rely on frequent neurological examinations (neurochecks) to assess for neurodeterioration. Serial neurochecks are part of guideline recommendations, but there is equipoise between hourly (Q1) and every-other-hour (Q2) evaluation. In the ICU, care-related awakenings occur frequently, but it is unclear if differential neurocheck frequencies result in differential sleep, providing the scientific premise for this proposal.\nPopulation: Twenty-two patients (N=11 per group) who have undergone elective aneurysm coiling will be enrolled. On post-operative day (POD) 0, patients will be screened and approached for informed consent if they do not meet exclusion criteria, e.g., prior intracranial injury, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, mechanical ventilation. Patients with elective aneurysm coiling are being chosen because they require ICU level of care following their intracranial procedure, but do not have structural brain injury or ongoing sedation needs that might impact sleep measurements.\nMethods: Usual care: Patients are monitored every 15-30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-procedure, then Q1 or Q2 for up to 24 hours. If these patients remain stable, they are discharged home on post-operative day (POD) 1. Proposed Intervention: Enrolled patients will be randomized to Q1 or Q2 neurochecks following the institutionally required 6 hours of stable neurological and vascular checks. Once randomized, patients will undergo placement of electroencephalogram (EEG) with video, electrooculogram, and chin lead. The video EEG will be in place for at least 8 hours to include the overnight (10PM-6AM) time period. Following completion of the recording, the signals obtained will be reviewed by a blinded polysomnographic sleep technician for sleep characteristics including quantitative assessments of wakefulness, deep (N3) sleep, REM sleep, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation and arousals. On POD1, patients and their nurse will fill out the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire to rate subjective sleep quality.",
        "model_output": "Rationale: Neurocritical care patients are often awakened for neurological examinations after craniotomy for elective or emergent reasons. There are no data regarding the frequency of neurological examinations that would facilitate sleep. Objective: The objective is to compare the effect that varying frequency of neurological examinations has on both sleep in hospitalized neurocritical patients and patient recovery and neurological outcome. We hypothesize more frequent neurological examinations will increase sleep efficiency at the expense of time spent awake or time spent in a more profound sleep stage (e.g. deep sleep), thus, there will be less recovery in patients awakened more frequently. Methods: This will be a prospective, randomized study of consecutive patients enrolled at 9:00 pm on the first post-operative night and continued until discharge to the hospitalist service. Patients will be randomized to the group that is awakened for neurological examinations every hour or every other hour. An overnight sleep study (polysomnogram) will be performed on the same first night following surgery and again on the following 2-4 nights at the discretion of the clinical team. Polysomnograms will be scored using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) international scoring manual.\nResults: This study was presented and discussed at Society of Critical Care Medicine Critical Care Congress, February 16-19, 2019, San Diego, California. There were no published data presented in scientific journals at the time of this submission. Discussion: This is the first study to compare the effects of varying the frequency of neurological examinations on sleep quantity and quality in critically ill neuroscience patients after neurosurgery.

It is a well-known factor that indicates a poorer prognosis and outcome for patients who have undergone surgical removal of the cancer. In such cases, it is recommended to combine chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery.\nAs the number of cases of HNSCC related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) is increasing, treatment approaches have shifted towards using radiation therapy as the primary treatment method instead of surgery. This raises an important question about the significance of ENE observed through imaging tests (referred to as iENE) and its impact on the prognosis. Unfortunately, this question remains unanswered.\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study across multiple medical institutions. The investigators will gather data including scan results, histopathology reports, and data from patient charts from individuals who have been treated for head and neck cancer. The aim is to analyze and correlate the findings between the pathological evidence of ENE and the imaging results, while also assessing the prognostic value of iENE. Additionally, the investigators will explore the influence of HPV status on these factors.\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, the investigators hope to establish standardized criteria that can assist radiologists in accurately identifying ENE through imaging tests.

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",
        "model_output": "Background and Aims:\nDiabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is a common and severe complication of diabetes. Bedside blind bone biopsies (BBB) are a simple, safe, and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete DFU healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological BB. In addition, BBB can be performed in patients who have not yet received antimicrobial treatment and before definitive diagnosis of DFO. Our hypothesis is that BBB is non-inferior to conventional BB in DFO outcomes and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO. Aims: \nTo compare the clinical efficacy and safety of both procedures. To compare the microbiological culture results between the two procedures. Main and Secondary Outcomes: \nThe main objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of bedside blind bone biopsy, compared to conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological), on DFO remission without surgery at 1 year. The secondary objectives are to: (i) compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy (ii) compare microbiological culture results between groups (iii) compare the safety of both procedures. Methods: A single-centre open-labelled, randomized non-inferiority controlled trial comparing the clinical, microbiologic and safety outcomes of bedside blind bone biopsy and conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological). \nRandomisation, Blinding, and Implementation: \nRandomisation will be open-labelled, controlled, and non-inferiority, with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients with DFO will be asked to participate in the study and, if they accept, they will be registered. Registration includes the acquisition of informed consent, inclusion and exclusion criteria fulfillment, baseline evaluations, and randomization. Both patients and the clinician responsible for patient care cannot be blinded. The intervention will take place in the patient\u2019s room; therefore, patients will not be unaware of the intervention type. An external statistician will be responsible for data safety, as well as for the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of the data by the principle investigator. All researchers will remain blinded until all results are published. Ethical considerations will be considered throughout the study, especially during the design phase. In the event of a conflict of interest, no team member other than the first author will be involved in the article's publication. A copy of the data set will be provided if requested by journal. Statistical Analysis: \nThe sample size was determined to assess the non-inferiority of BBB over CCBB. Using the published results1, a one-side (superiority) test with a non-inferiority margin of 20%, power of 90% and type 1 error of 5% would include 152 participants (76 in each arm). This non-inferiority margin was determined based on the primary published trial in 20181 which reported a DFU remission rate without surgery at 1 year of 50.5% in the bedside blind bone biopsy group. We plan to enroll at least 350 patients. To account for losses due to withdrawals or loss to follow-up, we planned a minimum sample size of 350 patients. This target enrollment will give us a total of 1150 patients across two groups of which approximately 55% will be allocated to either BBB or conventional bone biopsy. For the analysis of the main outcome, we will use a one-sided 0.05 Fisher\u2019s exact test, with the non-inferior hypothesis being established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less than 20% with respect to the DFO remission rate without surgery. The secondary outcome is the need for surgery. The non-inferior hypothesis will be established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less than 20% with regard to the need for surgery. In both cases, the non-inferiority margin corresponds to the non-inferiority margin chosen for the main outcome. These non-inferiority hypotheses apply whether the study is considered as superiority or not; therefore, there are no superiors or non-inferiorities hypotheses. If the non-inferiority hypothesis is not met, the superiority hypothesis cannot be verified.

        "model_output": "\u03b2-TrCP2 is a novel protein that directly controls \u03b2-catenin, a key regulatory protein that mediates the Wnt signaling pathway. Mutations in Wnt genes and activating mutations in \u03b2-TrCP2 have been linked to several cancers, including colon cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer. In this study investigators will explore the potential role of inhibiting \u03b2-TrCP2 in human colon cancer. The study will be in the form of a randomized clinical trial comparing a \u03b2-TrCP2 inhibitor-RK2-001 to placebo in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The study is limited to subjects with mCRC, K-RAS tumor status and no active CNS metastases who are not candidates for curative therapy. Subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio, stratified by tumor KRAS status and number of prior fluoropyrimidine adjuvant treatments. The study will consist of the screening and baseline periods; the treatment period that is 56 days; and a follow-up safety assessment period. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of RK2-001 compared with placebo on duration of objective response (measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of RK2-001 compared with placebo on progression-free survival (according to RECIST Version 1.1) and overall survival in subjects with measurable disease.\n\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\n\u03b2-catenin overexpression plays a major role in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) disease. It is also well recognized that over-activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is tightly linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which is a characteristic feature of metastatic disease. Wnt signaling pathway is controlled by a multi-protein complex comprising \u03b2-catenin, APC, Axin and GSK3\u03b2. Tumor suppressor genes (e.g., APC) or mutations in GSK3\u03b2 tend to lead to over-activation of \u03b2-catenin and consequentially, to cancer formation. Thus, inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway would have tremendous potential in treating many cancers. Since \u03b2-catenin directly controls the Wnt signaling pathway, inhibiting \u03b2-catenin has become an attractive strategy to treat tumors mediated by the Wnt signaling pathway. In contrast to inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway, which often leads to compensatory changes in the cell to sustain \u03b2-catenin activity, inhibiting \u03b2-catenin directly eliminates any \u03b2-catenin activity and consequentially, the Wnt signaling pathway that needs constant \u03b2-catenin activity to sustain. Recently, we have reported that \u03b2-TrCP2 is a novel protein that regulates \u03b2-catenin activity via its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Therefore, inhibiting \u03b2-TrCP2 will result in increasing \u03b2-catenin activity and consequentially, the Wnt signaling pathway. Over 20 different cancers have been reported to over-express \u03b2-TrCP2. Using \u03b2-TrCP2-deficient human colon cancer cell lines, we have shown that inhibiting \u03b2-TrCP2 prevents \u03b2-catenin degradation and inhibits Wnt signaling. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that inhibition of \u03b2-TrCP2 will block \u03b2-catenin degradation and increase Wnt signaling, leading to inhibition of tumor growth in patients with colon cancer. This hypothesis can be tested by investigating whether \u03b2-TrCP2 inhibition has an anti-tumor activity in patients with mCRC. The study investigators plan to conduct a randomized dose-finding study with a fixed dose (250 mg, twice daily) and then a randomized dose escalation study. In this study investigators will explore the potential role of inhibiting \u03b2-TrCP2 in human colon cancer. The study will be in the form of a randomized clinical trial comparing a \u03b2-TrCP2 inhibitor-RK2-001 to placebo in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

Approaching the different dimensions of PSR calls on a dozen essential components: workload, autonomy, social support, burnout, anxiety, efforts made, rewards, work addiction, investment, etc. a specific questionnaire which usually contains 20 to 30 questions, so that having an overall view of PSR using the current reference questionnaires (Karasek, Siegrist, etc.) represents a total of more than 300 questions. The response time is thus incompatible with current medical practice (passage in the waiting room before the occupational health medical examination) and leads to a majority of non-responses during anonymous questionnaires on the Internet. On the other hand, these validated questionnaires were carried out by different people and are very heterogeneous between them, including in their formulation, so that the respondents have the impression of disorganization and anarchy. There is therefore a need for short, quick and uniform questionnaires. EVAs offer the incredible advantage of meeting these criteria: speed, uniformity, precision.

In an attempt to attenuate the loss of hard and soft tissue after tooth loss, alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) immediately after complete tooth extraction could minimize the need for ancillary ridge augmentation or soft tissue grafting. Different techniques and barrier membranes has been proposed to achieve the sealing of extraction socket.\nAim:\nTo investigate the effect of different techniques and barrier membranes for the soft tissue contour and morphological change of alveolar ridge after ARP\nMethods:\nThe study was designed as a randomized controlled trial and recruited patients, who require ARP for the purpose of implant placement or prosthodontic rehabilitation. After the tooth extraction, patients were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: ridge preservation with a xenogeneic bone substitute and (a) spontaneous healing (control), (b) covered with a free palatal graft, (c) or covered with pedical palatal graft, (d) covered with a collagen membrane, (e) covered with a non-resorbable high-density polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks following tooth extraction and ARP, clinical profilometric and radiographic evaluations were performed to analyze the change of hard and soft tissue contour.

The \u03b2-glucan is identified as a main component of BLEX 404. Not only with therapeutic potential on several types of cancer, BLEX 404 has also shown the potential to improve hematopoiesis, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, and the cytotoxicity activity of immune cells in recent animal studies. Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity.

In patients with advanced lung cancer, brain metastases are a common source of pain, and they also reduce life expectancy. Currently, stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS) is the main therapeutic option for the treatment of brain metastases in patients with advanced lung cancer. However, not all patients respond to SRS and the disease is often recurrent. New strategies to treat patients with MBM and with brain metastases recurrence are required. The investigators propose Liraglutide, a glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) agonist that acts on the brain, can prevent the development of brain metastases in patients with lung cancer. Previous studies have shown the efficacy of this medication in reducing or preventing the risk of brain metastases. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that Liraglutide may act on the gut-brain axis with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses in the brain. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liraglutide and its effects on the gut-brain axis in patients with lung cancer with MBM or with brain metastases recurrence. The investigators believe that Liraglutide may act on the gut-brain axis, thus preventing or delaying the development of brain metastases.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nPhase II, multicenter, controlled, clinical trial. Patients with advanced lung cancer and not eligible for stereotactic radiotherapy due to the multifocal and multicentric nature of brain metastases will benefit because all patients with lung cancer will be offered to be randomized to the study. The trial will include patients with advanced lung cancer, treated or without treatment with immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy, with brain metastasis or with brain metastasis recurrence. Imaging will be performed at enrollment. Patients who develop new brain metastases during the follow-up of the trial will also be evaluated. The primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients who develop new brain metastases during the follow-up of the study in the group of patients treated with Liraglutide compared with the group of untreated patients. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Trial subjects will be selected from all eligible patients at the Oncology and Radiotherapy Department of the Hospital de Santa Creu i Sant Pau-Institut de Recerca Sant Pau (IR-SP) and the Institut Catal\u00e0 d'Oncologia (ICO).

The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). In the case of rehabilitation of older patients post-COVID-19, we do not know what the course of recovery for these patients will be, and what treatment/approaches will deliver the best outcomes.\nPersons that are recovering from a COVID-19 infection, and admitted on a geriatric ward for early rehabilitation, or geriatric rehabilitation ward or facility, can be included in the study. They will receive routine, usual care; participation in this study will not affect their rehabilitation care. Routine care data will be collected from their electronic patient files at admission to geriatric rehabilitation, and at discharge. This also includes some data about their premorbid status. In addition, study participants will be called six weeks and six months after discharge from rehabilitation and asked some questions about their recovery. There is no risk association with participation in this study. Data will be anonymously collected in an online database.\nThe primary aim of this study is to get insight into the course of recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe. Mainly, we are interested in functioning in activities of daily living (ADL-functioning) such as toileting, bathing, dressing, etc., and in quality of life. The second aim of this study is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organization of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive. Therefore, we collect data on the types of care provided and the professionals involved. Moreover, we collect some patient characteristics such as year of birth, gender, date of admission and date of discharge; and data about complications such as delirium, pain, post-traumatic stress syndrome, hospital readmissions, and mortality. Our hypothesis is that most patients will show recovery during geriatric rehabilitation and in the six months after.

To estimate the degree of inflammation (the immune system response to injury) and its changes over time in severe TBI patients and the effect and timing of acetaminophen use on their inflammatory response in the first days after the injury.\n\n2. To assess the impact of acetaminophen use on the level of the protein called \u03b2-Trace Protein (\u03b2-Tp; a substance which indicates the severity of TBI in patients with a good initial outcome) in the first 72 hours after the injury.\n\n3.

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

        "model_output": "----------------- Dementia is an umbrella term associated with the decline of a person\u2019s ability to think, remember and perform daily functions. Studies show these symptoms are more prevalent in patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factor. In addition, patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those without cardiovascular disease. Many of these patients have mild cognitive decline, which can be prevented with cognitive stimulation therapy. Cognitive stimulation therapy is a 14-week program, developed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and proven to help older adults with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The purpose of the project is to recruit 2,000 patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to test whether dementia patients who have cognitive stimulation therapy will score higher on a cognitive assessment than those without therapy. The project will also test whether the acceptance rate of cognitive stimulation therapy is greater than 60% among healthcare-referrals. The results of the project will help patients with dementia and MCI receive improved and accessible healthcare services.\n\n\nExplanation of the methods and analyses (Protocol): -----------------\nBackground Dementia is an umbrella term associated with the decline of a person\u2019s ability to think, remember and perform daily functions (NIH 2019). Dementia is common in older adults. It is estimated 39 million people are living with some form of \u201cdementia\u201d worldwide. Dementia has become the costliest condition to treat\u2014with 1 trillion in worldwide costs (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics 2021). With aging populations the prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are projected to rise throughout the next century (World Health Organization 2020). These statistics reflect a serious public health problem. The NIH and several other U.S. agencies are engaged in finding new ways to treat dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Amyloid Treatment and Prevention Initiative; https://www.alzheimers.org/research/clinical-trials-and-treatments/clinical-trials-and-you/amyloid-treatment-and-prevention-initiative). Dementia is often a result of cardiovascular disease (Gilbertson et al 2012). It also often co-occurs with metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (Rajan, et al 2019). While many are aware of this link, what remains unexplained is why this association exists. One possible link to this association is the development of blood coagulation (Raz and Yassuda 2019). The end product of this cascade is the formation of a clot (Yassuda 2008). Clotting of blood in the brain leads to a condition known as a \u201cstroke.\u201d Cognitive Impairment is defined as a change in a person\u2019s ability to function normally in daily situations. These changes are categorized as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. There are many forms of dementia: Alzheimers disease (the most common), vascular dementia, or a combination (dementia with mixed-features). Dementia with mixed-features is the second most common type of dementia. It is common for individuals with dementia to have multiple types of dementia. MCI and dementia are common conditions among older adults (Al-Kandari, et al 2019). It is estimated 16% (Gitlin et al 2005) of individuals with MCI are likely to progress to Alzheimer\u2019s disease within 4 years. When MCI is associated with physical impairment due to cerebrovascular disease, the risk of progression to dementia increases four-fold (Jacobsen, et al 2005). Among individuals who received care for a dementia-related diagnosis in 2013, 16.1% died compared to 8.8% of the general U.S. population (Johnson et al 2017). The high prevalence and mortality rate of dementia are significant public health problems. Most public health interventions have a preventive focus. This includes the promotion of physical exercise, brain stimulation and/or cognitive training. Research shows that cognitive stimulation is beneficial for patients with MCI and mild dementia (Martin et al 2009, Livingston et al",

GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores.

It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10.

        "model_output": "Background: Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the most common intra-abdominal surgical emergencies. Despite this, there is a paucity of evidence to guide the management of these patients. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of non-operative management (NOM) of ASBO for children with favorable clinical characteristics. A trial of NOM allows time for an assessment of clinical improvement as non-operative measures are administered to correct the imbalance of ileus. When initiated at the right time, this is successful up to 80% of the time according to the recent literature. Previous literature on NOM has focused on general principles of management including non-operative resuscitation, pain control, decompression of distended loops on physical examination, gastric decompression, and a low-residue diet. More recently, studies have suggested a potential role for enteral contrast administration (ECA). ECA may have utility in identifying complete small bowel obstruction. In adult literature there is Level 1 evidence supporting the use of enteral contrast in patients presenting with adhesive small bowel obstruction. The authors of those publications recommend the use of an enteral water soluble contrast followed by post contrast imaging. There have been no studies published to date reviewing the use of an enteral contrast challenge specifically in children with ASBO. Although there is some evidence to support the use of contrast at the decision to operate (DTO), there is no Level 1 or 2 evidence to support the use of early contrast. The addition of contrast imaging may aid in the management of children with ASBO by assisting in the decision to perform surgery, particularly when an enteral challenge can be administered with minimal risk. Objective: To study the effect of the use of an enteral contrast challenge for the management of children with ASBO, on the incidence of surgical intervention, as well as complications from contrast exposure in children with ASBO. Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study across nine sites that enrolled patients from May 2020 through September 2022 .

Data were collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tool hosted at the University of Colorado. Patient groups were evaluated including those who received enteral contrast and those who did not. Comparisons were made between those who received contrast and those who did not. A subset analysis was performed among patients who received enteral contrast. Comparisons were made based on type of contrast agent used and final osmolality of contrast administered. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between contrast and need for operation adjusting for age, body mass index for age z-score (or weight for height z-score for patients under 24 months of age per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards), volume of contrast administered, and number of previous laparotomies (< 3 v. \u22653). A second subset analysis was performed based on whether a contrast challenge aided in the management of an ASBO when comparing children who underwent an enteral contrast challenge and required an operation with those who required an operation with no prior contrast challenge.\n\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nUse of a Water Soluble Contrast-Based Protocol to Assist in the Management of Pediatric Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nSmall Bowel Obstruction, Contrast Media Adverse Reaction\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Diagnostic Test: Enteral contrast challenge\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: children 1-20 years diagnosed with an adhesive small bowel obstruction by an attending pediatric surgeon and underwent a trial of nonoperative management (NOM) on hospital admission Exclusion Criteria: peritonitis suspicion of inccerated or internal hernia active intra-abdominal malignancy inflammatory bowel disease less than four weeks since the most recent abdominal operations pneumatosis pneumoperitoneum known contrast allergy\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nMinimum Age: 1 Year\nMaximum Age: 20 Years\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nAll\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n-----------------\nNo\n\nStudy Plan\n================",

        "model_output": "Background\n-----------------\n\nOverview\n\nCrohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which generally manifests in the second or third decade of life and can persist for a long period. In the Netherlands, there are currently 66,440 people with chronic intestinal disease, of which 9,014 people suffer from Crohn's disease. Patients with Crohn's disease frequently present with episodes of severe abdominal pain and disabling diarrhea with blood and mucus. Complications such as stricture formation, fistula formation, and abscesses can contribute to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. In addition, the disease places a financial burden on our health care system and its patients. Patients require long-term management and there is currently no cure. For most patients, treatment will begin with mesalamine and corticosteroid use is often necessary when symptoms progress. If symptoms persist, the use of immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate is suggested. For patients not improving sufficiently, biologics (e.g. anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab or ustekinumab) are used as a last resort. There is currently no cure and in some patients, the disease can persist for a long time and treatment will need to be adjusted regularly to ensure that symptoms remain under control.\n\nTNF\n\nTumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) plays an important role in the inflammatory process of Crohn's disease, as well as the formation of complications such as strictures or abscesses. Targeting TNF-\u03b1 can reduce the burden of disease through reduced inflammation, reduced stricture formation and reduced abscesses. The first biologics to target TNF-\u03b1 was infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to TNF-\u03b1 and prevents its interaction with the TNF-\u03b1 receptor. The efficacy of infliximab was studied in a number of studies, including a phase III trial by Sandborn et al (2007) where infliximab was shown to be superior to placebo. In this study, the treatment with infliximab resulted in significantly higher remission rates and significantly fewer episodes of abdominal pain, disabling diarrhea, and hospitalization. Other studies showed similar results (Hanauer et al (2003); Feagan et al (2005); Sands et al (2003)).\n\nIFX monotherapy, IFX and immunosuppressive therapy\n\nIn a number of studies, the efficacy and safety of infliximab was studied, focusing on different doses of infliximab and the use of additional immunosuppressants. In these studies, patients received either 10 mg/kg every 2 months or 5 mg/kg every 2 or 8 weeks. The treatment schedules studied also included a loading dose of 5 mg/kg at the start of treatment. The results suggest that a higher loading dose and higher maintenance doses achieved better results, with higher remission rates and better response to therapy. The efficacy and safety of infliximab in combination with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine was also studied. A systematic review by Schnitzler et al (2013) showed that the use of combination therapy was associated with a better response to treatment, as shown by higher remission rates, higher rates of clinical remission and a quicker time to remission. There was no evidence of increased side effects and toxic effects with the use of combination therapy.\n\nAim of the study and research questions\n\nAs there is currently uncertainty as to whether infliximab monotherapy is as effective as infliximab in combination with azathioprine in the induction therapy for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease, this study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of infliximab monotherapy with infliximab in combination with azathioprine during induction therapy. Additionally, the study aims to study the following:\n\n\u2022 The efficacy and safety of infliximab monotherapy\n\u2022 The efficacy and safety of infliximab in combination with azathioprine\n\u2022 To what extent concomitant treatment with azathioprine or methotrexate improves the efficacy and safety profile of infliximab\n\u2022 The relationship between HLA",

        "model_output": "Bronchiectasis are defined as irreversible dilatations of the bronchial tree. Patients suffer from chronic cough, sputum production and recurrent airways infections. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and specifically forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a common modality used to estimate lung disease progression and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on PFTs, reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. Although all individuals perform spirometry testing using the same maneuver, there is some possibility that this maneuver can induce bronchoconstriction in some of the patients with bronchiectasis which may be improved by bronchodilators administration or by performing the testing prior to administration bronchodilators. Despite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis, the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations. According to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society statement, the proper way to demonstrate BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most resent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered positive BDR. While many factors may influence BDR, some can influence the results of the spirometry evaluation alone or in combination with bronchodilators administration. Theoretically, in patients with bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry can potentially cause changes in lung function, for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in patients with bronchiectasis might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Secondary objectives will be to assess if BDR is associated with age, gender, specific bronchiectatic disease, baseline FEV1, and other clinical factors such as sputum cultures, IgE levels, eosinophil levels, computed tomography (CT) score, family history of asthma.",

        "model_output": "1. Introduction:\nChronic migraine (CM) is a common form of headache that affects an estimated 3.6 million people in the United States (US). This type of headache can be debilitating and, at times, causes patients to miss work and school. While some people are affected by CM infrequently throughout their lives, other people experience these headaches more often and are considered to be chronic migraineurs (CMs). CM affects both genders and has been shown to have a negative impact on patients\u2019 quality of life and overall well-being. The current medical treatment of CM involves acute and preventative treatment modalities. Preventative treatments include medications that are typically used to treat depression, seizures, and hypertension. As such, these drugs pose an increase risk of cardiovascular disease, sedation, and renal toxicity. In spite of these risks, acute and preventative drug treatment strategies are still considered to be the predominant methods used to treat CM. Unfortunately, as with any drug, the effects from acute and preventative drug treatments are highly patient specific. Therefore, some patients may respond positively to the drug, while other patients may not respond to the drug or have mild to moderate side effects. One particular area where significant advancements are still needed is the field of patient-specific treatments.\n3. Personal significance:\nOur research group has a long history of studying migraine headaches and chronic migraine. The group has used a variety of research methodologies including clinical studies and psychophysical pain testing. As a result of this history, one of our group\u2019s researchers (J.G.) has encountered patients with CM many times during his career. These encounters brought to his attention the high prevalence of migraine headaches, as well as their negative impact on patients\u2019 quality of life. Our research group has been invited to serve as part of a team at Emory University that is charged with developing and testing alternative treatments for patients with CM. This new role provided J.G. with the opportunity to expand his thinking and focus on the potential effects of hormonal treatments on pain perception.  This line of enquiry and associated research questions grew out of a long history of experience working at Emory University and seeing patients with different migraine headaches including CM. Although CM has been shown to affect patients differently, little is known about how gender identity impacts pain perception and the potential treatment outcomes for these patients. Therefore, the current proposal represents the first step towards exploring the possible relationship between gender identity, hormone status and pain sensitivity among patients with CM. This type of research is important because the information that we learn from these studies can influence both the prevention (prior to the onset of a headache) and treatment of CM.\n4. Research history:\nThe field of neuroscience has witnessed a rapid increase in its understanding of the central and peripheral nervous system. Advancements in pain research were a direct result of these technological advancements, and neuroscientists were among the first researchers to understand how these technologies could be used to further their studies. The scientific methods and technologies that have been used to study pain perception include non-invasive brain imaging, pharmacologic modulation, psychophysical testing, and behavioral assessment. Our group has used a variety of these methods including brain imaging and psychophysical testing to examine pain perception in patients with migraine headaches. One of our major research discoveries has been that patients with migraine headaches show deficits in pain tolerance compared to healthy participants. Furthermore, these deficits have not been shown to be related to differences in brain activity (as indicated by brain imaging). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that deficits in pain tolerance may be directly related to differences in endogenous pain modulation systems. To test this hypothesis, we examined differences in pain tolerance among 4 groups of patients: controls, non-painful CM, painful CM, and patients with migraine headaches. Our results showed that these patients exhibit different levels of endogenous pain modulation, which could explain their observed differences in pain tolerance. Furthermore, our results showed that the presence of a migraine headache alone can reduce pain tolerance among these patients.\n5. Scientific objectives:\nOur primary scientific objective will be to understand how gender identity, hormonal status and pain perception are related among patients with CM. This relationship has never been investigated, which is a major scientific shortcoming in the CM literature. In order to address these issues, we propose to use a variety of scientific methods and technologies including brain imaging and psychophysical pain testing. The information that we learn from these studies can be used to develop and test alternative treatments for patients with CM. Furthermore, our research proposal will provide our team of investigators with important information about the relationship between gender identity, hormonal status and pain perception among patients with CM",

The only palliative treatment for respiratory failure is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which compensates failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea, improves quality of life and increases life expectancy. In ALS patients, the persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy). This study evaluates the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort in ALS patients with persistent dyspnea treated with NIV.",
        "model_output": "------------------\nIntroduction\nWhen the respiratory failure of ALS approaches, the persistence of dyspnea is often perceived as one of the major determinants of suffering induced by this disease. The only treatment capable of improving respiratory distress, prolonging the survival of ALS patients and alleviating suffering is non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Numerous therapeutic approaches have been evaluated in the past in order to alleviate dyspnea independent of its treatment (vasopressors, corticosteroids, cannabinoids, antidepressants, intravenous lidocaine, but also thoracic paravertebral injection of a bupivacaine local anesthetic, transcranial electrical stimulation). It has been suggested that virtual reality (VR) applied to ALS patients treated by NIV could reduce the feeling of respiratory effort and allow breathing to sound less labored, thus relieving dyspnea 1). A randomized controlled study involving 80 ALS patients treated with NIV has shown that VR can reduce the feeling of respiratory effort (40% improvement) and dyspnea intensity (12% improvement), thus increasing the quality of life of patients by improving sleep and preventing the premature use of NIV . 1.\n\nConcepts about the pathophysiology of dyspnea in ALS 2).\n\nALS patients develop the symptoms of respiratory failure only when there is a loss of function of respiratory muscles with an imbalance of ventilation / perfusion. Dyspnea in these patients is mainly sensory in nature, corresponding to the perception of the afferent information from the respiratory receptors and the central nervous system and not to a cardiopulmonary deficit. This dyspnea is characterized by a predominance of the affective component (dyspnea is experienced as undue), which is not linked to any organic alteration, but rather to the difficulty that ALS patients have in maintaining their autonomy and in particular their self-respect. 2)\nApart from dyspnea, ALS patients often experience anxiety, which results in anticipatory anxiety and an inability to remain calm and at rest. 3).\nAlthough the sensory component of dyspnea is the main target of current therapeutic approaches, it should be noted that they are based on symptomatology and no mechanism of action has been identified. 4).\n\nCurrent therapeutic approaches are based on the use of bronchodilators (bronchodilators), sedatives (hypnotics such as benzodiazepines) and NIV, without addressing the emotional aspects. Currently, there is no standardized way to measure dyspnea. The Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire is widely used for the evaluation of dyspnea. It consists of 30 items, 12 of which are specific to respiratory dysfunction. Each question is marked on a numerical scale from 0 to 10. The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 300. MDP questionnaires were administered to 34 ALS patients treated with NIV. The average score of these patients was 166 . 5).\n\nProblems related to the measurement of dyspnea.\n\nMDP questionnaires are used by clinicians to determine the effectiveness of dyspnea treatments in clinical trials. However, the results are variable even when the symptoms appear to be the same. We believe that this is due to the emotional aspect of the disease, the lack of involvement of the patient in the choice of his care program, and the place where the measurement of dyspnea is performed and therefore the psychological context in which he finds himself. There are differences between the way dyspnea is perceived at home, where the patient is in a private environment, and during the medical consultation, where the patient feels the influence of the medical environment, the clinician and the presence of his entourage in an unfamiliar place , even if this visit is programmed and scheduled within the routine of his disease. Another aspect to consider is the impact of this measurement on the patient\u2019s psychological condition. The evaluation by questionnaire of the dyspnea felt may change the way it is perceived, thus further exacerbating the problem. Although MDP questionnaires are commonly used, they are criticized for a number of reasons. First of all, the use of an ordinal scale makes the data inconsistent. Secondly, the wording used to explain the scale is not always self-explanatory and clinicians often have to adapt to the patient\u2019s level of understanding. In this study, patients have the option of completing the questionnaire at home",

Several studies have reported the positive impact of antibiotic susceptibility testing performed on urine cultures on the appropriate use of antibiotics.\nThe selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing , defined as the restriction of the list of antibiotics mentioned in the report according to the antibiotic resistance profile, would allow, according to observational studies, a reduction of 25 to 70% of the initial prescriptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics and a 20% rate of antibiotic de-escalation (=reduction of the antibacterial spectrum of an antibiotic treatment after re-evaluation).\nThe objective is to assess the impact of disseminating a selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing on the dispensing of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) for E. coli positive urine cultures in adult women, compared to the dissemination of a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing.",

Although this plan was quickly adopted by several countries, the rate of antibiotic prescriptions has generally continued to rise in parallel to the emergence of bacterial resistance. In particular, there is a lack of evidence regarding interventions that may support GPs in better targeting their antibacterial prescriptions. In primary care, antibiotic prescriptions often rely on urine culture results. Due to the time it takes a laboratory to analyze these cultures and return their results to GPs, many patients receive treatment based on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial conducted in the Loire Atlantique and Maine et Loire districts (France), with a primary care cohort of women presenting with a Escherichia coli urinary tract infection (UTI). Each patient will be attributed to either the intervention arm, receiving a targeted antibiotic susceptibility testing result, or to the control arm, receiving a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing result. Outcomes of interest are broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing in the same primary care practice and rate of de-escalation (=a shift from broad-spectrum to narrower-spectrum antibiotic therapy).

Researchers intend to show how the use of a virtual coach is more effective in preoperative weight reduction prior to ventral hernia repair over usual care. Correspondingly, this may lower unplanned hospital readmissions. For this clinical trial, where randomization is not possible, the study team will implement the use of propensity score matching that sorts individuals into different study arms as if randomly assigned. The primary outcome is the average net amount of time-dependent weight change per group over six months. Secondary outcomes are for the intervention group, patient satisfaction with the virtual coach and for both groups, quality of life. In addition, areas of social and economic disadvantage will be identified that may contribute to higher obesity rates. Machine learning (ML) modeling will be used to determine the important features for weight lost over the course of the study. The impact of this work will be to demonstrate efficacy and realized workflow efficiencies within a hospital-based surgery clinic.",
        "model_output": "Background: Ventral hernias (VH), defined as bulges in the abdominal wall, occur in 1 in 200 individuals. VH present a lifetime risk to the patient, resulting in morbidity, mortality, and quality of life decrease. VH are exacerbated when a patient is obese based on the individual\u2019s BMI. Weight reduction has shown to reduce the rate of re-herniation in patients undergoing elective ventral hernia repair. However, only 0.1-5% of the patients lose weight successfully prior to their scheduled VHR. Previous methods used to help with weight loss have not been successful. Studies suggest that the use of behavioral coaching may significantly enhance an individual\u2019s ability to successfully lose weight when compared to self-motivation alone. New technologies like virtual weight loss coaches have the potential to offer a cost-effective, scalable intervention for obese VHR patients to lose weight. The success of a virtual weight loss coach also heavily depends on the amount of interaction or engagement a patient has with the coach, as a lack of engagement results in greater than 80% of weight loss programs to fail. \n\nGiven this lack of success with the current interventions for weight loss in obese hernia patients, we propose using the MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach, and to test whether the virtual coach will increase overall weight loss as compared to the standard weight loss program (standard preoperative weight loss tools) or other intervention methods. In addition, given the lack of studies measuring whether patient engagement with the virtual coach translates to increased weight loss, we propose a secondary analysis to determine if a virtual weight loss coach increases the degree of patient engagement, as we hypothesize that this will lead to more weight loss in our subjects. \n\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nDoes a Virtual Coach Offer a Better Solution for Weight Reduction in Ventral Hernia Patients With Obesity?\n\nDescription\n-----------------\nHypothesis: The MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach will lead to the most weight loss in patients undergoing elective ventral hernia repair compared to patients using current standard preoperative tools or other weight loss programs. The overall purpose for this study is to determine if the MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach increases the total amount of weight loss when compared to standard preoperative tools. In addition to looking at the degree of weight loss, we hypothesize that the most successful intervention will also result in higher levels of patient satisfaction and will lead to more patient engagement when compared to a less successful intervention. Subjects will be recruited from the in-office and hospital-based clinics at UT Southwestern Medical Center and will be recruited by all members of The Division of Plastic Surgery and The Division of General Surgery. Subjects who fit each inclusion criterion will have the option to enroll in the study, which is a randomized trial. A total of 160 subjects will be needed to ensure adequate statistical power to measure any differences in the weight lost within each group and between each of the three study groups. Randomized enrollment will occur across three different groups, each with 53 subjects. We will record patient information such as demographics, BMI, and type of hernia repair. We will perform measurements on patients both preoperatively and 6 months post-op. Study enrollment will occur on the last scheduled pre-op visit, which will typically be 1-2 months prior to surgery. Participants will attend a total of four study visits, 2 of which will be virtual visits (pre-op and post-op), the other two will occur in-person with the research team. During the first two encounters, we will gather baseline information, patient demographics, and BMI of each subject. We will then give each subject a study code that will remain anonymous throughout participation in the study, as well as a phone number that will be directly in contact with the participant\u2019s assigned coach for the duration of the study. We will explain to each subject their respective methods of weight loss and guide them accordingly for the remainder of the study. The subject will be given the virtual coach number, login information, and directions on how to use the Mychart enabled virtual coach. Subjects assigned to the Standard group will be given a reference list for the most common obesity-related diet and exercise plans and a paper calendar where they will track their weight progress and diet/exercise plan compliance.

Research Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (nebulized) combined with conventional therapy for the treatment of moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 patients through a multicenter, randomized controlled, single-blind clinical trial. Our main goals revolve around developing a safe and effective therapeutic strategy that can be widely utilized to efficiently ameliorate the clinical symptoms of patients with moderate pulmonary and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and mitigating the clinical symptoms of patients with critical pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection. 2. Research Design: (1) The study adopts a multicenter, randomized controlled, single-blind trial design. (2) A total of approximately 101 participants will be enrolled in the trial. (3) The control group will receive nebulized saline solution twice a day (BID) for 5 days, while the experimental group will receive 5ml of nebulized umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles twice a day (BID) for 5 days. (4) The safety and effectiveness of the treatment plan will be evaluated by comparing the differences in symptom remission time, improvement of serum inflammatory markers, changes in lung lesions on CT as well as be hospitalized time and nucleic acid turn time of two groups during and after treatment. 3. Innovation of the trial: This is the first multicenter randomized controlled single-blind trial with clinical efficacy evaluation through pathogenesis studies on the application of stem cell-derived exosomes for coronavirus disease 2019 treatment. The outcome of this study can provide clinically valuable data for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in the future and also provide a methodological reference for the future conduct of multicenter and large-sample studies on stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of various diseases. A systematic approach for standardizing manufacturing processes has also been established, and the obtained extracellular vesicles will be stored for future basic studies (such as disease pathogenesis, immunotargeted drug delivery, and toxicity studies). 4. Outstanding characteristics of the trial: (1) Compared with other clinical applications of stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of various diseases, this trial provides a more systematic approach to the development and research of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, which can promote the development of stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle production technology and provide support for the production of new drugs for clinical treatment. (2) Compared with other clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, by selecting patients with moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 infection, the results of this trial are more directly applicable and can provide direct evidence that stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles can effectively reduce lung injuries and improve patient outcomes. 5. Risk and side effects evaluation: (1) According to the literature review on the efficacy and side effects of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of COVID-19 infection and the known side effects of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes, we conclude that the adverse reactions of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of COVID-19 infection remain unclear, and there are no reported cases of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes to treat patients with COVID-19 infection. (2) During the study period, participants will be closely monitored and their vital signs, lung function, laboratory tests, and adverse events will be investigated to ensure their safety during the study period. (3) The specific details of the trial monitoring and risk management will be formulated as part of the trial, and the investigators will also conduct regular safety and tolerability assessments of the trial. In the event of any adverse events that occur during the study period, the investigators will promptly provide appropriate medical care to the participants and report the event to the Drug Safety Committee and the Drug Administration Committee in time. 6.

Despite these advantages, the long-term presence of central venous catheters is associated with thrombotic and infectious risks , including catheter-related bacteremia, which can be complicated by septic thrombophlebitis and endocarditis that can lead to death.\nSeptic thrombophlebitis is a complication of venous catheter infections, which increases the morbidity. It is defined by the presence of a thrombosis in the vein where the venous catheter is located, associated with a bacteremia. A distinction is made between superficial and deep thrombophlebitis.\nThe frequency of septic thrombophlebitis of venous catheters is variable and poorly described in the literature.\nWhen the diagnosis of septic thrombophlebitis is made, it is recommended to extend the duration of antibiotic therapy, to remove the infected catheter and to prescribe anticoagulant treatment.

The diagnosis of STP is based on clinical diagnosis of thrombophlebitis (erythema, warmth and edema, sometimes painful), combined with a positive blood culture. STF is responsible for the majority of infections in ICU and is a major healthcare problem. For patients with STP and central line, a curative management is not available in current guidelines.

After a thorough periodontal check-up to determine the treatment needs, all included patients will be treated with non- surgical periodontal treatment. However, during this treatment, the patients will be divided into two groups: half will receive gaseous ozone application and another half a placebo treatment. The participants will be re-examined after 3 months, and the treatment effect will be evaluated. \n\nIntroduction\nThe periodontal disease is a chronic infection and inflammation condition of the supporting tissues of the teeth including the gingival, periodontal ligament, cementum and alveolar bone. \nUntreated, the periodontal disease may progress and lead to the destruction of gum and bone, which supports the teeth in the mouth. This, in turn, may lead to loosening of the teeth, and even complete tooth loss. Thus, the management of patients with periodontal disease, through scaling and root planing (SRP), is the gold standard of treatment. However, in cases of patients with moderate or severe periodontal disease, the use of adjunctive therapies have been proposed as possible alternatives to improve the clinical and periodontal parameters. \nAccordingly, many different biological (systemic antibiotics) or non-biological (subgingival irrigation, photodynamic therapy using lasers, application of ozone gas or topical antibiotic solutions) therapies have been proposed to improve the clinical and periodontal parameters. However, to date, no adjunctive approach is considered as the standard of care and clinicians should, therefore, choose the methods of adjunctive treatment based on their own experience, expertise and the best available evidence. \nIn this context, the use of gaseous ozone, as an adjunct to SRP, has been suggested in the past as a treatment with minimal invasiveness and risk of side effects. Ozone is a strong oxidizing agent with chemical activity on the surface of the bacteria; such as periodontal pathogens, where it can damage their membrane function and inactivate their metabolic functions. In addition, ozone also has an immunomodulatory effect and can help to reduce the inflammatory response of the tissues in patients with periodontitis. \nThis study is a single-center, randomized, assessor-blinded clinical study to investigate the impact of gaseous ozone application, besides of non- surgical periodontal treatment, on periodontal clinical parameters, periodontal probing depth, bleeding on probing, and inflammatory parameters in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF).\n\nObjectives\nThe primary aim of this study is to investigate and compare the treatment effect of periodontal subgingival scaling and root planning, with and without ozone application, on the periodontal clinical parameters including probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP), as well as inflammatory parameters in the GCF. \n\nStudy design\nThe study will be a single-center (Faculty of Dentistry, University of Bergen, Norway) assessor-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT).\n\nInclusion criteria\n \u2022\tPatients with periodontitis will be included in this study.

Besides calendar age, the degree of frailty also associates with increased susceptibility to pneumonia requiring hospitalization. How alterations in the mucosal immune system with advanced age predispose to infections remains unclear as access to relevant tissue samples is limited. With minimally-invasive nasal sampling methods, it was recently observed that in vital older adults, both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells are selectively lost from the nasal mucosa. However, the exact phenotype, underlying mechanisms, key molecules and consequences of this have not yet been investigated.\nObjective:\nElucidate the mechanisms underlying the loss of nasal T cells and characterize in depth the differences of T cells in young and older adults and associate this loss with susceptibility to infections.\nStudy design: Prospective cohort study\nStudy population: Participants will be recruited from 3 groups:\nhealthy young adults (18-30 years, n=50)\nvital older adults (>65 years, n=60)\nfrail elderly (>65 years, n=60).

        "model_output": "1. Hypothesis The loss of nasal T cells during ageing is associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and the development of a pro-inflammatory environment. 2. Background Aging is associated with a progressive decline in immune function. Immune senescence, in particular the loss of T cell immune responses, may contribute to frequent infections and increased susceptibility to severe infections during older age. However, our understanding of how the ageing immune system contributes to an increased susceptibility to respiratory infections still lacks. This is particularly an important knowledge gap when we observe that around a third of younger adults become infected with a respiratory pathogen after symptomatic influenza infection. We hypothesize that there are important individual differences in disease susceptibility, which may partly be explained by age-associated changes in the antiviral T cell response. Previous studies have revealed that T cell homeostasis in the nose is altered in older compared to young adults and that the T cell compartment in the nose is substantially reduced in older adults. The loss of nasal T cells is, however, an understudied phenomenon that has not been linked to susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. 3. Objective The main objective of this proposal is to identify the underlying mechanisms and consequences of the loss of nasal T cells in older adults of different health conditions. 4. Study design We will study the effects of ageing on the nasal T cell compartment and to elucidate the consequences of altered nasal T cell function in aged individuals. For this, we will recruit 180 volunteers (aged 18-40 and 65-95). For a subset of participants (n=60) with frequent respiratory tract infections a nasal swab will be collected in symptom-free periods to identify respiratory tract pathogens. We will furthermore perform detailed studies on nasal T cells, the nasal microbiota and the systemic immune responses during respiratory tract infections in a subgroup of participants. 6. Rationale Older age and pre-existing respiratory conditions are major risk factors for severe viral infections, such as influenza-related pneumonia, as well as severe bacterial infections. In this proposal we will use a combination of advanced molecular and cellular technologies to dissect immune mechanisms in the nose, which are expected to contribute new insights into how infections in the respiratory tract are linked to immune ageing. The findings may inform future development of preventive interventions that may help to reduce the number of severe infections in older age.\n\n\nStudy Design\n=================\nStudy Type:: Observational Study\nObservational Study Model:: Cohort\nTime Perspective:: Prospective\nCohort/Group Details:: 1.

Patients in Child B or higher class can have SBP. Also patients with any of the following risk factors are prone to develop SBP: presence of gastroesophageal varices, ascites that accumulates in short intervals, history of urinary tract infections, active malignancies, history of infections, history of neutropenia, and renal transplantation. The microorganisms that cause SBP can be both gram-positive and gram-negative.The usual treatment of SBP is antibiotics to prevent the risk of deterioration of the patients' condition. The choice of the antibiotic therapy is usually based on the results of the culture. The most common treatment regimen involves two or three different types of antibiotics, based primarily on the results of the culture if it performed in less than 12 hours. The antibiotics used for the treatment of uncomplicated SBP are ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem or meropenem. Antibiotics are usually given for at least 7 days. Cirrhotic patients with SBP are treated for a few days while their condition is stable. If the patient remains stable, the antibiotic therapy may change to oral therapy, and some studies have shown that this change has not been associated with increased risk of re-infection. Cirrhotic patients with SBP must be carefully followed, particularly if the renal function is deteriorating or if the patient's clinical condition does not improve. If the patient's clinical condition does not improve, he or she must be referred to the intensive care unit. If the patient's liver function deteriorates, he or she may require liver transplantation.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Primary outcome: Platelets to Lymphocytes Ratio and Monocytes to Lymphocytes Ratio as Predictors of Response to Treatment in Cirrhotic Patients with Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis .

The primary objective is to estimate the rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of the combination of Tislelizumab, Canakinumab, Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine by Cycle, Cycle 1, and Cycle 2, within the first 56 days of combination therapy. The DLT rate is derived from a safety population (SP) consisting of all patients with at least 1 dose of Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine. All toxicities (adverse events (AEs) and abnormal laboratory values) that occur within the first 8 weeks of study treatment will be evaluated for their relationship to study drug and considered a DLT. The SP is enrolled in two stages. The first stage enrolls 6 patients (SP1) during which the DLT rate is estimated. The second stage enrolls 9 additional patients to assess the DLT rate if the DLT rate observed in the first stage is > 20%. If the DLT rate lies within the range of 0.0-0.20, then further enrollment in the SP will be closed. If, after enrollment of 15 subjects (SP1 + SP2), the DLT rate is > 20%, then further dose escalation will be undertaken. This phase of the study will be terminated upon the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) when the pre-specified DLT rate for SP has been reached.

This study is powered to meet the DLT rate criterion based on a single dose of each study treatment. In the event of fewer than the total number of patients who consented to enrollment and receive the combination regimen actually receiving the respective study treatments, the upper limit on the DLT rate (1.36) will be adjusted, while still maintaining a 2-sided alpha level for the Stage I design of 0.20.

The proposed intervention is a model of care using technology and navigators for connecting youth ages 13-22 to mental health care and supports. The app is co-created with the community and supported by culturally responsive individuals called family and youth navigators, in schools and primary care clinics. Outcomes are measured using the cascade of care model.",
        "model_output": "Mental health services play a critical role in supporting youth well-being. However, despite the known effectiveness of such services for youth, youth-reported rates of receiving mental health services are relatively low. Moreover, there are racial/ethnic and SES disparities in the rate of engagement in mental health services. One explanation for a lack of access is the lack of connection to providers: referrals to mental health services are not well-matched to youth needs and often fail to engage youth and/or their families in services (i.e., failure to establish a linkage). Furthermore, due to structural racism and socio-economic stress (e.g., poverty, discrimination, trauma), mental health problems may co-occur with physical health illnesses and/or social problems which further complicate engagement with mental health services. The Connected for Wellness (CFW) project is a longitudinal multi-site collaboration to identify, implement, and evaluate innovations in the provision of mental health and social support services to improve access to care for high-risk school age and primary care youth. The CFW model represents a transformative approach to mental health service delivery that promotes linkage to high quality, low-stigma care and services tailored to youth needs. Specifically, The CFW model will bring together community members, youth and families, community institutions such as schools, clinics and government organizations, and policy makers to improve the quality, efficiency and equity of the mental health system. The investigators developed an app-assisted system to link youth with mental health needs to prevention strategies, mental health services, and social support resources. The intervention involves connecting youth in need with a diverse team of certified peer navigators who help support app adoption and engagement. Navigators are trained to be culturally-competent, and can connect youth to both in-person and online resources. Peer navigators support youth to use the CFW app. Through the app, youth complete the UCLA DICE-9 assessment (i.e., the UCLA Development and Interruptive Events Screen 9, a brief mobile mental health screen widely used in community settings), and receive age-targeted psycho-educational and resiliency-based intervention content tailored to their needs. For youth endorsing potential clinical needs, the app also provides them with curated suggestions for both online and in-person mental health services that are specific to their needs. The app can also connect youth to other types of prevention-based interventions for youth mental health, including mindfulness apps, yoga classes, nutrition classes, parenting classes and other community resources. In this study, we propose to test the CFW model in both schools and primary care clinics.

Recent research has shown Egypt to be the third-largest country globally, with an estimated 52% cesarean sections (3). However, the cesarean section has many serious complications, including the primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (4). During labor, the average blood loss is about 300 to 400 ml. Bleeding postpartum is known as losing over five hundred milliliter of blood following a vaginal birth and losing over one thousand milliliter after the cesarean section (5). The prime cause of maternal death rate is postpartum bleeding, predominately in poor countries, and the estimated mortality number due to postpartum bleeding is one hundred thousand per year (6). Therefore, it is essential to reduce bleeding during and after CS to diminish maternal mortality and morbidity (7). The most successful technique for decreasing PPH is the active third stage labor management, requiring prophylactic uterotonic drugs like oxytocin, ergometrine malate, prostaglandins (E1, E2, and F2\u03b1), and combinations of them, or hemostatic agent as tranexamic acid (Kapron) and Etamsylate (Dicynon) (8, 9).",

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in developing countries. Uterotonics are the first-line drugs used to control PPH, even though not all uterotonic drugs are equally effective.\nOxytocin is a natural hormone that stimulates uterine contractions following delivery and is used to prevent bleeding after the delivery. It is the most commonly used uterine stimulant for bleeding after cesarean section. Transfusion risk is associated with postpartum hemorrhage. Blood transfusions are associated with an increased risk due to the shortage of blood in emergencies and the high cost of blood transfusion.

The aim was to describe vaginal microbiome in women with and without a history of infertility. Additionally, vaginal microbiome was assessed in relation to successful implantation in an assisted reproduction treatment (ART) cycle, regardless of pregnancy. The overall conclusion is that vaginal microbiome has a profound influence on the implantation process and the subsequent pregnancy. Furthermore, the results demonstrate how the microbiome is affected by ART interventions in the reproductive process.\nThe vaginal microbiome of women with a history of infertility is more complex, but it has a higher chance to support implantation and the pregnancy that follow. In this group, a diversity was found in the microbiome at baseline. We therefore conclude that a healthy vaginal microbiome is not necessarily the same for all women.

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment. Thus, the role of pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for five days in volunteers undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (BVR) will be investigated in order to verify the vascular expression of SPhk1, transcriptome and vascular proteome remodeling, as well as S1P content in HDL.",

        "summary": "Epidemiological studies have shown that OSA is closely related to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases, especially hypertension. At present, there are 66 million patients with moderate to severe OSA in China, and the current diagnosis and treatment of OSA is mainly completed in the sleep center of the hospital, which is time-consuming and laborious, resulting in the delayed diagnosis and treatment of a large number of patients, making about 80% of potential OSA patients have not been diagnosed and treated in time. With the development of the Internet technologies, telemedicine has been increasingly applied to the diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic diseases with its advantages of convenience, interactivity, efficiency, sharing, coherence and breaking through the limitations of time and space. Our center has initially built a remote diagnosis and treatment management model for OSA. Compared with the traditional medical model, the medical and health economic analysis shows that the OSA diagnosis and treatment model based on telemedicine is more cost-effective, but its clinical efficacy needs to be further verified. Hypertension is a common complication in OSA patients, and continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) has a significant hypertensive effect in the treatment of OSA. However, whether clinical management based on remote diagnosis and treatment mode can achieve the same therapeutic effect as traditional face-to-face diagnosis and treatment mode in improving ambulate blood pressure in OSA patients needs to be further clarified. This study will compare the improvement of ambulatory blood pressure management in patients with hypertension under the new telemedicine mode and the traditional medical mode through a single-center randomized controlled trial, so as to optimize the diagnosis and treatment process of OSA patients with hypertension, establish a more convenient and efficient remote diagnosis and treatment mode with reliable clinical outcome, and provide a theoretical basis for subsequent multi-center research and promotion",
        "model_output": "400-600 (4:1) subjects aged 18-70 with suspected sleep apnea were randomized in the ratio of 1:1 for in-person assessment (control arm) or telemedicine assessment (intervention arm). They will complete a 3-month intervention and will be followed for 1 year. All subjects will have 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (cuff) monitoring at enrollment, at 3months, and then at 6months and 12months. 200-300 subjects with known or suspected cardiovascular disease will be randomized to a separate control group in which the intervention arm consists of the same intervention and outcome measures as the main study, but the intervention will extend for a 5-year study period.\n\nDescription: Cardiovascular complications are well established in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), especially among patients with significant cardiovascular disease. In parallel, recent reports indicate that daytime blood pressure (BP) levels among OSA patients are significantly higher compared with the same population without OSA, and these increased BP levels are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular complications.\nHowever, it is not clear why patients diagnosed with OSA have higher BP levels compared with the same population without OSA, or whether treatment of OSA with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) could influence daytime BP levels. This proposal aims to address these important questions using a clinical trial among patients with known or suspected OSA.\nHypothesis: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is characterized by increased nighttime BP levels due to repeated cycles of breathing cessation, sleep fragmentation, and intermittent hypoxia. Increased nighttime BP levels among OSA patients could be related to increased sympathetic activity leading to increased BP levels during daytime. The study hypothesis is as follows - increased daytime BP levels among patients with OSA are mediated by increased sympathetic activity caused by OSA-related cyclic activation of the sympathetic nervous system. If this hypothesis is confirmed, we expect the following results: (1) OSA and CPAP therapy are strongly related to elevated nighttime BP levels, (2) OSA is not related to elevated daytime BP levels, and (3) elevated nighttime BP levels are mediated by elevated sleep sympathetic activity.\nMethods: A detailed description of the methods has been published elsewhere. In this proposal we will focus on the main objectives and specific aims of the study.\nThe main objective: To study the association between OSA severity and BP response to CPAP treatment.\nThe specific aims: (1) To measure nighttime BP levels at enrollment among patients with severe OSA and the same population without OSA. (2) To measure daytime BP levels at enrollment among patients diagnosed with OSA and the same population without OSA. (3) To evaluate the BP response in the following cohorts: (a) patients with severe OSA not treated with CPAP, (b) patients with severe OSA treated with CPAP over the course of \u2265 1 year, and (c) patients not diagnosed with OSA treated with CPAP over the course of \u2265 1 year. We will use a novel portable wireless BP monitoring system for daytime BP monitoring. (4) To evaluate the effects of CPAP therapy on BP levels during daytime by comparing patients treated (intervention) or not treated with CPAP. (5) To identify the mechanisms underlying changes in BP levels after CPAP therapy. We will use high resolution plasma profiles to identify specific BP regulation pathways and their interaction with OSA and CPAP therapy.\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nIntervention to Improve Hypertension in Obese Children\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nHypertension, Obesity\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: behavioral/lifestyle intervention, including dietary modification\n* Other: pharmacologic intervention\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Children and adolescents (ages 7-18 years) BMI \u2265 age- and sex-specific 95th percentile at enrollment Exclusion Criteria: Medical condition, other behavioral issues or family issues that may interfere with evaluation and completion of the study.

        "summary": "Low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer (LCS) has been shown to reduce lung cancer specific mortality in multiple randomised controlled trials. However, although LDCT screening has been demonstrated to reduce cancer- specific mortality, there remain outstanding questions regarding how screening can be implemented. In particular, indeterminate nodules are common, and can be challenging to distinguish from benign nodules on CT appearances alone. Furthermore, distinguishing cancers which are likely to become clinically significant from those that will remain indolent is challenging, but essential to prevent over-treatment and overdiagnosis. There is significant interest in using a multi-modal approach to LCS, incorporating biomarkers obtained from minimally-invasive samples alongside LDCT to improve ability to recognise clinically-significant lung cancers at an early stage.\nThe Targeted Lung Health Check (TLHC) programme is an NHS programme with the aim of using LDCT screening in appropriately high-risk individuals to improve early diagnosis and survival in lung cancer. The North Central London TLHC programme started in December 2022.\nThe purpose of the ALPINE study is to develop a platform to allow collection of minimally-invasive samples from participants undergoing screening within the North Central London TLHC programme. The use of such biomarkers in the diagnosis of lung cancer is a rapidly developing field and novel techniques and technologies are continuously under development.

With rising tobacco consumption in many countries, the number of current and former smokers in the population is increasing. As the population ages, we expect a rise in the incidence of age-related cancers such as lung cancer.

This is particularly useful when identifying mutations such as EGFR, ALK and ROS-1, which can be targeted by specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, patients not harboring actionable mutations are still deprived of treatment options. Consequently, the development of new biomarkers could lead to a paradigm shift in the clinical management of patients with lung cancer.

To control variability in the intervention sessions, the intervention sessions will be videotaped and then rated for fidelity. A treatment adherence scale was developed that assesses each element of the mindfulness protocol. Rated protocol elements serve to measure the quality and quantity of each session, and are used to determine intervention dose by dividing the fidelity ratings by the number of expected protocol elements in the given session. An MBCT therapist will also rate the participant attendance at the sessions.

        "summary": "In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",
        "model_output": "Background: Primary brain tumors (gliomas) are highly heterogeneous tumors that are often difficult to diagnose accurately with imaging. Identification of biomarkers at diagnosis and during follow-up may aid in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment effectiveness and follow-up monitoring. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive modality that can be used in clinical studies to detect metabolites from tumor tissue which may inform about tumor behavior (e.g. tumor progression or response to treatment). \nAim of this study / Research question: Our aim is to identify MRS biomarkers in high-grade gliomas that are associated with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p19q codeletion, as surrogates for epigenetic alterations (in particular IDH1 mutation and 1p19q codeletion) and chromosomal aberrations. \nRationale: IDH mutations have been found to occur mainly in grade II gliomas. The histological classification of gliomas into grade II/III differs from a molecular or genetic perspective. In particular, IDH1 mutation is common in grade II glioma but only present in a small fraction of grade III gliomas (glioblastomas). Also, the 1p19q codeletion, which is the most common molecular alterations in glioblastomas, is present in less than 10% of grade II gliomas. \nBy integrating MRS analysis and the results of ex vivo genetic profiling of tumor tissue, we expect to be able to characterize IDH mutation status and 1p19q codeletion with a high accuracy. Moreover, we expect that MRS analysis is capable of detecting IDH-related changes (e.g. altered concentrations of 2-hydroxyglutarate) in glioma tumors. \nObjective: The overall objective of this feasibility study is to further optimize our analysis pipeline for the identification of MRS biomarkers by investigating which MRS biomarkers can be used to reliably classify the molecular and genetic characteristics of gliomas.

This deficiency leads to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells, resulting in anemia that may require constant monitoring and care. Effective drug therapies, such as hydroxyurea (HU), act to reduce the clinical severity of the disorder. However, long-term therapy with the antifolate agent, folic acid antagonist (FAA) HU, is associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity and increased sensitivity to its effects. As of the study's inception, patients previously enrolled in HU studies were not permitted to receive thalidomide, a drug approved for treating myelodysplastic syndrome with a low risk of bone marrow aplasia. The initial phase of the study involved using monotherapy for HU, during which its efficacy and safety were evaluated. Once the initial therapeutic response was observed, thalidomide was added to the therapeutic regimen. This study aims to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of HU and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of hydroxyurea and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients. The secondary objective is to examine the effect of long-term therapy with the combination therapy on clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters. Furthermore, XmnI polymorphism will be analyzed in response to combination therapy, and the long-term safety of participants in the trial will be evaluated. The study is designed to enroll 30 patients aged 2 to 50 years with a documented clinical and genetic diagnosis of beta-thalassemia major and intermedia who are not candidates for bone marrow transplantation due to their health status or due to the lack of a suitable donor. The study will follow a single-arm approach, with all participants receiving both HU and thalidomide as a result of the initial 6-month monotherapy. After this initial period, 15 patients with good or partial response to HU alone will be randomized to receive a combined regimen of HU and thalidomide for 6 months, while the remaining 15 patients with poor response to hydroxyurea alone will be assigned to receive the same regimen, but their dose will be increased every 30 days instead of every 3 months. Adverse drug reactions will be recorded and analyzed if thalidomide is discontinued. Safety parameters, such as urea and creatinine levels, liver function tests, and measurements of liver and spleen size, will be consistently monitored and recorded throughout the trial. In addition, XmnI polymorphism will be determined among responders, partial responders, or non-responders who have completed 1-year, 2-years, and 3-years of combination therapy.

        "model_output": "The primary goal of this project is to develop, implement and test a behavioral treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs). It is our hypothesis that the development of healthy alternative actions through the use of personalized avatars will help enhance prospective thinking and delay discounting, which are often impaired processes in individuals with SUDs.\n\nThis study will implement a Virtual Reality (VR) prototype, called the Virtual Reality Avatar (\u201cVR Avatar\u201d), to provide participants with an avatar-based, personalized social environment. In the VR environment each subject\u2019s avatar, which is modeled after their face but is gender neutral, will undergo a series of positive social interactions with the subject. We hypothesize that experiencing a variety of social interactions will help to improve self-reinforcement, increase future time perspective and delay discounting. These changes are predicted to lead to fewer instances of substance use and longer periods of abstinence. In this study, we will investigate whether the VR Avatar intervention will provide effective support in recovery from SUDs. We will examine whether the VR Avatar intervention will (a) lead to reductions in drug use, (b) increase abstinence periods, (c) increase future self-identification, (d) increase future time perspective, (e) improve the ability to resist short-term rewards.\n\nThe secondary goal is to develop a novel computer-vision based avatar system that will help to enhance personalized treatment for behavioral disorders through the use of avatar-based social environments. Our approach is unique in that we can analyze the face of an avatar to understand how to adapt treatment protocols in real-time, rather than relying on subjective reports alone, to ensure the social environmental is sufficiently personalized. We will compare the efficacy of our computer-vision based approach to traditional approaches, which utilize more time-intensive manual procedures to generate new treatments. This approach holds promise for making behavioral therapies more cost-efficient, effective and customizable for the individual user. For instance, participants with certain facial features could be provided with personalized treatments to manage negative emotions or to delay the urge to consume drugs. These personalized treatments could be implemented in VR, mobile or video gaming environments.\n\nIn this study, we will compare the efficacy of two approaches to delivering the VR Avatar treatment. One of the approaches will utilize a manual avatar creation process (the manual group), while the other will utilize a computer-vision based avatar creation process (the automated group). We expect that the automated group will receive more personalized and responsive treatment than the manual group, leading to better outcomes in reducing drug use, increasing abstinence periods, and changing behavioral risk factors (e.g., impaired self-regulation, prospective temporal processing). We hypothesize that these outcomes will lead to improved outcomes in reducing the risk of relapse and increasing engagement in treatment.\n\nIn summary, through this study, we will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that govern changes in prospective thinking, impaired self-regulation, and risk-taking behavior in substance use disorders. We will also examine whether a personalized VR Avatar treatment will lead to improved outcomes in these risk factors, which will provide important insights for the development of more effective and personalized behavioral treatments for substance use disorders.

        "summary": "Despite progress in chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still the only curative procedure for some hematological malignancies. The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old. The co-transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) at the time of transplantation has previously shown a double interest in GvHD immunomodulation and hematopoiesis support. Pre-clinical studies (in mice) have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from Wharton's Jelly reduce the incidence of GvHD when the infusions are weekly repeated.

Additionally, we will also evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting ASSET-PPD and collect formative feedback from the fathers and mothers to improve ASSET-PPD and ensure that the needs of the families are met. We plan to enroll 50 parent dyads (100 individuals total, 25 romantic or non-romantic partners per arm). Our study will have 3 phases to assess the feasibility, recruitment, and acceptability of the ASSET-PPD intervention in the target population. During Phase I (Feasibility and Acceptability), we will conduct focus groups to obtain feedback about ASSET-PPD as a delivery format. During Phase II (Recruitment and Satisfaction), we will randomize 25 parent dyads with a mother who is receiving individual treatment outside of the study and the father is receiving the ASSET-PPD training; data collection will occur for 12-months. During Phase III (Clinical Efficacy), we anticipate that ASSET-PPD will reduce maternal depressive symptoms in a sample of 25 parent dyads with a mother who is receiving individual treatment outside of the study and the father is receiving the ASSET-PPD training; data collection will occur for 12-months. Outcomes: Our outcomes of interest include maternal depression, anxiety, parent-infant interactions, and breastfeed initiation. This study has the potential to impact maternal mental health by supporting and strengthening the familial bond between parents and children.\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\nJiajia Xu, Ph.D.",

Depression is associated with significant adverse personal, medical, and health systems outcomes. However, psychotherapy and psychoeducation related to depression among patients with cancer are not widely available. Mobile apps have been found to improve depressive symptoms in individuals in general, with positive results for both non-depressed and depressed. METHODS/DESIGN: To address the challenges of disseminating depression treatment to cancer survivors, we propose to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of a proactive digital mental health intervention targeting individuals with depressive symptoms within an academic cancer center. Over 12 months we plan to randomize 80 Illic patients with depressive symptoms to either a control (TAU) or Moodivate (mHealth treatment) group. Participants in both groups will be provided with questionnaires every 2 weeks for three months and monthly for six months in order to track changes in depressive symptoms, physical, psychological, and social wellbeing, and resource use. Participants who are assigned to Moodivate will be asked to use the app at least once per day from baseline (time of enrollment) to 12 weeks from enrollment.

This material is still in its evolution phase and has yet to reach a clear statement regarding its safety and acceptability. This study aims to collect enough evidence to support its use in children. METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study was designed to determine the prevalence of early childhood caries, its associated risk factors and to evaluate the acceptability of SDF when used as a caries preventive and arrestive material. A sample of 887 children was selected to estimate the prevalence of early childhood caries, and 159 children were selected to test the efficacy of SDF as a caries preventive and arrestive material. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of early childhood caries (dmfs) was 77.17% and significantly higher in low-income families. The caries incidence score was much higher in the low-income group than in the middle- and high- income groups, while the caries arrest index score was significantly high in the middle- and high- income groups but lower in the low-income group. The acceptability score of SDF application was not significantly different among the different groups. CONCLUSION: Low income families were at a higher risk of having severe early childhood caries whereas middle and high income families were at a higher risk of developing new caries lesions. SDF application was acceptable by almost all parents and SDF was clinically efficient as caries preventive and arrestive agent except for one child. These findings will hopefully allow clinicians to reach out confidently to parents of children with early childhood caries to choose this alternative and potentially cost effective preventive and arrestive material.\n\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nEarly Childhood Caries\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: Silver Diamine Fluoride\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Children with early childhood caries Children with with cavitated lesions with active caries Children with no clinical signs of pulp involvement Exclusion Criteria: Children with grossly broken down teeth Children with teeth with more than one third of the crown missing Children with pulpally involved teeth (with pulp exposure, presence of an abscess or a sinus) Children with obvious discoloration, and abnormal mobility\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nMinimum Age: 3 Years\nMaximum Age: 5 Years\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nAll\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n-----------------\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\nHow is the study designed?\n-----------------\n\nArms and Interventions\n\n| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |\n| --- | --- |\n| Active Comparator: Study 1<br>Children who receive a single application of 38% SDF | Drug: Silver Diamine Fluoride<br>* A colourless solution known with its alkaline nature; it simply consists of a union of silver, fluoride and ammonia.

Color selection in the clinic is a very sensitive process and is affected by environmental factors and operator-related variables. This has led to the development of single-color universal composite resins that aim to facilitate color selection. These materials have a universal opacity and several Vita shades and are recommended by manufacturers to be used in a single color layer that can match different tooth colors. In recent years, monochromatic universal composites have been developed that are supposed to be compatible with all Vita Classic Scale shades from A1 to D4. Manufacturers report that single-color universal composites can be applied to teeth of all colors without using the layering technique using different color composites.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to compare the clinical performance of 2 different single-color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions with the control group (Filtek Z250, 3M), which is a multi-color composite resin material, using modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) and World Dental Federation (FDI) criteria.",

        "summary": "Up to 60% of endometrial cancer cases are attributed to obesity, in part because obesity promotes development of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), and up to 40% of women with AEH go on to develop endometrial cancer. The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment. It is the hypothesis that premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer who desire uterine preservation will be more likely to have atypia-free uterine preservation at two years if they receive progestin in combination with a behavioral weight loss intervention versus progestin plus enhanced usual care.",

This clear identification of the confluence between the cystic duct and the body of the gallbladder represents the way to determine if the procedure was safely completed using the current technique. After successful identification, the cystic duct was clipped. The gallbladder can then be lifted and turned over, leaving the unidentified CBD untouched, and cholecystectomy can be carefully performed as usual. The inflamed posterior wall remained attached to the gallbladder bed of the liver. The results of the procedure in the three initially cases treated showed an easy mobilization of the gallbladder with this method. The cholecystectomies were uneventful in two of them. The third patient had to be converted to open cholecystectomy due to small gallstones trapped within the gallbladder fossa.

With the characteristics of easily learning, internal and external training, and individualised treatment of tumours, this series of routines effectively combines traditional oriental Tai Chi martial arts with tumour treatment, which opens up a beautiful and mysterious oriental healing journey for integrative medicine.",

However, the postoperative recovery process is slow, and the incidence of complications such as infection of the surgical site, respiratory failure, delirium, etc. is high. Analgesia is the most effective measure to reduce pain and accelerate the rehabilitation process and recovery after surgery.\nIn recent years, ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia has achieved good clinical effectiveness and rapid recovery in the postoperative analgesia process. At present, interfascial (IF) block and erector spinae (ESP) plane block are widely used for surgical analgesia in clinical practice. However, few studies have used IF block and ESP block for postoperative analgesia after lumbar spinal surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to compare the clinical analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided lumbar IF block and ESP block for postoperative analgesia after lumbar spinal surgery. Secondly, we will make further recommendations for the implementation of nerve block in the perioperative period.\n1.2\tSignificance \nUltrasound-guided regional anesthesia is a form of regional anesthesia (RA) after the development of nerve stimulation and nerve ultrasound guidance, which can improve the success and safety rate of regional anesthesia. This trial focuses on postoperative lumbar interfascial block and erector spinae plane block in the perioperative period, which is an important part of the anesthesia plan for lumbar spinal fusion surgery.\nAlthough ultrasound-guided nerve block reduces the incidence of intraoperative adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory failure, and so on, but there is lack of evidence to clarify the clinical effects of these three regional analgesia methods. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct relevant research.\n2.\tHypothesis\nThe postoperative analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided lumbar interfascial (IF) block is better than that of ultrasound-guided lumbar erector spinae (ESP) plane block in the perioperative period for patients with lumbar spinal fusion surgery.\n2.1\tEthical considerations\nThis study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki.

During the calibration period, MABOS will be used to measure the same three wavelengths of light utilized by the Ocean HR2 XR Spectrometer (410, 660, and 940 nm). After the calibration period, all participants will be asked to perform the following procedure 5 times as part of the testing period: a deep inhalation lasting no longer than 10 seconds, followed by a slow exhalation lasting no longer than 30 seconds. Between each trial, a five-minute break will be required. For the entire testing period, all two devices will be continuously acquiring data. After this testing period, all two devices will continue taking measurements until 90 minutes have elapsed. Skin integrity will be examined before spectrometer use, after spectrometer use, after the calibration period, every 30 minutes after the start of the testing period, and after the testing period. During the study, if the participants report any uncomfortable feeling and/or pain or if a change to the skin at the site of device placement occurs, the measurements will be discontinued, and all the devices placed on the participants will be removed. Questionnaires will be provided after the study period and during follow-up visits approximately 48 hours and 96 hours post the device testing visit for a proof-of-concept evaluation of the safe wearability.",

Recruitment is planned to begin in August 2022.\n\nWhen will it start?\n=================\nRecruitment has commenced, and the study is ongoing.\n\nHow will it be designed?\n=================\nThis is a randomized phase I study.\n\nThe study is a randomized (2:1 ratio), parallel arm, open label, single-site study, where participants will either receive tadalafil or matched placebo.\n\nHow does it work?\n=================\nTadalafil will be administered in a dose of 5 mg twice daily. A separate matched placebo will be dosed in a similar manner to the tadalafil. The sequence of participants, in either the tadalafil or the placebo group, will be determined by randomization.\n\nIn order to increase the likelihood of achieving the sample size to run the phase II/III trial with a suitable number of participants, 30 participants will be recruited for this phase I trial: 20 participants to receive tadalafil and 10 participants to receive placebo.\n\nWhat is being tested?\n=================\nTadalafil is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of Erectile Dysfunction. It is available as a 5 mg tablet (dose in participants).\n\nTadalafil is an inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase type five (PDE5) enzyme and has multiple functions in the body including smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilatation. This has been leveraged for erectile dysfunction in men. PDE5 is a widely expressed enzyme in the body, and there are many other effects of its inhibition that researchers aim to harness for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as pulmonary hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer, all of which are known indications for the use of tadalafil.\n\nWhat does this involve?\n=================\nParticipants will have the following study visits:\n\u2022\tScreening visit (1-3 weeks prior to start of trial)\n\u2022\tTrial visit 1 (Day -1)\n\u2022\tTrial visit 2 (Day 0 - start of trial administration)\n\u2022\tTrial visit 3 (Day 7)\n\u2022\tTrial visit 4 (Day 14)\n\u2022\tTrial visit 5 (Day 28)\n\u2022\tTrial visit 6 (Day 84)\n\n\nHow long will it last?\n=================\nParticipants will be in the study for 6 hours on 3 occasions (Trial visit 2, 4 & 6).\n\nWho are the participants?\n=================\nUp to 30 male participants aged 30 years or older will be recruited.\n\nThe study entry and safety criteria can be found in the trial protocol in the trial registry: https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12621001686416.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\n=================\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and PK profile of tadalafil in healthy male participants who are not on blood pressure medication.\n\nPotential risks for the participants include:\n\u2022      A low risk of experiencing adverse events while on study drug\n\u2022      Risk of experiencing minor discomfort for some procedures e.g. blood draws and nasal swabs\n\u2022      Blood pressure measurement\n\nThe risks of taking part in the PK component include:\n\u2022",

        "summary": "Sleep of critically ill patients is highly disturbed with a high sleep fragmentation; patients spend most of their sleep in very short sleep episodes, lasting less than 10 minutes. Causes of theses sleep alterations are complex including environmental noise (alarms, beepers, conversations\u2026), continuous light, nurse care and repetitive measures of vital parameters.\nNumerous studies have reported a relationship between severe sleep alterations and a prolonged weaning period and mortality. Improving sleep quality in critically ill patients is a major challenge to promote ICU patient's recovery.\nA very promising treatment is the application of a nocturnal  quiet-time  during which non urgent care, comfort care, systematic measures of vital parameters are delayed and clustered in order to limit room entries. However,  quiet time  procedures have failed to improve sleep quality to date.\nA miniaturized medical device recording one EEG channel and embedding an automated sleep scoring algorithm running in real-time was devised. This device (positioned on forehead, and continuously recording noise and light levels) indicates if the patient is awake or asleep using a tablet positioned at doorstep of the room, so that nurses know if patient is sleeping, without entering the room.\nHypothesis proposes that applying sleep protection procedures (clustering cares, limiting room entries, reducing lights and noise, delaying non urgent care\u2026) when patients are sleeping (= EEG-guided strategies) will increase patients sleep quality.\nThis study will assess the effect of such device on sleep quality in ICU patients. This is a before / after design. The first group (control group), will be recorded but the sleep scoring will not be displayed by the tablet and patient will be expose to standard care. Then, procedure will be established collegially with nurses, nurses assistants and doctors. Then, the second group (treated group) will be recorded with the device displaying the status of the patient (asleep/awake) and all caregivers will be asked to follow the established rules (EEG-guided sleep protection rules)",
        "model_output": "INTRODUCTION: Sleep quality and duration is reduced in critically ill patients and has been associated with poor clinical outcomes [1, 2]. Sleep disturbance is multifactorial and includes both endogenous factors such as circadian disruption and neuroendocrine alterations, and exogenous factors such as invasive devices, sleep environment and environmental noise.\nNocturnal care is essential and recommended for critically ill patients. Moreover, nocturnal care in the ICU is associated with patient agitation and delirium. However, most studies about sleep protection and interventions to reduce noise have been conducted in pediatric patients, and the effectiveness of most interventions in adults remains unclear [3].\nEEG-guided protection procedure: An algorithm has been developed from machine learning in healthy volunteer and patients in medical ICU to prioritize sleep  at low risk for the patient. \n\n\nScientific background\n-----------------\nStudies on sleep quality of hospitalized critically ill patients\nMost studies report that critical illness is associated with reduced sleep quality. Indeed, sleep is disrupted by interruptions and caregivers entries or by the environment (light, noise, pain\u2026etc). In some studies patients display poor subjective sleep quality, whereas in others, objective sleep quality is affected with a high number of arousals [4, 5]. Other studies using EEG, demonstrated that a severe decrease in sleep quality is present and appears early after admission [6, 7].\nThe prevalence of delirium during critical illness may exceed 80 % in some populations [8].  It also has been established that sleep deprivation may be a risk factor for delirium [9]. Some studies suggest that sleep disruption, defined as prolonged arousal, also was a risk factor in critically ill patients for delirium [10, 11]. \nImpact of sleep disruption on outcomes: \nThe poor sleep quality experienced by ICU patients may impair ventilator weaning and extubation success rate. \nThe impact of sleep quality on mortality is also poorly known. Two post-hoc meta-analyses demonstrated that shorter sleep duration was associated with a higher mortality risk in intensive care unit (ICU) (RR 1.58 , CI : 1.06 -2.35 ). However, these results were derived from a small sample from studies which were conducted in the 90s .\n\n\nImpact of noise on the patient\nNocturnal noise in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a common complaint of both patient and staff . Noise in the ICU has been correlated with a delayed recovery of sleep and a higher incidence of critical illness myopathy . \nThe impact of noise on critical illness myopathy in ICU is poorly investigated but some randomized trial suggest that noise may increase the severity and delay the recovery of this disease .\n\n\nImpact of noise on healthcare professionals\nNocturnal noise and sleep disruption have also had a profound negative influence on nursing and physicians\u2019 health. As an example, a 62% lower risk of hearing loss was found in ICU nurses who reported to work less than two or 3 nights per week, versus those who reported to work 4 or more nights per week . A cross-sectional survey of 650 physicians in 78 intensive care units has found that almost 50% of physicians reported that they experienced stress when caring for critically ill, mechanically ventilated, patients in intensive care unit (ICU) . Therefore, there is a critical need for strategies to protect caregivers\u2019 and patients\u2019 rest.\n\n\nInnovation\nBased on previous data collected in healthy volunteers, we developed an algorithm from machine learning that can predict sleep disruption during night. This algorithm use the electroencephalography (EEG) of the patients to estimate the risk of sleep disruption. A previous study has demonstrated that patients presenting with a high risk of sleep disruption can be identified from EEG prior to the occurrence of any discontinuity of sleep. The risk assessment has been validated in two groups of patients (with and without sedation). This is a major innovation because the study showed the feasibility of sleep protection with the EEG of the patients and this study also assessed the feasibility of sleep measurements in real life conditions. It was the first study to combine sleep measurement with EEG.\nOur objective is to implement this innovative diagnostic procedure on the bedside of critically ill patients to perform an EEG-guided sleep protection.\n\n\nEthics\n\nThis study has been approved by French Ethics Authority (CPP 2020 Ouest II",

        "model_output": "1. Research objectives: Endocalyx is a seaweed derived dietary supplement aimed at restoring a healthy glycocalyx layer on the endothelium which has been shown to be impaired in chronic heart failure. The first aim of the project is to evaluate whether daily intake of Endocalyx will restore a healthy glycocalyx in heart failure patients. The second aim is to evaluate whether Endocalyx will reduce clinical symptoms of sodium overload in patients with chronic heart failure. The third aim is to evaluate how Endocalyx modulates the glycocalyx in heart failure patients.\n2. Background information: Chronic heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by reduced cardiac output and blood flow, leading to excessive fluid accumulation, and reduced blood flow to tissues and organs, including brain, skin, and kidneys.(1, 2) In patients with congestive heart failure, sodium and water excess develop. Sodium accumulates in heart failure patients due to an imbalance between renal sodium excretion and dietary sodium intake, and subsequent increased sodium levels in blood. This has several pathophysiological and structural manifestations; for instance, in heart failure patients the renal sodium leak and endothelial dysfunction increases, contributing to a further reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). As a result, the sodium and water retention worsens.\n3. Significance of the research: Endocalyx is a dietary supplement developed to restore a healthy glycocalyx layer on the endothelium. Glycocalyx is the protective coat of endothelial cells that is known for several beneficial biological functions; (i) glycocalyx plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and vascular function. A healthy glycocalyx layer is important for endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) production. NO regulates sodium and water excretion and the peripheral vasculature; (ii) glycocalyx regulates sodium and water retention, and controls immune function and inflammation. As a result, a healthy glycocalyx layer may help to improve (or prevent) endothelial dysfunction, heart failure-related sodium overload, reduced GFR and inflammation. Heart failure-related sodium overload and inflammation contribute to the worsening of cardiac, kidney and skin function which are hallmarks of HF.\n4. Proposed scientific solutions: We expect Endocalyx to exert beneficial effects on the glycocalyx in patients with chronic heart failure. The primary objective of the study is therefore to evaluate whether daily administration of Endocalyx for 8 weeks will restore a healthy glycocalyx in heart failure patients. The secondary objective is to evaluate whether daily administration of Endocalyx will reduce clinical symptoms of sodium overload including peripheral edema, hypertension and a reduced compliance. The tertiary objective is to evaluate how Endocalyx modulates the glycocalyx in heart failure patients.\n6.

        "summary": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is one of the most common causes of serious gastrointestinal disease in the US. Adhesion-related SBO (aSBO) is usually treated by the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) to decompress the stomach, administration of intravenous (IV) fluids and observation by a surgical team.\nThe purpose of this feasibility study is to determine the potential for implementation of treatment protocols for aSBO and determine the feasibility of randomizing patients with aSBO to receive or not receive NGTs or water-soluble contrast (WSC). The investigators will also determine the ability to measure HRQOL as a main outcome for the treatment of aSBO. The studies outlined in this research program intend to address gaps in knowledge about how to determine who benefits from NGT placement, who can be managed without them, how to objectively determine when a bowel obstruction has resolved, how to reintroduce feeding to patients with aSBO, what criteria should be used for hospital discharge and what role cathartics such as WSC contrast have in the management of aSBO.\nThis feasibility study will enroll a limited number of patients (n=40) who will be followed for up to 30 days.",
        "model_output": "Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) is common in the postoperative period, with an incidence rates of up to 7% in some surgical centers. It is characterized as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting in patients who have undergone a prior abdominal operation. Early diagnosis and treatment is important since delayed diagnosis and treatment are strongly associated with longer length of stay (LOS) and increased morbidity. Treatment consists of supportive care (fluid resuscitation, analgesia) with correction of electrolyte abnormalities as needed. Nasogastric tube placement in patients suspected to have SBO is recommended to prevent gastric distention. A 38ml nasogastric tube (NG tube) is inserted following infiltration of local anesthetics with or without sedation. The NG tube can be used to decompress the stomach and small bowel, which increases patient comfort. The NG tube has also been used to administer oral agents (pregabalin, ondansetron, dexamethasone) and medications such as water-soluble contrast and metoclopramide. However, routine use of water-soluble contrast (WSC) and metoclopramide is not standard of care and has been studied in few small studies with mixed results. WSC is used to obtain the necessary contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) image to confirm presence of an abnormality responsible for bowel obstruction. By obtaining the information of which area of bowel is obstructed, the operator may be guided to perform a more conservative incision for the treatment of the SBO. Metoclopramide increases motility by a variety of mechanisms and helps reduce symptoms of obstruction (nausea and vomiting). This study aims to identify the role of NGT and water-soluble contrast in patients with clinically suspected SBO.",

        "summary": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health threat in China. At present, a functional cure, also known as clinical cure or sustained Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, is recommended as the ideal endpoint of HBV treatment. However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection. In this study, a large multicenter prospective study will be performed to explore the safety and efficacy of a novel combination strategy involving immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 antibody) and IFN\u03b1 in CHB patients, observe the HBsAg loss rate in NA-treated CHB patients receiving this combination strategy, evaluate the potential of breaking immune tolerance by this strategy, and further assess its efficacy to further improve the clinical cure rate on the basis of New Switch Study. Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients. The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the burden of HBV infection in China and contribute to the goal of global elimination of hepatitis B and C by 2030 (WHO 2030).",

Causes of poor sperm DNA integrity include unhealthy lifestyles such as smoking and exposure to gonadotoxins, as well as, obesity, varicoceles, infections, advanced paternal age and systemic disorders. An increase in DNA fragmentation in sperm has been linked to lower fertilisation rate, poorer quality embryos, lower pregnancy rate, and high miscarriages rate.\nThe best way for sperm selection and processing in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) should be noninvasive and cost-effective. It should also make it possible to identify high-quality spermatozoa and produce more favorable results in terms of pregnancy and live birth rates.7 Meanwhile, the microfluidic sperm separation technology is a less expensive and less invasive alternative.

Mild treatment or testicular sperm extraction might potentially improve the results in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation, since they usually have poor semen features and retrieval of sperm through testicular aspiration is beneficial for successful fertilization.  Objective of the study: The aim of the study is to compare clinical outcomes between testicular sperm aspiration (TESA)-ICSI and microfluidic sperm separation device (Zymot) - ICSI (MSS-ICSI), using fresh ejaculate (TE) from men with high sperm DNA fragmentation.  Study Design: TESA-ICSI group will consist of couples who were recruited to the study by our center to receive a fresh ICSI cycle.  Zymot-ICSI groupwill included patients using the microfluidic device for selecting sperm with lower DNA fragmentation that were undergoing a ICSI cycle. Zymot device extract sperm with motility and low DNA fragmentation, resulting in better outcome compare to TESA-ICSI.

Study Time: Couples who completed a TESA-ICSI or Zymot-ICSI cycle in our center within six years before the study was initiated were included in the study. Primary Outcome Measures: The primary outcome in our study is clinical pregnancy rate comparing between TE using TESA-ICSI vs. Zymot-ICSI.

The drug used in this study (istradefylline) has been prescribed off-label for years to individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and recently was approved as a PD medication as the first medication shown to affect and slow progression of this disease. However, as with any drug of this type, it is important to characterize the potential side effect as it relates to its main targets of receptors that affect movement. The PD medication (istardefylline) we propose to study, works at some of the same systems as caffeine (e.g., adenosine and dopamine receptors). Therefore, the study of caffeine can help inform our understanding of the PD drug (istardefylline) and its potential side effects.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nElderly individuals, such as those over age 80, are commonly exposed to both caffeine and istradefylline as the two treatments are routinely prescribed to manage different conditions affecting movement. In contrast to healthy young adults, older adults exhibit significant age-related decline in cognitive, perceptual, and motor performance, including a decrease in the ability to maintain attention to multiple tasks over a period of time without significant degradation in overall performance. This deficit in selective attention is likely, at least in part, due to a decline in the ability of older adults to maintain synchronized, coordinated neural activity in the face of challenging multi-tasking conditions. This deficit makes older adults particularly susceptible to adverse outcomes associated with both multi-tasking and sleep deprivation, as these conditions require an individual to maintain selective attention for long periods of time despite increased demands on sensory systems and a need to maintain adequate levels of alertness. Given that individuals commonly take medications (e.g., caffeine and istradefylline) to compensate for symptoms of diminished alertness and sleep-deprivation, it's important to determine the impact of these medications on individual performance and the integrity of their neural systems. Specifically, the investigators propose to determine the effects of caffeine on selective attention in older adults by measuring brain connectivity and its association with performance both at rest and during a difficult multi-modal attention task.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nThe Effect of Adenosine A2a Receptor Antagonism on Brain Connectivity\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nMovement Disorders, Parkinson's Disease\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Drug: caffeine\n* Drug: placebo\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: -Healthy between the ages of 60 and 85 -Informed Consent Documentation before testing procedures Exclusion Criteria: -Inability to meet the pre-screening conditions -Including, but not limited to: any medical conditions that would compromise the ability to participate in testing, any history of brain, eye or ear trauma, or any history of psychoactive drug use. -Including, but not limited to: benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, any SSRI/SNRI medications, any beta blocker medications, any anti-cholinergic",

The occurrence of PPCs after surgery is affected by many factors, such that there are many ways in which they can be prevented. We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized study to evaluate the effect of the addition of a 12-hour preoperative regimen of intravenous albuterol and ipratropium on the incidence of PPCs in patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery for cancer. We are planning to perform this trial again, using the same protocol, at our institution. Research Questions: Can we further reduce the incidence of PPCs after laparoscopic or open gastrectomy or pancreatic surgery by adding this IV regimen to that prescribed by the Surgeon General of the United States Army? Methods: Prospective, double-blinded, randomized study using 12-hour preoperative regimen of intravenous albuterol and ipratropium versus no preoperative prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrectomy or pancreatic surgery for cancer. The investigators hypothesize that the 12-hour preoperative intravenous regimen of albuterol and ipratropium will reduce the incidence of PPCs in patients undergoing laparoscopic or open gastrectomy or pancreatic surgery for cancer. Design: Single center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized study. The investigators will randomize 100 patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery for cancer who are scheduled to begin their general anesthesia within 60 minutes of initial arrival to the preoperative holding area to the 12-hour preoperative IV regimen containing albuterol and ipratropium or to no preoperative prophylaxis. The statistical analysis plan includes an interim analysis after enrollment of forty patients with type1 error protection using the O'Brien-Fleming method. The investigators anticipate enrollment of 96 patients.

        "summary": "More than 30% of Black women with obesity binge eat. Binge eating may increase the risk for the development of metabolic syndrome and binge-eating-disorder (BED), which is associated with severe obesity. Though several effective treatments for binge eating exist, Black women have not fared well. Not only has their inclusion in treatment trials been limited, but when participating, they are more likely to drop out, and/or lose less weight, compared to their White counterparts. Furthermore, treatment for binge eating is often not available in primary care and community-based settings places where Black women are more likely to receive treatment for their eating and weight-related concerns. Currently, there is scant intervention research to treat binge eating in Black women. With the highest rates of obesity (57%) nationally, Black women are in need of culturally-relevant treatments for binge eating and weight gain prevention. Given the established relationship between frequent binge eating and subsequent weight gain, addressing binge eating among Black women with obesity is imperative.",

However, limited data are available that have examined the potential performance enhancing effect of beetroot juice in resistance exercise. Moreover, there is no information on the dose of nitrate required for performance enhancing effects during resistance exercise which limits its widespread use to enhance performance. Therefore, the investigators will assess if supplementing the diet with nitrate-rich beetroot juice impacts resistance exercise performance (e.g., power, velocity), when compared to supplementing the diet with nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (i.e. placebo). The investigators will also investigate the dose-response effect of beetroot juice on resistance exercise performance by providing a low, moderate, and high nitrate dose of concentrated beetroot juice. The results of this study will improve understanding of whether beetroot juice influences resistance exercise performance and will provide insight on whether different doses of beetroot juice influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation on resistance exercise performance. Together, these data will guide supplementation strategies for enhancing resistance exercise performance.",

Orthodontic appliances, poor oral hygiene habits, and malocclusion have an important effect in keeping dental plaque and in causing oral health problems. In addition, the oral problems associated with these disorders are also associated with other systemic problems. The evaluation of children's plaque removal efficacy has become one of the most important issues in modern dentistry. Plaque removal by children is as important as proper and continuous oral care is by their parents. Children with special health care needs are more likely to experience systemic, social, and emotional problems. In children with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), these problems may arise. Many studies emphasize that regular oral care should be ensured during the early life period. Because the period when the first permanent molars erupt is the most important period for children when it comes to maintaining the structure of the dental arch and controlling dental caries. It has been reported in the literature that many children who suffer from dental caries also have ADHD. Children with special health care needs tend to have more oral health problems. Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common and complex behavioral and developmental disorders that increase children's risk of oral health problems.

Evidence shows that persons with obesity are 5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared with normal-weight individuals and people with obesity spend on average $1500 more per year on chronic diseases and related treatments, compared with people with a healthy weight. People with obesity experience numerous barriers to effective management of their weight and underlying comorbidities. Effective treatments to support these patients, in particular those people who are overweight, need to be both effective and easily accessible, and to accommodate their other health priorities and other life priorities. Current treatment models that support people with obesity to manage their condition are based primarily on in-person contact. These approaches include a variety of lifestyle-based interventions that have been demonstrated to induce reductions in weight and improvements in comorbid conditions in people with obesity. These lifestyle interventions can be highly effective and are well-tolerated in motivated individuals, however, many people with obesity have difficulties sustaining these changes because current lifestyle interventions require individuals to have a high level of intrinsic motivation. Individuals also often need practical and emotional support to implement changes within their complex lifestyle contexts and to maintain these changes over time. Furthermore, given the substantial number of individuals with obesity, it is challenging for lifestyle interventions to be accessible and affordable to all persons in need. The overall goal of this project is to enhance the metabolic care of people with obesity by establishing an accessible, scalable, and high-quality metabolic care model. Metaplan will accomplish this goal through an iterative development process that combines (i) the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), (ii) behavioural science theories to optimize treatment personalization, and (iii) rapid cycle evaluation methods for continuous improvement. This collaborative project consists of six participating centres: the Obesity Centre of British Columbia (Obesity Centre), the Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control (Centre), the Centre for Health Evaluation & Outcome Sciences (CH\u00c9OS) (CH\u00c9OS), the Institute for Health Economics (IHE), the Centre for Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis Research & Management (CHKOR) (CHKOR), the Institute of Health Research at the Faculty of Medicine (IHRe FM), and the Centre for Community Research (Centre). The Centre is affiliated with both the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Health Sciences. (ii) the Centre for Clinical Research and the School of Public Health (Centre). The IHE is located on the campus of the Simon Fraser University (SFU). (iii) IHE is affiliated with both the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Applied Sciences). (iv) CHKOR is a research centre at Simon Fraser University (SFU). (v) IHRe FM located on SFU's campus. (vi) Centre is located on the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) campus.\n2. The nature of the health condition of the subjects/patients/population: People living with obesity have experienced, or are at risk of experiencing, one or more health complications, including cardiovascular problems, sleep apnea, depression, and cancer. A recent Canadian community-based study found that one-in-three people living with obesity experienced at least one obesity-related cancer, compared with people with a healthy weight. Furthermore, people with obesity often struggle with other chronic diseases and mental health issues. It is estimated that over half of Canadian adults with obesity are living with one or more comorbid chronic diseases. The economic cost of obesity is also high for individuals and for society. Canadian adults with obesity spend on average $1,500 more per year on medical services and on prescription drugs compared with people with a healthy weight. Together, these health consequences and financial burdens place people with obesity at risk of poorer health and quality of life outcomes and poorer financial outcomes. For people with obesity, there often exists a substantial gap between their unmet care needs and the current metabolic care that is available to them.\nPeople living with obesity often experience a range of societal barriers such as the stigma associated with being seen having an appointment for \"excessive\" weight. These social factors contribute to the difficulties people experience when accessing healthcare services for obesity and in sustaining weight loss. The goal of this project is to address these unmet care needs by providing people living with obesity with a tailored care plan that meets their specific health and social needs.\n3.

        "summary": "Over 65% of all lung cancer patients experience significant weight loss fuelled by a catabolic state that is represented by enhanced protein breakdown. The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period. The secondary aim is to investigate the feasibility for the subjects to comply with the study protocol. Lastly, the investigators aim to study the feasibility of gathering data on a number of exploratory parameters that may link nutritional intake to clinically relevant outcomes.",

This study was initially designed to have a standard of care chemotherapy arm (Paclitaxel and Carboplatin) in addition to a control arm without nutritional intervention.  Enrollment did not demonstrate adequate accrual.  As a result, at this time the study is being amended to an observational study design only in participants receiving anti-PDL1 therapy. Participants with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC who are >18 years of age and who have not received prior systemic therapy treatment for advanced NSCLC will be enrolled.  At the time of recruitment, participants will be randomized to receive either the nutritional intervention or standard of care therapy without nutritional intervention.  All participants will undergo standard of care anticancer therapy.  The nutritional intervention arm will receive 2 bottles of protein/carbohydrate enriched beverage product for 12 weeks in addition to anticancer therapy.  The standard of care arm will only undergo anticancer therapy.  In order to standardize outcomes, the investigators will use standard of care laboratory assays to evaluate the clinical outcomes in each arm of the study by comparing baseline value measurements to post-study value measurements.  As participants will be observed but not randomized, there is the possibility of confounding bias. \n\n \nObjective: \n-----------------\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of this nutritional intervention by evaluating patient recruitment, adherence, and compliance. \n\n \nEligibility: \n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: \n1.

While 23andMe may not be able to offer definitive answers regarding a person\u2019s genetic predisposition to a particular condition, they can provide important information that will guide a person\u2019s approach towards understanding their risk, as well as informing conversations with their physicians. This type of information can be used to empower individuals with more knowledge about their personal genetic risks, which also has an effect on the decision to follow preventative health measures, such as getting tested and seeing a medical professional. 23andMe has an important place in the genetics industry, for providing individuals with information about their genetic predispositions at a very low cost, and in the medical industry, as PG reports may be useful to physicians, as well as individuals. To enable this goal more effectively, it may be beneficial for patients to receive information from their physicians in addition to PG reports.\nIn order for the information provided by 23andMe to be more useful to patients, it is necessary to consider whether they will make lifestyle changes in response to PG test results. Since 23andMe provides an opportunity to receive information about genetic predispositions and risks for a broad spectrum of condition and disease, it is necessary to assess whether individuals will be motivated to follow preventative measures. A PG report may be informative in prompting a discussion between a patient and physician regarding genetic risk for conditions and diseases, motivating a person to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and even informing physician treatment practices. \nIt appears that the information provided by 23andMe is useful to the patients who receive PG test results. In fact, PG tests seem to be useful for patients who are otherwise in the dark about their susceptibility to developing a particular condition or disease, since it provides them with an opportunity to know more about themselves, and to take control of their genetic information and health. Since PG reports provide an opportunity to inform doctors, other patients, and family members, it is imperative that a PG test is used appropriately since it can be a powerful tool for improving the health of an individual, as well as their quality of life.",

Pixantrone (100 mg/m2) or a dose-intensive treatment regimen (either 360 mg/m2 prednisolone equivalent on day 1 of each cycle or 100 mg/m2 prednisolone equivalent on days 1-3 of each cycle given during alternating 28-day cycles) will be administered on days 1-5 and 35-39 of a 56 day cycle without concomitant anthracycline therapy for at least 4 cycles to patients with newly-diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The study will assess toxicity, disease-free survival rate, overall response rate, event free survival, and overall survival.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nChildren with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a variety of other malignancies have responded favorably to pixantrone in combination with various anti-tumor agents. This multi-center study tests the hypothesis that pixantrone in place of conventional 4 (or more) cycles of anthracyclines can reduce cardiac toxicity without compromising overall cure rates. 27 centers outside the United States will treat 160 newly diagnosed children with ALL or NHL using a dose intensive regimen based on pixantrone without anthracyclines. Patients randomized to arm A will receive the following on days 1-5 and again on days 35-39 of each cycle (all in a 56 day cycle): (in mg/m2): pixantrone (100) or prednisolone equivalent (360). Chemotherapy will be stratified by disease (either ALL or NHL) and protocol. Treatment will continue for at least 4 cycles (up to 58 cycles). Patients randomized to arm B will receive the following on day 1 of each cycle (all in a 56 day cycle): (in mg/m2) pixantrone (100) or prednisolone equivalent (100) and receive 10 doses of cyclophosphamide (450). Chemotherapy will be stratified by disease (either ALL or NHL) and protocol.

However, parents with IDDs are not provided with appropriate support, and there is a lack of evidence-based programmes tailored to these parents' needs. Parenting Young Children (PYC) is a home-based parenting programme developed for parents with IDDs. PYC has shown promising clinical results in interview-based studies, but there is no evidence of its effectiveness. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the PYC programme for improving parenting in parents with IDDs where there is risk of child neglect. The study will include a quantitative evaluation, a process evaluation, and a qualitative evaluation of the children's and parents' perspectives on participating in PYC.\nMethods: The quantitative evaluation will have a multi-centre, non-randomised, comparative study design. Eligible for participation are parents with IDDs who have children aged 0-9 years living at home and who are assessed as needing tailored parenting support. Thirty parents receiving PYC and thirty parents receiving treatment as usual (TAU) will be recruited from Swedish municipal social services. Outcome variables will be examined before and after the intervention, with a follow-up 6 months after completing the intervention. The primary outcome will be goal-attainment in parenting skills, and secondary outcomes will be parental self-efficacy and children's wellbeing. Interview methods will be used to explore the perspectives of parents and children in the PYC group.\nDiscussion: This study is motivated by the need for evidence-based support for parents with IDDs, and it focuses on upholding the centrality of child-caregiver relationships and family preservation, as well as children's rights and the rights of people with disabilities. Social services have expressed ethical concerns with employing a randomized design for this vulnerable group, and this study will therefore evaluate PYC in a non-randomized comparative study.",

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",
        "model_output": "Background: Early and accurate detection of bacteria that are likely to contribute to severe infection is a critical need for the care of patients with sepsis. Traditional techniques for bacteria detection from blood (or \u201cculture\u201d) are known as time-consuming (generally >2 days), costly, not widely available, and have a high rate of false-negative results. The T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel is a novel molecular test which can identify bacteria from a simple blood draw with results available to clinicians within a few hours. The test is simple and can be run on any blood sample that is sent to the laboratory for culture (typically the first blood draw a patient receives after arrival in the emergency room). It is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized test of its kind. This study will evaluate whether the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel can potentially reduce time to initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, thereby achieving better patient outcomes. Methods: This prospective, multi-center pragmatic randomized controlled trial will include 2500 adult patients across six emergency departments in the United States. Upon arrival to the emergency department, patients will have a blood sample drawn for conventional blood culture (taken to the laboratory according to routine protocol) and for the investigational study. Patients will also receive 1 gram intravenous of vancomycin which is the standard therapy used while cultures are pending. Blood draws for the study will also occur at 18, 24, 42, 60, and 72 hours after the first blood draw, although testing may be stopped by the patients treating physician at any time at the physicians discretion. Study participants will then be randomized to either the control (usual care) group, or to the investigational group who will receive an in-house alert 2.5 hours after the first blood draw indicating a positive screening test result for a suspected bacterium from the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. The alert may be suppressed by the patient\u2019s treating physician or lab team. Results: We believe that this study will have the potential to significantly impact clinical care. The T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel promises to be a powerful test for clinicians in the emergency department. The availability of direct-from-blood testing results could make vancomycin prescribing decisions simpler and more data-driven. The T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel also offers the ability to test for a larger variety of bacteria with more nuanced identification of antibiotic resistance. This may help clinicians in the emergency department avoid unnecessary incomplete or complete drug holidays for patients in whom vancomycin may be an appropriate therapy. This improved clinical decision-making around vancomycin therapy may lead to a reduction in treatment-related antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity through earlier initiation of potentially effective agents in patients with bloodstream infection. The impact of reduced antimicrobial exposures on antimicrobial resistance and on the economic burden of healthcare-associated infections will also be assessed. Data Collected: In addition to time-to-treatment and vancomycin use, the study will investigate potential outcomes of 7-day mortality, 28-day mortality, and hospital length-of-stay. Antimicrobial use will be evaluated as will occurrences of acute kidney injury in patients receiving vancomycin. Data will be collected for patients from enrollment through their index treatment episode. Trial Design: A prospective, multi-center pragmatic randomized controlled trial will be used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of direct-from-blood bacterial testing for clinical decision making in the emergency department. Randomization: Patients will be randomized at a rate of 75% Usual care to 25% Intervention using computer-generated permuted block randomization. Masking: A computer-generated random sequence will be used to allocate patients to the study arms. Randomization will be stratified by individual investigator sites. \nMasking of the laboratory will be ensured by using the standard laboratory request forms for both the control and intervention groups and ensuring that all specimens will be processed and reported by the same laboratory group. \nOutcomes: Patient-centered clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes will be used to evaluate the impact of direct-from-blood bacterial testing results compared to usual care. Outcomes of interest are time to receiving the last dose of intravenous vancomycin and time to initiation of the last dose of systemic anti-pseudomonal beta lactam antibiotics, in addition to outcomes related to antibiotic-associated adverse events and treatment duration.

One potential way to address this challenge is to offer community-based services for individuals who are high-utilizers of expensive emergency and inpatient psychiatric services. Due to the decentralized nature of California governance, responsibility for mental health services falls primarily to the individual counties. The County of Santa Clara, CA invests significantly in community-based services as well as 24-hour care settings.

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators also hypothesize that the CBT-informed intervention will be more effective than the attitudinal inoculation intervention for increasing COVID-19 vaccination among participants with symptoms of anxiety or depression.",

Patients are reviewed in a nurse-led HNC PFU clinic where they receive personalised survivorship, health promotion and education in identifying signs of disease recurrence with information on the pathway to re-present directly to the services at Guy's Cancer.\nThis mixed methods research project will evaluate implementation factors of this new PFU programme whilst prospectively measuring its effectiveness.

        "summary": "Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is an abnormal rhythm of the heart which is increasingly common and can be associated with serious consequences. We know that AF is associated with an increase in the scarring of the heart, the left atrium and it is thought that this scarring may be one of the drivers for this abnormal heart rhythm. The nature of this scarring in humans has been subject to limited study and generally only by indirect means such as cardiac MRI scans or measuring the voltage of the tissues. During cardiothoracic surgery, tissue from the left atrium is removed as a part of the procedure. This tissue is normally disposed of, but we would propose to consent patients to collect it to allow it to be analysed. Such analysis would examine the composition of the tissue, including the pattern of scarring, to allow us to gain a greater insight into the mechanisms of AF.",
        "model_output": "The study aims to collect and examine patient tissue. It will be collected during patients\u2019 routine operations, and it would be otherwise discarded. Therefore, patients undergoing routine operations requiring the surgical removal of relevant tissues will be eligible to participate in this study.\n\nThe pilot study will examine up to 10 participants. The feasibility of a full study will be assessed based on the findings of this study. Therefore, for this study, the study team have decided to recruit patients with atrial fibrillation and with a range of degrees of AF fibrosis. During cardiothoracic surgery, a randomised trial has shown that surgical exclusion of the LAA at the time of cardiac surgery is associated with a 2.2% reduction in ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism. This will involve the removal of the left atrium, and the tissues, which would normally be discarded during heart surgery will be collected. During lung resections for malignancies, along with the part of the lung being resected, the pulmonary vein and surrounding portion of the left atrium are also removed. These operations therefore provide tissue which is known to be of great importance in promoting and sustaining AF, but which is normally discarded. Therefore, the current study proposal plans to make use of this discarded tissue to find out more about the causes of AF.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nPIONEER: a Prospective International Observational cohort study to aNalYse the long-term clinical course of early RA\n\nDescription\n-----------------\nPIONEER is a prospective international observational study aiming to provide insight into the natural history, clinical patterns, and management of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Play is often associated with intrinsic motivational factors. Play may involve serious interaction (often termed playful or serious play) or humorous interaction (often termed play or \"horseplay\"). The use of play as therapy started long time back and was used by playworkers and play therapists. Initially play was believed to help the children improve their social skills and to develop in a more independent way. Play based therapies have been found to be useful in different kind of mental health disorders. The basic principle underlying this therapy is that play enables the child express his feelings in a way in which he would not communicate otherwise. Play based therapy is widely used but there is no concrete evidence from randomized control trials. It shows promising results for communication, and expressive disorders in children.\nThere are a number of interventions and therapies that have been designed for developing the functional communication skills in the language delayed autistic children. Some functional communication training strategies are highly successful and have been used since many years. But this method doesn't take into consideration the role of functional language skills development in children with language delays which can also be an important problem for these children.\nWe did a lot of studies in the past we also have done few reviews on the treatment of child language disorders and the use of play as therapy. We also concluded that the Play based therapy is safe and very effective.\nWe therefore came to conclusion that the language delayed autistic children with communication and Expressive disorders can be better treated by the combination of Play based therapy and Functional communication training.<\n2.Objective: To compare the the comparative efficacy of Play based therapy and Functional communication training in Speech-language Delayed Children from hearing loss. | \n\n Terms related to the study\n=================\nKeywords Provided by Centre Hospitalier Valida\n-----------------\nchildren, speech language developmental delay, speech-language disorders, Speech delay, communication difficulties, speech language disorder, speech and language difficulties, Speech language therapist",

        "summary": "Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by cardiac abnormalities compromising the ability of the heart to provide a blood supply adequate to the metabolic needs of peripheral tissues. ADHF is characterized by systemic and pulmonary fluid retention, with weight gain, peripheral edema, needing diuretic therapy. Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide. The researchers will perform a spontaneous, prospective, randomized trial aiming at investigating the effect of combined furosemide-induced diuresis and automated matched dehydration, compared with standard furosemide administration in ADHF patients with fluid overload.",

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent. We propose that rintatolimod/durvalumab-combination therapy is feasible and may induce synergistic anti-tumor immune responses in PDAC.",
        "model_output": "Background and objectives of the study\n-----------------\nAccording to the latest cancer classification, pancreatic cancer is the fourth deadliest cancer worldwide (187.000 deaths in 2018), with an estimated 5 year survival of less than 10%. Currently, the treatment options for advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer are rather limited, leading to a median overall survival time of less than one year. Treatment of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is challenging because most patients are not eligible for surgical resection of the primary tumor due to poor prognosis. Consequently, the only treatment options that are currently available for this population are a limited number of chemotherapeutic regimens. These regimens do improve patient survival in comparison with the situation in which there is no treatment at all. However, the number of treatment options needs to be increased in order to improve survival rates. Since the immune system is known to play an important role in tumorigenesis and immunotherapy is rapidly becoming a new and promising therapeutic strategy, it is hypothesized that combination therapy with two different immunotherapy drugs might prove to be more promising than regular treatment. \nRationale\n-----------------\nPDAC is characteristically associated with a profound immunosuppressive environment, which impairs the functionality and cytotoxic capacities of effector CD8+ T cells. In this study we will investigate the effectiveness of combining anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy with a TLR-3 agonist (rintatolimod), which is an immunotherapeutic drug that activates dendritic cells and CD8+ T cells via direct stimulation of the TLR-3 and CD137 receptors. Previous research has shown that this combination therapy improves immune system function in cancer patients. \nOver the last few years, multiple clinical trials have already been performed in an attempt to find effective combination therapies for pancreatic cancer. Most of these studies have been designed to find the right dose for combining two drugs. However, since combination therapy can be dangerous from a safety point of view, it is important that these safety profiles are well understood before these combinations are tested in a larger population of cancer patients. In this study we aim to determine the highest dose per protocol without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). We will also determine the clinical benefit rate in addition to the tumor response rate and progression-free survival rate and investigate the effect of combination therapy on the infiltrating tumor immune profile. \nInterventions\n-----------------\nIn this study, patients will first receive the chemotherapeutic treatment FOLFIRINOX for a period of 8 months. Subsequently, they will start with combination therapy, including rintatolimid and durvalumab, for a six weeks period. Rintatolimid will be administered as an infusion twice per week and durvalumab will be administered intravenously every two months, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \nWho is included\n-----------------\nPatients that are 18-75 years old and have histologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic cancer, i.e. adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with tumor nodules or metastases that are eligible for treatment with the chemotherapeutic regimen FOLFIRINOX. These patients must also be ineligible for surgical resection of their pancreatic cancer. \nResearch design and methods\n-----------------\nThis study consists of two phases: phase Ib and phase II. All participating patients will first start with the chemotherapeutic regimen FOLFIRINOX for 8 months and patients that do not benefit from this treatment will be excluded. After FOLFIRINOX the patients will all start with the combination therapy, which consists of rintatolimid and durvalumab. \nPhase Ib\n-----------------\nIn this phase, participants will receive durvalumab and rintatolimid consecutively after FOLFIRINOX, according to the following escalation scheme and design: The patients will receive durvalumab via intravenous infusion on the first day of a 28-day cycle, followed by rintatolimid administered twice per week for a period of 6 weeks. After the first six weeks, a second cycle will be started, with the same time scheme as before. Every six weeks (i.e. with every new cycle) a new toxicity assessment will take place; if the treatment remains safe, the dose can be increased and combination therapy in new patients can be started.",

        "summary": "The potential benefits of exercise for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and pain have been well documented in the scientific literature. Psychiatric, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are examples of conditions that impact the health and quality of life of the population. Due to the effects provided by exercise, it can modify the natural course of these diseases. This concept is important to justify the efforts made by government bodies committed to promoting exercise, such as the WHO. However, the habitual practice of physical activity following the primary guidelines may be hampered by some factors, including those that support the physiological repercussions of exercise on the body, such as muscle pain. In this sense, an important complicating factor such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), present in the post-exercise recovery period, can impair adherence and permanence in physical activity programs, thus representing a considerable barrier to exercise promotion. They can also severely impair the performance of high-level athletes. Flavonoids, present in plants, but also in foods of the human diet, are known to have several biological properties, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Currently, there are still few studies that have evaluated the effects of flavonoids on the development and evolution of DOMS in humans.",
        "model_output": "This study has been designed to demonstrate the ability of diosmin to attenuate post-exercise muscle soreness in humans by means of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized clinical trial. To this end, we will evaluate whether supplementation with the flavonoid diosmin can attenuate muscle pain, plasma levels of total creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity) induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol. In addition, we will evaluate if the supplementation of the flavonoid diosmin can improve the recovery of muscular function and balance. Our hypothesis is that supplementation with the flavonoid diosmin can attenuate the inflammatory process caused by intense dynamic exercise, resulting in a decrease in delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and its adverse effects. To attain the objective of this study, 20 athletes will be subjected to the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol and, after exercise, will receive diosmin supplementation at a concentration of 750 mg per day. The intense dynamic exercise modality proposed for the study will consist of a sequence of three sets of repetitions until failure of bilateral muscle contractions on a leg-press machine with a 45\u00b0 angle. This protocol of intense dynamic exercise has been proposed because it provides similar physiological responses to those found during dynamic exercises of long duration. In addition, it has been established as a well-tolerated and safe technique for eliciting muscle damage without impairing the neuromuscular functional capacity of athletes. The intense dynamic exercise protocol proposed here will be identical for all participants. The project is approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Londrina State University (Londrina, State of Paran\u00e1, Brazil) under protocol number 64025122.2.0000.0108 of the year 2021. The selected participants will be informed about the objectives and methodology of the study and when there is agreement with the proposed design, the agreement to voluntarily participate in the study will be registered by means of an Informed Consent Form. The intense dynamic exercise modality proposed for the study will follow the following approach: participants will perform a standardized muscle injury protocol that will consist of a sequence of three sets of repetitions until fatigue of bilateral muscle contractions on a leg-press machine with a 45\u00b0 angle. Each The participant will have their load previously defined through the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) test, and 70% of the defined weight will be used during the intense dynamic exercise protocol. During each action, the load will be resisted with the legs placed on the leg-press supporter from full knee extension to the 90\u00b0 knee flexion angle, lasting approximately 3-5 seconds. Between each series, participants will be able to take a 1-minute rest period. The intense dynamic exercise protocol that will be carried out by all participants will be supervised by the project manager and/or collaborators duly trained for such assessments. 20 athletes will be recruited for this study. They will be divided into two experimental groups of approximately equal numbers. One of these will be subjected to a placebo regimen and the other to the diosmin regimen. The intense dynamic exercise protocol described above will be carried out twice (before and after supplementation). This allows us to assess the potential effects of supplementing with diosmin before the start of exercise (pre-treatment) and to investigate its effects on DOMS and related pathological events. In order to investigate our main hypothesis, the potential effects of diosmin supplementation on DOMS will be evaluated and the potential causes of this condition, such as inflammation and oxidative stress, will be studied. The intense dynamic exercise model proposed for the study will consist of two different sessions. Each session will consist of three sets of 10 repetitions until failure. Both sessions will be conducted two days apart. The first day will be considered as the initial day for the analysis of clinical and blood parameters. In addition, it will allow the measurement of the 1RM of the leg-press machine and will prepare the participants mentally in order to be able to perform the protocol properly. The second day will be considered as the DOMS induction day. According to the prefrontal analysis, three sets of 10 repetitions of bilateral muscle contractions will be performed on the leg-press machine. The total duration of the protocol will be approximately 5 minutes. Between each repetition, the participants will have a 2-minute recovery period. A set of 10 bilateral repetitions (maximum tolerance load) will be considered an accomplishment and",

        "model_output": "Gestational diabetes mellitus is a common pregnancy-associated condition that affects 3-19% of pregnant women globally, depending on diagnostic criteria and population demographics. Women who are at a higher gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk due to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors are at a higher risk for having gestational diabetes mellitus, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Low vitamin D levels are associated with insulin resistance, a risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus. Vitamin D is known to be important for glucose metabolism and its deficiency is prevalent among pregnant women in developing countries, where the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus is also high. Previous studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation is associated with lower risk of gestational diabetes mellitus among high-risk pregnant women, while others show no benefits. Thus, evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus during pregnancy is inconclusive.\nResearch has suggested that vitamin D supplementation may have additional benefits, such as preventing low birth weight, preeclampsia, and preterm delivery. These potential benefits may be due to the immuno-regulatory and anti-inflammatory activities of vitamin D, which can help to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications.\nA research has been planned to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus among high-risk pregnant women. The primary outcome will be the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups Criteria after 75 g OGTT. If the findings show that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus among high-risk pregnant women, it may provide evidence for the implementation of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy as part of routine prenatal care. This research may benefit pregnant women and their offspring by reducing the risk of pregnancy complications and improving health outcomes for both mother and baby.",

The main outcome hypothesis is that the AUC of chronicization of RAII predicted by the prediction model based on the expression level of immune factors is more than 0.8.",
        "model_output": "----------------\nIntroduction: Radiation-induced intestinal injury (RAII) is a common complication of rectal cancer chemoradiotherapy-temazolomide (CRT-TMZ). The incidence of RAII varies from 20% to 70%, with mild self-limited diarrhea in 10%-20% of patients to severe intestinal necrosis in 5%-10% of patients. Although mild intestinal toxicity is usually self-limited, severe and chronic comorbidities will lead to delayed rectal cancer surgery, reduced treatment dose intensity and drug treatment compliance, poorer tolerance and increased toxicity. The pathophysiological mechanism of RAII is still unclear. The immune response of the intestinal mucosa to malignant tumors stimulated by radiation and chemotherapy contributes to acute intestinal injury, as immune cells and cytokines are involved in the repair of radiation damage and the process of tumor response and resistance. However, the immune microenvironment changes in the progression of acute intestinal injury to chronic intestinal injury, and studies on the role and mechanism of immune factors in chronic intestinal injury are still limited. Methods: A prospective, observational, confirmatory single-center study recruited adult rectal cancer patients aged 18 to 75 years old diagnosed by pathology and MRI, who underwent NCRT and TME and developed RAII during NCRT, to verify acute intestinal injury and chronic intestinal injury . Expected samples of 200 patients were collected.

Even with the new anti-thrombotic agents, the rate of stroke remains significant in the NVAF population. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) prevents thrombus formation within the LAA and is indicated in high risk patients for stroke who are unable to tolerate oral anticoagulants.

The development of the SEPIOLA System (figure 8) offered physicians and patients an alternative to these two procedures. The SEPIOLA System was granted CE mark for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF, who are not candidates for long-term oral anticoagulant intake.

        "summary": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) refers to ongoing chromosome segregation errors throughout consecutive cell divisions. CIN is a hallmark of human cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Analyzing CIN of the DNA extracted from cast-off cells in bile samples seems a promising method for diagnosing, monitoring, and predicting the prognosis of biliary tract carcinoma patients. CIN can be assessed using experimental techniques such as bulk DNA sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or conventional karyotyping. However, these techniques are either time-consuming or non-specific. The investigators here intend to study whether a new method named Bile Ultrasensitive Chromosomal Aneuploidy Detection (BileCAD), which is based on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, can be used to analyze CIN and microbial infection analysis thus help diagnosing and treating biliary tract carcinoma patients.",

        "summary": "Schizophrenia represents a significant contributor to the global burden of disease, with this burden disproportionately impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In India, the burden due to schizophrenia is further exacerbated by low access to effective psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting recovery, rehabilitation, and community tenure, as well as inadequate attention to managing co-occurring chronic medical conditions that result in significantly reduced life expectancy among those living with schizophrenia compared to the general population. A major driver of these alarming gaps in access to care for persons with schizophrenia in India is the limited capacity within primary care settings aimed at addressing the complex co-occurring mental health, physical health, and functional needs of this patient population. There now exists strong evidence demonstrating that community programs delivered in primary care and leveraging psychosocial interventions combined with linkage to specialty psychiatric services are effective for supporting treatment and recovery of schizophrenia in low-resource settings. We will leverage our existing collaboration and robust research infrastructure in both rural and urban settings in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, India to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate whether the use of a digital platform offers added clinical benefit and can support integration of this task shared care for schizophrenia into routine primary care settings. We will address the following aims: 1) evaluate whether the use of the mindLAMP digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness of task-shared community-based psychosocial rehabilitation (COPSI) for individuals with schizophrenia, and 2) determine whether the addition of mindLAMP to the delivery of the COPSI program has an impact on implementation metrics when compared to delivery of COPSI alone.",

The Community Reinforcement and Family Training  (CRAFT) is based in social learning theory and is a strength-based approach that involves helping individuals affected by OUDs to identify ways for their loved one (IP) to achieve and maintain recovery, while also learning new skills to cope with the difficulties and stress of their family context.  The goal is for CRAFT providers to identify positive goals to work towards with their IPs and, ultimately, to increase the likelihood that IPs will voluntarily attend and engage in substance use and mental health treatment.

As a bispecific antibody against PD-1 and CTLA-4, cardonirimab can not only induce the production of a large number of T cells in the early stage of immune response by antagonizing CTLA-4, but also block PD-1 and PD-L1/L2 combination. Thereby restoring the killing function of T cells to tumor cells and reducing the exhaustion of T cells.The hypothesis is the combination of cadonilimab and nab-Paclitaxel will overcome PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-resistance to enhance the response of patients with persistant, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.",
        "model_output": "1.Background:\nCervical cancer is a kind of human cancer, which is especially frequent in young patients. The incidence of HPV-associated cervical cancer is increasing in more and more counties. Radical surgery is the main treatment for patients with early stage of cervical cancer. Most patients with advanced cervical cancer will receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy to improve the prognosis of the disease. According to the results of the GOG 240 trial, the use of platinum-based combination regimens is now the standard treatment for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. In recent years, the treatment of advanced cervical cancer has shown remarkable changes. The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with antiangiogenic therapy provides more opportunities for prolonging the survival time of these patients and obtaining clinical benefits.\nIn the KEYNOTE 42 study, pembrolizumab showed remarkable clinical efficacy in recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer and pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel and bevacizumab became the standard treatment for recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer. In the KEYNOTE 826 study, PD-1 monoclonal antibody + chemotherapy combined regimen significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with placebo + chemotherapy combined regimen. In the phase II AMP7 study, nivolumab combined with nab-paclitaxel + liposome doxorubicin (lip-dox) was effective and safe, with an ORR of 51%, a median DoR of 5.2 months, and an OS of 12.4 months.\n5.2 A previous report found that among people with PD-1-positive recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who received immune checkpoint blockade + chemotherapy combined treatment, patients with specific germline variants in the tumor microenvironment gene (TMEG) had a significant increase in PFS compared with those with wild genes or germline variants in other genes (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35\u20130.91, P = 0.016). In another study of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, when PD-1 combined with other drugs in combination to treat cervical cancer, only 30.6% of patients (31/102) had a complete or partial response to treatment. For the remaining 70.7% of patients, it was difficult to improve the prognosis of cervical cancer by continuing to treat cervical cancer. Therefore, from the perspective of immunotherapy, it is urgently needed to explore the new treatment of cervical cancer. Based on the above, the immune checkpoint blockade combined with chemotherapy is still the most common and promising treatment method for recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer, and it is necessary to continue to conduct explorations for combined treatment methods. However, some of the adverse events that are frequently seen in the treatment of cervical cancer patients are adverse drug reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea; and there are some other adverse events. For example, some researchers have reported that cardiovascular adverse events can also be seen in immune checkpoint inhibitor-based treatment regimens. Due to the special characteristics of the cervical cancer population, in recent years, nab-paclitaxel has been approved for the use of recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer in many countries. However, the application of nab-paclitaxel in different countries in the world is still not uniform. Thus, it remains necessary for international multicenter large-scale clinical studies to explore whether or not nab paclitaxel combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors is a more powerful treatment regimen for recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer.\n7) The combination of PD-1 inhibitor+nab-paclitaxel may be one of the treatment regimens for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. There are some reports which confirm the relationship between nab-paclitaxel combined with checkpoint inhibitors and the efficacy of tumor treatment. In the KEYNOTE-028 study, nab paclitaxel combined with nivolumab + ipilimumab as first-line treatment, in a group of patients with recurrent or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, the response rate was about",

        "summary": "Approximately 65, 000 hip fractures occur in the United Kingdom (UK) each year, and more than 99% are repaired by surgery. Roughly half of patients receive spinal anaesthesia, where a small amount (usually less than half a teaspoonful) of local anaesthetic is injected into the lower back, around the nerves that go to and from the hip.\nLow blood pressure is very common during surgery (at least > 30%, depending on definition), and appears to be linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery.\nThere are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. National guidelines recommend that lower doses are given, but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately or often enough.\nThe Anaesthesia Sprint Audit of Practice (ASAP) 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.5 mls of spinal anaesthesia is given, and the investigator has been using this amount in Brighton since 2011. Recently, the investigator has reported a way of transferring vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (e.g. in Coroner's investigations: approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery).\nHowever, analyzing such observational data should also allow the investigator to describe accurately how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (e.g. the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, the investigator hopes to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery, potentially improving people's survival and recovery after hip fracture.",

        "model_output": "519 COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reached an estimated 4 million deaths across the globe. Despite the availability of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the investigators do not yet understand the correlates of protection. Thus, the investigators do not know who will be protected from symptomatic disease, or what will be required to achieve protective immunity in populations. Given the limited research in this area, the investigators also do not know how the unique immunological and nutrition characteristics of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a region with the highest mortality, affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission and immunity. To date, there is no research looking at how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination among uninfected individuals and individuals chronically infected from exposure to malaria and the intestinal helminth, which are highly prevalent in SSA. The investigators propose collecting up to 200 symptomatic subjects (index cases) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their households, up to 600 vaccinees, and up to 2700 uninfected individuals without any history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Malawi. The investigators will enroll these subjects throughout Blantyre, Malawi, and collect extensive laboratory samples, including whole blood, capillary blood, stool, and blood taken through venipuncture, to measure markers of immune function and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and immune responses against the virus. The investigators will assess risk of asymptomatic infection among contacts of index cases, the ability to generate strong antibody responses against the virus, the potential risk for re-infection or breakthrough infections in vaccinees, immune activation in response to the virus and in response to the vaccine, the potential risk for acquiring infections in a household, the duration of symptomatic infections and reinfections, and how malaria and intestinal helminth infection may impact these parameters. The investigators will also explore the relationship between infection and vaccination with regard to immunity and protection against SARS-CoV2 infection in the context of malaria and intestinal helminth infection. The investigators' overarching hypothesis is that exposure to malaria and intestinal helminth may lead to an abnormal innate immune phenotype that is highly inflammatory, and that these inflammatory responses may lead to immune exhaustion upon exposure to the virus or to a vaccine, resulting in decreased levels of protective Ab and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and inadequate responses to vaccine.\n\n\nStudy Design\n=================\nPurpose:: Diagnostic, Other, Prevention\nRetrospective/Prospective:: Prospective\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nStudy Purpose:: Prevention\nPhase:: Not applicable\nIntervention Model:: Parallel, Sequential\nBlinding/Masking:: Double\nBlinded Subject:: Subject, Outcome Accessor\nAllocation:: RCT\nIntervention Type:: Biological/Vaccine, Others, Pharmacological, Surgery\nIntervention Description:: 1) Blood collection\n- Venous blood for immunologic analyses will be collected with or without blood draws for immunologic analyses in 0.32L serum tubes.

In addition to negative impact on patient's quality of life, chronic pancreatitis is also associated with the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. The etiology of recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) can be divided into mechanical obstructive factors (e.g. cholelithiasis, cholestasis), metabolic abnormality and toxic substance factors (e.g. hyperlipidemia and alcoholism), and other or idiopathic factors. At present, the diagnosis and treatment of RAP remains highly challenging. Early identification and intervention on risk factors of recurrence will be effective in reducing incidence and improving prognosis.\nContrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) can not only provide more imaging information and further assess the severity of acute pancreatitis, but also aid in the differentiation of other diseases associated with acute abdominal pain. In addition, radiomics based on raw radiographic data has become a research hotspot in recent years.

Although the association of egg intake and cardiovascular health outcomes appears to be controversial, there are no known randomized clinical trials investigating the effects of egg intake on HDL size distribution or the number of HDL subclasses (high, medium, or low density lipoprotein), and whether the positive associations between egg intake and cardiovascular health outcomes is due to changes in HDL size distribution or the number of HDL subclasses or not. In addition, there is limited information on how egg intake may affect immune function, and whether these effects change with age. We propose that whole eggs, egg yolks, and egg whites, when consumed over a 4-week period, will have different effects on serum large HDL particles, serum HDL subclasses, and circulating T-cell subsets in young and older adults. METHODS: This randomized, crossover study will be performed at Baylor College of Medicine's Human Nutrition Research Center. During this study, participants will consume each diet during a 4-week period in random order, with a 4-week egg-free washout in between. All egg intake will be conducted by consuming 3 liquid large eggs per day, provided by Hickman's Family Farms, for 4 weeks, separated into 3 liquid large eggs consumed in the morning, 1 liquid large egg consumed at lunch, and 1 liquid large egg consumed in the evening. The three liquid egg products will be prepared by the volunteer. One of the two eggs in the early evening will be mixed with a protein-rich food (e.g., cottage cheese) to prevent nighttime satiety, which can lead to poor sleep quality.

The study will recruit 24 unique male and female participants between the ages of 18-30 years (n=12) and older adults between the ages of 60-70 years (n=12) in order to minimize gender- and age-dependent physiological effects. These participants will be separated into a \"single meal\" subgroup (n=3 per condition) and a \"whole day\" subgroup (n=9 per condition). In the single meal subgroup, study participants will consume all 3 liquid large eggs in the morning (with the early evening egg substituted with a placebo (pure water)), followed by fasting until dinner with no other egg intake during the 4-week intervention period. The \"whole day\" subgroup will be consuming 3 liquid large eggs in the morning, 1 liquid large egg at lunch, and 1 liquid large egg in the early evening (as described above) for the first 4 (or more) consecutive weeks. For the second 4 (or more) weeks (or the next time point), study participants will consume 2 liquid whole eggs in the morning, 2 liquids egg whites in the morning, and 2 liquids egg yolks in the early evening. During the intervening 4 weeks, the egg products from the first 4 weeks will be substituted to test for repeatability of any observed treatment effect.

In this way, MyoTrain AR will be beneficial for all individuals who use pattern recognition controls.

Second: MyoTrain AR will provide the first objective metrics of upper limb amputee functional performance associated with pattern recognition control. Third: MyoTrain AR will provide a platform for future research and development of novel training methods aimed at improving myoelectric control.\n\nIn this randomized control case study, amputee participants will be split into two groups, a traditional motor imagery training group, and an experimental augmented reality training group. All will complete the same assessment battery before, during, and after the training intervention. To minimize bias, all participants will be blinded to the type of training they receive and the outcome measures to be assessed. The data will then be evaluated without bias using standard analytic methods, for example, generalized estimating equations that account for repeated measures.\n\nThis study has limited statistical power but will be sufficient for providing a proof of concept evaluation of MyoTrain AR. The study is limited to a single time point to minimize costs and participant burden but the same participants will be monitored for up to one year to determine if there is any sustained benefit of MyoTrain AR. If an effect of the training intervention is observed, this evidence will be sufficient to provide funding (for example, from the National Institute of Health) for a larger randomized control trial.\n\nThe proposed research is significant because it will provide insight into one of the most critical impediments to upper limb function in arm amputees following pattern recognition control: the inability to perform real-world tasks requiring object manipulation at a desired speed without sacrificing grasp stability. If the study can demonstrate an improvement to functional performance (that is, object manipulation) using a simple low-cost training intervention, this could transform the way pattern recognition control is established and trained for upper limb amputees. \n\nMore details regarding the study can be found at the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT0506928\n\n\nStudy Design\n=================\n\nStudy Type:: Interventional Study\nObservational Study:: No\n\n\n\nCohort/Phase\n-----------------\nCohort Details:: Prospective, non-randomized, single-site, sequential, blinded study\n\n\nArms and Interventions\n\n| Participant Group/Arm | Intervention/Treatment |\n| --- | --- |\n| Experimental: Augmented reality control training<br>Participants will undergo functional task training (using the MyoTrain AR system described in the intervention model section) for 30 consecutive days (approximately 30 minutes per day).

Each of the selected outcome measures has been extensively validated in diverse populations and is widely used in clinical research and practice for assessing patients with chronic pain. SF-36 is a standardized assessment tool that measures overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The three pain scales assess different aspects of pain and include: the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and the Mobility in Chronic Pain Scale (MCPS). These scales have been shown to have high validity and reliability in assessing pain severity, chronic pain catastrophizing, and disability due to chronic pain. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a standardized instrument that assesses patients' HRQoL and consists of five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities (including work), pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each domain is scored on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is frequently used in clinical trials and has been shown to be a reliable measure of HRQoL in patients with chronic pain. | 12 months | \n\n Terms related to the study\n=================\nKeywords Provided by Centre Hospitalier Valida\n-----------------\nchronic pain, electronic health record, disease phenotyping, deep learning, treatment recommendations",

While its exact cause is unclear, it involves genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Crohn's disease can lead to nutrient deficiencies and has unpredictable flare-ups and remission periods. During the remission phases, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms can persist in 50% of patients, for which no satisfactory treatment is available yet.\nChitin-glucan is prebiotic, obtained by extraction, isolation and purification from a fungal resource: the mycelium of Aspergillus niger (a microscopic fungus of the Ascomycetes family) of which it composes the cell walls. The biopolymer consists essentially of two types of polysaccharide chains: chitin (poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) and beta-(1,3)-D-glucan (D-glucose units linked essentially via beta-1,3 bonds). Because of its beta bond, human intestinal enzymes cannot digest it, as a result, the majority of chitin-glucan can reach the colon where it can be fermented by the microbiota.\nBy modulating the composition and/or activity of the intestinal microbiota, fermentation of chitin-glucan could have beneficial effects on health.\nThe aim of the RELIEVE study is to assess if BK003 could improve the relief of global symptoms, individual symptoms, stool consistency and frequency of evacuations, quality of life, anxiety, and depression in patients with Crohn's disease in remission without treatment or with stable maintenance therapy and having IBS-like symptoms and to confirm the product's safety.",

The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases. The same junction clones from pre-post-RT serums and surgical tissues will be confirmed and the copy number changes of vh-DNA be correlated with RT response and disease-control status.\nThe investigators plan to identify HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR as personalized biomarkers from the same-patient serum samples. The investigators will further correlate clinical response and recurrence/metastasis with serial changes of vh-DNA copy numbers. The investigators have been prospectively collecting plasma samples from HBV-related HCC patients before/after RT, at 1, 4, 7 months, and at recurrence/metastasis. The investigators plan to confirm the viable role of pre-/post-RT changes of plasma vh-DNA copies of the same junction clone in post-RT response and prognosis. Moreover, The investigators will explore the recurrent/metastatic tumors arising from the original or a de novo one by identifying their clonality with HBV integration patterns. The true value of this novel HBV chimera vh-DNA will be revealed. The results will also support the consolidative use of personalized vh-DNA for earlier evaluating treatment response after RT, for post-RT disease monitoring, and for differentiating clonality at recurrence to design future clinical trial on combinational treatment.",
        "model_output": "Research question: Can we identify the virus-human chimera DNA (vh-DNA) on early serial detection in patients undergone radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of response and recurrence? \nProspective: Yes, single-center study enrolling patients undergone radiotherapy for HCC in Department of Radiation Oncology, National Taiwan University Hospital. \nBackground and rationale: Current diagnosis of HCC relies mainly on ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Patients with small tumor may not develop obvious symptoms during radiotherapy, which makes the monitoring of tumor size and metabolic activity challenging in early radiation periods. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA fragments (ctDNA) have emerged as a promising biomarker to monitor treatment response and predict recurrence and metastasis in various tumors types. However, the detection rate of somatic mutations-specific ctDNA is limited, leading to the utilization of cell-free virus-human chromosome (vh-DNA) as a biomarker to identify residual HCC cells and recurrence. vh-DNA may offer a unique advantage over somatic mutation-specific ctDNA. Most HCC tumors harbor integrated HBV-DNA fragments within the host genomic DNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV-human chromosome (vh)-DNA may persist longer in the peripheral blood compared to the conventional mutation-specific ctDNA because of their integration pattern. \nStudy design and methodology: Blood samples will be collected serially from HCC patients before, during and after RT. The captured vhDNA will be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS), which will be used for clonal analysis of tumor cells at a single junction of HBV-human chromosome. The investigators will further detect and quantify selected vh-DNA junction clone by specific PCR to monitor early changes of HBV chromosome by plasma samples.

        "summary": "The unexpected changes caused by the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can lead individuals to question their beliefs, life meanings, and goals, prompting a search for meaning. According to Park and Folkman's (1997) Meaning-Making Model, the process of meaning making functions as a coping mechanism. It helps individuals adapt challenging experiences into their lives, ultimately assisting in their psychological adjustment to stressful situations. Based on this theoretical model, principles from meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), literature reviews, interviews with breast cancer patients, and expert consultation, an 8-week online individual psychological intervention was developed. It was aimed at facilitating the finding of new meanings in the experience of breast cancer and promoting psychological well-being. It includes psycho-educational, cognitive, existential, and behavioral components explicitly focusing on the meaning-making process. This intervention is called the Meaning Centered Coping Program (MCCP). The main purpose of this study was to test whether the MCCP was an effective intervention program for women diagnosed with breast cancer. For this purpose, the study sample consisted of women with stage I, II, and III breast cancer. Then, participants were randomly assigned to the MCCP group and the wait-list control group. A number of reliable and valid measurement tools were used to compare the MCCP group with the waitlist control group and to examine the effect of the program. Compared with the control group, significant improvements were expected in the level of meaning in life, post-traumatic growth, situational meanings, psychological inflexibility, and psychological well-being in the MCCP group.",
        "model_output": "Background\n-----------------\nBreast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide . However, despite the progress in cancer treatments, the diagnosis of breast cancer and its related treatments has a significant impact on survivors' psychological responses. One of the consequences of the diagnosis of breast cancer is the disruption in the meaning of life, which is associated with psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and hopelessness . Meaning in life is defined as the extent to which individuals perceive their existence as meaningful . Meaning in life plays a crucial role in psychological well-being and mental health .\nWhile some people report feeling a sense of purpose and meaning in life after the diagnosis of breast cancer and its related treatments, others experience a significant decline in meaning due to the diagnosis of breast cancer and its treatment . Therefore, a strong theoretical foundation is needed to investigate how people make sense of their life after the diagnosis of breast cancer.\nIn this study, we will examine how self-identity, values, and personal goals are affected by the diagnosis of breast cancer and its treatment.\nStudy objectives\n-----------------\nThe research objectives of this study are as follows:\n1. Develop a theoretical framework for the effects of breast cancer on one's identity, values, and goals.\n2. Examine how the diagnosis of breast cancer affects one's identity, values, and goals.\n3. Evaluate the impact of breast cancer on one's sense of meaning in life, post-traumatic growth, stress appraisal, and coping strategies.\n4. Analyze the psychological consequences of breast cancer diagnosis and its related treatments on patients.\n\nStudy design\n-----------------\nThis is a prospective cohort study design involving a mixed-methods approach. The study commenced in April 2022 and is expected to last for approximately one year. The participants in the study are individuals who have been diagnosed with breast cancer within the past five years and are receiving treatment or have completed treatment at a specific hospital. The study will include a total of two groups: an intervention group and a comparison group. The intervention group will receive a psycho-educational intervention program, while the comparison group will receive standard care.\nThe intervention group will be asked to complete various questionnaires before, during, and after the intervention program. They will also be asked to participate in interviews to discuss changes in their identity, values, and goals. The interviews will be recorded and transcribed for analysis.\n\nRecruitment\n-----------------\nThe study participants will be recruited through several methods. In the first stage, information about the study will be disseminated through social media platforms and posters placed in clinical settings. Potential participants who are interested in participating in the study will be informed about the study objectives and methods in detail. The research team will establish contact with individuals who are eligible to participate in the study based on the study's inclusion criteria. In the second stage, potential participants will be asked to provide written informed consent. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and ethical approval will be obtained from the hospital's ethics committee.\nThe study team will conduct an assessment of the participants' psychological health and well-being before the intervention program begins. During the intervention program, the participants will receive psycho-educational information about the diagnosis of breast cancer and its impact on identity, values, and goals. They will also be provided with strategies for coping with breast cancer diagnosis and its related treatments.\nThe intervention program will last for eight weeks and involve individual sessions with a trained psychologist for 60 minutes, which will be conducted at a specific hospital. The sessions will be tailored to the needs and experiences of each patient, and the participants will be expected to complete weekly homework tasks to promote their engagement and progress throughout the program.\nAfter the intervention program is completed, the participants will be asked to complete the same questionnaires that were administered before the intervention program. The questionnaires will help researchers assess the impact of the intervention program on the participants' psychological health and well-being. Additionally, participants will be asked to participate in semi-structured interviews to discuss changes in their identity, values, and goals. The interviews will be conducted by a trained member of the study team and will be analyzed using qualitative research methods.\nThe data collected through the questionnaires and interviews will be used to analyze the changes in the participants' identity, values, and goals due to the diagnosis of breast cancer and its related treatments.

        "model_output": "5G system is an upgrading innovation of 4G network technique . The experimental design of this project is to compare the differences between the 5G network technology and the 4G network technology. And the results of the comparison will provide a theoretical basis for people to understand and apply the 5G network.\n\nBackground\n-----------------\nIn 2005, the term \"5G\" was first proposed by Qing Zhao, founder of ZTE, to refer to the next generation of cellular communications after 4G technology [1]. On October 10, 2019, the 3GPP standardization organization officially released the standard of 5G new radio, marking the entry of 5G technology into the industrialization stage [2].\nIn October 2020, the 3GPP organization officially released 3GPP Release 16, also known as 5G phase 2 standard, which introduces additional key 5G features. And in December 2020, 3GPP organization officially released 3GPP Release 17, which is called 5G phase 3 standard, which will be used after 2023 or 5G commercial use phase 3.\nHowever, due to the strong penetration of 4G in the communication field, many application and technical scenarios still rely on the relatively long 4G time-to-market cycle. Therefore, it is a long way to achieve the full commercial use of 5G technology . To a certain extent, it puts forward higher requirements on the implementation speed of 5G technology.\nTherefore, the research project of this article is to focus on the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of 5G technology and 4G technology. And on this basis, it hopes to provide a more comprehensive analysis of 5G technology, so as to help guide the application and commercial use of 5G technology in the future.\nThe 5G system is based on the existing 4G system, with some advantages and disadvantages . Through the comparison and analysis of 4G and 5G, it can be found that:\nIn terms of bandwidth and communication speed, 5G can significantly improve communication speed and bandwidth by using millimeter waves.\nIn the development of the technical scheme, 5G has significantly optimized the performance of the communication network by improving the network architecture and reducing the weight of the hardware equipment, so as to accelerate and reduce the overall cost of the development of the communication network, resulting in higher profits of the operators.\nThe communication technology of 5G is more stable, and the network is more reliable due to the reduction of network failure or disconnection time, so it has higher practicality.\nIn order to support more efficient and reliable network connection scenarios, the security of the network connection needs to be upgraded in the 5G network . By adding an independent security layer in the control plane and data plane, the security of the network connection can be effectively guaranteed, and the problem of data eavesdropping can be effectively avoided.\n5G will also provide more powerful and richer functions to support the 5G terminal device, which can provide better connection scenarios for customers.\nThe 5G network is based on new technologies such as massive access and network slicing to further improve network performance. It also has many new technologies such as millimeter wave technology, Internet of things technology, artificial intelligence technology, and virtual reality technology, which are of great significance to accelerate the development of industries such as public safety, education, industrial control, and smart home.\nDue to the gradual upgrading of the communication network, many application scenarios of 5G will gradually emerge in the future. Therefore, it is not difficult to see that the 5G network is the future and the future and the future.\nReference:\n1. Zhao, Q., Jia, L., Liu, J., Jiang, S., Liu, J., Tian, R., and Gong, H.

MS is a neurologic disease that affects the brain and spinal cord in people of any age or gender, with the highest incidence rate between 20 and 40 years of age. It affects motor, sensory, and cognitive function of patients. It has a variable course with many having mild symptoms and disability, while others experience rapid disease progression and significant physical, mental and emotional disabilities. The treatment of MS is based on the individual needs of patients and their disease course. There is no clear evidence based treatment of mood and anxiety disorders in people with MS. In spite of the high prevalence of depression and anxiety in the general population, patients with MS are known to suffer from these psychological disorders with even greater frequency than the general population. Although there are many pharmacological interventions to treat depression and anxiety and behavioral intervention to prevent and treat depression and anxiety disorders, these psychological interventions are underutilized by patients with MS. In addition, they lack data-driven research on its effectiveness and optimal treatment delivery models. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of behavioral activation, one of the most common behavioral therapies, on treating depression, anxiety, and fatigue among adults with MS. A secondary goal is to examine the mediating role of self-efficacy and behavioral activation in improving quality of life in people with MS. The third goal is to examine the role of internet based intervention in delivering the behavioral-activation intervention to better manage the mental and emotional symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders as well as to improve quality of life in this population.\n\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) that results in physical and cognitive changes. While MS can affect patients as early as puberty, the disease is most frequent during adolescent years and early adulthood, but can also be diagnosed at any age. Amongst other things, symptoms of MS can include fatigue, depression, difficulties with concentration, memory, and attention, along with changes to physical strength, balance, pain, heat sensitivity, and bladder, bowel, and breathing problems. For these reasons, MS can lead patients to feel isolated and alone. Additionally, MS frequently requires patients to take medications that have side effects of their own, such as anxiety and depression. In spite of the high prevalence rates of depression and anxiety (40-65%), patients with MS do not receive proper treatment. According to a recent systematic review on psychotherapy for people with MS, few psychosocial interventions were found and the overall quality of included studies was rated as low. The review concludes that we need more studies on psychosocial interventions to improve the mental and emotional health of patients with MS. The purpose of this project is to examine the effectiveness of Behavioral Activation (BA) amongst adults with MS. Behavioral Activation is an evidence-based therapeutic program that has been found to be effective in treating depression and anxiety. It focuses on helping patients to identify and alter the dysfunctional behaviors and thoughts that contribute to their depression and anxiety. This is accomplished by using in-person sessions, through the internet, or via the telephone. We believe that the effectiveness of behavioral Activation is likely to be enhanced by taking an individualized approach to determine the best treatment delivery method, and by providing treatment via multiple formats to optimize treatment outcomes (ie, in-person, via the telephone, or through the internet). However, we will need evidence-based treatment programs to prove that this theory is true. For example, in patients with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety who are too impaired to come into the clinic for an intervention or to engage in cognitive behavioral interventions. Research studies have shown that BA is very effective for treating patients with severe depression and anxiety who are not able to participate in cognitive behavioral intervention (e.g., because they are not able to concentrate well enough to",

However, it also increases the risk of ischemic complications in patients. The current standard dual antiplatelet regimen is considered crucial in reducing thrombotic events. Nevertheless, some patients exhibit resistance to antiplatelet drugs, which puts them at a higher risk of thrombotic events. In clinical practice, there is a lack of standardized platelet function testing and consensus on adjusting antiplatelet drug programs. This study conducted a multi-center, prospective cluster randomized controlled trial to investigate whether antiplatelet adjustment therapy guided by light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) detection can decrease the occurrence of ischemic events after stent implantation in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

        "model_output": "Background\n-----------------\nChildren with cerebral palsy (CP) are at risk of developing low bone mineral density (BMD) due to a variety of factors, including reduced weight-bearing activities, muscle weakness, altered biomechanics, limited mobility, and hormonal imbalances. Children with CP have been reported to have lower BMD compared to typically developing peers, with a prevalence of osteopenia ranging between 20% to 40%. Children with CP have shown to have lower bone mineral density (BMD) compared to typically developing individuals, which can lead to increased risk of skeletal problems such as fractures and scoliosis. The relationship between gross motor function (GMF) and quality of life in children with cerebral palsy is poorly understood and requires further exploration. The investigators hypothesise that children with more functional activity and a greater range of motion have higher BMD, better GMFM scores, and a higher quality of life. This study will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between bone health, gross motor function, and quality of life in children with CP, enabling us to develop personalised interventions to address these complex health issues. The investigators hypothesised that there would be a positive relationship between BMD and gross motor function. The investigators hypothesised that the bone density would be a predictor of the motor function and quality of life. Methodology \nA sample of 75 children with cerebral palsy between the ages of 7 to 10 years will be recruited from the outpatient clinics within the Egyptian National Research Centre (NRC) and Pediatric Hospital, Ain Shams University Children's hospital (CCH) and their chronological ages will be ranged from 7 to 10 years. The sample size will be based on a power of 0.8 and an estimated effect size of 0.4, according to Cohen\u2019s d. The bone mineral density will be assessed using a DXA scan (Hologic) that measures hip and lumbar spine bone density. The gross motor function will be measured using the gross motor function classification system (GMFCS). The investigator will analyse the correlation between BMD and GMFCS using a Spearman correlation coefficient. The investigators will use the Mann-Whitney U test to assess whether there are differences in BMD between different GMFCS levels. The investigators will also analyse the relationship between BMD and quality of life using the quality of life questionnaire for children (CP QOL-Child). The investigators will use a Kruskal-Wallis test to assess whether there are differences in quality of life between different GMFCS levels. The investigators will also use a Spearman correlation coefficient to assess the relationship between BMD and quality of life. The investigators will perform a multivariable analysis to investigate whether BMD is an independent predictor of gross motor function and quality of life. The investigators will also investigate whether there are any interactions between BMD and GMFCS in relation to gross motor function and quality of life outcomes. The investigators will also examine whether age is a significant mediator in the relationship between BMD and gross motor function and quality of life.

Though anaesthesia is usually thought to be safe and necessary to improve health, concerns remain the effects that the drugs used may have on brain development in children and the potential long-term consequences for health. The two techniques used to keep someone asleep during anaesthesia are either giving the appropriate drugs through a small plastic tube into a vein or introducing different drugs into the lungs in gas form.\nGene expression is the process by which instructions in DNA are used to make products such as proteins. Anaesthetic drugs may change how a child's genes are expressed\u037e a process called epigenetics. Studies have shown that different anaesthetic drugs can cause epigenetic changes in animals and affect the processing ability of their brains.\nThis study will focus on children aged under 3 undergoing general anaesthesia for planned hypospadias surgery (a developmental condition where the look and function of the penis may not be completely normally). Participants will either receive their general anaesthetic in gas form or through directly into their veins - both techniques are commonly used.

In light of this, we are undertaking a number of epigenetic studies which aim to investigate whether the type of anaesthetic drugs used to induce and maintain anaesthesia cause changes in signals which are responsible for regulating how genes are expressed. If alterations in these signals are demonstrated, then it is possible (but not certain) that this could lead to neurological problems later in life. Studies to address these concerns are currently limited by a lack of research involving children.

        "summary": "Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism can have multiple causes; most patients suffer from primary autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma, or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease occur. Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",
        "model_output": "2007 is estimated to be the year with the highest prevalence of hypothyroidism. This number will more than likely continue to increase. Hypothyroidism can be treated with L-T4 (levothyroxine), a synthetic form of thyroid hormone. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is commonly used as a parameter to monitor therapy, although it cannot always be used to determine the thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. Free T4 (fT4) often shows high values within a few hours after L-T4 intake, whereas TSH is barely affected. These increased values may lead to undesired changes in dosage. Deiodinase polymorphisms could contribute to these altered values in some patients. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate other parameters (total T4 (TT4), total T3 (TT3), free T3 (fT3), free T3/free T4 ratio, reversed T3 (rT3), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), (acyl)carnitines, and several amino acids) which have been suggested as biomarker of thyroid hormone status. However, these biomarkers need to be investigated in healthy controls as well in order to properly determine their value in patients using L-T4. This study will assess how altered fT4 levels can influence the interpretation of the other parameters. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether a variety of additional markers can improve laboratory diagnostics in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status (e.g. central hypothyroidism). TSH will be considered to reflect thyroid hormone status reliably. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status. Therefore, the outcomes of this study will particularly benefit the follow-up of patients with central hypothyroidism in whom TSH cannot be used to monitor therapy.",

The treatment decision (operative or non-operative treatment) for this group will be discussed during a consultation or a case meeting. Most of the elderly patients and their family members or other caregivers will prefer surgical intervention, as they believe that surgery is the only option to fix a fracture. Orthopedic surgeons will have difficulty with implementing a non-operative treatment in this select group of frail elderly people with a limited life expectancy. A new treatment paradigm, consisting of an algorithm to distinguish between operative and non-operative treatment for frail patients, is recently proposed. This has resulted in new consensus protocols named PNOM (palliative non-operative management). However, this protocol has not yet been tested in a prospective cohort study. The PNOM-implementation study will test the PNOM-protocol in 10 hospitals across the Netherlands. The main design is a multicenter prospective cohort study.

        "summary": "After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma.",
