        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThis study aims to understand the psychosocial factors (defense and psychological processes) and personality traits that may underlie NP, focusing on the role of early and adulthood traumatic experiences in predicting the onset and maintenance of NP, and the effects of NP on life, emotions, social relationships and the quality of life of the subjects. Thus the investigators will examine the psychosocial predictors of the onset and progression of Chronic Migraine (CM), Fibromyalgia (FM) and Vulvodynia (VU), in an effort to identify a common core of psychosocial characteristics in individuals who suffer from these disorders, despite showing quite different pain behavior. Given the heterogeneity of the three pathologies expressed by NP, it is necessary to investigate the characteristics that may differentiate them with reference to the type of personality, defense mechanisms, childhood traumatic events, and central sensitization. Ultimately, the study aims to identify subgroups of individuals who suffer from NP, based on similarities and differences in psychological variables, in order to tailor the best therapeutic practices for each patient.",

        "summary": "Aim: This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of two types of mattresses with different support surfaces used in bedridden patients.\nMethod: The sample of this quasi-experimental study consisted of 60 patients according to the inclusion criteria. A group I and group II of 30 patients each were formed from the sampled patients. For the patients in group I, a bed with a cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was used. For the patients in group II, a viscoelastic mattress was used. The data of the study were collected with the ''Patient Identification Form'', ''Braden Scale'', ''Pressure Wound Observation Form'' and ''Wound Measurement Chart''. Number-percentage distributions, Chi-square, Fisher's Exact Probability Test and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to evaluate the data.\nImplications for Clinical Practice: It was determined that the support surface used affected the pressure sore size and the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature created smaller sized wounds in the sacrum, trochanter, malleolus and heel regions. In the sacrum, scapula, and heel regions, although not statistically significant in terms of wound stage and the number of patients who developed pressure sores, it was seen that the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was more effective.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPressure injuries, also known as pressure sores, are a medical condition that affects elderly or bedridden patients. The formation of these wounds occurs for several reasons, such as long periods of sitting or lying down without adequate tissue perfusion. The goal of this study is to investigate the prevention effect of a modern mattress system compared to a standard mattress system. The standard mattress system is a viscoelastic mattress with an orthopedic foam system. In the experimental group, a modern mattress system with a support surface with vibration (massage) features, a cube/block system, and a ventilation system is used. To determine the risk of pressure ulcers, the patients' Braden Scores are calculated daily upon admission. The patients are then followed for four weeks, and their pressure ulcer risk is recorded on a daily basis. The pressure ulcer area is calculated with a square centimeter ruler using the Pressure Ulcer Observation Form. The number of patients without pressure ulcers is monitored in both groups, and the number of patients with a Braden Score of 13 or higher is compared statistically between the two groups. The investigators predict that bedridden patients using a mattress system with a support surface that reduces the pressure, vibration, and air exchange will have less pressure ulcer formation. These mattresses with cube/block systems have a greater area of low pressure that offers lower pressure to the patient, which may have a positive effect on prevention of pressure ulcers. The mattresses with cube/block systems are more expensive and cost approximately 400 more euros than the standard mattress, but the prevention of pressure ulcers and subsequent complications may lead to cost savings within a short time.",

OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed.

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

How well they do isn't as related to the kinds of treatment they get. However, there are significant side effects for the various types of treatments they may get. Because these patients generally have favorable outcomes no matter the kind of treatment, reducing side effects should be a priority when choosing their treatment.\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate whether a new blood test called a Circulating Tumor DNA test (ctDNA test) can decrease the number of people that require radiation after surgery. This blood test is often elevated in people when they are diagnosed with head and neck cancer. There are studies that show that cancer most often returns when this blood test is positive after treatment. This study will test patients' blood before and after surgery.

PBI is a hypo-fractionated treatment regimen for early breast cancer with a reduced treatment time of approximately one week. Recent evidence from randomized prospective trials is in favor of PBI as it allows better quality of life with no decrease in oncologic outcomes. However, some concern about the risk of local recurrence has persisted since no meta-analysis has been able to establish the risk due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and the impossibility of comparing PBI and WBI. The investigators believe that the reduction in treatment time and the low toxicity rate of daily fractionation allow the hypofractionated regimen to be safely compared with the standard fractionation regimen. The main hypothesis of this trial is that ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in either PBI or WBI is as effective in terms of oncologic control with less acute and late toxicity compared to the standard fractionation regimen. Specifically, the investigators aim to demonstrate that ultra-hypofractionated PBI and WBI are as effective as the standard fractionation regimen (26 Gy/50 Gy) with less toxicity and less financial burden on the health care system. Additionally, the investigators will assess patient-reported outcomes (PRO) (quality of life, body image, psychosocial burden and satisfaction with treatment), complication rates and late toxicities.

To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSynopsis: The gut microbiome has been implicated in several medical disorders including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, ulcerative colitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux and gallstone disease. Gut microbes may either promote or impede the progression of many disorders and therefore have significant clinical implications for patients affected by them. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without but there are only a handful of small scale studies linking these differences with the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. Preliminary results from these studies suggest an association between gut microbiome diversity (the richness of the number of species present in the gut) and gallstone disease and that specific species may confer risk for symptomatic gallstone disease. Researchers are currently unaware of what these microbes are and whether these differences have any effect on the progression of gallstone disease or its complications. Therefore, this study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including those who develop complications following diagnosis and those who develop complications following cholecystectomy. It is intended that this work will help to identify the differences in gut microbiome in patients with gallstone disease compared to controls and link this to the development of complications. The knowledge gained from this study will allow researchers to devise strategies to reduce the number and severity of complications in patients with gallstone disease and ultimately result in a better patient experience and reduced use of NHS resources. This study is crucial in the first step in understanding differences in the gut microbiome that are linked to gallstone disease. The findings from this study will provide the evidence to support future larger scale studies or trials to determine interventions which can be used to reduce the development of complications in patients with this disorder.\n\nInclusion criteria: All adults (age >18 years of age) patients diagnosed with gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging at an East Kent University Foundation Trust Hospital.

Many patients with gallstone disease experience varying severity of symptoms including abdominal pain and bloating, which can result in considerable disruption to patients lives in addition to increased costs to the NHS. Cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment for symptomatic gallbladder disease. However, surgery carries risks including bleeding, infection and injury to surrounding structures.

        "summary": "Sepsis, characterized by severe organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated immune response to infection, is often life-threatening in clinical settings. Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis. Furthermore, we also evaluated the performance of APRI in hypoxic hepatitis and sepsis induced cholestasis (SIC), which are two subtypes of SALD.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nStudy design: 2 cohorts, consisting of sepsis patients with and without SALD, were selected for the investigators to further compare and analyze the patients' clinical data, characteristics, outcomes, and biochemical markers.\nObjectives: This study is an observational, retrospective cohort study, focusing on evaluating correlation between APRI and SALD in adult patients with sepsis.\nStudy population/sample: The MIMIC IV database for sepsis patients was downloaded from physionet. We performed a review, after which we selected the cases most relevant to our study. Inclusion criteria in the MIMIC IV database for sepsis patients included the following: 1) adult sepsis patients (\u226518 years) and 2) first hospitalization and first ICU admission. Exclusion criteria were: 1) all types of chronic liver disease; 2) viral hepatitis; 3) primary acute cholangiopathies; 4) cholecystitis; 5) hepatic infarction; 6) liver necrosis; 7) liver trauma; 8) length of ICU stay< 24 hours; 9) Patients without simultaneous AST and PLT data in the first 24 hours after ICU admission.\nThere were 87 234 patients in our database. Ultimately, 326 patients with APRI data and simultaneous AST and PLT data were enrolled.\nData collection and extraction: The database(MIMIC IV), which contains patient demographics, characteristics, and hospital data, was used. The biochemical markers were also assessed, both in the database and by additional laboratory testing. The extracted indicators include age, weight, gender, comorbidities, infection site, disease severity scores, vital signs, treatment received, blood parameters and clinical endpoints.\nThe MIMIC IV database for sepsis patients was downloaded from physionet (http://www.physionet.org) at 19:06 on Jan. 7, 2019. It contains detailed, longitudinal EMR data for sepsis patients in three adult ICUs from 2008 through 2012 in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\nData analysis: APRI and incidence of SALD will be evaluated using logistic regression analyses. We will use 0.5 of APRI as a cut-off to discriminate the association between APRI and SALD. The APRI and clinical indices were dichotomized into a high APRI group (APRI > 0.5) and low APRI group (APRI \u2264 0.5). The SALD group is used for comparison, and the non-SALD group is used as the control group. Risk differences will be calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals for differences.\nLogistic regression will be performed to evaluate the association between incidence of SALD with APRI, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidity, infection site, disease severity scores, APACHE II, and initial serum hemoglobin levels. Odds ratios, along with 95% confidence intervals for differences, will be calculated.\nExpected results: APRI is a simple, inexpensive, and widely available marker of liver disease. It is calculated by (AST(IU/L)/ upper limits of normal)/PLT(k/uL)\u00d7100. We hypothesized that APRI will be elevated in patients with SALD, regardless of etiology. In the current study, patients with higher APRI values will be more likely to develop SALD as compared to those with lower APRI values. Additionally, APRI > 0.5, which we set in our study, will be predictive of SALD.

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

The patient physical and psychological sufferings in ALS are immense, and apart from Riluzole, there is no effective treatment.

Perhaps the most challenging topic of ALS care is the decision to extend ventilation support into the stages of disease that require treatment both during day and night. In these cases, treatment is clearly life-sustaining and although quality of life may be maintained, the burden of caregiving imposed upon family or health care workers is huge, regardless of tracheostomy (TIV) or non-invasive (NIV) modality.\nThe present study is a longitudinal questionnaire study in Norway measuring overall quality of life, health-related quality of life, and disease-specific quality of life in ALS patients, partners and children before and after the introduction of life sustaining ventilation support.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground : Motor Neuron Disease (MND) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with high morbidity. It is considered a medical emergency that is progressive, severe and life threatening. The diagnosis of MND is made on a combination of clinical findings including signs and symptoms related to dysfunction of the motor system, and supported by neurophysiological investigations and imaging techniques that do not show any other abnormalities attributable to other diseases causing motor impairment. Most people with MND die from respiratory failure, and this can be a slow process that can last from a few months to years. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been shown to improve exercise capacity, sleep quality, and quality of life in some cases, and has been implemented as a standard treatment for MND in adults. Intriguingly, however, the effect of ventilation and the decision to offer it in the outset has not been systematically studied in MND. Patients and their families suffer from the physical, psychological and social changes that occur both with the disease itself and as a consequence of the decision about long term ventilation. Currently, the decision about the treatment with long term ventilation is made in a non - standardized way in clinical practice, with the focus on preventing respiratory failure. When patients and their families experience respiratory failure or discomfort, it can become a medical emergency that requires acute medical support and, possibly, intubation and mechanical ventilation that has both short and long term consequences for the patients and their partners and children. In most cases, however, the decision for ventilation is made because of a deteriorating quality of life, and before this can happen, the patients and their partners should be informed about the pros and cons of this treatment.\nObjective : To examine objectively the effects of long-term ventilation support and the support of health care professionals on the quality of life of ALS patients and their families and to explore reasons for their decision making with regards to the treatment.\nMethods : Long-term ventilation support will be defined as ventilation that is not intended to be used temporarily (e.g. during acute respiratory insufficiency), but planned to be used continuously and for an extended period of time. Patients with or without such treatments will be included in an active clinical intervention cohort study. Inclusion criteria for patients: A clinical diagnosis of probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria. Progression of the illness leading the consulting physician to offer NIV or NPPV in the outset of the disease. Can communicate in Norwegian. Inclusion criteria for partners of ALS patients: Partner of a patient that suffers from ALS with progression of the illness leading the consulting physician to offer NIV or NPPV in the outset of the illness. Can communicate in Norwegian. Inclusion criteria for children: Children from 8 years and older having a parent who suffers from ALS with progression of the illness leading the consulting physician to offer NIV or NPPV in the outset of the illness. Can communicate in Norwegian. Exclusion criteria for patients, partners and children of ALS patients: 1.Potential participants with cognitive impairment or dementia.\nThe following outcome measures will be used in the study: The primary outcome is the change in overall quality of life, measured by the Quality of Life Scale, which will be completed by the patient, his/her partner, and his/her children. Other outcome measures include quality of life measured by the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire, health-related quality of life measured by the Kidsscreen-27 and self-reported measures of health perceptions, psychological distress and burden of caregiving. In addition, patients' symptoms and survival will be recorded up to 2 years. Discussion: This project will contribute to the knowledge about the effect of long-term ventilation support in MND and the effect of this treatment with respect to quality of life, psychological distress and burden of caregiving. It will contribute to the knowledge base on patient care and decision-making in ALS and improve the quality of care in ALS. This in turn may improve the well-being of patients and help them to decide, based on more information, whether or not they wish to start with long-term mechanical ventilation, and how these decisions will affect them and their family. If ventilation has a positive effect of the quality of life, but not the symptom burden, it is possible that ventilation support can be a useful treatment for both patients and their families. If mechanical ventilation has a negative impact on the quality of life, it is reasonable to consider other methods of treatment, or to discontinue treatment if symptom burden increases.\nThis project will contribute to the quality of care",

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChronic subdural hematomas (cSDH), due to head trauma, have an estimated annual incidence of 1 per 1000 population. Though most cases will resolve following surgical evacuation of the hematoma, post-operative degradation in clinical status is common and it is often a challenging clinical dilemma in regard to optimal management.\nStudying EEG signatures may help predict post-operative neurologic function. In general, post-traumatic spreading depolarization (SD) events are associated with post-operative worsening in patients with a cSDH. The primary goal of this study is to use EEG measures to differentiate between SD and non-SD associated cSDH.\nSpecifically, we will compare three EEG measures of SD associated cSDH: 1) frequency of SD, 2) duration of SD, and 3) volume of brain tissue involved with SD. These measurements will be compared to neurological outcomes (disability, cognitive function, and health related quality of life). The secondary outcome of this study is to assess the association of EEG SD events, when present, with clinical outcomes in patients undergoing surgical evacuation of cSDH.\nBy correlating EEG-related characteristics of SD in cSDH with outcomes as assessed by functional and cognitive measures post operatively and longer term outcomes, this study will provide insights into post-operative neurologic status and may impact clinical decision making and rehabilitation planning. Since EEG will be employed, our study will not impact the current standard of care. The proposed study aims to provide fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms of neurologic deterioration in patients with cSDH. The proposed study has several advantages: \n1. This study aims to provide important information to aid in clinical decision-making. SD events may be associated with deleterious neurological outcomes in patients with cSDH, and elucidating this may influence the decision to either observe or proceed with surgical drainage. Thus, this study will contribute to patient care and outcomes.\n2. Because EEG monitoring is an easy and relatively inexpensive method, this study will provide a valuable tool for future studies investigating this same question.\n3. This research is focused on patients with acute, as well as chronic, subdural hematomas. This is important as most studies have used only patients with chronic cSDH.\n4. This study is relevant to most neurosurgical practices in the United States, where cSDH is a common occurrence in patients seen in the emergency room.\n5.

Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials on the inflammatory component of the disease, reducing the annualized relapse rate by 46% and the rate of new T2 lesions by 80% compared with interferon-\u03b2 1a.\nThe use of anti-CD20 agents, including ocrelizumab, is associated with an infectious risk that increases with duration of exposure, part of which is due to the development of hypo-gammaglobulinemia in relation to cumulative dose.\nSeveral reports suggest a persistent effect of anti-CD20 drugs in MS, with no resumption of inflammatory activity after discontinuation:\nDuring the development of ocrelizumab, at the end of phase 2, after having received 3 or 4 semi-annual cycles of ocrelizumab, a safety period with a therapeutic window of 18 months was planned, before re-administration in the extension study. During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic pathology characterized by relapses of neurological symptoms and a progressive worsening of neurological impairment leading to physical and cognitive disability. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool to monitor the disease and to assess the therapeutic efficacy of MS treatments. In our routine practice at the Toulouse Neurology Hospital, we prescribe regular follow-up MRI in patients with MS.\nOcrelizumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was designed as an interferon-\u03b2 re-evaluation treatment in MS and more especially in Relapsing Remitting MS. Clinical trials have proven its efficacy in treating MS and its role in slowing down the cognitive decline and the physical disability.\nThis anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody has been distributed for more than 5 years in France for the treatment of MS. The ocrelizumab injection is a continuous treatment with initial 3 treatments per year, followed by one injection per year for two more years in patients with active MS.\nSince its introduction in 2017, we have noted that the initial treatment was effective, but in some cases, clinical deterioration was observed after a year of follow up. These progressive diseases, which occur despite treatment with ocrelizumab, pose new concerns for the patient and the neurologist.\nConsequent to this observation, the manufacturer has been contacted to allow an earlier intervention, with the option to inject again every 6 months. \nFor the patient and the neurologist, the use of less than 3 annual administrations would be preferable to a monthly injection on one hand and to a weekly injection during 4 years on the other hand. For the patient, the treatment of MS has a significant impact not only on their physical and cognitive impairment but also on their family and social life.

        "summary": "Mortality following elective colorectal cancer surgery range between 2.5-6% and increase for the elderly and frail patient regardless of T-stage. Around 80% of the patients who present with a colon cancer and is in a condition where surgery is possible will be offered resection of the tumor. A part of the colon is always removed together with the lymph nodes in order to ensure that cancer cells are not left behind. The risk of lymph node metastasis is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. The overall risk of lymph node metastases is less than 20 % in patients with early colon cancer. This indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer have no benefit of additional resection besides local tumor excision. The alternative to resecting a larger part of the bowel is to make more focused surgery only resecting a small part of the bowel part through a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. This new organ sparing approach is called Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS). The investigators aimed to examinate the hypothesis that organ preserving approach (CELS) provides superior quality of recovery in elderly frail patients with small colon cancers when compared with standard surgery in RCT.",

The main treatment for the radical resection of tumors in the colon is a segmental resection where the section of the section of colon is removed together with tumor. This resection is performed according to the rules of the oncologists - oncologic principles (CRC principles).\nThe primary objective of radical resection is to obtain a tumor-free margin, which should be more than 1 mm, in terms of clinical oncology terminology is called \"R0\", i.e., resection for cure or complete remission.\nFor small non-invasive colonic adenocarcinomas, there are discussions for the use of minimal invasive procedures, which can be performed without removing full sections of the colon. This type of procedure is called Organ Sparing, Organ Preserving or non-standard procedures, e.g. endoscopic submucous dissection (ESD). In our study, we describe a minimal invasive procedure called the Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) which provides endoscopic and laparoscopic methods for performing a minimally invasive procedure for small colonic adenocarcinomas. In this study we will evaluate if it can be used in patients who are frail and over 75 years old.\nThe investigators hypothesize that CELS can be performed with regard to oncological principles and lead to increased patient-reported recovery. The investigators also need to determine whether the new technique has a higher risk of cancer recurrence compared with the traditional colonic resection with an intact mesenter.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: \n74 patients will be included in a two-armed prospective randomized controlled trial at the Dept. of surgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. Patients above 75 years of age or otherwise judged frail and fit to undergo elective colon resection for small (T1N0) colonic adenocarcinoma located in the proximal colon. Patients will be screened and examined pre-operatively by an oncologic MTD. Eligible patients will be randomized to either the CELS or the standard colonic resection group. In both the CELS and the standard colonic resection procedures, all procedures will be performed under general anesthesia and according to current oncological principles. The CELS group will undergo the hybrid endoscopic laparoscopic procedure, whereas the standard surgery group will have the colonic section removed using oncological principles. Assessment of postoperative morbidity and mortality, change in patients' functional capacity and quality of life, and assessment of histopathological risk factors and long-term oncological outcomes will be performed.\nThe investigators believe that the study design follows the criteria of good clinical practice.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nRationale\n-----------------\nBackground:\nNeuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are a heterogeneous group of over 70 disorders resulting from a defect in a specific type of muscle protein, such as neurofilaments, dystrophin, laminin, potassium channels, collagen proteins, troponin or creatine kinase. People with neuromuscular diseases may have difficulty in breathing. Spinocerebellar ataxias, the most common inherited ataxias, are another cause of neurogenic lung weakness. People with neurogenic lung weakness are more likely to have infections, lung damage leading to scarring or bronchial dilatation, and eventually require ventilatory support or are at risk of dying from respiratory-related cause. The treatment of lung damage is based on removal of secretions through airway clearance techniques and drugs to reduce infection and inflammation in the airway. The airway clearance techniques employed consist of simple cough techniques and chest physiotherapy, like percussion, forced expiration, and postural drainage. Aerosol delivery, that is, the delivery of drug into the airway during breathing, is often used. Aerosol delivery can be in the form of inhalation or nebulisation. Nebulisation involves turning a liquid medication into a fine mist that can be breathed in with regular breathing. Nebulised saline can help to clear secretions in the lungs and reduce the risk of infections by acting like a natural expectorant to thin secretions. People with neuromuscular diseases are at risk of breathing in too much salt into their lungs. This is called hypertonic saline poisoning, and requires admission to hospital for treatment with intravenous fluids and close monitoring. It is not known whether more frequent nebulisation of saline may lead to more salt in the lungs of people with neuromuscular diseases. This is likely to depend upon how much is breathed in, and the balance between the beneficial effects of nebulised saline and the risks of breathing in too much salt.\n\nObjectives:\nThe objective of this study is to determine the amount of salt in the airway of people with NMD or neurodisability, following nebulisation of saline using different concentrations.",

        "summary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nGliomas are the most common tumors of the central nervous system, accounting for 20% of all brain tumors. Despite the many advancements, therapy remains challenging in many patients, particularly those with malignant, \"high-grade\" gliomas. Because of their invasive nature, these tumors are not able to be completely removed by surgery. For this and other reasons, radiation and chemotherapy are often given after tumor removal in an effort to eradicate any remaining tumor cells. Tumors are metabolically active, and use more energy from the food consumed, compared to normal brain. This increased activity can be visualized by a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, there are only a few PET scanners, and many patients do not have access to them. This means that patients often have to wait months or years after their tumor removal for their first PET scan. This is usually not enough time for clinicians to make decisions on the effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy. This problem is particularly important in young or elderly patients who may have difficulty undergoing MRI scans or in those with medical conditions that are worsened by lying in the MRI scanner. They may need surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to be started as quickly as possible, leading to potential overtreatment in some cases and delay in therapy in others. The investigators believe that a new metabolic imaging approach using an MRI based approach, \"aMRI\" may offer advantages to both patients and physicians. The investigators have developed a powerful new metabolic measurement technique (named k\u1d62\u2092*V) that can be used during MRI scans, in the same device used for structural MRI scans. This has been successfully used in animals to differentiate benign and malignant brain tumors in normal brains, but has never been evaluated in human subjects. The investigators first need to confirm that this method is robust and reproducible in human subjects, and compare it with the current standard of care, PET.\nBased on its promising results in the above mentioned studies, the investigators have developed an MRI based approach to measure brain activity at 3 tesla in various disease states and in normal subjects. This includes:\n- Patients with gliomas\n- Metabolic profile before brain surgery\n- Metabolic profile after brain surgery\n- Metabolic profile in different conditions of the brain in which glucose metabolism is altered (normal subjects, diabetic patients, acute stroke patients) and\n- Metabolic profile in different brain diseases (seizures, neurocutaneous syndromes, autism, etc.) and normal subjects.\nFor gliomas, the investigators will measure brain activity using the new aMRI approach in comparison to the current gold standard of PET. In patients with glioma, a tumor or \"lesion\" is an abnormal mass or area, detected on standard brain images, that is likely to be due to tumor. Surrounding healthy brain tissues normally show increased metabolic activity (shining bright in \u00b9\u2078FDG PET) in response to the tumor, and this is thought to be due to the tumor cells \"feeding\". However, while the tumor is metabolically active, many of the normal-appearing, surrounding tissues which are thought to have the potential to eventually form tumor are still able to maintain good blood flow and provide nutrition. In addition, some normal-appearing tissues may not provide enough nutrition to maintain normal function and can therefore undergo some degree of damage, which can lead to problems with memory and thinking. The investigators will test their hypothesis that the MRI based approach, aMRI, can differentiate between the normal appearing tissues in the brain that are good and those that are bad, and thereby, identify new treatment targets in brain cancers. The investigators will also test whether the activity difference between the tumor and normal-appearing tissues is different in different forms of the disease, including benign and malignant types, and the type that is more or less likely to be sensitive to the standard chemotherapeutic drugs that are used currently in patients with brain cancer.\nThe investigators believe that this research project will make important contributions to improving the evaluation of brain cancer and development of new treatment strategies by directly comparing the MRI based approach to the current standard PET scans.",

HF and its chronic symptoms and progressive symptoms are associated with an estimated annual healthcare expenditure of $30.7 billion in the United States alone. Despite advances in pharmacological and device therapy, heart failure continues to have a poor prognosis with 50% risk of hospitalization or death within the first 6 mo after diagnosis, and average 5-year mortality remains at 50%. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) that maximizes evidence-based pharmacotherapy, including use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), beta-blockers (BB), aldosterone antagonists (AA), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), reduces morbidity and mortality in HF patients. Patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) have the most consistent and prominent benefit when GDMT is optimized. A key issue surrounding GDMT underutilization is the recognition that in primary care practice, the number of guideline-specified pharmacotherapy doses that require an up-titration, addition of a new class of treatment, or discontinuation of contraindicated medications can be substantial due to patient heterogeneity. Further, although current heart failure therapies (eg, ACEI, BB) help patients with HFrEF, there are recent developments in novel therapies including SGLT2i and ARNI. ARNI provides benefit over ACEi/ARB in terms of reducing the combined endpoint of death from any cause and hospitalization for heart failure. However, there is limited evidence on the use of novel GDMT therapies in real world settings especially in HFrEF population, when compared to ACEi/ARB. It is increasingly clear that multi-prong approaches (combination of strategies) are needed to further optimize GDMT among patients with HFrEF in primary care settings.\nThe purpose of this intervention study is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF seen in primary care practices. We hypothesize that the addition of (1) multiprong clinical decision support (CDS); (2) focused education; and (3) physician and pharmacist referral options, (4) enhanced by electronic patient note reminders and patient portal messages to enhance clinician and patient awareness of key HF guidelines, and (5) targeted at different primary care practitioners' (PCPs) behaviors and preferences will lead to GDMT intensification in patients with chronic HFrEF receiving primary care. The investigators are also interested in identifying specific combinations of interventions that result in the best improvement in guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in these settings.\nThis study is a single-blinded randomized parallel group study with a non-randomized factor (education versus delayed education) and will be conducted on 6 outpatient cardiology clinics within the Geisinger Clinic system. Approximately 4000 (1600 per practice clinic) patients with chronic HFrEF \u2265 18 years of age will be allocated via a stratified block randomized design into no intervention (control), multiprong CDS, multiprong CDS with pharmacist referral, and focused education at the clinic level. Patients in these four study arms will not interact with each other and will follow their individual study arms' randomization over a 12-month period.\nTo achieve balanced allocation of practices by cardiologist preference for pharmacist referral (P = 0.40) and cardiologist preference for electronic patient note reminders/patient portal messages (P = 0.70), the investigators will stratify by specialty (cardiologist or non-cardiologist) and by cardiologist referral habits over the previous 12-month period to estimate a 45%/45%/10% proportional distribution of clinics within these categories to the following arms (intervention/control, respectively): (1) no intervention, (2) multiprong CDS, (3) multiprong CDS+referral, (4) education.\nClinics will be randomized to one of the four study arms, after which each 24-month period within a clinic will be randomized to either early or delayed education rollout.\nClinical decision support-intervention\nThe intervention will involve adding multiple forms of BPAs in the electronic medical record (EMR).

Its role as part of medical expulsion therapy for the treatment of patients with kidney and ureteric stones has proved to be of considerable success. However, its role in clearing upper ureteric stones as an adjunct to ESWL is controversial.

In patients who have developed ureteric stone for the first time the possibility of spontaneous passage of these stones is about 40-50%. In cases where the stone is less than 6 mm chances of spontaneous passage is about 80% but in larger stones chance of spontaneous passage is about 30-40% of patients.\nStone clearance by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has improved significantly in the last two decades, with success rate and stone\u2010 free rates reaching 95% with new generation lithotriptors.

It is believed that alpha blockers play an important role in the treatment of ureteric stones, by augmentation of ureteric blood flow, relaxation of the peri ureteric fibrous tissue and hence facilitate stone fragment dislodgment and spontaneous passage.\nHence the investigators hypothesize that in patients with upper ureteric stones of size ranging from 6-15 mm the addition of tamsulosin therapy to the ESWL treatment protocol would lead to higher stone clearance by ESWL after one week of procedure as compared to ESWL alone.",

The stenotic site was examined endoscopically (directly after the intervention by a laryngologist and one month later during fiber optic bronchoscopy by a thoracic surgeon). The laryngeal-tracheal area was then imaged using computed tomography (CT). In all cases, the self-retainer was kept in place for about 6 months, up to tracheal and tube removal. All patients underwent decannulation after intervention, with a maximum follow-up period of 12 months. In all of the 17 patients enrolled in the study, the self-retainer was positioned correctly and retained its position, enabling complete decannulation with no complications after the intervention. One patient died from cardiac arrest at 3 months (no direct involvement of the technique). There was no significant deterioration in glottis morphology during the follow-up period. All patients were successfully decannulated. In conclusion, transarterial cryosurgery combined with APC plus the insertion of the self-retainer in the trachea appears to be an effective and safe treatment for tracheal stenoses resulting from a previous tracheotomy.",

        "summary": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by a variety of other symptoms, such as bipolar disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), etc. The behavioral and social complications often marginalize the population, impact on life satisfaction, undermined societal values that impact on economic and financial fairness, and so forth. Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.\nThe research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.\nThe study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care. Contributed by the sociostructural elements and necessities, black market amphetamine and ketamine have not only emerged in the regime for decades, but also have become a lucrative business. Their recreational uses are also sometimes accompanied by real necessities and needs; black markets cater to the needs but guidance on the usages is based on word-of-mouth stories without professional medical assistances. There is one case the Principal Investigator (PI) collected, that one person, possibly under depression contributed by PTSD, took relatively high dosage of amphetamine and went into a state of psychosis with overwhelming persecution mania.

Evidence of poor contraceptive counseling is widespread, with multiple methods for measurement and many different aspects to consider. Conventional clinical measures for assessing quality of family planning counseling and its determinants could be used to support reproductive health. In 2017, Holt, Dehlendorf, and Langer created a framework for contraceptive counseling quality grounded in quality of care and human rights principles and research in healthcare communication. Based on this framework, Holt et al. developed and validated the Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale, which covers three interrelated aspects of counseling quality: information exchange, interpersonal relationship, and disrespect and abuse . The scale comprehensively measures aspects of the counseling process related not only to information receipt but also individuals' experiences having the opportunity to participate in the method selection process and the degree to which they had positive and trusting experiences with the provider . Associations between quality of contraceptive counseling and characteristics of clients, such as age, education, and reproductive status, could represent significant health disparities and indicate the need for research.

It includes : 1) information exchange, 2) interpersonal relations, and 3) disrespect and abuse in contraceptive counseling. The information exchange subscale consists of ten items, the interpersonal relationship subscale consists of seven items, and the disrespect and abuse subscale consists of five items. Item responses were given on four-point Likert scales. Response categories for positively worded items were completely agree (4), agree (3), disagree (2), and completely disagree (1). Response categories for negatively worded items were yes (1), yes with doubts (2), no with doubts (3), and no (4). Composite subscale and total scores were calculated as mean scores .

Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMultiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality, affecting young to middle-aged individuals with a devastating impact on their quality of life. Standard medical management aims at symptom control and the identification of potential triggers for fluctuations. In spite of various disease progression models, the identification of suitable therapeutic targets in order to personalize therapies is hampered by the variable course of the disease and incomplete understanding of the biological pathways associated with MSA. As a consequence, the optimal management of individuals with MSA is still defined by a multidisciplinary approach, but its implementation can be demanding, particularly in geographically dispersed populations. The impact of the disease, including autonomic, motor, and cognitive dysfunction can affect the quality of life of the patients, as well as the caregivers of the patients. The burden of caregiving is associated with physical and psychological morbidity.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a multidisciplinary, personalized treatment plan, based on a predefined standardized operational protocol and adapted to individual needs, in order to improve quality of life and reduce caregiver burden in individuals with MSA. With the advancement of technological solutions, this study will integrate telemedicine components with mobile palliative solutions, to improve access and continuity of care in an aging population. We plan to recruit 46 individuals with MSA fulfilling all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria for this trial. The study will follow a randomized, parallel design. At baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months after the baseline visit, the individuals with MSA will undergo a comprehensive clinical, psychological and neuro-rehabilitation assessment. The individualized treatment plan, including telemedicine and mobile palliative care offer, and therapy adaptations will be made based on the individualized assessment of therapeutic needs and healthcare preferences, and monitored throughout the 18 months study period. Twenty-three patients will be randomized to receive additional monthly and on-demand neurological, psychological, physio-, occupational and speech therapy telemedicine visits (based on individual needs). The therapeutic interventions will be documented, and the monthly follow-up visits will allow for the monitoring of caregiver burden and the identification of barriers to compliance. The study will be evaluated in terms of effect on the baseline to 18 months-change in the EQ-5D-5L score, the MSA-QoL score and subscores, UMSARS (video-based, rater-blinded assessment of the UMSARS motor score and Hoehn & Yahr changes over the study period), and the individual healthcare preferences of individuals with MSA and their informal caregivers. Based on our previous work on telemedicine in MSA, we expect to improve the coordination of care, adherence to the therapeutic plan and the overall quality of life within the 18 months of this study, to be eventually integrated as a standard component into the management of the disease. Successful management of the disease associated with improvements in quality of live and support in the informal caregivers will have a direct impact on the daily practice of healthcare professionals involved in the care of people with MSA. The proposed clinical trial will contribute to a comprehensive approach for the development of a new, patient-centered, evidence-based model of management in individuals with MSA.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nMedical Decision Making in Multiple System Atrophy: Developing Personalized Best Medical Care With Integrated Telemedicine and Mobile Palliative Care for Individuals With Multiple System Atrophy\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nMultiple System Atrophy\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Telemedicine visits\n* Other: Multidisciplinary, personalized symptomatic treatment\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria For individuals with MSA: i.

The purpose of the study is to identify differences in the genetic characteristics of participants who responded well or poorly to growth hormone therapy. No medications or other treatments are provided to the participants by Novo Nordisk as part of this study. The study will last for up to 1 year.

ISS is a common condition, affecting approximately 2-3% of the paediatric population. Clinicians face the challenge of having to assess the likelihood of response to GH therapy among children with ISS before starting the treatment. The main consequence of a non-responder (poor responder) outcome is the withdrawal of an ineffective therapy, associated with significant costs, both personal and system-based.\nThe hypothesis to be tested in this study is that ISS has a partly, but nevertheless, genetic basis. However, this genetic basis might be heterogeneous and thus may vary among children with the same condition/phenotype. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the molecular profile (measured through genetic variants) will provide additional information for clinicians to predict treatment response after initiation of GH therapy.\nWe will compare the genetic profiles between good responders and poor responders to identify the differences in the frequency and count of genetic variants per gene/pathway that contribute to the different response to GH. The study expects to enrol 600 children with ISS, 300 good responders and 300 poor responder. Each participant will provide one non-invasive biological sample. The main outcome measure is the frequency and count of genetic variants per gene/pathway, which will be determined by a panel of genetic panels and the ISSomics\u00ae test (R&O Genetics GmbH).\nTo facilitate the dissemination of the study results, the participants will be asked to allow the use of data and bio-samples for future research purposes in anonymized and de-identified format.",

        "summary": "Background: Following acute brain injury (ABI), patients are monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) where providers rely on frequent neurological examinations (neurochecks) to assess for neurodeterioration. Serial neurochecks are part of guideline recommendations, but there is equipoise between hourly (Q1) and every-other-hour (Q2) evaluation. In the ICU, care-related awakenings occur frequently, but it is unclear if differential neurocheck frequencies result in differential sleep, providing the scientific premise for this proposal.\nPopulation: Twenty-two patients (N=11 per group) who have undergone elective aneurysm coiling will be enrolled. On post-operative day (POD) 0, patients will be screened and approached for informed consent if they do not meet exclusion criteria, e.g., prior intracranial injury, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, mechanical ventilation. Patients with elective aneurysm coiling are being chosen because they require ICU level of care following their intracranial procedure, but do not have structural brain injury or ongoing sedation needs that might impact sleep measurements.\nMethods: Usual care: Patients are monitored every 15-30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-procedure, then Q1 or Q2 for up to 24 hours. If these patients remain stable, they are discharged home on post-operative day (POD) 1. Proposed Intervention: Enrolled patients will be randomized to Q1 or Q2 neurochecks following the institutionally required 6 hours of stable neurological and vascular checks. Once randomized, patients will undergo placement of electroencephalogram (EEG) with video, electrooculogram, and chin lead. The video EEG will be in place for at least 8 hours to include the overnight (10PM-6AM) time period. Following completion of the recording, the signals obtained will be reviewed by a blinded polysomnographic sleep technician for sleep characteristics including quantitative assessments of wakefulness, deep (N3) sleep, REM sleep, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation and arousals.

        "summary": "Extranodal extension (ENE) refers to the spread of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) outside the lymph nodes. It is a well-known factor that indicates a poorer prognosis and outcome for patients who have undergone surgical removal of the cancer. In such cases, it is recommended to combine chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery.\nAs the number of cases of HNSCC related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) is increasing, treatment approaches have shifted towards using radiation therapy as the primary treatment method instead of surgery. This raises an important question about the significance of ENE observed through imaging tests (referred to as iENE) and its impact on the prognosis. Unfortunately, this question remains unanswered.\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study across multiple medical institutions. The investigators will gather data including scan results, histopathology reports, and data from patient charts from individuals who have been treated for head and neck cancer. The aim is to analyze and correlate the findings between the pathological evidence of ENE and the imaging results, while also assessing the prognostic value of iENE. Additionally, the investigators will explore the influence of HPV status on these factors.\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, the investigators hope to establish standardized criteria that can assist radiologists in accurately identifying ENE through imaging tests. This research is essential for enhancing our understanding of HNSCC and improving the effectiveness of diagnostic procedures and treatment planning.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nOropharyngeal and laryngeal carcinomas account for 90% of newly diagnosed head and neck cancer (HNC) in Denmark. In the United Kingdom in 2018, 3800 new HNC patients were diagnosed and 1940 died. In the US in 2018, 64,670 new cases were diagnosed and 13,780 died. A main risk factor for HNC is tobacco smoking, along with alcohol consumption and diet. Recently, the human papilloma virus (HPV) has emerged as a significant risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC). OPSCC is highly curable if treated, while laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, and oral cavity HNC are generally of a more advanced and poorer prognosis.\nTo improve patient outcome, accurate and reliable staging of HNC is crucial. Tumor extent at presentation is important for treatment decision-making, prediction of clinical outcome, and can also affect quality of life. Several risk groups and staging systems have been developed and are widely accepted. For HNC, staging of the neck is primarily based on clinical and endoscopic examinations of the patient.\nDespite the availability of clinical and endoscopic staging, the diagnosis of HNC is frequently dependent on imaging, specifically CT and/or MRI scans of the head and neck. The radiologists use the scans to evaluate the primary tumor location, lymph node involvement, and presence of extranodal tumor extension (ENE). The radiologists assess the ENE on the CTs by looking for \"loss of circumscribed demarcation\" between the primary tumor and the lymph node. This is based on the assumption that the normal lymphatics are demarcated and therefore normal lymphatics should not cross. Thus, the presence of ENE relates to the loss of circumscribed demarcation of the lymphatic architecture.\nThis is the first multicenter study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists' assessments of ENE compared with the gold standard obtained via histopathology (the presence of ENE on the neck specimen, pathologic ENE [pENe])), as well as analyzing the prognostic significance of ENE. This study will serve as the basis for the development of a standardized reporting system for ENE.\nFor the purpose of this project, the investigators will define ENE as a tumor extension which appears to extrude the capsule of a lymph node or anatomical barrier. Radiologically, this is identified as \"loss of circumscribed demarcation\" between the tumor and the lymph node. The presence of this radiological finding will be defined as radiologic extranodal extension (rENE).\nThis is a retrospective, multi-institutional, international study based on data from consecutive patients treated for head and neck cancer. All patients eligible for inclusion must have sufficient imaging and clinical data available; this includes neck scans with or without contrast and either histopathology or clinical follow-up. The investigators will identify data from consecutive patients treated for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, carcinoma of unknown primary, laryngeal, or hypopharyngeal cancer and be over the age of 18. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria must be treated with curative intent via surgery, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy or a combination within the study inclusion period (1/1/1999-12/31/2020). Radiologic and clinical data available within a 3-month timeframe before the start of treatment must be available.\nThe investigators will only include HNC for this study if data of the imaging and the histopathology (primary or metastatic lesions) are available and if they could be traced back to a report of pENE. All patients should have at least two years of follow-up, or death. It is not necessary that all patients included in the study have ENE on the neck specimen (pENE) as only patients with sufficient imaging and clinical data can be included in the study. The study will include patients with pENE and patients without pENE in one single cohort. Patients treated palliatively at first presentation and patients presenting with recurrent disease will not be included.\nFollow-up data will be requested from the participating centers and include data on recurrence, localization of recurrence, overall survival, and disease-specific survival.\nThis is a multicenter international study",

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",

However, its use remains underused for various reasons. These include availability in some centers, high costs, and delays for conventional bone biopsies (conventional BB: surgical or radiological) which could lead to the loss of limb. In a few years, we have set up a simple blind biopsy procedure (Bedside BB) that involves a physician performing a biopsy through healthy skin at the bedside of the patient with DFU suspected of DFO. This procedure is effective, safe and has already been developed in more than 200 patients with DFO in the university departments of diabetology of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). Since its inception, more than 60 publications have studied the effectiveness of this new procedure in DFO: its safety, its equivalence to conventional biopsies, its sensitivity and its specificity in microbiological results. In order to extend the results of these preliminary and observational studies and to make Bedside BB a standard, the investigators have recently evaluated the feasibility of an randomised controlled trial comparing the safety and effectiveness of Bedside BB versus conventional biopsies. To evaluate the effectiveness, they have designed a multicentre open-label controlled non-inferiority trial. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the equivalence in treatment outcomes between Bedside BB and surgical conventional bone biopsy in patients with DFO.

For example, goals of care conversations, which are critical discussions between clinicians, patients, and families near the end of life, are less likely to occur for AAs than for Whites, and preferences are less likely to be followed when they do occur. Instead, families are more likely to be labeled as difficult if their decisions are incongruent with clinicians' recommendations. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences of structural racism. Efforts to address disparities need to address multiple factors such as patient-level cultural identity and EoL care values, interpersonal- and community-level norms for EoL communication and treatment, and healthcare institutional contexts for delivering EoL care in a setting affected by institutional racism. Our research group began to address this need with 'African American Community Speaks', a proof-of-concept prototype of a community-developed training program for clinicians caring for AA older adults with serious illnesses. The program originally focused on rural Southern older AAs and is not broadly generalizable across the US due to geographic differences in culture, attitudes, and communication preferences among AA persons in the US. Thus, we propose to adapt our prototype program to urban-dwelling Southern and Northern older AA adults using our established platform of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) in two geographically diverse regions: Birmingham, Alabama, and the Bronx, New York. To create the new training program called 'Caring for Older African Americans', our team of experts in CBPR, medical sociology, and clinical trials will work with local Community Advisory Boards to: 1. Conduct a comparative ethnographic study of urban dwelling AAs in the North and South to describe AA community values and preferences related to EoL care; 2. Adaptation of our prior community-developed training program by integrating community-developed storytelling videos for empathizing with experiences of racism in EoL care, guidelines for culturally concordant EoL care delivery, and adapting an existing implicit bias management program to goals of care communication; and 3. Conduct a cluster randomized trial in which we will randomize training times to 1 of 4 start dates using a stepped wedge design to accommodate the training of all clinicians and to mitigate the effect of secular trends. Patients' personal experience of racism will be measured using the discrimination subscale of the Group Based Mistrust Scale. The primary outcome will be patient/family's perception of therapeutic alliance using The Human Connection Scale. Secondary outcomes will be family-reported goal-concordant care, and clinicians' knowledge of cultural values, awareness of implicit bias, and confidence to change practice. This innovative effort will be the first training program that: 1. addresses culturally concordant care, systemic racism, and implicit bias management, the three key elements in enhancing the provision of equitable care; and 2. is designed and implemented in full partnership with two distinct AA communities in the South and the North of the US.",

Approaching the different dimensions of PSR calls on a dozen essential components: workload, autonomy, social support, burnout, anxiety, efforts made, rewards, work addiction, investment, etc. a specific questionnaire which usually contains 20 to 30 questions, so that having an overall view of PSR using the current reference questionnaires (Karasek, Siegrist, etc.) represents a total of more than 300 questions. The response time is thus incompatible with current medical practice (passage in the waiting room before the occupational health medical examination) and leads to a majority of non-responses during anonymous questionnaires on the Internet. On the other hand, these validated questionnaires were carried out by different people and are very heterogeneous between them, including in their formulation, so that the respondents have the impression of disorganization and anarchy. There is therefore a need for short, quick and uniform questionnaires. EVAs offer the incredible advantage of meeting these criteria: speed, uniformity, precision. From a data analysis point of view, EVAs also have the advantage of offering a continuous quantitative response, allowing the use of all statistical approaches. If some questionnaires have already been validated in the form of EVA, such as the EVA stress versus the  Perceived Stress Scale  questionnaire (PSS), the EVA workload and EVA autonomy at work versus the Karasek questionnaire, the other reference questionnaires are not yet validated in EVA (burnout, anxiety, efforts / rewards, work addiction, etc.).",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe prevalence of chronic diseases in developed countries is increasing, and their economic impact on the healthcare system is high. Chronic diseases have a high prevalence in Western countries. Healthcare costs in the United States of America alone are 7.8 million dollars, and the prevalence of chronic health conditions in England costs over 71 billion pounds a year. In France, an epidemiological study found that 60% of the population has several chronic diseases, some of which require regular medical appointments. In addition, these sick patients often have jobs that require them to meet deadlines and targets or are subject to a hierarchical regime, which can lead to burnout, defined as a chronic loss of motivation and an increase in job dissatisfaction, particularly if there is a discontinuity between efforts and rewards. Healthcare professionals are also part of these sick patients, and the effects of their job and burnout are increasingly recognized, especially among physicians with professional qualification. The economic cost of work burnout is considerable for the company, which is forced to retrain employees. Workers who are frequently absent from work because of burnout often lead to low productivity and less quality care for patients. Anxiety or depression is not uncommon in healthcare professionals, with a prevalence ranging from 5% to 29%. Chronic health conditions can also have an impact on employees' emotional state. Psychological burnout can lead to depression, anxiety or substance abuse, thus influencing a workers' quality of life and productivity.\nThere is an urgent need to assess a sick employee's health status and psychological quality. Some tools exist today to evaluate the emotional state of a person but often rely on self-declarations which may alter the results. In addition, some questionnaires are very exhaustive and long, making it difficult for patients to answer them. An alternative would be to introduce more visual tools that avoid the tediousness of a long questionnaire, the patient answers being less subjective. Visual analog scales have proven reliable in a few studies. These scales are easy to use, they do not require a lot of education of patients and often patients do not have to answer to open questions. This scale could quickly assess and track the evolution of the patient's well-being. Visual analog scales, if they can be validated, could be used as a complement to the regular questionnaire of healthcare professionals. The investigator aims to implement a questionnaire assessing the emotional state of the employee to better understand whether the company should provide more psychological support, thus preventing burnout. The investigator does not aim to redo existing questionnaires or to create a new tool to assess psychological state. The main goal is to create a simple, visual and understandable tool to quickly assess well-being. In addition, the investigator does not aim to assess a sick employee's physical state (other questionnaires can already exist for this) but to focus on their emotional one and their relationship with their job, in order to prevent burnout and decrease the risks of an emotional disturbance that may worsen their quality of life.",

The \u03b2-glucan is identified as a main component of BLEX 404. Not only with therapeutic potential on several types of cancer, BLEX 404 has also shown the potential to improve hematopoiesis, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, and the cytotoxicity activity of immune cells in recent animal studies. Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity.

The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. Many patients stay on the ICU/hospital for weeks. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore geriatric rehabilitation will be very likely required.\nGeriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments.\nOBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study to get insight into the course of functional and medical recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe.\nThe secondary objective is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organisation of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The study follows a pragmatic and observational design, and study-related data will be collected via a web-based data collection system on routine healthcare information from rehabilitation patients, which has no effect on their treatment and care in rehabilitation.\nPARTICIPANTS: This pan-European study involves cooperation between several countries across the world. Participants are patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection that recovered from their infection and are admitted to geriatric rehabilitation for a rehabilitation treatment.\nDATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES: The information about demographics (age), gender and diagnoses will be collected from the patients\u2019 own charts or from medical records of their referring general practitioner or hospital records. The information collected from their own charts will only include existing data, no additional procedures need to be performed to collect these data.\nThe following data will be collected at admission: demographics (year of birth/age, gender, premorbid residency), and if routinely collected data is available: level of ADL functioning (using the Barthel Index (BI) scale 0-20), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L scale 0-1), frailty (mMSE/SNAQ/NRS/MUST/Clinical Frailty Scale), cognition (MMSE/Demtect/ MOCA), mood/anxiety (/GDS/HADS), muscle strength (MRC biceps/quadriceps), fatigue (VAS scale), dyspnoea (VAS scale) and pain (NRS scale). Additional information that we receive in anonymised or descriptive way is the number of hospital readmissions, the length of stay in GR, discharge destination and ADL, quality of life, frailty, BMI, nutrition, cognition, mood/anxiety, fatigue, dyspnoea, pain, mobility/balance, muscle strength, and comorbidity/diagnostics will be documented at discharge.\nIn case of follow-up data, data will be collected for quality of life, fatigue, dyspnoea, nutritional status, frailty, post-traumatic stress syndrome and comorbidity and diagnostics.\nAll patient data are anonymised.\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS: Rehabilitation care is designed to improve the overall situation of the patient in the short and longer run. By optimising the rehabilitation care for COVID-19 patients the quality and speed of their recovery can be improved.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study will lead to better insights in the course of recovery of post-COVID-19 patients and can give more insight in the treatment modalities employed, and can lead to better and more targeted rehabilitation care for this group. In 2019, the European Union developed the Joint Programming Platfora 2 \u2018Preventing Mobility Disability and Promoting Mobility in Older Adults\u2019. The goal of the platform is to coordinate and improve intersectorial cooperation, which is of paramount importance to improve the outcome of rehabilitation. We hope this study will contribute to this effort that seeks to improve the evidence base for the benefits of rehabilitation in the European Union.",

Studies have demonstrated that patients that use everolimus instead of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) have a higher immune response after vaccination. Vaccine response against Varicella Zoster Vaccine (VZV) is also impaired in patients that use everolimus instead of MMF. Both the COVID-19 vaccine and the VZV require an optimal immune response to be fully effective. Therefore, we hypothesize that kidney transplant recipients who replace their MMF by everolimus, have an increased capacity to mount a specific immune response to both vaccines. The purpose of the \"PREPARE-iVAC\" trial is to evaluate replacement of MMF by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients on immunosuppression after vaccination. The main focus will be COVID-19 vaccination and vaccination against herpes zoster, but we will also investigate humoral and cellular immunity against varicella zoster. Moreover, we will evaluate safety of using everolimus instead of MMF in kidney transplant recipients. The hypothesis is that those who receive everolimus achieve better vaccine response, as measured by specific antibody concentrations and virus neutralising capacity, as compared to the MMF/MPA group.",

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

        "summary": "Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common genetic predisposition syndrome for colorectal cancer (CRC), responsible for around 2-4% of cancers. It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in this specific population. To this end, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing CAD EYE with CE in patients with LS.",

The physician's and CAD-EYE's predictions of histologic pathology of the colonic lesions will be reported separately;\no The CE group will undergo a colonic examination by chromo-colonoscopy with indigo carmine (IC) under white light. The physician's predictions of histologic pathology for the removed polyps will be reported. \nIn the CAD EYE group, when polyps are detected, these will be identified with the DOT mode of the colonoscope, and photographs taken and reported. Polyp location, size with and without biopsy, will be reported by the physician. The endoscopist will remove all adenomas or suspected later lesions immediately by snare polypectomy.\nPolyp location, size with and without biopsy, will be reported by the physician. The endoscopist will remove all adenomas or suspected later lesions immediately by snare polypectomy. \nResults: \nThe primary objective of the study is to compare the detection rate of adenomas and serrated lesions in the 2 study arms (CAD-EYE vs. CE). \nThe study also aims to evaluate CAD-EYE and CE predictive abilities for specific lesions and resect and discard strategy by comparing CAD-EYE histologists prediction to the physician's histologists prediction and the histological anatomopathological report. The performance of the CAD-EYE automated detection system assessed by its sensitivity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value will be compared to its automated prediction in comparison to colonoscopy indigo carmin chromo-colonoscopy. \nColonoscopy time will be analyzed under the 2 study arms as well. \nThe study should provide proof of the effectiveness of CAD EYE in the detection of colonic adenomas and serrated lesions in Lynch syndrome patients. The implementation of CAD EYE will also improve the predictive ability of the physician for this lesion. \nCAD EYE is expected to facilitate the adoption of a resect and discard strategy during colonoscopies in Lynch syndrome patients by improving the diagnostic specificity of the procedure. \nFinally, the system has a potential to reduce colonoscopy average procedure time. \nExpected results: \nResults of this study will provide a new tool to better detect colonic lesions in Lynch syndrome patients, while reducing the colonoscopy duration and the number of lesions taken care off.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvaluation of the CAD-EYE System for the Detection of Colorectal Neoplastic Lesions in Patients With Lynch Syndrome\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nLynch Syndrome\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Colorectal cancer screening with CAD EYE colonoscopy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Confirmed pathogenic mutation (",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBronchiectasis is a chronic disease characterized by thickening of the bronchial walls, chronic cough, sputum production and prone to recurrent infections. Many factors can be associated with bronchiectasis: congenital abnormalities can affect the bronchial development, immune inborn deficiencies cause chronic infections and lung damage, while external insults can cause the inflammatory changes that lead to bronchial wall destruction. Patients with bronchiectasis present with non-reversible airway obstruction. However, in contrast to asthma, the improvement in airway obstruction in response to bronchodilators in bronchiectasis is less clear. Bronchodilators are still among the most common therapies used in bronchiectasis despite the lack of a clear effect on disease progression and treatment of airway obstruction. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in bronchiectasis might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. Theoretically, in bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry testing can potentially cause changes in lung function for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether bronchodilator response is influenced by the time between spirometry and bronchodilator inhalation. This will be determined by performing bronchodilator response test (BDT) in the following order: 1) 30 minutes of regular spirometry followed by 4 puffs of salbutamol; 2) 30 minutes later the same procedure with placebo will be performed.

New and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity.\nThis study looks to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of such a model, using rehabilitation technology to enrich and enhance delivery of rehabilitation within an NHS inpatient stroke unit environment. This model of rehabilitation delivery has already been tested by the research team with community-dwelling participants in the chronic phase of stroke (over a year since stroke) and is known to be feasible and safe. Participants will be recruited from the stroke unit at University Hospital Wishaw during the acute and sub-acute phase of stroke (0-6 months since stroke), if requiring rehabilitation following a stroke and deemed medically fit enough to participate. Participants will be supported to complete activities in a newly dedicated 'technology enriched rehabilitation space' by NHS staff, in addition to their usual treatment. This will enable participants to engage in rehabilitation activities relating to their physical, cognitive, visual, communication and functional goals using equipment such as an adapted treadmill, interactive screens and tablets, upper limb exercise devices, power-assisted gym equipment and virtual reality. All devices are commercially available and known to be safe for use with stroke patients, however the use of such devices within NHS services is currently known to be under-utilised. Data will be obtained through a range of measures to monitor safety (incidence and types of adverse events), adherence (sessions/time attended, movement repetitions) and through interviews with participants, their family/carers, and staff to understand user acceptability.",

The only palliative treatment for respiratory failure is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which compensates for failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea. The persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy). To date, several studies have evaluated the effect of IVR on dyspnea in respiratory patients. However, studies conducted in populations other than ALS have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of IVR. Several studies have shown the interest of auditory distraction through music on dyspnea. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort (scale A1 of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire) of patients with ALS at the stage of respiratory failure treated by NIV. Method: This will be an open-label, monocentric, randomized, controlled cross-over clinical study.

Several studies have reported the positive impact of antibiotic susceptibility testing performed on urine cultures on the appropriate use of antibiotics.\nThe selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing , defined as the restriction of the list of antibiotics mentioned in the report according to the antibiotic resistance profile, would allow, according to observational studies, a reduction of 25 to 70% of the initial prescriptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics and a 20% rate of antibiotic de-escalation (=reduction of the antibacterial spectrum of an antibiotic treatment after re-evaluation).\nThe objective is to assess the impact of disseminating a selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing on the dispensing of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) for E. coli positive urine cultures in adult women, compared to the dissemination of a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequent bacterial infection among women, and antibiotic treatment, most of the time broad-spectrum, is associated with an increase in the risk of resistance. Since the majority of women with lower urinary tract infection (UTI) are managed by general practitioners (GPs), this study aims to promote the use of susceptibility testings (ST) among GPs, by providing a new report that recommends a targeted antibiotic therapy, and thereby reduce the consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nSince the early 2000s, the use of specific antimicrobials targeted at susceptibility profiles in GPs practices has been shown to lead to a reduction in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Bronner et al., 2006). More recently, the same approach, involving the use of selective reportings (SR) to promote ST in GP practices, was associated with a significant reduction in antibiotic prescribing in French primary care (Berenger et al., 2012). This SR approach is implemented from 2013 in all laboratories in France thanks to an inter-professional consortium in charge of its production (Consortium Interprofessionnel de D\u00e9lai de Livraison des Rapports de R\u00e9sistance). Indeed, the implementation of standardized targeted reporting by all clinical laboratories could be a major milestone to reduce the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in French primary care settings.\nWe hypothesize that a selective reporting among general practitioners would further reduce the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed among patients with E. coli UTI. We plan to compare four levels of treatment of E. coli UTI based on E. coli susceptibility, and their impact on the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Furthermore, given that the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic consumption may vary according to practice and patient characteristics, we plan to identify potential modifiers and mediators of this impact. Finally, we plan to measure the effect of this intervention on the rate of directed antibiotic de-escalation.\nWe will carry out a randomized controlled clinical trial among all GPs who receive ST from the LabOuest network (a public laboratory), and among women with E. coli UTI for which ST is performed in these laboratories over a one-year period. The sample size is estimated to 20 000 women.\nThis study is innovative in that it aims to optimize the use of ST by providing physicians with a recommendation that can lead directly to prescription of narrower-spectrum antibiotics.",

Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke.
