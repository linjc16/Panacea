        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThis study aims to understand the psychosocial factors (defense and psychological processes) and personality traits that may underlie NP, focusing on the role of early and adulthood traumatic experiences in predicting the onset and maintenance of NP, and the effects of NP on life, emotions, social relationships and the quality of life of the subjects. Thus the investigators will examine the psychosocial predictors of the onset and progression of Chronic Migraine (CM), Fibromyalgia (FM) and Vulvodynia (VU), in an effort to identify a common core of psychosocial characteristics in individuals who suffer from these disorders, despite showing quite different pain behavior. Given the heterogeneity of the three pathologies expressed by NP, it is necessary to investigate the characteristics that may differentiate them with reference to the type of personality, defense mechanisms, childhood traumatic events, and central sensitization. Ultimately, the study aims to identify subgroups of individuals who suffer from NP, based on similarities and differences in psychological variables, in order to tailor the best therapeutic practices for each patient.",

        "summary": "Aim: This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of two types of mattresses with different support surfaces used in bedridden patients.\nMethod: The sample of this quasi-experimental study consisted of 60 patients according to the inclusion criteria. A group I and group II of 30 patients each were formed from the sampled patients. For the patients in group I, a bed with a cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was used. For the patients in group II, a viscoelastic mattress was used. The data of the study were collected with the ''Patient Identification Form'', ''Braden Scale'', ''Pressure Wound Observation Form'' and ''Wound Measurement Chart''. Number-percentage distributions, Chi-square, Fisher's Exact Probability Test and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to evaluate the data.\nImplications for Clinical Practice: It was determined that the support surface used affected the pressure sore size and the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature created smaller sized wounds in the sacrum, trochanter, malleolus and heel regions. In the sacrum, scapula, and heel regions, although not statistically significant in terms of wound stage and the number of patients who developed pressure sores, it was seen that the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was more effective.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPressure injuries, also known as pressure sores, are a medical condition that affects elderly or bedridden patients. The formation of these wounds occurs for several reasons, such as long periods of sitting or lying down without adequate tissue perfusion. The goal of this study is to investigate the prevention effect of a modern mattress system compared to a standard mattress system. The standard mattress system is a viscoelastic mattress with an orthopedic foam system. In the experimental group, a modern mattress system with a support surface with vibration (massage) features, a cube/block system, and a ventilation system is used. To determine the risk of pressure ulcers, the patients' Braden Scores are calculated daily upon admission. The patients are then followed for four weeks, and their pressure ulcer risk is recorded on a daily basis. The pressure ulcer area is calculated with a square centimeter ruler using the Pressure Ulcer Observation Form. The number of patients without pressure ulcers is monitored in both groups, and the number of patients with a Braden Score of 13 or higher is compared statistically between the two groups. The investigators predict that bedridden patients using a mattress system with a support surface that reduces the pressure, vibration, and air exchange will have less pressure ulcer formation. These mattresses with cube/block systems have a greater area of low pressure that offers lower pressure to the patient, which may have a positive effect on prevention of pressure ulcers. The mattresses with cube/block systems are more expensive and cost approximately 400 more euros than the standard mattress, but the prevention of pressure ulcers and subsequent complications may lead to cost savings within a short time.",

OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed.

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

How well they do isn't as related to the kinds of treatment they get. However, there are significant side effects for the various types of treatments they may get. Because these patients generally have favorable outcomes no matter the kind of treatment, reducing side effects should be a priority when choosing their treatment.\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate whether a new blood test called a Circulating Tumor DNA test (ctDNA test) can decrease the number of people that require radiation after surgery. This blood test is often elevated in people when they are diagnosed with head and neck cancer. There are studies that show that cancer most often returns when this blood test is positive after treatment. This study will test patients' blood before and after surgery.

PBI is a hypo-fractionated treatment regimen for early breast cancer with a reduced treatment time of approximately one week. Recent evidence from randomized prospective trials is in favor of PBI as it allows better quality of life with no decrease in oncologic outcomes. However, some concern about the risk of local recurrence has persisted since no meta-analysis has been able to establish the risk due to the heterogeneity of the included studies and the impossibility of comparing PBI and WBI. The investigators believe that the reduction in treatment time and the low toxicity rate of daily fractionation allow the hypofractionated regimen to be safely compared with the standard fractionation regimen. The main hypothesis of this trial is that ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in either PBI or WBI is as effective in terms of oncologic control with less acute and late toxicity compared to the standard fractionation regimen. Specifically, the investigators aim to demonstrate that ultra-hypofractionated PBI and WBI are as effective as the standard fractionation regimen (26 Gy/50 Gy) with less toxicity and less financial burden on the health care system. Additionally, the investigators will assess patient-reported outcomes (PRO) (quality of life, body image, psychosocial burden and satisfaction with treatment), complication rates and late toxicities.

To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSynopsis: The gut microbiome has been implicated in several medical disorders including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular disease, ulcerative colitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux and gallstone disease. Gut microbes may either promote or impede the progression of many disorders and therefore have significant clinical implications for patients affected by them. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without but there are only a handful of small scale studies linking these differences with the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. Preliminary results from these studies suggest an association between gut microbiome diversity (the richness of the number of species present in the gut) and gallstone disease and that specific species may confer risk for symptomatic gallstone disease. Researchers are currently unaware of what these microbes are and whether these differences have any effect on the progression of gallstone disease or its complications. Therefore, this study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including those who develop complications following diagnosis and those who develop complications following cholecystectomy. It is intended that this work will help to identify the differences in gut microbiome in patients with gallstone disease compared to controls and link this to the development of complications. The knowledge gained from this study will allow researchers to devise strategies to reduce the number and severity of complications in patients with gallstone disease and ultimately result in a better patient experience and reduced use of NHS resources. This study is crucial in the first step in understanding differences in the gut microbiome that are linked to gallstone disease. The findings from this study will provide the evidence to support future larger scale studies or trials to determine interventions which can be used to reduce the development of complications in patients with this disorder.\n\nInclusion criteria: All adults (age >18 years of age) patients diagnosed with gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging at an East Kent University Foundation Trust Hospital.

Many patients with gallstone disease experience varying severity of symptoms including abdominal pain and bloating, which can result in considerable disruption to patients lives in addition to increased costs to the NHS. Cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment for symptomatic gallbladder disease. However, surgery carries risks including bleeding, infection and injury to surrounding structures.

        "summary": "Sepsis, characterized by severe organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated immune response to infection, is often life-threatening in clinical settings. Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis. Furthermore, we also evaluated the performance of APRI in hypoxic hepatitis and sepsis induced cholestasis (SIC), which are two subtypes of SALD.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nStudy design: 2 cohorts, consisting of sepsis patients with and without SALD, were selected for the investigators to further compare and analyze the patients' clinical data, characteristics, outcomes, and biochemical markers.\nObjectives: This study is an observational, retrospective cohort study, focusing on evaluating correlation between APRI and SALD in adult patients with sepsis.\nStudy population/sample: The MIMIC IV database for sepsis patients was downloaded from physionet. We performed a review, after which we selected the cases most relevant to our study. Inclusion criteria in the MIMIC IV database for sepsis patients included the following: 1) adult sepsis patients (\u226518 years) and 2) first hospitalization and first ICU admission. Exclusion criteria were: 1) all types of chronic liver disease; 2) viral hepatitis; 3) primary acute cholangiopathies; 4) cholecystitis; 5) hepatic infarction; 6) liver necrosis; 7) liver trauma; 8) length of ICU stay< 24 hours; 9) Patients without simultaneous AST and PLT data in the first 24 hours after ICU admission.\nThere were 87 234 patients in our database. Ultimately, 326 patients with APRI data and simultaneous AST and PLT data were enrolled.\nData collection and extraction: The database(MIMIC IV), which contains patient demographics, characteristics, and hospital data, was used. The biochemical markers were also assessed, both in the database and by additional laboratory testing. The extracted indicators include age, weight, gender, comorbidities, infection site, disease severity scores, vital signs, treatment received, blood parameters and clinical endpoints.\nThe MIMIC IV database for sepsis patients was downloaded from physionet (http://www.physionet.org) at 19:06 on Jan. 7, 2019. It contains detailed, longitudinal EMR data for sepsis patients in three adult ICUs from 2008 through 2012 in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\nData analysis: APRI and incidence of SALD will be evaluated using logistic regression analyses. We will use 0.5 of APRI as a cut-off to discriminate the association between APRI and SALD. The APRI and clinical indices were dichotomized into a high APRI group (APRI > 0.5) and low APRI group (APRI \u2264 0.5). The SALD group is used for comparison, and the non-SALD group is used as the control group. Risk differences will be calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals for differences.\nLogistic regression will be performed to evaluate the association between incidence of SALD with APRI, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidity, infection site, disease severity scores, APACHE II, and initial serum hemoglobin levels. Odds ratios, along with 95% confidence intervals for differences, will be calculated.\nExpected results: APRI is a simple, inexpensive, and widely available marker of liver disease. It is calculated by (AST(IU/L)/ upper limits of normal)/PLT(k/uL)\u00d7100. We hypothesized that APRI will be elevated in patients with SALD, regardless of etiology. In the current study, patients with higher APRI values will be more likely to develop SALD as compared to those with lower APRI values. Additionally, APRI > 0.5, which we set in our study, will be predictive of SALD.

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

The patient physical and psychological sufferings in ALS are immense, and apart from Riluzole, there is no effective treatment.

Perhaps the most challenging topic of ALS care is the decision to extend ventilation support into the stages of disease that require treatment both during day and night. In these cases, treatment is clearly life-sustaining and although quality of life may be maintained, the burden of caregiving imposed upon family or health care workers is huge, regardless of tracheostomy (TIV) or non-invasive (NIV) modality.\nThe present study is a longitudinal questionnaire study in Norway measuring overall quality of life, health-related quality of life, and disease-specific quality of life in ALS patients, partners and children before and after the introduction of life sustaining ventilation support.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground : Motor Neuron Disease (MND) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with high morbidity. It is considered a medical emergency that is progressive, severe and life threatening. The diagnosis of MND is made on a combination of clinical findings including signs and symptoms related to dysfunction of the motor system, and supported by neurophysiological investigations and imaging techniques that do not show any other abnormalities attributable to other diseases causing motor impairment. Most people with MND die from respiratory failure, and this can be a slow process that can last from a few months to years. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been shown to improve exercise capacity, sleep quality, and quality of life in some cases, and has been implemented as a standard treatment for MND in adults. Intriguingly, however, the effect of ventilation and the decision to offer it in the outset has not been systematically studied in MND. Patients and their families suffer from the physical, psychological and social changes that occur both with the disease itself and as a consequence of the decision about long term ventilation. Currently, the decision about the treatment with long term ventilation is made in a non - standardized way in clinical practice, with the focus on preventing respiratory failure. When patients and their families experience respiratory failure or discomfort, it can become a medical emergency that requires acute medical support and, possibly, intubation and mechanical ventilation that has both short and long term consequences for the patients and their partners and children. In most cases, however, the decision for ventilation is made because of a deteriorating quality of life, and before this can happen, the patients and their partners should be informed about the pros and cons of this treatment.\nObjective : To examine objectively the effects of long-term ventilation support and the support of health care professionals on the quality of life of ALS patients and their families and to explore reasons for their decision making with regards to the treatment.\nMethods : Long-term ventilation support will be defined as ventilation that is not intended to be used temporarily (e.g. during acute respiratory insufficiency), but planned to be used continuously and for an extended period of time. Patients with or without such treatments will be included in an active clinical intervention cohort study. Inclusion criteria for patients: A clinical diagnosis of probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria. Progression of the illness leading the consulting physician to offer NIV or NPPV in the outset of the disease. Can communicate in Norwegian. Inclusion criteria for partners of ALS patients: Partner of a patient that suffers from ALS with progression of the illness leading the consulting physician to offer NIV or NPPV in the outset of the illness. Can communicate in Norwegian. Inclusion criteria for children: Children from 8 years and older having a parent who suffers from ALS with progression of the illness leading the consulting physician to offer NIV or NPPV in the outset of the illness. Can communicate in Norwegian. Exclusion criteria for patients, partners and children of ALS patients: 1.Potential participants with cognitive impairment or dementia.\nThe following outcome measures will be used in the study: The primary outcome is the change in overall quality of life, measured by the Quality of Life Scale, which will be completed by the patient, his/her partner, and his/her children. Other outcome measures include quality of life measured by the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire, health-related quality of life measured by the Kidsscreen-27 and self-reported measures of health perceptions, psychological distress and burden of caregiving. In addition, patients' symptoms and survival will be recorded up to 2 years. Discussion: This project will contribute to the knowledge about the effect of long-term ventilation support in MND and the effect of this treatment with respect to quality of life, psychological distress and burden of caregiving. It will contribute to the knowledge base on patient care and decision-making in ALS and improve the quality of care in ALS. This in turn may improve the well-being of patients and help them to decide, based on more information, whether or not they wish to start with long-term mechanical ventilation, and how these decisions will affect them and their family. If ventilation has a positive effect of the quality of life, but not the symptom burden, it is possible that ventilation support can be a useful treatment for both patients and their families. If mechanical ventilation has a negative impact on the quality of life, it is reasonable to consider other methods of treatment, or to discontinue treatment if symptom burden increases.\nThis project will contribute to the quality of care",

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChronic subdural hematomas (cSDH), due to head trauma, have an estimated annual incidence of 1 per 1000 population. Though most cases will resolve following surgical evacuation of the hematoma, post-operative degradation in clinical status is common and it is often a challenging clinical dilemma in regard to optimal management.\nStudying EEG signatures may help predict post-operative neurologic function. In general, post-traumatic spreading depolarization (SD) events are associated with post-operative worsening in patients with a cSDH. The primary goal of this study is to use EEG measures to differentiate between SD and non-SD associated cSDH.\nSpecifically, we will compare three EEG measures of SD associated cSDH: 1) frequency of SD, 2) duration of SD, and 3) volume of brain tissue involved with SD. These measurements will be compared to neurological outcomes (disability, cognitive function, and health related quality of life). The secondary outcome of this study is to assess the association of EEG SD events, when present, with clinical outcomes in patients undergoing surgical evacuation of cSDH.\nBy correlating EEG-related characteristics of SD in cSDH with outcomes as assessed by functional and cognitive measures post operatively and longer term outcomes, this study will provide insights into post-operative neurologic status and may impact clinical decision making and rehabilitation planning. Since EEG will be employed, our study will not impact the current standard of care. The proposed study aims to provide fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms of neurologic deterioration in patients with cSDH. The proposed study has several advantages: \n1. This study aims to provide important information to aid in clinical decision-making. SD events may be associated with deleterious neurological outcomes in patients with cSDH, and elucidating this may influence the decision to either observe or proceed with surgical drainage. Thus, this study will contribute to patient care and outcomes.\n2. Because EEG monitoring is an easy and relatively inexpensive method, this study will provide a valuable tool for future studies investigating this same question.\n3. This research is focused on patients with acute, as well as chronic, subdural hematomas. This is important as most studies have used only patients with chronic cSDH.\n4. This study is relevant to most neurosurgical practices in the United States, where cSDH is a common occurrence in patients seen in the emergency room.\n5.

Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials on the inflammatory component of the disease, reducing the annualized relapse rate by 46% and the rate of new T2 lesions by 80% compared with interferon-\u03b2 1a.\nThe use of anti-CD20 agents, including ocrelizumab, is associated with an infectious risk that increases with duration of exposure, part of which is due to the development of hypo-gammaglobulinemia in relation to cumulative dose.\nSeveral reports suggest a persistent effect of anti-CD20 drugs in MS, with no resumption of inflammatory activity after discontinuation:\nDuring the development of ocrelizumab, at the end of phase 2, after having received 3 or 4 semi-annual cycles of ocrelizumab, a safety period with a therapeutic window of 18 months was planned, before re-administration in the extension study. During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic pathology characterized by relapses of neurological symptoms and a progressive worsening of neurological impairment leading to physical and cognitive disability. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool to monitor the disease and to assess the therapeutic efficacy of MS treatments. In our routine practice at the Toulouse Neurology Hospital, we prescribe regular follow-up MRI in patients with MS.\nOcrelizumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was designed as an interferon-\u03b2 re-evaluation treatment in MS and more especially in Relapsing Remitting MS. Clinical trials have proven its efficacy in treating MS and its role in slowing down the cognitive decline and the physical disability.\nThis anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody has been distributed for more than 5 years in France for the treatment of MS. The ocrelizumab injection is a continuous treatment with initial 3 treatments per year, followed by one injection per year for two more years in patients with active MS.\nSince its introduction in 2017, we have noted that the initial treatment was effective, but in some cases, clinical deterioration was observed after a year of follow up. These progressive diseases, which occur despite treatment with ocrelizumab, pose new concerns for the patient and the neurologist.\nConsequent to this observation, the manufacturer has been contacted to allow an earlier intervention, with the option to inject again every 6 months. \nFor the patient and the neurologist, the use of less than 3 annual administrations would be preferable to a monthly injection on one hand and to a weekly injection during 4 years on the other hand. For the patient, the treatment of MS has a significant impact not only on their physical and cognitive impairment but also on their family and social life.

        "summary": "Mortality following elective colorectal cancer surgery range between 2.5-6% and increase for the elderly and frail patient regardless of T-stage. Around 80% of the patients who present with a colon cancer and is in a condition where surgery is possible will be offered resection of the tumor. A part of the colon is always removed together with the lymph nodes in order to ensure that cancer cells are not left behind. The risk of lymph node metastasis is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. The overall risk of lymph node metastases is less than 20 % in patients with early colon cancer. This indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer have no benefit of additional resection besides local tumor excision. The alternative to resecting a larger part of the bowel is to make more focused surgery only resecting a small part of the bowel part through a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. This new organ sparing approach is called Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS). The investigators aimed to examinate the hypothesis that organ preserving approach (CELS) provides superior quality of recovery in elderly frail patients with small colon cancers when compared with standard surgery in RCT.",

The main treatment for the radical resection of tumors in the colon is a segmental resection where the section of the section of colon is removed together with tumor. This resection is performed according to the rules of the oncologists - oncologic principles (CRC principles).\nThe primary objective of radical resection is to obtain a tumor-free margin, which should be more than 1 mm, in terms of clinical oncology terminology is called \"R0\", i.e., resection for cure or complete remission.\nFor small non-invasive colonic adenocarcinomas, there are discussions for the use of minimal invasive procedures, which can be performed without removing full sections of the colon. This type of procedure is called Organ Sparing, Organ Preserving or non-standard procedures, e.g. endoscopic submucous dissection (ESD). In our study, we describe a minimal invasive procedure called the Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) which provides endoscopic and laparoscopic methods for performing a minimally invasive procedure for small colonic adenocarcinomas. In this study we will evaluate if it can be used in patients who are frail and over 75 years old.\nThe investigators hypothesize that CELS can be performed with regard to oncological principles and lead to increased patient-reported recovery. The investigators also need to determine whether the new technique has a higher risk of cancer recurrence compared with the traditional colonic resection with an intact mesenter.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: \n74 patients will be included in a two-armed prospective randomized controlled trial at the Dept. of surgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. Patients above 75 years of age or otherwise judged frail and fit to undergo elective colon resection for small (T1N0) colonic adenocarcinoma located in the proximal colon. Patients will be screened and examined pre-operatively by an oncologic MTD. Eligible patients will be randomized to either the CELS or the standard colonic resection group. In both the CELS and the standard colonic resection procedures, all procedures will be performed under general anesthesia and according to current oncological principles. The CELS group will undergo the hybrid endoscopic laparoscopic procedure, whereas the standard surgery group will have the colonic section removed using oncological principles. Assessment of postoperative morbidity and mortality, change in patients' functional capacity and quality of life, and assessment of histopathological risk factors and long-term oncological outcomes will be performed.\nThe investigators believe that the study design follows the criteria of good clinical practice.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nRationale\n-----------------\nBackground:\nNeuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are a heterogeneous group of over 70 disorders resulting from a defect in a specific type of muscle protein, such as neurofilaments, dystrophin, laminin, potassium channels, collagen proteins, troponin or creatine kinase. People with neuromuscular diseases may have difficulty in breathing. Spinocerebellar ataxias, the most common inherited ataxias, are another cause of neurogenic lung weakness. People with neurogenic lung weakness are more likely to have infections, lung damage leading to scarring or bronchial dilatation, and eventually require ventilatory support or are at risk of dying from respiratory-related cause. The treatment of lung damage is based on removal of secretions through airway clearance techniques and drugs to reduce infection and inflammation in the airway. The airway clearance techniques employed consist of simple cough techniques and chest physiotherapy, like percussion, forced expiration, and postural drainage. Aerosol delivery, that is, the delivery of drug into the airway during breathing, is often used. Aerosol delivery can be in the form of inhalation or nebulisation. Nebulisation involves turning a liquid medication into a fine mist that can be breathed in with regular breathing. Nebulised saline can help to clear secretions in the lungs and reduce the risk of infections by acting like a natural expectorant to thin secretions. People with neuromuscular diseases are at risk of breathing in too much salt into their lungs. This is called hypertonic saline poisoning, and requires admission to hospital for treatment with intravenous fluids and close monitoring. It is not known whether more frequent nebulisation of saline may lead to more salt in the lungs of people with neuromuscular diseases. This is likely to depend upon how much is breathed in, and the balance between the beneficial effects of nebulised saline and the risks of breathing in too much salt.\n\nObjectives:\nThe objective of this study is to determine the amount of salt in the airway of people with NMD or neurodisability, following nebulisation of saline using different concentrations.",

        "summary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nGliomas are the most common tumors of the central nervous system, accounting for 20% of all brain tumors. Despite the many advancements, therapy remains challenging in many patients, particularly those with malignant, \"high-grade\" gliomas. Because of their invasive nature, these tumors are not able to be completely removed by surgery. For this and other reasons, radiation and chemotherapy are often given after tumor removal in an effort to eradicate any remaining tumor cells. Tumors are metabolically active, and use more energy from the food consumed, compared to normal brain. This increased activity can be visualized by a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, there are only a few PET scanners, and many patients do not have access to them. This means that patients often have to wait months or years after their tumor removal for their first PET scan. This is usually not enough time for clinicians to make decisions on the effectiveness of radiation and chemotherapy. This problem is particularly important in young or elderly patients who may have difficulty undergoing MRI scans or in those with medical conditions that are worsened by lying in the MRI scanner. They may need surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to be started as quickly as possible, leading to potential overtreatment in some cases and delay in therapy in others. The investigators believe that a new metabolic imaging approach using an MRI based approach, \"aMRI\" may offer advantages to both patients and physicians. The investigators have developed a powerful new metabolic measurement technique (named k\u1d62\u2092*V) that can be used during MRI scans, in the same device used for structural MRI scans. This has been successfully used in animals to differentiate benign and malignant brain tumors in normal brains, but has never been evaluated in human subjects. The investigators first need to confirm that this method is robust and reproducible in human subjects, and compare it with the current standard of care, PET.\nBased on its promising results in the above mentioned studies, the investigators have developed an MRI based approach to measure brain activity at 3 tesla in various disease states and in normal subjects. This includes:\n- Patients with gliomas\n- Metabolic profile before brain surgery\n- Metabolic profile after brain surgery\n- Metabolic profile in different conditions of the brain in which glucose metabolism is altered (normal subjects, diabetic patients, acute stroke patients) and\n- Metabolic profile in different brain diseases (seizures, neurocutaneous syndromes, autism, etc.) and normal subjects.\nFor gliomas, the investigators will measure brain activity using the new aMRI approach in comparison to the current gold standard of PET. In patients with glioma, a tumor or \"lesion\" is an abnormal mass or area, detected on standard brain images, that is likely to be due to tumor. Surrounding healthy brain tissues normally show increased metabolic activity (shining bright in \u00b9\u2078FDG PET) in response to the tumor, and this is thought to be due to the tumor cells \"feeding\". However, while the tumor is metabolically active, many of the normal-appearing, surrounding tissues which are thought to have the potential to eventually form tumor are still able to maintain good blood flow and provide nutrition. In addition, some normal-appearing tissues may not provide enough nutrition to maintain normal function and can therefore undergo some degree of damage, which can lead to problems with memory and thinking. The investigators will test their hypothesis that the MRI based approach, aMRI, can differentiate between the normal appearing tissues in the brain that are good and those that are bad, and thereby, identify new treatment targets in brain cancers. The investigators will also test whether the activity difference between the tumor and normal-appearing tissues is different in different forms of the disease, including benign and malignant types, and the type that is more or less likely to be sensitive to the standard chemotherapeutic drugs that are used currently in patients with brain cancer.\nThe investigators believe that this research project will make important contributions to improving the evaluation of brain cancer and development of new treatment strategies by directly comparing the MRI based approach to the current standard PET scans.",

HF and its chronic symptoms and progressive symptoms are associated with an estimated annual healthcare expenditure of $30.7 billion in the United States alone. Despite advances in pharmacological and device therapy, heart failure continues to have a poor prognosis with 50% risk of hospitalization or death within the first 6 mo after diagnosis, and average 5-year mortality remains at 50%. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) that maximizes evidence-based pharmacotherapy, including use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), beta-blockers (BB), aldosterone antagonists (AA), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), reduces morbidity and mortality in HF patients. Patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) have the most consistent and prominent benefit when GDMT is optimized. A key issue surrounding GDMT underutilization is the recognition that in primary care practice, the number of guideline-specified pharmacotherapy doses that require an up-titration, addition of a new class of treatment, or discontinuation of contraindicated medications can be substantial due to patient heterogeneity. Further, although current heart failure therapies (eg, ACEI, BB) help patients with HFrEF, there are recent developments in novel therapies including SGLT2i and ARNI. ARNI provides benefit over ACEi/ARB in terms of reducing the combined endpoint of death from any cause and hospitalization for heart failure. However, there is limited evidence on the use of novel GDMT therapies in real world settings especially in HFrEF population, when compared to ACEi/ARB. It is increasingly clear that multi-prong approaches (combination of strategies) are needed to further optimize GDMT among patients with HFrEF in primary care settings.\nThe purpose of this intervention study is to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF seen in primary care practices. We hypothesize that the addition of (1) multiprong clinical decision support (CDS); (2) focused education; and (3) physician and pharmacist referral options, (4) enhanced by electronic patient note reminders and patient portal messages to enhance clinician and patient awareness of key HF guidelines, and (5) targeted at different primary care practitioners' (PCPs) behaviors and preferences will lead to GDMT intensification in patients with chronic HFrEF receiving primary care. The investigators are also interested in identifying specific combinations of interventions that result in the best improvement in guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in these settings.\nThis study is a single-blinded randomized parallel group study with a non-randomized factor (education versus delayed education) and will be conducted on 6 outpatient cardiology clinics within the Geisinger Clinic system. Approximately 4000 (1600 per practice clinic) patients with chronic HFrEF \u2265 18 years of age will be allocated via a stratified block randomized design into no intervention (control), multiprong CDS, multiprong CDS with pharmacist referral, and focused education at the clinic level. Patients in these four study arms will not interact with each other and will follow their individual study arms' randomization over a 12-month period.\nTo achieve balanced allocation of practices by cardiologist preference for pharmacist referral (P = 0.40) and cardiologist preference for electronic patient note reminders/patient portal messages (P = 0.70), the investigators will stratify by specialty (cardiologist or non-cardiologist) and by cardiologist referral habits over the previous 12-month period to estimate a 45%/45%/10% proportional distribution of clinics within these categories to the following arms (intervention/control, respectively): (1) no intervention, (2) multiprong CDS, (3) multiprong CDS+referral, (4) education.\nClinics will be randomized to one of the four study arms, after which each 24-month period within a clinic will be randomized to either early or delayed education rollout.\nClinical decision support-intervention\nThe intervention will involve adding multiple forms of BPAs in the electronic medical record (EMR).

Its role as part of medical expulsion therapy for the treatment of patients with kidney and ureteric stones has proved to be of considerable success. However, its role in clearing upper ureteric stones as an adjunct to ESWL is controversial.

In patients who have developed ureteric stone for the first time the possibility of spontaneous passage of these stones is about 40-50%. In cases where the stone is less than 6 mm chances of spontaneous passage is about 80% but in larger stones chance of spontaneous passage is about 30-40% of patients.\nStone clearance by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has improved significantly in the last two decades, with success rate and stone\u2010 free rates reaching 95% with new generation lithotriptors.

It is believed that alpha blockers play an important role in the treatment of ureteric stones, by augmentation of ureteric blood flow, relaxation of the peri ureteric fibrous tissue and hence facilitate stone fragment dislodgment and spontaneous passage.\nHence the investigators hypothesize that in patients with upper ureteric stones of size ranging from 6-15 mm the addition of tamsulosin therapy to the ESWL treatment protocol would lead to higher stone clearance by ESWL after one week of procedure as compared to ESWL alone.",

The stenotic site was examined endoscopically (directly after the intervention by a laryngologist and one month later during fiber optic bronchoscopy by a thoracic surgeon). The laryngeal-tracheal area was then imaged using computed tomography (CT). In all cases, the self-retainer was kept in place for about 6 months, up to tracheal and tube removal. All patients underwent decannulation after intervention, with a maximum follow-up period of 12 months. In all of the 17 patients enrolled in the study, the self-retainer was positioned correctly and retained its position, enabling complete decannulation with no complications after the intervention. One patient died from cardiac arrest at 3 months (no direct involvement of the technique). There was no significant deterioration in glottis morphology during the follow-up period. All patients were successfully decannulated. In conclusion, transarterial cryosurgery combined with APC plus the insertion of the self-retainer in the trachea appears to be an effective and safe treatment for tracheal stenoses resulting from a previous tracheotomy.",

        "summary": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by a variety of other symptoms, such as bipolar disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), etc. The behavioral and social complications often marginalize the population, impact on life satisfaction, undermined societal values that impact on economic and financial fairness, and so forth. Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.\nThe research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.\nThe study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care. Contributed by the sociostructural elements and necessities, black market amphetamine and ketamine have not only emerged in the regime for decades, but also have become a lucrative business. Their recreational uses are also sometimes accompanied by real necessities and needs; black markets cater to the needs but guidance on the usages is based on word-of-mouth stories without professional medical assistances. There is one case the Principal Investigator (PI) collected, that one person, possibly under depression contributed by PTSD, took relatively high dosage of amphetamine and went into a state of psychosis with overwhelming persecution mania.

Evidence of poor contraceptive counseling is widespread, with multiple methods for measurement and many different aspects to consider. Conventional clinical measures for assessing quality of family planning counseling and its determinants could be used to support reproductive health. In 2017, Holt, Dehlendorf, and Langer created a framework for contraceptive counseling quality grounded in quality of care and human rights principles and research in healthcare communication. Based on this framework, Holt et al. developed and validated the Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale, which covers three interrelated aspects of counseling quality: information exchange, interpersonal relationship, and disrespect and abuse . The scale comprehensively measures aspects of the counseling process related not only to information receipt but also individuals' experiences having the opportunity to participate in the method selection process and the degree to which they had positive and trusting experiences with the provider . Associations between quality of contraceptive counseling and characteristics of clients, such as age, education, and reproductive status, could represent significant health disparities and indicate the need for research.

It includes : 1) information exchange, 2) interpersonal relations, and 3) disrespect and abuse in contraceptive counseling. The information exchange subscale consists of ten items, the interpersonal relationship subscale consists of seven items, and the disrespect and abuse subscale consists of five items. Item responses were given on four-point Likert scales. Response categories for positively worded items were completely agree (4), agree (3), disagree (2), and completely disagree (1). Response categories for negatively worded items were yes (1), yes with doubts (2), no with doubts (3), and no (4). Composite subscale and total scores were calculated as mean scores .

Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMultiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality, affecting young to middle-aged individuals with a devastating impact on their quality of life. Standard medical management aims at symptom control and the identification of potential triggers for fluctuations. In spite of various disease progression models, the identification of suitable therapeutic targets in order to personalize therapies is hampered by the variable course of the disease and incomplete understanding of the biological pathways associated with MSA. As a consequence, the optimal management of individuals with MSA is still defined by a multidisciplinary approach, but its implementation can be demanding, particularly in geographically dispersed populations. The impact of the disease, including autonomic, motor, and cognitive dysfunction can affect the quality of life of the patients, as well as the caregivers of the patients. The burden of caregiving is associated with physical and psychological morbidity.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a multidisciplinary, personalized treatment plan, based on a predefined standardized operational protocol and adapted to individual needs, in order to improve quality of life and reduce caregiver burden in individuals with MSA. With the advancement of technological solutions, this study will integrate telemedicine components with mobile palliative solutions, to improve access and continuity of care in an aging population. We plan to recruit 46 individuals with MSA fulfilling all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria for this trial. The study will follow a randomized, parallel design. At baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months after the baseline visit, the individuals with MSA will undergo a comprehensive clinical, psychological and neuro-rehabilitation assessment. The individualized treatment plan, including telemedicine and mobile palliative care offer, and therapy adaptations will be made based on the individualized assessment of therapeutic needs and healthcare preferences, and monitored throughout the 18 months study period. Twenty-three patients will be randomized to receive additional monthly and on-demand neurological, psychological, physio-, occupational and speech therapy telemedicine visits (based on individual needs). The therapeutic interventions will be documented, and the monthly follow-up visits will allow for the monitoring of caregiver burden and the identification of barriers to compliance. The study will be evaluated in terms of effect on the baseline to 18 months-change in the EQ-5D-5L score, the MSA-QoL score and subscores, UMSARS (video-based, rater-blinded assessment of the UMSARS motor score and Hoehn & Yahr changes over the study period), and the individual healthcare preferences of individuals with MSA and their informal caregivers. Based on our previous work on telemedicine in MSA, we expect to improve the coordination of care, adherence to the therapeutic plan and the overall quality of life within the 18 months of this study, to be eventually integrated as a standard component into the management of the disease. Successful management of the disease associated with improvements in quality of live and support in the informal caregivers will have a direct impact on the daily practice of healthcare professionals involved in the care of people with MSA. The proposed clinical trial will contribute to a comprehensive approach for the development of a new, patient-centered, evidence-based model of management in individuals with MSA.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nMedical Decision Making in Multiple System Atrophy: Developing Personalized Best Medical Care With Integrated Telemedicine and Mobile Palliative Care for Individuals With Multiple System Atrophy\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nMultiple System Atrophy\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Telemedicine visits\n* Other: Multidisciplinary, personalized symptomatic treatment\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria For individuals with MSA: i.

The purpose of the study is to identify differences in the genetic characteristics of participants who responded well or poorly to growth hormone therapy. No medications or other treatments are provided to the participants by Novo Nordisk as part of this study. The study will last for up to 1 year.

ISS is a common condition, affecting approximately 2-3% of the paediatric population. Clinicians face the challenge of having to assess the likelihood of response to GH therapy among children with ISS before starting the treatment. The main consequence of a non-responder (poor responder) outcome is the withdrawal of an ineffective therapy, associated with significant costs, both personal and system-based.\nThe hypothesis to be tested in this study is that ISS has a partly, but nevertheless, genetic basis. However, this genetic basis might be heterogeneous and thus may vary among children with the same condition/phenotype. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the molecular profile (measured through genetic variants) will provide additional information for clinicians to predict treatment response after initiation of GH therapy.\nWe will compare the genetic profiles between good responders and poor responders to identify the differences in the frequency and count of genetic variants per gene/pathway that contribute to the different response to GH. The study expects to enrol 600 children with ISS, 300 good responders and 300 poor responder. Each participant will provide one non-invasive biological sample. The main outcome measure is the frequency and count of genetic variants per gene/pathway, which will be determined by a panel of genetic panels and the ISSomics\u00ae test (R&O Genetics GmbH).\nTo facilitate the dissemination of the study results, the participants will be asked to allow the use of data and bio-samples for future research purposes in anonymized and de-identified format.",

        "summary": "Background: Following acute brain injury (ABI), patients are monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) where providers rely on frequent neurological examinations (neurochecks) to assess for neurodeterioration. Serial neurochecks are part of guideline recommendations, but there is equipoise between hourly (Q1) and every-other-hour (Q2) evaluation. In the ICU, care-related awakenings occur frequently, but it is unclear if differential neurocheck frequencies result in differential sleep, providing the scientific premise for this proposal.\nPopulation: Twenty-two patients (N=11 per group) who have undergone elective aneurysm coiling will be enrolled. On post-operative day (POD) 0, patients will be screened and approached for informed consent if they do not meet exclusion criteria, e.g., prior intracranial injury, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, mechanical ventilation. Patients with elective aneurysm coiling are being chosen because they require ICU level of care following their intracranial procedure, but do not have structural brain injury or ongoing sedation needs that might impact sleep measurements.\nMethods: Usual care: Patients are monitored every 15-30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-procedure, then Q1 or Q2 for up to 24 hours. If these patients remain stable, they are discharged home on post-operative day (POD) 1. Proposed Intervention: Enrolled patients will be randomized to Q1 or Q2 neurochecks following the institutionally required 6 hours of stable neurological and vascular checks. Once randomized, patients will undergo placement of electroencephalogram (EEG) with video, electrooculogram, and chin lead. The video EEG will be in place for at least 8 hours to include the overnight (10PM-6AM) time period. Following completion of the recording, the signals obtained will be reviewed by a blinded polysomnographic sleep technician for sleep characteristics including quantitative assessments of wakefulness, deep (N3) sleep, REM sleep, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation and arousals.

        "summary": "Extranodal extension (ENE) refers to the spread of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) outside the lymph nodes. It is a well-known factor that indicates a poorer prognosis and outcome for patients who have undergone surgical removal of the cancer. In such cases, it is recommended to combine chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery.\nAs the number of cases of HNSCC related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) is increasing, treatment approaches have shifted towards using radiation therapy as the primary treatment method instead of surgery. This raises an important question about the significance of ENE observed through imaging tests (referred to as iENE) and its impact on the prognosis. Unfortunately, this question remains unanswered.\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study across multiple medical institutions. The investigators will gather data including scan results, histopathology reports, and data from patient charts from individuals who have been treated for head and neck cancer. The aim is to analyze and correlate the findings between the pathological evidence of ENE and the imaging results, while also assessing the prognostic value of iENE. Additionally, the investigators will explore the influence of HPV status on these factors.\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, the investigators hope to establish standardized criteria that can assist radiologists in accurately identifying ENE through imaging tests. This research is essential for enhancing our understanding of HNSCC and improving the effectiveness of diagnostic procedures and treatment planning.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nOropharyngeal and laryngeal carcinomas account for 90% of newly diagnosed head and neck cancer (HNC) in Denmark. In the United Kingdom in 2018, 3800 new HNC patients were diagnosed and 1940 died. In the US in 2018, 64,670 new cases were diagnosed and 13,780 died. A main risk factor for HNC is tobacco smoking, along with alcohol consumption and diet. Recently, the human papilloma virus (HPV) has emerged as a significant risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC). OPSCC is highly curable if treated, while laryngeal, hypopharyngeal, and oral cavity HNC are generally of a more advanced and poorer prognosis.\nTo improve patient outcome, accurate and reliable staging of HNC is crucial. Tumor extent at presentation is important for treatment decision-making, prediction of clinical outcome, and can also affect quality of life. Several risk groups and staging systems have been developed and are widely accepted. For HNC, staging of the neck is primarily based on clinical and endoscopic examinations of the patient.\nDespite the availability of clinical and endoscopic staging, the diagnosis of HNC is frequently dependent on imaging, specifically CT and/or MRI scans of the head and neck. The radiologists use the scans to evaluate the primary tumor location, lymph node involvement, and presence of extranodal tumor extension (ENE). The radiologists assess the ENE on the CTs by looking for \"loss of circumscribed demarcation\" between the primary tumor and the lymph node. This is based on the assumption that the normal lymphatics are demarcated and therefore normal lymphatics should not cross. Thus, the presence of ENE relates to the loss of circumscribed demarcation of the lymphatic architecture.\nThis is the first multicenter study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists' assessments of ENE compared with the gold standard obtained via histopathology (the presence of ENE on the neck specimen, pathologic ENE [pENe])), as well as analyzing the prognostic significance of ENE. This study will serve as the basis for the development of a standardized reporting system for ENE.\nFor the purpose of this project, the investigators will define ENE as a tumor extension which appears to extrude the capsule of a lymph node or anatomical barrier. Radiologically, this is identified as \"loss of circumscribed demarcation\" between the tumor and the lymph node. The presence of this radiological finding will be defined as radiologic extranodal extension (rENE).\nThis is a retrospective, multi-institutional, international study based on data from consecutive patients treated for head and neck cancer. All patients eligible for inclusion must have sufficient imaging and clinical data available; this includes neck scans with or without contrast and either histopathology or clinical follow-up. The investigators will identify data from consecutive patients treated for oral cavity, oropharyngeal, carcinoma of unknown primary, laryngeal, or hypopharyngeal cancer and be over the age of 18. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria must be treated with curative intent via surgery, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy or a combination within the study inclusion period (1/1/1999-12/31/2020). Radiologic and clinical data available within a 3-month timeframe before the start of treatment must be available.\nThe investigators will only include HNC for this study if data of the imaging and the histopathology (primary or metastatic lesions) are available and if they could be traced back to a report of pENE. All patients should have at least two years of follow-up, or death. It is not necessary that all patients included in the study have ENE on the neck specimen (pENE) as only patients with sufficient imaging and clinical data can be included in the study. The study will include patients with pENE and patients without pENE in one single cohort. Patients treated palliatively at first presentation and patients presenting with recurrent disease will not be included.\nFollow-up data will be requested from the participating centers and include data on recurrence, localization of recurrence, overall survival, and disease-specific survival.\nThis is a multicenter international study",

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",

However, its use remains underused for various reasons. These include availability in some centers, high costs, and delays for conventional bone biopsies (conventional BB: surgical or radiological) which could lead to the loss of limb. In a few years, we have set up a simple blind biopsy procedure (Bedside BB) that involves a physician performing a biopsy through healthy skin at the bedside of the patient with DFU suspected of DFO. This procedure is effective, safe and has already been developed in more than 200 patients with DFO in the university departments of diabetology of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). Since its inception, more than 60 publications have studied the effectiveness of this new procedure in DFO: its safety, its equivalence to conventional biopsies, its sensitivity and its specificity in microbiological results. In order to extend the results of these preliminary and observational studies and to make Bedside BB a standard, the investigators have recently evaluated the feasibility of an randomised controlled trial comparing the safety and effectiveness of Bedside BB versus conventional biopsies. To evaluate the effectiveness, they have designed a multicentre open-label controlled non-inferiority trial. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the equivalence in treatment outcomes between Bedside BB and surgical conventional bone biopsy in patients with DFO.

For example, goals of care conversations, which are critical discussions between clinicians, patients, and families near the end of life, are less likely to occur for AAs than for Whites, and preferences are less likely to be followed when they do occur. Instead, families are more likely to be labeled as difficult if their decisions are incongruent with clinicians' recommendations. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences of structural racism. Efforts to address disparities need to address multiple factors such as patient-level cultural identity and EoL care values, interpersonal- and community-level norms for EoL communication and treatment, and healthcare institutional contexts for delivering EoL care in a setting affected by institutional racism. Our research group began to address this need with 'African American Community Speaks', a proof-of-concept prototype of a community-developed training program for clinicians caring for AA older adults with serious illnesses. The program originally focused on rural Southern older AAs and is not broadly generalizable across the US due to geographic differences in culture, attitudes, and communication preferences among AA persons in the US. Thus, we propose to adapt our prototype program to urban-dwelling Southern and Northern older AA adults using our established platform of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) in two geographically diverse regions: Birmingham, Alabama, and the Bronx, New York. To create the new training program called 'Caring for Older African Americans', our team of experts in CBPR, medical sociology, and clinical trials will work with local Community Advisory Boards to: 1. Conduct a comparative ethnographic study of urban dwelling AAs in the North and South to describe AA community values and preferences related to EoL care; 2. Adaptation of our prior community-developed training program by integrating community-developed storytelling videos for empathizing with experiences of racism in EoL care, guidelines for culturally concordant EoL care delivery, and adapting an existing implicit bias management program to goals of care communication; and 3. Conduct a cluster randomized trial in which we will randomize training times to 1 of 4 start dates using a stepped wedge design to accommodate the training of all clinicians and to mitigate the effect of secular trends. Patients' personal experience of racism will be measured using the discrimination subscale of the Group Based Mistrust Scale. The primary outcome will be patient/family's perception of therapeutic alliance using The Human Connection Scale. Secondary outcomes will be family-reported goal-concordant care, and clinicians' knowledge of cultural values, awareness of implicit bias, and confidence to change practice. This innovative effort will be the first training program that: 1. addresses culturally concordant care, systemic racism, and implicit bias management, the three key elements in enhancing the provision of equitable care; and 2. is designed and implemented in full partnership with two distinct AA communities in the South and the North of the US.",

Approaching the different dimensions of PSR calls on a dozen essential components: workload, autonomy, social support, burnout, anxiety, efforts made, rewards, work addiction, investment, etc. a specific questionnaire which usually contains 20 to 30 questions, so that having an overall view of PSR using the current reference questionnaires (Karasek, Siegrist, etc.) represents a total of more than 300 questions. The response time is thus incompatible with current medical practice (passage in the waiting room before the occupational health medical examination) and leads to a majority of non-responses during anonymous questionnaires on the Internet. On the other hand, these validated questionnaires were carried out by different people and are very heterogeneous between them, including in their formulation, so that the respondents have the impression of disorganization and anarchy. There is therefore a need for short, quick and uniform questionnaires. EVAs offer the incredible advantage of meeting these criteria: speed, uniformity, precision. From a data analysis point of view, EVAs also have the advantage of offering a continuous quantitative response, allowing the use of all statistical approaches. If some questionnaires have already been validated in the form of EVA, such as the EVA stress versus the  Perceived Stress Scale  questionnaire (PSS), the EVA workload and EVA autonomy at work versus the Karasek questionnaire, the other reference questionnaires are not yet validated in EVA (burnout, anxiety, efforts / rewards, work addiction, etc.).",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe prevalence of chronic diseases in developed countries is increasing, and their economic impact on the healthcare system is high. Chronic diseases have a high prevalence in Western countries. Healthcare costs in the United States of America alone are 7.8 million dollars, and the prevalence of chronic health conditions in England costs over 71 billion pounds a year. In France, an epidemiological study found that 60% of the population has several chronic diseases, some of which require regular medical appointments. In addition, these sick patients often have jobs that require them to meet deadlines and targets or are subject to a hierarchical regime, which can lead to burnout, defined as a chronic loss of motivation and an increase in job dissatisfaction, particularly if there is a discontinuity between efforts and rewards. Healthcare professionals are also part of these sick patients, and the effects of their job and burnout are increasingly recognized, especially among physicians with professional qualification. The economic cost of work burnout is considerable for the company, which is forced to retrain employees. Workers who are frequently absent from work because of burnout often lead to low productivity and less quality care for patients. Anxiety or depression is not uncommon in healthcare professionals, with a prevalence ranging from 5% to 29%. Chronic health conditions can also have an impact on employees' emotional state. Psychological burnout can lead to depression, anxiety or substance abuse, thus influencing a workers' quality of life and productivity.\nThere is an urgent need to assess a sick employee's health status and psychological quality. Some tools exist today to evaluate the emotional state of a person but often rely on self-declarations which may alter the results. In addition, some questionnaires are very exhaustive and long, making it difficult for patients to answer them. An alternative would be to introduce more visual tools that avoid the tediousness of a long questionnaire, the patient answers being less subjective. Visual analog scales have proven reliable in a few studies. These scales are easy to use, they do not require a lot of education of patients and often patients do not have to answer to open questions. This scale could quickly assess and track the evolution of the patient's well-being. Visual analog scales, if they can be validated, could be used as a complement to the regular questionnaire of healthcare professionals. The investigator aims to implement a questionnaire assessing the emotional state of the employee to better understand whether the company should provide more psychological support, thus preventing burnout. The investigator does not aim to redo existing questionnaires or to create a new tool to assess psychological state. The main goal is to create a simple, visual and understandable tool to quickly assess well-being. In addition, the investigator does not aim to assess a sick employee's physical state (other questionnaires can already exist for this) but to focus on their emotional one and their relationship with their job, in order to prevent burnout and decrease the risks of an emotional disturbance that may worsen their quality of life.",

The \u03b2-glucan is identified as a main component of BLEX 404. Not only with therapeutic potential on several types of cancer, BLEX 404 has also shown the potential to improve hematopoiesis, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, and the cytotoxicity activity of immune cells in recent animal studies. Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity.

The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. Many patients stay on the ICU/hospital for weeks. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore geriatric rehabilitation will be very likely required.\nGeriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments.\nOBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study to get insight into the course of functional and medical recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe.\nThe secondary objective is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organisation of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The study follows a pragmatic and observational design, and study-related data will be collected via a web-based data collection system on routine healthcare information from rehabilitation patients, which has no effect on their treatment and care in rehabilitation.\nPARTICIPANTS: This pan-European study involves cooperation between several countries across the world. Participants are patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection that recovered from their infection and are admitted to geriatric rehabilitation for a rehabilitation treatment.\nDATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES: The information about demographics (age), gender and diagnoses will be collected from the patients\u2019 own charts or from medical records of their referring general practitioner or hospital records. The information collected from their own charts will only include existing data, no additional procedures need to be performed to collect these data.\nThe following data will be collected at admission: demographics (year of birth/age, gender, premorbid residency), and if routinely collected data is available: level of ADL functioning (using the Barthel Index (BI) scale 0-20), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L scale 0-1), frailty (mMSE/SNAQ/NRS/MUST/Clinical Frailty Scale), cognition (MMSE/Demtect/ MOCA), mood/anxiety (/GDS/HADS), muscle strength (MRC biceps/quadriceps), fatigue (VAS scale), dyspnoea (VAS scale) and pain (NRS scale). Additional information that we receive in anonymised or descriptive way is the number of hospital readmissions, the length of stay in GR, discharge destination and ADL, quality of life, frailty, BMI, nutrition, cognition, mood/anxiety, fatigue, dyspnoea, pain, mobility/balance, muscle strength, and comorbidity/diagnostics will be documented at discharge.\nIn case of follow-up data, data will be collected for quality of life, fatigue, dyspnoea, nutritional status, frailty, post-traumatic stress syndrome and comorbidity and diagnostics.\nAll patient data are anonymised.\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS: Rehabilitation care is designed to improve the overall situation of the patient in the short and longer run. By optimising the rehabilitation care for COVID-19 patients the quality and speed of their recovery can be improved.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study will lead to better insights in the course of recovery of post-COVID-19 patients and can give more insight in the treatment modalities employed, and can lead to better and more targeted rehabilitation care for this group. In 2019, the European Union developed the Joint Programming Platfora 2 \u2018Preventing Mobility Disability and Promoting Mobility in Older Adults\u2019. The goal of the platform is to coordinate and improve intersectorial cooperation, which is of paramount importance to improve the outcome of rehabilitation. We hope this study will contribute to this effort that seeks to improve the evidence base for the benefits of rehabilitation in the European Union.",

Studies have demonstrated that patients that use everolimus instead of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) have a higher immune response after vaccination. Vaccine response against Varicella Zoster Vaccine (VZV) is also impaired in patients that use everolimus instead of MMF. Both the COVID-19 vaccine and the VZV require an optimal immune response to be fully effective. Therefore, we hypothesize that kidney transplant recipients who replace their MMF by everolimus, have an increased capacity to mount a specific immune response to both vaccines. The purpose of the \"PREPARE-iVAC\" trial is to evaluate replacement of MMF by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients on immunosuppression after vaccination. The main focus will be COVID-19 vaccination and vaccination against herpes zoster, but we will also investigate humoral and cellular immunity against varicella zoster. Moreover, we will evaluate safety of using everolimus instead of MMF in kidney transplant recipients. The hypothesis is that those who receive everolimus achieve better vaccine response, as measured by specific antibody concentrations and virus neutralising capacity, as compared to the MMF/MPA group.",

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

        "summary": "Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common genetic predisposition syndrome for colorectal cancer (CRC), responsible for around 2-4% of cancers. It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in this specific population. To this end, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing CAD EYE with CE in patients with LS.",

The physician's and CAD-EYE's predictions of histologic pathology of the colonic lesions will be reported separately;\no The CE group will undergo a colonic examination by chromo-colonoscopy with indigo carmine (IC) under white light. The physician's predictions of histologic pathology for the removed polyps will be reported. \nIn the CAD EYE group, when polyps are detected, these will be identified with the DOT mode of the colonoscope, and photographs taken and reported. Polyp location, size with and without biopsy, will be reported by the physician. The endoscopist will remove all adenomas or suspected later lesions immediately by snare polypectomy.\nPolyp location, size with and without biopsy, will be reported by the physician. The endoscopist will remove all adenomas or suspected later lesions immediately by snare polypectomy. \nResults: \nThe primary objective of the study is to compare the detection rate of adenomas and serrated lesions in the 2 study arms (CAD-EYE vs. CE). \nThe study also aims to evaluate CAD-EYE and CE predictive abilities for specific lesions and resect and discard strategy by comparing CAD-EYE histologists prediction to the physician's histologists prediction and the histological anatomopathological report. The performance of the CAD-EYE automated detection system assessed by its sensitivity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value will be compared to its automated prediction in comparison to colonoscopy indigo carmin chromo-colonoscopy. \nColonoscopy time will be analyzed under the 2 study arms as well. \nThe study should provide proof of the effectiveness of CAD EYE in the detection of colonic adenomas and serrated lesions in Lynch syndrome patients. The implementation of CAD EYE will also improve the predictive ability of the physician for this lesion. \nCAD EYE is expected to facilitate the adoption of a resect and discard strategy during colonoscopies in Lynch syndrome patients by improving the diagnostic specificity of the procedure. \nFinally, the system has a potential to reduce colonoscopy average procedure time. \nExpected results: \nResults of this study will provide a new tool to better detect colonic lesions in Lynch syndrome patients, while reducing the colonoscopy duration and the number of lesions taken care off.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvaluation of the CAD-EYE System for the Detection of Colorectal Neoplastic Lesions in Patients With Lynch Syndrome\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nLynch Syndrome\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Colorectal cancer screening with CAD EYE colonoscopy\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Confirmed pathogenic mutation (",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBronchiectasis is a chronic disease characterized by thickening of the bronchial walls, chronic cough, sputum production and prone to recurrent infections. Many factors can be associated with bronchiectasis: congenital abnormalities can affect the bronchial development, immune inborn deficiencies cause chronic infections and lung damage, while external insults can cause the inflammatory changes that lead to bronchial wall destruction. Patients with bronchiectasis present with non-reversible airway obstruction. However, in contrast to asthma, the improvement in airway obstruction in response to bronchodilators in bronchiectasis is less clear. Bronchodilators are still among the most common therapies used in bronchiectasis despite the lack of a clear effect on disease progression and treatment of airway obstruction. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in bronchiectasis might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. Theoretically, in bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry testing can potentially cause changes in lung function for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether bronchodilator response is influenced by the time between spirometry and bronchodilator inhalation. This will be determined by performing bronchodilator response test (BDT) in the following order: 1) 30 minutes of regular spirometry followed by 4 puffs of salbutamol; 2) 30 minutes later the same procedure with placebo will be performed.

New and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity.\nThis study looks to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of such a model, using rehabilitation technology to enrich and enhance delivery of rehabilitation within an NHS inpatient stroke unit environment. This model of rehabilitation delivery has already been tested by the research team with community-dwelling participants in the chronic phase of stroke (over a year since stroke) and is known to be feasible and safe. Participants will be recruited from the stroke unit at University Hospital Wishaw during the acute and sub-acute phase of stroke (0-6 months since stroke), if requiring rehabilitation following a stroke and deemed medically fit enough to participate. Participants will be supported to complete activities in a newly dedicated 'technology enriched rehabilitation space' by NHS staff, in addition to their usual treatment. This will enable participants to engage in rehabilitation activities relating to their physical, cognitive, visual, communication and functional goals using equipment such as an adapted treadmill, interactive screens and tablets, upper limb exercise devices, power-assisted gym equipment and virtual reality. All devices are commercially available and known to be safe for use with stroke patients, however the use of such devices within NHS services is currently known to be under-utilised.

Several studies have reported the positive impact of antibiotic susceptibility testing performed on urine cultures on the appropriate use of antibiotics.\nThe selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing , defined as the restriction of the list of antibiotics mentioned in the report according to the antibiotic resistance profile, would allow, according to observational studies, a reduction of 25 to 70% of the initial prescriptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics and a 20% rate of antibiotic de-escalation (=reduction of the antibacterial spectrum of an antibiotic treatment after re-evaluation).\nThe objective is to assess the impact of disseminating a selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing on the dispensing of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) for E. coli positive urine cultures in adult women, compared to the dissemination of a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequent bacterial infection among women, and antibiotic treatment, most of the time broad-spectrum, is associated with an increase in the risk of resistance. Since the majority of women with lower urinary tract infection (UTI) are managed by general practitioners (GPs), this study aims to promote the use of susceptibility testings (ST) among GPs, by providing a new report that recommends a targeted antibiotic therapy, and thereby reduce the consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\nSince the early 2000s, the use of specific antimicrobials targeted at susceptibility profiles in GPs practices has been shown to lead to a reduction in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Bronner et al., 2006). More recently, the same approach, involving the use of selective reportings (SR) to promote ST in GP practices, was associated with a significant reduction in antibiotic prescribing in French primary care (Berenger et al., 2012). This SR approach is implemented from 2013 in all laboratories in France thanks to an inter-professional consortium in charge of its production (Consortium Interprofessionnel de D\u00e9lai de Livraison des Rapports de R\u00e9sistance). Indeed, the implementation of standardized targeted reporting by all clinical laboratories could be a major milestone to reduce the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in French primary care settings.\nWe hypothesize that a selective reporting among general practitioners would further reduce the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed among patients with E. coli UTI. We plan to compare four levels of treatment of E. coli UTI based on E. coli susceptibility, and their impact on the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Furthermore, given that the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic consumption may vary according to practice and patient characteristics, we plan to identify potential modifiers and mediators of this impact. Finally, we plan to measure the effect of this intervention on the rate of directed antibiotic de-escalation.\nWe will carry out a randomized controlled clinical trial among all GPs who receive ST from the LabOuest network (a public laboratory), and among women with E. coli UTI for which ST is performed in these laboratories over a one-year period. The sample size is estimated to 20 000 women.\nThis study is innovative in that it aims to optimize the use of ST by providing physicians with a recommendation that can lead directly to prescription of narrower-spectrum antibiotics.",

Besides calendar age, the degree of frailty also associates with increased susceptibility to pneumonia requiring hospitalization. How alterations in the mucosal immune system with advanced age predispose to infections remains unclear as access to relevant tissue samples is limited. With minimally-invasive nasal sampling methods, it was recently observed that in vital older adults, both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells are selectively lost from the nasal mucosa. However, the exact phenotype, underlying mechanisms, key molecules and consequences of this have not yet been investigated.\nObjective:\nElucidate the mechanisms underlying the loss of nasal T cells and characterize in depth the differences of T cells in young and older adults and associate this loss with susceptibility to infections.\nStudy design: Prospective cohort study\nStudy population: Participants will be recruited from 3 groups:\nhealthy young adults (18-30 years, n=50)\nvital older adults (>65 years, n=60)\nfrail elderly (>65 years, n=60).

Both young healthy adults as well as frail vulnerable elderly suffer from RTIs. The former are known to have a stronger immune response to vaccinations, leading to high protection rates. In contrast, the latter have been reported to carry a high burden of RTI-related mortality despite being vaccinated with RTI-preventing vaccinations. A likely reason for this is their severely weakened immune system, even after RTI vaccination, allowing RTI-induced immune suppression to develop to such an extent that vaccination is no longer effective. The nose/nasal cavity is recognized as the main site of RTI development, as the majority of RTI-causing pathogens enter the respiratory tract through the nose. Thus, the immune response in the nose is the first line of defense against RTI-causing pathogens. CD8+ T cells are the main cell type mediating clearance of RTI-causing pathogens in the nose. In the last years, we have performed several pilot projects showing a marked decrease in CD8 T cell frequency in the nose of healthy aging adults. Our most recent pilot studies indicate that this decrease is even more profound in frail older adults and even more so after RTI development. We here propose a longitudinal controlled study aiming 1) To unravel the underlying mechanisms and consequences of the loss of T cells and/or other immune cell populations that is responsible for the increased RTI susceptibility in older individuals; 2) to assess the added value of repeated (seasonal) sampling during 5 months to assess immune response dynamics to SARS-CoV-2, a well-known respiratory pathogen that is also responsible for large numbers of nosocomial infections, and; 3) to dissect the role of sex-differences in RTI susceptibility in both young healthy adults and frail older adults.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBreast Cancer is a heterogeneously different disease in terms of pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, disease progression and response to therapy, as well as prognosis and survival. While local management of breast cancer may provide adequate treatment in early stages, locally advanced breast cancers must be treated with surgery followed by combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy to improve long-term survival. In this setting radiation reduces the risk of local residual disease, recurrence, and distal metastases up to 10 years after radiation. Despite the benefits of radiotherapy there is little to no consideration of the effects on the patients' quality of life (QoL) while planning and delivering radiation therapy. Previous studies have shown that adjuvant therapies have a lasting and long-term impact on the quality of patients' lives, with more severe effects in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation. Radiation dose to the heart has been shown as a major contributor to cardiac complications in radiotherapy for left-sided breast cancer. Patients with left-sided breast cancer are therefore particularly at risk for radiation-induced coronary artery disease. Breast cancer patients who have undergone radiotherapy to left breast can experience reduced function of the heart muscle on the side of the breast receiving radiation, even many years after the treatment. The increased risk for cardiovascular disease is of particular concern for breast cancer survivors. Thus, the dose of radiation to organs outside the target, such as the heart, is important to consider in breast cancer therapy. Although recent advances in high precision radiation therapy have improved the targeting and consequently the reduction of dose to organs outside of the treatment target, the radiation dose to the heart continues to be a major concern. A number of strategies have been developed to keep the radiation dose to the heart as low as possible. Most recent developments involve respiratory techniques that enable radiation oncologists to position patients to maximize tumor target coverage and minimize cardiac exposure by utilizing the distance between the moving heart and the adjacent breast tissue during deep inspiratory breath holds. Patient cooperation to enable the radiation oncologist to achieve these goals is critical, but it is dependent on patients' respiratory skill and mental and psychological well-being. The investigator's preliminary results demonstrate that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, reducing radiation dose to the heart. However, DIBH training regimens may not fully address patients' mental stress and anxiety that interfere with their ability to perform deep inspiration breath holds optimally. Preliminary data in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance and anxiety and comfort. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis by determining the impact of these training techniques in the context of radiation therapy for left-sided breast cancer on heart dose reduction. While radiation oncologists are aware of cardiac concerns, they lack tools to facilitate these psychological aspects of care in the context of radiation therapy. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R) will improve patients' DIBH performance skills and further reduce heart dose, while alleviating anxiety and stress and improving quality of life during and after radiation therapy. The results of this proposal will contribute to the development of novel patient-centered training and integrative health regimen to further improve the success of advanced technology-based cardiac dose reduction in breast cancer therapy, and improve cardiac health in breast cancer survivors.",

Over 100,000 patients are diagnosed with PC in the U.S. With an estimated 45,750 PC death toll (male 22,400, female 23,350), the estimated pancreas cancer death is higher than the breast cancer and colon cancer combined, and the incidence is expected to grow in coming years due to an aging population, obesity rates and the high prevalence of heavy smoking. Unfortunately, the current treatment options for patients with resectable PC do not produce durable disease control once a tumor has recurred. While chemotherapy helps reduce the chance of disease recurrence and improves survival, this effect is typically short lived.\nThe interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) pathway, an inflammatory pathway, plays an important role in tumorigenesis, cancer progression, angiogenesis and metastasis. Activation of this pathway is associated with aggressive, metastatic and treatment-resistant cancer. Inhibitors of the components of the pathway can prevent migration, invasion and the proliferation of cancer cells in several preclinical cancer models. Canakinumab (ACZ885), a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-1beta, and tislelizumab (BGB-A1217), an immuno-oncology therapy that can enhance a patient's own anti-cancer immune responses and enable the patient's T-cells to target cancer cells, offer new therapeutic approaches for PC. The combination of nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and a IL1beta-targeting antibody in a neoadjuvant setting has the potential to improve outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed resectable PC.

Recent research has shown Egypt to be the third-largest country globally, with an estimated 52% cesarean sections (3).

Bleeding postpartum is known as losing over five hundred milliliter of blood following a vaginal birth and losing over one thousand milliliter after the cesarean section (5).

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment.

Palatoglossal air space shadow error is one of the most common positioning errors and it's due to the tongue not sticking to the roof of the palate. Techniques used to deal with this error might help prevent unnecessary radiation to patients and save them time and money. The study aimed to investigate to investigate the effects of using celluloid matrix and edible tapes (fruit leather and chewing gum) on reducing the palatoglossal air space shadow error in panoramic imaging Methods: In our study, 270 patients referred to the Department of Radiology were randomised into three groups: a control group, a celluloid matrix group, and an edible tapes group. Before panoramic imaging, all patients were instructed to adhere their tongues to the roof of their mouths, with the distinction that for the celluloid matrix and edible tapes groups, patients were asked to place celluloid tapes, fruit leathers, or chewing gums on their tongues before doing so. The routine imaging process was then performed, and the results were compared across groups to evaluate the incidence of palatoglossal air space shadow error.\nResults: *** Conclusion: ***",

At present, there are 66 million patients with moderate to severe OSA in China, and the current diagnosis and treatment of OSA is mainly completed in the sleep center of the hospital, which is time-consuming and laborious, resulting in the delayed diagnosis and treatment of a large number of patients, making about 80% of potential OSA patients have not been diagnosed and treated in time. With the development of the Internet technologies, telemedicine has been increasingly applied to the diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic diseases with its advantages of convenience, interactivity, efficiency, sharing, coherence and breaking through the limitations of time and space. Our center has initially built a remote diagnosis and treatment management model for OSA. Compared with the traditional medical model, the medical and health economic analysis shows that the OSA diagnosis and treatment model based on telemedicine is more cost-effective, but its clinical efficacy needs to be further verified. Hypertension is a common complication in OSA patients, and continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) has a significant hypertensive effect in the treatment of OSA. However, whether clinical management based on remote diagnosis and treatment mode can achieve the same therapeutic effect as traditional face-to-face diagnosis and treatment mode in improving ambulate blood pressure in OSA patients needs to be further clarified. This study will compare the improvement of ambulatory blood pressure management in patients with hypertension under the new telemedicine mode and the traditional medical mode through a single-center randomized controlled trial, so as to optimize the diagnosis and treatment process of OSA patients with hypertension, establish a more convenient and efficient remote diagnosis and treatment mode with reliable clinical outcome, and provide a theoretical basis for subsequent multi-center research and promotion",

A large-scale retrospective observational study found that the prevalence of OSA in hypertension patients with daytime sleepiness or sleep disturbances was more than 80 percent.

The blood pressure in daytime sleepiness and sleep disturbances are the most serious, but the rhythm pattern of 24-hour blood pressure is often irregular, and there is no large scale prospective study on this. The blood pressure improvement of OSA patients during the treatment of OSA may be mainly the normalization of blood pressure rhythm. The purpose of our study is to observe changes in blood pressure rhythm of OSA patients after 3 months of treatment with CPAP device. We want to compare the blood pressure after 3 months of treatment between the inpatient care and telemedicine, and then to determine whether CPAP device treatment can effectively improve the out-of-time blood pressure rhythm of OSA patients after 3 months treatment, and to explore the effective intervention mode, so as to improve the clinical prognosis of OSA patients, promote the use of telemedicine, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

One potential explanation for this phenomenon is that verbal communication plays an important role in how the patient will perceive the analgesic efficacy.

However, the epidemiology and treatment strategy for ARDS may have changed significantly due to the accumulation of a large body of knowledge, following the two-year pandemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) of which the primary manifestation is ARDS. To improve the quality of ICU care that patients receive after admission to the ICU, a variety of academic societies, including the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, are currently developing evidence-based guidelines and consensus guidelines and statements regarding ABCDEF bundles, nutritional therapy, ICU diary. The ABCDEF bundle, nutritional therapy, and ICU diary have been developed and are being promoted for implementation in hospitals around the world. The implementation of evidence-based ICU care is strongly recommended, especially for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who frequently require ventilators to maintain their lives, because their patient outcomes are worse than those who were admitted to ICU with other causes.\nHowever, there is still little evidence on how the quality of ICU care (compliance rate) correlates with patient prognosis and outcomes, and there are currently no clear goals or indicators for the ICU care we should develop.\nThis study aims to investigate the epidemiology and treatments given to the patients and evaluate the implementation of evidence-based ICU care and its association with the outcomes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to the ICU.

PCa is known to affect the quality of life as well as life span of the men diagnosed with it. Although a lot of effort has been put into the prevention and treatment of this type cancer, there are still significant knowledge gaps concerning the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Epidemiological data suggest that there is a 40-fold variation in the incidence of PCa between different populations. In this context, epidemiology provides evidence that lifestyle, including smoking habits, nutrition and physical activity, influence PCa risk. The microbial colonization, i.e. gut microbiota, present in the intestine is known to affect many metabolic processes and diseases in the human body. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggest that gut microbiota composition might also affect PCa risk.\n\nThe purpose of our study is to better understand the role of gut microbiota composition in benign prostate hyperplasia (SHPB) and PCa. For the clinical part of the study, a cohort of men with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer will be recruited.

        "summary": "In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",

The grade of malignancy is assessed according to the IDH mutational status and the 1p19q codeletion status, established on an ex vivo tumor specimen.\nIn the case of glioblastoma and metastatic glioma, the survival prognosis is poor. For other grades, patients have a good prognosis when these tumors are fully removed. Tumor recurrences are frequent and associated with the development of resistance mechanisms.\nThe diffusion MRI technique and metabolic spectroscopy are imaging modalities that could be used to distinguish recurrences from regrowths and to better target the biological status of the tumor.\nIn gliomas, the concentration of 2-Hydroxyglutarate (2HG) is measured by MRS at the time of surgery and 6 months after the beginning of treatment (chemoradiotherapy or targeted treatment). The concentration of 2HG is correlated with the histologic status and 1p19q codeletion status. The goal is to assess the evolution of 2HG concentrations in various recurrences situations: no treatment, adjuvant chemotherapies or adjuvant targeted treatment (L1 inhibitor).\nThis study is performed on 30 patients operated for a glioma. A MRS examination is performed before and after tumor removal to quantify metabolites, particularly 2HG. This examination is also performed 6 months and 1 year after the start of treatment on the patients according to the evolution of tumor and/or to the appearance of new symptoms.\nPatients with a glioma in the second grade, who benefit from a surgical resection, are included in a sub-study (study2).\nPatients with a glioma in the third grade without surgical resection are included in a sub-study (study3). \nThis study is not considered a clinical trial because it is a sub-study of a diagnostic test.\nThe results of this study will help to optimize treatment strategies, by selecting patients responding to a certain treatment and identifying those with refractory tumors. \nMRI will not be the only selection criteria of the study but this exam will provide additional information to optimize the therapeutic strategy of patients.",

        "summary": "Despite progress in chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still the only curative procedure for some hematological malignancies. The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old.

The algorithm specifically predicts imminent death or the need for intensive care unit (ICU) transfer. Within the eCART interface, clinical teams are then directed toward standardized guidance to determine next steps in care for elevated-risk patients.\nThe investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nClinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults in the United States and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The most severe deterioration is most often associated with critical illness, an outcome that is heralded by the gradual development of physiologic abnormalities in multiple organ systems. Early identification of patients at risk for critical illness followed by intervention and optimization can reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Although numerous early warning scores (EWSs, such as Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS)) have been developed, the sensitivity and specificity of EWSs is far from perfect. Machine learning algorithms, which identify patterns in big data, improve accuracy but only achieve high clinical accuracy if fully integrated into hospital workflows. This study examines performance parameters of a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm (ecarter) at a single academic medical center and seeks to measure its impact on patient care at 4 healthcare organizations (HOs) using a randomized controlled design. The primary outcome measure is to determine whether eCART reduces mortality for high-risk hospitalized patients at participating HOs. Secondary outcome measures include reduction in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and the proportion of ICU- and ventilator-free days for elevated risk patients. This trial involves the development of an artificial intelligence model for screening hospitalized patients and standardization of care of these patients based on clinical pathways.

Pregnant or postpartum AA women also have poor mental healthcare utilization and compliance with psychiatric treatment, contributing to poor clinical outcomes. In addition, AA fathers have a critical role in reducing the mother's emotional distress and environmental stress. This study will address some of these shortcomings by using fathers as an untapped resource to reduce the mother's environmental stress and encourage healthy maternal behaviors. The proposed study aims to design and implement a culturally-based and empirically-tailored intervention to target the AA father's mental health literacy, psychoeducation, and communication skills with the AA mother to reduce maternal depression symptoms during the prenatal to postpartum period. Also, this study will enhance the father's parenting and the mother-father-infant relationship through targeted skills and support. Twenty-five dyads of pregnant or postpartum dyads aged 18 or older, in committed relationships or not, will be randomized into the ASSET-PPD (African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment-Partners Alleviating Perinatal Depression) or the No Treatment comparison groups. The ASSET-PPD intervention will be designed to have 4 active modules that address the key factors to reduce maternal stress during the prenatal and postpartum period. The modules will be individual sessions constructed to provide training, information, and behavioral assignments to increase fathers' understanding of depression- and anxiety-provoking situations, and to create a communication and a parenting plan that promotes an equal division of parenting responsibilities before the birth of the infant. The primary outcome will be maternal depression, assessed using the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self-Rated (IDS-SR16). Secondary outcomes will include infant attachment, breastfeeding experience, and parent-infant interactions.

Effectiveness accounts for both high sensitivity (i.e. the fraction of suspension correctly detected) and low false alarm rate.\nThe study has three phases:\nfree-living artificial pancreas data collection,\nin-patient induction of hyperglycemia (mimicking an insulin pump malfunction),\nretrospective analysis of the collected data to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in detecting insulin suspension.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThis study is designed as a retrospective data analysis of a database of controlled malfunction simulation in subjects with type 1 diabetes receiving automated insulin delivery (AID). The current clinical practice is currently performed by recording the time series of glucose, insulin, and food intake data produced by the patients' AID, without any a priori information about the onset of the malfunction itself. To address this limitation, the investigators developed a control algorithm to detect episodes of insulin pump malfunction, based on the comparison between pre- and post-malfunction data-sets, the latter characterized by a significant increase in glycemia. However, a validation of this algorithm in real clinical practice, with a sufficient number of patients, may confirm the actual effectiveness and safety of this detection system. The use of a retrospective analysis, as currently conducted in the clinical practice, would permit the collection of a large amount of high-quality data, with a precise characterization of the malfunctions, as previously described. These data could support further validation in a prospective study. In these circumstances, it is necessary to assess the sensitivity of a number of detection techniques, in order to estimate the probability that a suspected insulin pump malfunction corresponds to a true positive event. The investigators propose the following study objectives: 1) Assess the sensitivity of the existing algorithms for the detection of insulin pump malfunctions (currently used in clinical practice) in 20 patients; 2) Analyze the ability of the proposed algorithms to detect malfunctions when the glycemic excursion is milder than what was simulated in this study, in 15 additional patients. The investigators expect that a sensitivity of 100% in detecting insulin suspension will be achieved, when the glycemic excursion following malfunction is higher than a defined threshold. As a secondary objective, the investigators will assess the safety of the study procedures, in terms of the risk of hyperglycemia and other side effects or complications. The study results may lead to optimization and improvement of the glycemic control, and to avoid the occurrence of the most serious risks associated with malfunctions. The study will be conducted on a population of 20 patients with type 1 diabetes, under insulin pump treatment and using continuous glucose monitoring sensors. The study will be conducted in two phases: - Phase 1: collection of free living data - Phase 2: malfunction simulation (data analysis after the experiment). The patients enrolled will be required to visit the study center at least twice: one baseline visit to activate the artificial pancreas and collect baseline data, and one visit to perform the malfunction simulation. Based on the experience gained during phase 1, the malfunction simulation procedure aims at inducing different durations and severity of hyperglycemia, by means of controlled insulin suspension. The study team will assist the patient in the restoration of normoglycemia before sending the patient back home. To account for the variability of the response to insulin suspension, subjects with type 1 diabetes and AID therapy are planned for enrollment, as the response to the same malfunction may vary according to the patient, insulin dose, and other factors such as meal intake, exercise, and illness. These factors will be carefully recorded by means of standardized questionnaires to be filled by each participant during the study visits.\nThe novelty of this approach is in the control of the experimental insulin suspension events, performed under medical supervision in a controlled and documented setting. The data collected in this study will be the only human trial dataset where malfunctions have been induced with precisely defined characteristics. By analyzing data generated by these experiments, it will be possible to develop accurate algorithms for detecting malfunctions and minimize the risk of missing important events because of lack of data. As a result, the patients will benefit of a more reliable system for insulin infusion and monitoring, with a reduced risk of critical and dangerous consequences.",

This study will evaluate effectiveness as follows:\nPrimary Outcome Measure: Test Negative Design (TND) 1. Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) calculated as 1 minus the odds ratio (OR) comparing the odds of being vaccinated with ABRYSVO for RSV-related hospitalized LRTI cases and controls, multiplied by 100%.\nAdministrative and Biologic Exemptions: 27.8% ABRYSVO coverage rates among the entire group at risk for vaccine preventable disease, as well as among those hospitalized and/or ED visited with a respiratory infection, are likely, given Kaiser Permanente's prior vaccine efforts. To address expected noncompliance with the 24-month exclusion window among those who are unvaccinated, we plan to include a 12-month control group, for VE estimation at this specific timepoint.\n\nEligibility: All Kaiser Permanente Southern California members born on or before 31-12-1935, regardless of sex or residence.\nDesign: Retrospective cohort study including 2 components: 1) TND, in which cases were identified using inpatient and certain outpatient medical claims and remnant respiratory specimens, to assess RSV-related hospitalizations, among which participants may have received prior vaccination or had prior documented RSV infection; and 2) population-based cohort including all KPSC patients at risk for RSV vaccine preventable, and nonpreventable, ARI/LRTI, as well as mortality.\n\nStatistical Analysis: For the cohort study, we will estimate Incidence Rates (IRs) and related rate differences for all ARI and LRTI outcomes. We will also estimate VE using modified Poisson regression, adjusted for covariates including: 1) comorbid conditions, 2) RSV subgroup, 3) severity, and 4) age to describe the effectiveness of ABRYSVO against all-cause LRTI and ARI.\n\nThis study will have the potential to address important unanswered questions regarding the effectiveness of RSV vaccine in preventing lower respiratory tract infection in the KPSC population. The cohort study component will provide insights into the effectiveness of the vaccination against other ARI and LRTI outcomes, as well as provide a comprehensive understanding of the vaccine's effects in the general population. This study will further clarify the risk/benefit profiles to assist decision-making for RSV vaccine.",

Our project hopes to establish the optimal depth of injection for onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin for maximal improvement of glabellar lines with minimal adverse effects",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe efficacy and safety of the use of botulinum toxin type A in the treatment of facial wrinkles has been well established by many studies. Botulinum toxin is a safe and effective treatment for facial wrinkles and has a high patient satisfaction rate. Botulinum toxin acts by blocking the release of acetylcholine from the neuromuscular junction and thereby temporarily paralyzing the muscles responsible for facial movement and expression. In patients with hyperkinetic wrinkles, most notably the glabellar complex or frown lines in the region of the procerus and corrugator supercilii muscles, the toxin causes selective, temporary paralysis of the muscles responsible for producing frown lines. With the increasing usage of botulinum toxin, many studies have validated its efficacy and safety. However, botulinum toxin is prone to variable responses from a dose of 20U to 50U depending on several factors such as the muscle strength, thickness of the muscle and muscle area to be treated, as well as the injector's experience and skill. Variability in injection technique and individual patient response to botulinum toxin can lead to complications, such as incomplete inhibition and/or over-inhibition. Furthermore, the efficacy and safety of the BoTN varies depending on the injection depth. The depth can vary between injectors and can lead to adverse effects such as overdose, under-dose, intravascular injection, and bruising. Additionally, there is no in vivo data on the optimal injection depth of botulinum toxin in the glabellar complex. In this study, the investigators aim to establish an injection depth map for botulinum toxin type A, either at the Superficial Dermis Depth or Intramuscular Depth for the treatment of glabellar wrinkles. With this study the investigators also aim to determine any adverse effects associated with both treatment arms.

Graft failure and relapse remain the major causes of death. Recently, non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation has been proven to have much lower treatment-related mortality. A number of clinical trials showed that the outcome of HSCT using non-T cell depleted alografts was much better than T-cell depleted alografts. However, the incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) was also very high. In China, the incidence of GVHD in SAA is 70% to 80% and most of the patients required systemic steroid therapy. Non-myeloablative transplantation has also been used in unrelated cord blood transplantation. The outcome was good especially for unrelated cord blood transplantation for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. However, the outcome in adult patients with acute leukemia was not satisfactory. In the recent years, several conditioning regimens have been used in unrelated cord blood transplantation. Several reports showed that busulfan combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (Bu/Flu/Cy) or Cy/ATG conditioning regimens also have a good outcome. However, these conditioning regimens were associated with cardiac toxicity and the incidence of graft failure was relatively high. It has been proposed that the regimens may be changed to avoid the cardiac toxicity of these conditioning. Our experience showed that the incidence of GVHD in this population is relatively high and the management of GVHD in this population was very difficult.

        "summary": "Acute liver failure (ALF) is a potentially fatal complication of severe hepatic illness resulting from various causes. In a clinical setting, severe hepatic injury is usually recognized by the appearance of jaundice, encephalopathy and coagulopathy.\nThe term acute liver failure (ALF) is frequently applied as a generic expression to describe patients presenting with or developing an acute episode of liver dysfunction.\nCerebral edema is very common in patients with acute liver failure and encephalopathy.\nAcute liver failure (ALF) has Less common aetiologies include viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, pregnancy-induced liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis.\nSurvival for patients with ALF has steadily improved over the last few decades. Acute liver failure (ALF) is defined as sever acute liver injury with encephalopathy and impairment of synthetic function (INR \u02c31.5) in a patient without pre-existing cirrhosis or liver disease.\nAcute liver failure (ALF) and acute on chronic liver Failure (ACLF) are conditions frequently encountered in the ICU and are associated with high mortality.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIntroduction\n-----------------\nAcute liver failure (ALF) is the most severe form of acute liver disease, occurring mostly in adolescents and young adults. It often carries a grave prognosis and affects mainly the developed countries. The management of ALF is complicated by the large number of underlying etiologies and the complexity of the clinical picture, which represents a challenge to clinicians in the management of these cases.\nKidney diseases are known as causes of liver disease, however, kidney injury in the course of ALF is of much greater significance, because the liver is the primary site of endogenous biotransformation of drugs, and as a consequence, renal functions are very susceptible to liver failure. Kidney injury in ALF can develop by hepatorenal syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis. ALF is associated with acute-on-chronic liver disease (ACLF), where some characteristics of both ALF and chronic liver disease coexist. ACLF is defined by the International Ascites Society as the presence of the following combinations of ascites, encephalopathy, or hepatic failure with bilirubin >3 mg/dL, along with other organ failure, including coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Mortality rate of patients with ACLF was reported from 14% to 60% in other studies.\nDue to lack of knowledge about the causes of ALF and ACLF, early diagnosis is vital for prognosis and recovery of patients. Early diagnosis of complications such as hepatorenal syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis is crucial, as these alter the course and outcome of ALF. Several risk factors that lead to ALF and ACLF have been identified in many studies.\nIn this study, ALF and ACLF cases are defined according to guidelines. ALF is defined as an acute deterioration of liver function in patients with previously normal liver function. It can be isolated liver failure, or it can evolve to ACLF by underlying liver cirrhosis that are detected after evaluation. ACLF is defined as evolving from chronic liver disease (CLD) or having a chronic progressive liver disease. CLD is defined as a known chronic liver disease for at least 6 months, with or without ascites, and with or without other organ failure.\nStudy goals\n-----------------\nDetermination of risk factors leading to ALF and ACLF in a hospital setting. Study of the main causes of disease. Early determination of organ failure, and complications such as renal failure (hypotension or shock in the course of ALF), nephrotic syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis. Assessment of mortality and short-term (1 week, 2 weeks) morbidity rates in patients with severe acute liver disease. Assessing hepatic and renal functions in individuals with ALF with regard to age and gender.\nMethodology\n-----------------\nWe aim to recruit at least 60 patients with ALF and 30 patients with ACLF fulfilling the specific criteria, who are admitted to intensive care units at National Liver Institute, Menoufia University.

This has led to the development of single-color universal composite resins that aim to facilitate color selection. These materials have a universal opacity and several Vita shades and are recommended by manufacturers to be used in a single color layer that can match different tooth colors.

This has led to the development of single-color universal composite materials that aim to facilitate color selection. These materials have a universal opacity and several Vita shades and are recommended by manufacturers to be used in a single color layer that can match different tooth colors. As we know, there is no study investigating the clinical performance of these two universal composites. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical performance of 2 different single-color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions with the control group (Filtek Z250, 3M), which is a multi-color composite resin material, using modified USPHS and FDI criteria. In this study, two different null hypotheses were established. The first null hypothesis of this study is; It is concluded that there is no difference between 2 different single color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in terms of clinical performance in restorations of non-carious cervical lesions. The second null hypothesis of the study is that universal composite resin materials are not different from the control group, multicolored composite resin (Filtek Z250, 3M), in terms of clinical performance in restorations of non-carious cervical lesions.\n\nStudy Population and Sample Size\n-----------------\nNon-carious cervical lesions (NCCL) lesions located on first permanent molars and premolars will be selected, according to the FDI criteria. Inclusion criteria for this study are:\n\n-At least 3 teeth with cervical abrasion\n-Volunteerily enrolling in the study.\n\nInclusion of both gender and different teeth types allows the study to detect significant differences related to the materials used for restorations. The study includes 99 male and female patients voluntarily chosen for participation. The data will be collected from six health facilities that operate in Izmir.\n\nMethod\n-----------------\nPatients who have voluntarily agreed to participate in the study will be asked by the clinical coordinator to fill in the consent form. After completing the consent form, patients will be informed about the restoration procedure and postoperative instructions. The color of the teeth will be recorded with the Vita classic scale (N = 16). The selection of 44 teeth for the study will be based on the teeth with the same Vita color (A1-D4).\n\nFor each restoration, one tooth will be randomly assigned to OMNICHROMA, one tooth to Zenchroma and the third tooth will be assigned to Filtek Z250. A code will be prepared for all restoration procedures, and each restoration in the same patient will be prepared with one of the 3 materials, which will not be specified to the dentist. The operator who performs clinical and radiographic examinations will be blinded to the restorative materials used in the study. All restorative procedures will be performed by one operator. During this period, a composite color will be prepared as if it is a different tooth to eliminate the operator's habituation to a specific color shade. Each restoration will be restored by a single restoring operator. The operator who prepared the restoration will check the restoration and score the results according to the modified USPHS and FDI criteria (Table 1 and Table 2). The same operator will restore each patient's 3 teeth and apply the same restorative protocol to all teeth.\n\nTooth preparations for the NCCL will be planned in accordance with the modified USPHS criteria. Full coverage of the preparations will be provided with the use of resin composite. Before restoring each tooth, 35% phosphoric acid (Ultra Etch, 3M) will be applied to the NCCL surface for 15 seconds each time and washed with water. It will be dried gently with a compressed air and cotton roll. After that, Te-Etch \u00ae (Brush & Co) (18% nano-hydroxyapatite primer and 37% phosphoric acid) will be applied for 15 seconds and washed with water. Dentin will be covered with a single layer of nanofilled (Filtek Z250, 3M) and cured in 40 seconds.

        "summary": "Up to 60% of endometrial cancer cases are attributed to obesity, in part because obesity promotes development of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), and up to 40% of women with AEH go on to develop endometrial cancer. The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment. It is the hypothesis that premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer who desire uterine preservation will be more likely to have atypia-free uterine preservation at two years if they receive progestin in combination with a behavioral weight loss intervention versus progestin plus enhanced usual care.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nOverweight and obesity are common among women diagnosed with endometrial lesions, including atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) and grade 1 endometrial cancer. These women, especially those who are premenopausal, wish to preserve their uterine, meaning that they do not wish to undergo hysterectomy for their atypical endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer. The primary goal of treatment in these patients is to eliminate the atypia and prevent or delay the development of grade 2 or higher grade endometrial carcinoma or recurrence. Progestin, oral or intrauterine device (IUD), is used as part of standard practice in order to promote atypia elimination. However, the efficacy rate of atypia-free uterine preservation with progestin treatments is only 50%. As such, identifying strategies to increase the effectiveness of progestin treatment in premenopausal women diagnosed with endometrial atypia is important.\nThis study hypothesizes that weight loss may improve the efficacy of atypia-free uterine preservation with progestin treatment. It is reasonable to assume that, over the course of six months, a modest weight loss of 5% will result in improvements in clinical outcomes. The investigators also believe that the study of a behavioral weight loss intervention may result in the formation of a support network, provide strategies to manage weight, and help women who have received an endometrial diagnosis to develop skills that can help them with weight management in the future.\nA two-year randomized prospective study of 50 obese and prematurely menopausal women with AEH or grade 1 endometrial cancer and a uterus will be conducted. Women with endometrial atypia (with complex architecture histologically), grade 1 endometrial cancer, or premenopausal endometrial hyperplasia will undergo a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD insertion and be randomized to receive counseling for an enhanced usual care (EUC) or a novel behavioral weight loss intervention. Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random numbers table, with a randomization allocation scheme by a statistician who is independent of the randomizing physician. It is expected that over the course of one year, there will be a 19% chance that women assigned to behavioral intervention will achieve atypia-free uterine preservation compared to 12% of women assigned to the EUC. In year 2, those in the EUC will cross over to receive the behavioral weight loss intervention, while the treatment group will receive the standard of care therapy.\nPatients will be followed to evaluate uterine preservation and weight status. The investigators will examine the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the number of participants who will require surgical intervention, including hysterectomy or endometrial resection.\nThis study will provide information into if a behavioral weight loss intervention can improve the clinical outcomes of women with this diagnosis.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nRationale: During many years, cholecystectomy has been considered a safe laparoscopic procedure . However it can turn into a disaster that may require the application of damage control techniques. Many authors have recognized difficulty in performing cholecystectomy following several reports (1)(2)(3)(4)(5). Several methods for performing simple laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been proposed to overcome this difficulty.\nProcedure: A new simple technique of subtotal cholecystectomy was recently described (6) to deal with the difficulty associated with cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis.\n\nObjectives: \nThe aim of this paper was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this technique.\nStudy Design: \nFifty patients with acute cholecystitis were enrolled in this study between June of 2005 and June of 2008. All patients had either symptoms or radiological evidence of difficulty and were to be operated on within days of symptom onset. The operative technique was performed as reported by Zhuang et al. The operative procedure was evaluated using the Clavien - Dindo classification. Data was collected using case report forms filled by the investigators. The postoperative course was assessed for 30 days, including the assessment of surgical wound complications, and death.\n\nResults: This procedure seems to offer many advantages compared with other cholecystectomy techniques that have been proposed . It is performed within minutes by a simple operation and represents a feasible and safe technique.\n\nFood and liquid intake postoperatively was allowed on day 1, oral activity and hospital discharge were on day 4. None of the patients died or were converted to an open procedure, and no major morbidity was reported in this series of patients with acute cholecystitis. No leaks were reported nor was there bile duct injury. Three patients were converted into Laparotomic cholecystectomy for reasons not directly related to the technique used in this study (other gallbladder bed attachments). One of the converted patients was a 60 y/o woman who was a type II obesity (BMI 39.2) and was operated on two months after the first presentation with acute cholecystitis. She had a perforated appendix that was treated with necreectomy. She had severe abdominal adhesion and there was an inflammatory induration between the liver and the falciform ligament that prevented performing the operation. This patient underwent a cholecystectomy (performed under General anesthesia) in the same sitting of the laparotomy for appendectomy (there was a 5 cm midline laparotomy incision). Another problem reported with the new technique is an unanticipated bile duct injury which could occur with clipping of the cystic duct. This was not observed in the current study. The remaining 9 patients were laparoscopically operated on without difficulty or complication.\nAfterwards, all patients were mobilized in the morning of day 1 and allowed to tolerate food. They were mobilized on day 1 and allowed to tolerate food. Fluids were introduced in the morning of day 1, followed by semisolid diet in the morning of day 2. Oral activity and hospital discharge were both done on day 4.\nThe mean operative time (from the time of first incision into the stomach until the closure of the last skin incision) was 140 min (95% CI 116 min to 231 min). The mean time required to identify the cystic duct was 14 min (95% CI 10 min to 21 min) and the mean length of hospitalization was 5.4 days (95% CI 4.7 days to 5.9 days). This technique was feasible and safe for use in patients with acute cholecystitis within three days of symptom onset. More studies are needed to confirm our results.\n\nThe results of our study indicate that our new technique is safe compared with other traditional techniques. This method seems to be reliable since no biliary duct injuries or leaks were noted in the series.\n\nIn summary, the new laparoscopic technique proposed by Zhuang et al. represents a relatively safe and quick operation that seems to be a better approach in patients with acute cholecystitis who are being operated on within 3 days of symptom onset.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIntroduction and Aims Most patients prefer to discharge from the hospital to their own home, but 11% of all hospitalized patients-and 22.4% of patients with Medicare-require discharge to a post-acute care facility. Hospital systems are increasingly incentivized to facilitate discharge home since a post-acute care facility stay is costly. Post-acute care is most often necessitated by a patient's functional decline during hospitalization. Physical therapists, whose primary treatment objective is generally to improve functional independence, could therefore play a crucial role in promoting improvements in functional status sufficient to enable a greater number of discharges to home. In current practice, however, physical therapists in acute care hospitals do not generally address patients' function-related deficits. They do not generally have the opportunity to do so, since the Inpatient Prospective Payment System incentivizes short hospital stays. Nor have they needed to, since post-acute care facilities have become the primary setting for patients to regain functional independence. In this environment, physical therapists-a constrained resource in most hospitals primarily play a consultative role in which they evaluate functional status during a single visit in order to provide a recommendation for appropriate post-acute rehabilitation needs. With greater focus on ensuring value across the care continuum, healthcare systems are now striving to maintain short hospital stays, but also limit post-acute care utilization. This will require patients to achieve greater functional independence as quickly as possible within their hospital stay. Thus, the role of physical therapists in acute care hospitals must evolve. Intervention Despite the need to evolve, the fact that physical therapists are a constrained resource prompts the need for care prioritization that is optimally targeted. It is currently unclear which patients need physical therapist intervention in the hospital, and how much physical therapy is necessary, in order to achieve a functional status that is adequate to discharge home. We have developed a patient-level clinical decision support tool to guide optimal treatment frequency. This tool-the Physical Therapy Frequency Clinical Decision Support Tool, or PT-PENCIL-is based on a statistical model that predicts discharge home relative to the frequency of physical therapist treatment. The primary goals of this study are to assess the development and implementation strategy for the PT-PENCIL and analyze its effect on improving the proportion of patients who discharge home. The PT-PENCIL will include two solutions integrated into the electronic health record (Epic). For both, Epic will use the underlying statistical model to identify patients for whom daily physical therapy may be indicated in order to facilitate a discharge to home. For such patients, an Epic best practice advisory (BPA) alert will appear on the screen, which will prompt therapists to consider a visit on the next day. The second Epic-integrated solution is an indicator column on the patient lists maintained by therapists, which will identify patients who would benefit from daily PT (a green dot), those who would not (a red dot), and those for whom the PT-PENCIL did not run in Epic. PT-PENCIL will be implemented into clinical care by means of a pilot hybrid type 2 design, informed by the PRISM (Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model) and RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) frameworks. We will accomplish the following primary specific aims: Aim 1: Analyze the effect of using the PT-PENCIL on the proportion of patients discharged home.

        "summary": "Sleep of critically ill patients is highly disturbed with a high sleep fragmentation; patients spend most of their sleep in very short sleep episodes, lasting less than 10 minutes. Causes of theses sleep alterations are complex including environmental noise (alarms, beepers, conversations\u2026), continuous light, nurse care and repetitive measures of vital parameters.\nNumerous studies have reported a relationship between severe sleep alterations and a prolonged weaning period and mortality. Improving sleep quality in critically ill patients is a major challenge to promote ICU patient's recovery.\nA very promising treatment is the application of a nocturnal  quiet-time  during which non urgent care, comfort care, systematic measures of vital parameters are delayed and clustered in order to limit room entries. However,  quiet time  procedures have failed to improve sleep quality to date.\nA miniaturized medical device recording one EEG channel and embedding an automated sleep scoring algorithm running in real-time was devised. This device (positioned on forehead, and continuously recording noise and light levels) indicates if the patient is awake or asleep using a tablet positioned at doorstep of the room, so that nurses know if patient is sleeping, without entering the room.\nHypothesis proposes that applying sleep protection procedures (clustering cares, limiting room entries, reducing lights and noise, delaying non urgent care\u2026) when patients are sleeping (= EEG-guided strategies) will increase patients sleep quality.\nThis study will assess the effect of such device on sleep quality in ICU patients. This is a before / after design. The first group (control group), will be recorded but the sleep scoring will not be displayed by the tablet and patient will be expose to standard care. Then, procedure will be established collegially with nurses, nurses assistants and doctors. Then, the second group (treated group) will be recorded with the device displaying the status of the patient (asleep/awake) and all caregivers will be asked to follow the established rules (EEG-guided sleep protection rules)",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIt is well-known that an altered sleep is often found in ICU and critically ill patients. Sleep quality and duration have been previously reported to be disturbed in critically ill patients. Critical care setting is characterized by multiple light variations due to frequent opening of doors with entrance of medical and paramedical staff, interruption by medical devices and alarms. Indeed, in this environment, sleep quality is reported to be disturbed due to interruptions by staff, alarms and light variations. Although hospitalized patients are recommended to sleep 8 hours a day in a room free of light, noise and disturbances, this is particularly difficult to achieve in intensive care.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are currently no data on the sleep quality of in-hospital intensive care unit patients. Furthermore, there is no systematic practice to optimize sleep (particularly at night) quality in critically ill patients. These lack of data on sleep quality, absence of specific care dedicated to sleep and the current trend to deliver care closer to the patient's room, prompt us to propose a novel approach, that is the use of an electroencephalogram (EEG) guided sleep protection method. Indeed, by monitoring continuously the EEG traces, we can distinguish between sleep and wake phases. When sleep is detected, the system displays an alert which advises the caregivers to protect the patient from care interruption or noise. Although the study has not been reported, this approach is currently used by several health care institutions in Europe.\nThe objective is to evaluate the impact of EEG-guided protection of the patients' sleep in intensive care and its effect on patients' sleep quality, sleep fragmentation, environmental noise and light exposure, caregiver and patients agitation. In addition, we will quantify the impact of sleep optimization on patient, caregiver and society benefits as indicated on the health-economic analysis by the French high authority of health (Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9) which is a key priority for ICU work.

While the pathogenesis of HF is multifactorial, one of the key underlying mechanisms is the disruption of the endocalyx, a glycocalyx layer that lines the blood vessels and regulates the exchange of water and electrolytes between blood and the cardiovascular system. This mechanism occurs even in patients with HF who have otherwise normal kidney function. The key consequence is fluid excess which results in symptoms like peripheral edema and shortness of breath. This fluid excess is typically managed by diuretic treatment, but excessive use of diuretics often leads to electrolyte depletion and worsening of kidney function. Therefore, a non-diuretic treatment option that will allow patients to be less dependent on diuretics is urgently needed. However, existing non-diuretic treatment options are either not effective or are associated with negative consequences. Thus there is a clear clinical need for finding treatments that will help HF patients deal with the fluid excess without relying on diuretics. The main goal of the current investigation is to determine the efficacy of the food supplement Endocalyx in dealing with the fluid excess of chronic HF. For patients with long-term chronic HF, fluid excess can manifest in a variety of ways. Most patients experience symptoms such as shortness of breath and peripheral edema, while others develop hypertension or may have a worsening of kidney function. Endocalyx is a food supplement that has shown to reduce sodium storage in the small intestine, and as a result increase sodium excretion in healthy volunteers. However, the effect of Endocalyx on patients with long-term chronic HF remains unknown. In the current study we will test whether Endocalyx can decrease sodium and water excess in patients with chronic HF. In an explorative pilot study we have previously demonstrated that Endocalyx also has positive effects on blood pressure control and microcirculation in patients with chronic HF and diabetes mellitus with hypertension. This study was not powered to directly demonstrate these effects. For the current study we will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled trial focused on patients with heart failure and fluid excess, as manifested by elevated NT-proBNP levels or symptoms such as shortness of breath, peripheral edema, hypertension or worsening kidney function. The primary outcome will be the degree of fluid excess or symptom burden based on the change in NT-proBNP levels. Secondary outcomes will include changes in body weight, blood pressure, hemodynamic parameters, total body water and urinary sodium excretion as well as adverse events. We aim to include 50 patients. As many as 1 out of 3 patients will drop out prematurely leading to an estimation of an n = 74, which will give a 80% power to identify a 30% difference in NT-proBNP levels between the two study arms, assuming a significance level of 5%.

However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection.

Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients.

At the Rothschild Foundation, as in many Western referral centers, DMEK is currently the surgical technique of choice for the treatment of primary or secondary corneal endothelial decompensation.\nTechnically challenging, it is a relatively tedious surgery to learn, but offers the best visual and refractive results, as well as faster visual and functional recovery in simple cases.\nIn patients without anterior or posterior segment surgical history, the complication rate of DMEK, including graft rejection, is similar to that of other endothelial keratoplasty surgical techniques.\nHowever, in specific cases, in patients with a history of ophthalmological surgery such as vitrectomy, trabeculectomy, large iris defects, anterior synechiae, aniridia or aphakia, the scientific literature shows a higher complication rate for DMEK (increased rate of rebulling and graft decompensation).\nAs a result, other techniques that are less effective on visual results continue to be used for these patients in a large number of centers.\nNonetheless, in our department, DMEK is also performed on these complicated patients.\nWhen it comes to patients with a history of anterior or posterior segment surgery, it seems to us that the surgeons' experience with DMEK allows better visual results than with any other technique, but without any back up regarding the complication rate in the literature.\nThe main aim of this study is to describe, in patients with a history of anterior or posterior segment surgery undergoing DMEK, the 12-months occurrence rate of at least one serious post-operative complication.",

Artificial intelligence, such as a chatbot, could be programmed to simulate the perspective of the mother or the daughter as a tool for pediatricians to practice communication before interacting with real families. Through human-centered design, an iterative problem-solving approach, our overall goal is to develop and test a communication training chatbot tool that is accurate, developmentally tailored for adolescents and mothers, culturally tailored, and aids pediatricians to manage resistance and conflict about contraception to ultimately close disparities in teen births. The investigator's primary hypothesis is that a communication focused intervention will improve pediatrician interactions with dyads about contraception. Through three stages, the study team will develop an artificial intelligence tool as a behavioral intervention. The study team will gather basic communication data to generate, refine, modify, adapt, and pilot test novel communication tools with real-world encounters while keeping humans at the center of attention",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Sexual and reproductive health concerns often arise, but adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these sensitive topics with their parent or provider. Despite clear benefits to contraception use, adolescents may experience challenges in the quality of communication discussing contraception with their providers that can influence their sexual health outcomes. Mothers and daughters are increasingly accessing primary care. Providers may feel unprepared in discussions around contraception. Although a variety of communication training programs exist for pediatrician trainees and health providers, none are culturally appropriate, family based or designed to address the challenges of adolescent reproductive health. Objectives: To characterize the quality of sexual and reproductive health encounters involving adolescents, mothers and their provider in pediatric primary care settings. To evaluate a conversation skills intervention for providers and assess its impact on communication quality of sexual and reproductive health encounters. To identify communication strategies preferred by adolescents and their family that may be embedded in a chatbot communication training program. Methods: This study will be conducted in three stages. In Stage 1 (formative) (50 encounters), we will characterize the quality of sexual and reproductive health encounters involving adolescents, mothers and their provider in pediatric primary care settings. Through separate post-encounter surveys of each triad member, we will determine ideal, moderate, and poor communication interactions with a 4-point Likert scale to describe the overall quality of the interactions (concordant contraception plans, satisfaction), communication (confidence, comfort, self-efficacy, confidentiality) and decision-making (perceived autonomy, ownership and power) to determine ideal, moderate, and poor communication interactions. In Stage 2 (development), we will use machine learning algorithms to design virtual conversations for providers, adolescents and mothers. In Stage 3 (proof-of-concept), we will test how an AI communication training intervention tool can influence triadic interactions by comparing evaluation results of 50 pre and 50 post training encounters using the same assessments as in Stage 1. The investigators will enroll ten physician learners who will train with the chatbot communication training program as a behavioral intervention. Before the training, the 10 learners will complete 5 sexual health clinical encounters with adolescent-mother dyads (50 total encounters) that will be audio-recorded and post-encounter surveys completed. After training with the tool, the same 10 learners will complete 5 more clinical encounters with adolescent-mother dyads (50 total encounters) in the same format to assess for improvement in communication interactions. Discussion: This study aims to provide innovative approaches to train pediatricians in adolescent sexual health care. This project addresses a critical gap in evidence-based communication training interventions for pediatricians focusing on underserved adolescents. Expected outcome of this project will be a culturally appropriate and family-focused conversation skills training for pediatricians engaging with adolescents and parents.",

Purpose: The main goal of this prospective study is to assess the extent of horizontal and vertical bone loss determined by MRI compared with CBCT in molars with deep class restorations and furcation involvement. We also aim to assess the correlation between MRI and CBCT in the measurement of furcation involvement. Methods: 60 subjects will be included sequentially by the clinical periodontal research group of the Department of Periodontology of the University of Graz.

Data on alveolar bone loss will be extracted for the mesial and distal roots of each molar in both CBCT and MRI examinations. Results and conclusion: If MRI is shown to be an acceptable alternative to CBCT, then further research will be needed for an alternative, non-invasive method.

Manual toothbrushes require a more specific manual technique for women, while sonic electric toothbrushes, due to their ease of use, might be an excellent for oral individual prophylaxis. Therefore, the question of which type of manual or electric toothbrush might be more effective in reducing gingival inflammation in pregnant women is still unresolved. In literature there are a large number of in vitro clinical studies on this topic, there are currently no clinical studies investigating this long-term clinical comparison.\nIn this context, this study is a randomized clinical trial consisting of a comparative evaluation between two manual and two sonic electric toothbrushes in the efficacy of the control of plaque in order to reduce gingivitis in women during the period of pregnancy.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: The objective of this clinical research is to evaluate the efficacy of two manual toothbrushes (CS 5460 and Oral-B 123) and two electric toothbrushes (DiamondClean 9000 Philips\u00ae and HydroSonic Easy Curaden\u00ae) when used daily by pregnant women over a 3-month period.\nObjective: Assess the impact of the recommended brushing time (3 minutes minimum) of electric and manual toothbrushes on clinical parameters from baseline during pregnancy.\nMethods: Randomized clinical comparative trial in parallel groups with controlled masking. Fifty-two women were recruited when they were in their first trimester of pregnancy and were randomly distributed into groups using sonic or manual toothbrushes or a combination of both. The initial evaluation is made at baseline (T1) and after 1 and 3 months (T2 and T3) by the principal investigator, independent of the randomization groups. The clinical parameters evaluated were: gingival bleeding (BI), number of sites with BI, gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), clinical attachment (CAL), periodontal pocket (PTRPDEP), and Patient Satisfaction Score (PSS).\nIntervention/Treatment: Participants at baseline were included in the trial in four experimental groups: Group 1 (n = 13), patients using a sonic toothbrush; Group 2 (n = 13), patients using manual with 5460 strands; Group 3 (n = 13), patients using manual toothbrush; Group 4 (n = 13), patients using two brushes during baseline.\nAnalysis: Qualitative and quantitative variables were presented by descriptive statistics: absolute and percentage frequency for qualitative variables; minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation for quantitative variables. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed in the experimental groups, comparing changes from baseline in all parameters before and after treatment between the various groups.\nResults: The mean plaque index before treatment (baseline) was similar between all experimental groups (PBS1 = 3.3\u00b12.6; PBS2 = 3.3\u00b12.6; PBS3 = 2.7\u00b12.8; PBS4 = 3.4\u00b12.7), except for the number of teeth (mean: PBS1 = 21.5\u00b14.2; PBS2 = 21.4\u00b14.7; PBS3 = 22.0\u00b14.3; PBS4 = 21.4\u00b14.6, p= 0.010). Over the evaluation period, there was a significant reduction in plaque (P < 0.0001) in all groups. However, no significant differences were observed between the groups using any toothbrush, the only difference being in the GI index with regard to the treatment performed (p= 0.000). The results of the study conclude that the two toothbrushes, sonic and hydrosonic, were as effective as the manual toothbrush to control gingival bleeding, gingival inflammation, and plaque control.\nEthical Considerations: This study is the direct result of the study of its investigators and a clear need to expand knowledge in this field, which was developed with the participation of the research group, taking into account the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Research Ethics Board of Cl\u00ednica S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 of CIMO, Campinas, based on the National Law No. 7,194, of 17 December 1984 on the Registry of Clinical Trials, in force since August 18, 1986, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nClinical Comparison of Two Sonic Electric Toothbrushes and Two Manual Toothbrushes, Used Under Normal Oral Hygiene Conditions, on the Reduction of Gingival Inflammation in Pregnant Women Aged 18 to 40: Randomized Clinical Trial\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nPregnant Woman\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: Sonicare DiamondClean 9000 Philips\u00ae\n* Device: HydroSonic Easy Curaden\u00ae\n* Device: Manual toothbrush Oral-B 123\n* Device: Manual toothbrush Curaprox CS 5460\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------",

        "summary": "Over 65% of all lung cancer patients experience significant weight loss fuelled by a catabolic state that is represented by enhanced protein breakdown. The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period. The secondary aim is to investigate the feasibility for the subjects to comply with the study protocol. Lastly, the investigators aim to study the feasibility of gathering data on a number of exploratory parameters that may link nutritional intake to clinically relevant outcomes.",

Each participant will be evaluated by a team of expert psychologists and physicians, who will be conducting a structured interview and administering a set of psychopathological scales to assess the symptoms' severity. The participants will also undergo7T multimodal neuroimaging session (including T1-weighted, 1H-MRS and fMRI).\nIn the second part of the study, murine models will be used to study the role of integrin \u03b23 (Itgb3) and protocadherin 9 (Pcdh9) in glutamatergic transmission at a molecular level and to evaluate whether the electrophysiological and behavioral defects identified in Itgb3- and Pcdh9-knockout mice can be restored by CRISPR-mediated transcription activation (CRISPRa).",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nDepression and anxiety disorders are pathological conditions associated with severe economic and social costs. While significant progress has been made in understanding its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, very few molecular targets for drug development have emerged. Here we identify a number of signaling pathways linking integrin \u03b23, Protocadherin-9 (Pcdh9) and dysfunctional synaptic circuitry in glutamatergic circuits in the brain.\nIn order to achieve this aim, the following study arms have been designed:\n1) Patients with Anxious-Depressive Disorders (Anx-Depr.D) and healthy controls (HC) will be enrolled, and neurofunctional and neurochemical assessments will be conducted, including the measurement of excitatory synaptic markers using structural and functional MRI, 1H-MRS.\nExcitatory neurotransmission is critical in the regulation of glutamatergic circuits in cognitive and emotional functions and a dysfunction in this type of transmission has been found in depression and anxiety.\nIn particular:\n- structural brain imaging (e.g., T1-weighted) performed using a 7T-MRI will be used to study the volumetric differences in white and gray matter structures between HC and Anx-Depr.D subjects in the prefrontal-limbic pathway, the area most sensitive to depression and anxiety. This assessment is crucial as the Anx-Depr.D shows significant atrophy of white matter in this specific area, and this atrophy is more severe in patients who have also experienced suicide attempts\n- functional brain imaging (e.g., fMRI) will be used to study the functional connectivity differences at rest and during task in the prefrontal-limbic pathway. Since this pathway is frequently impaired in both depression and anxiety disorders, this assessment will help to identify abnormal functional connections.\n- proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) will be performed to study the altered levels of glutamatergic neurotransmitters in the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, critical hubs in cognitive-emotional control.\nThese specific targets are of potential interest in the pathogenesis of depression. Moreover, they help to test the hypothesis that glutamate neurotransmission in the prefrontal-anterior cingulate circuit is altered in depression and anxiety.\n2) Mice with Pcdh9 deficits will be investigated for changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal-limbic pathway, comparing Pcdh9 KO (homozygotes) and control mice (wild type). Pcdh9 was not known to be involved in the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the nervous system thus far, but it has a role in maintaining the integrity of synaptic connections in the brain, ensuring they are correctly targeted to and from the developing brain. In fact, it is known that Pcdh9 plays a critical role in controlling how cells communicate throughout the developing brain, by ensuring that neurons and other cell types remain connected to the right nearby structures. Abnormal Pcdh9 expression has been implicated in a number of developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as lissencephaly, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Autism Spectrum disorders (ASD). Given the role of Pcdh9 in mediating synaptic connectivity, understanding the dysfunctional circuitry may provide new targets for drug development.\n3) In a series of follow-up experiments, the investigators plan to study the interaction between integrin \u03b23 and Protocadherin9 using co-immunoprecipitation analysis from murine brain. If a causal link is established between the two proteins, the investigators will proceed to study compensatory mechanisms of defective Pcdh9 activity in mice. They will assess whether overexpression of integrin \u03b23 or Protocadherin9 compensates for defects in synaptic glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs. In this case, experiments on murine models will be performed to determine whether overexpression of integrin \u03b23 or protocadherin9 could compensate for defects in synaptic glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs.\nFinally, the investigators will undertake to establish an integrin \u03b23/Protocadherin9 drug discovery program to identify novel compounds that restore glutamatergic syn",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIn the United States and internationally, refugees are one of the fastest growing demographic groups. In Mexico, tens of thousands of refugees arrived after December 2018, when the previous US administration began the \"return-to-Mexico\" policy that separated thousands of families. While this policy was temporary, Mexican families continue to arrive to the Tijuana/San Diego border in high numbers. Many stay in large shelters, awaiting adjudication of refugee claims by Mexican authorities. A unique opportunity exists to intervene during the shelter stay to promote parenting skills and strengthen family relationships and overall well-being. While stressors on parents in refugee shelters have been identified in previous research, no studies address effective interventions to address these challenges. This research is proposed to fill these gaps by creating an innovative and culturally-sensitive learning curriculum to build parenting skills in refugee families facing the challenges of the border environment. By involving the host community directly, this approach will enable parents to learn and practice important skills that lead to more positive parent-child interactions, as well as child behaviors and fewer signs of parental stress. Participating mothers, fathers, and children can learn together while also promoting community and culture within the shelter. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of teaching parenting skills to refugee families and to involve the larger host community in promoting these skills. This proposed investigation has 4 specific goals: to work with parents and community stakeholders in shelter settings to identify the most important parenting skills that they want for their children. These skills will be prioritized into a concise curriculum. To facilitate the delivery of the curriculum through a learning-by-observing model (LOPI), which increases feelings of ownership and efficacy. To test the effectiveness of this curriculum of parenting skills in improving parent-child interactions and reducing signs of parenting stress compared to a control group waiting to receive the intervention while providing a handout on basic parenting skills. To demonstrate, through qualitative analysis, that parenting skills learned in the shelters may be applicable to life post-shelter after refugees cross the US border. This research proposal presents a framework for adapting parenting interventions for refugee-origin families and involves all groups of people in the shelter in identifying the most important needs and learning together in a supportive community setting. The proposed curriculum aims to be accessible, culturally and linguistically sensitive, and effective in promoting the highest quality care for children of refugee families. This research has the potential to contribute to the development of a community-oriented mental health program that will impact a growing population of refugees awaiting asylum in Mexico.",

There are several structured evidence-based training programs, but they are mostly delivered in small groups or in the community and they often lack focus on individualized care for families or on practical skills such as household safety. Further, there is an underreported risk for neglect and abuse of young children with IDDs, but structured training programs for supporting those parents are yet to be fully tested. The intervention: For this study, we want to develop a parenting program that has been found to be effective, but that can be delivered in a practical approach suitable for parents with IDDs.

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",

Medical treatment is usually necessary, lifestyle modifications should always be included. Besides physical activity and a balanced diet, there are also therapeutic approaches from the so called classical complementary medicine. One very important part in Europe is hydrotherapy, based on ideas of Sebastian Kneipp and his contemporaries. In hydrotherapy there are various therapeutic approaches that can be used additionally to conventional therapy. Because conventional medical therapy is often associated with unwanted side effects, these additional approaches experience increasing popularity. In arterial hypertension, temperature-elevating armbaths, developed by Kneipps contemporaries Hauffe and Schwenninger, are a hydrotherapeutic approach that is highly recommended. Even though hydrotherapy has been a part of complementary medicine for more than a century now some therapeutic approaches lack of scientific evidence - especially when it comes to their effect on arterial hypertension. This randomized-controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a temperature-elevating armbath among participants with arterial hypertension. 50 participants will be randomized to either an intervention group or waitlist (treatment as usual).

        "summary": "Healthcare systems in the United States (U.S.) have long faced the considerable challenge of managing budgetary pressures while at the same time helping people with serious mental illness and/or addiction. One potential way to address this challenge is to offer community-based services for individuals who are high-utilizers of expensive emergency and inpatient psychiatric services. Due to the decentralized nature of California governance, responsibility for mental health services falls primarily to the individual counties. The County of Santa Clara, CA invests significantly in community-based services as well as 24-hour care settings. This County adopted an innovative Pay for Performance (PFP) model and contracted with a new care provider to better meet the needs of this patient population and, in turn, reduce demand on the County's 24-hour psychiatric services. Whether this innovative contracting framework will help individuals who thus far have not responded well to mental health services is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the quality of care for these high-need patients was improved and at a sustainable cost. To this end, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted to determine whether this innovative quality improvement initiative, referred to as Partners in Wellness, was successful at reducing the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric care used by enrollees compared to individuals who concurrently received services from the county. Individuals were randomly assigned to the Usual Care (UC) or Pay-For-Performance (PFP) conditions. The primary outcome of this evaluation was reduction in the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services in the target population.\nthe primary outcome of this evaluation was reduction in the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services in the target population.",

The purpose is to evaluate whether a pay for performance program, that includes both performance incentives and intensive treatment, can reduce the use of emergency, inpatient, and other high-cost services by persons with severe and persistent mental illness.\nThe intervention or treatment is an approach that includes intensive case management, individualized assessment and skill building, rehabilitation in the community, peer support, crisis intervention and crisis support, treatment for co-occurring disorders, psychiatric medications, and hospital based care. There are also two financial incentives for providers. The first requires providers to meet certain performance targets by reducing the use of high cost services, with monetary incentives in the form of an 8% bonus if targets are met and a 7% penalty if they are not. The second is a capitated payment system that gives providers a flat amount of money for each client enrolled, but the providers are only paid if clients actually use the services that they pay for.\nThere was a three-year study period that included an 8-month enrollment period and two years of outcome measures collection. We randomly assigned 114 eligible patients on a 4 to 1 basis to either the pay for performance program or to traditional mental health and psychosocial services, and then followed them over two years. At each follow-up period, we assessed use of emergency services, psychiatric and crisis services, residential care, correctional facility services and other costly programs and services.

Two cohorts of participants will be enrolled: 1) CAR T na\u00efve and 2) CAR T experienced.\nUp to approximately 60 patients (15 per dose level per cohort) will be enrolled in dose finding Phase 1 part of the study, which will determine the recommended phase 2 dose.\nPhase 2 will enroll up to approximately 40 additional participants (20 per cohort) to evaluate further the safety and efficacy of IMPT-314.\nIMPT-314 treatment consists of a single infusion of CAR-transduced autologous T cells administered intravenously after a conditioning chemotherapy regimen consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, administered over 3 days.\nIndividual participants will remain in the active post-treatment period for approximately 2 years. Participants will continue in long-term follow-up for 15 years from treatment.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-modified cell therapies are rapidly emerging as a promising approach for the treatment of relapsed and refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL).\nWhile CAR-T cells targeting CD19 represent a significant improvement in therapeutic options for patients with R/R aggressive B-cell NHLs, CAR-T cells targeting B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) which target the CD22 antigen, show even better treatment results. The CD20 antigen is also a valuable surface marker for anti-cancer therapy. CD20 has a high degree of target saturation on the surface of virtually all B-cell lymphomas, even at non-pathological or benign disease stages, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Unlike CD19, CD20 is not a cancer-specific marker, but it is very well expressed on the surface of cells. Based on extensive pre-clinical evaluation of bispecific anti-CD19/20 CAR-T cell clones with excellent in in-vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity, I-Mab has developed a CD19/20 bispecific CAR-T cell product, IMPT-314.\nObjectives: This study is designed as a dose finding Phase I/II clinical trial with an expansion phase. The purpose of Phase I is to evaluate the safety of IMPT-314 in a first-inhuman study in adult R/R B-cell aggressive NHL patients and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMPT-314 based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The primary objectives of Phase II are to confirm the dose level determined in Phase I, to evaluate the complete response (CR) rate and to estimate the safety of the chosen dose level (either MTD or the highest tolerated dose).\nDesign: Phase I consists of 2 parts. In Part A a conventional 3+3 design is applied. The MTD of IMPT-314 in adult R/R B-cell aggressive NHL patients will be determined based on the number of participants experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLTs) within the first 28 days after infusion of IMPT-314. In Part B a response-adapted design is used. Cohort A consists of CAR-na\u00efve patients enrolled at the determined MTD. Cohort B consists of CAR-experienced patients enrolled at the determined MTD.\nThe Phase II part consists of patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell NHL who already initiated the study in the expansion phase of Part B.

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators also hypothesize that the CBT-informed intervention will be more effective than the attitudinal inoculation intervention for increasing COVID-19 vaccination among participants with symptoms of anxiety or depression.",

During the intervention period, participants in the experimental group listened to 20 minutes of Taiwanese Hokkien oldies embedded with BBM once in the morning and afternoon thrice a week. Participants in the control group only listened to Taiwanese Hokkien oldies. Questionnaires and heart rate variability analysis were used to assess participants' sleep quality, heart rate variability, and depressive symptoms.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChronic sleep disturbance or poor sleep quality is a common problem in long-term care institutions. However, few interventions have been examined to alleviate the problem. A possible solution, binaural beats (BBs), is a music technology embedded with an audio signal that stimulates brainwaves to produce a relaxing and stress-reducing state. To test the efficacy of BBs in improving sleep quality, depression, heart rate variab;ity (HRV) among older adults with poor sleep quality, a randomised controlled trial was conducted.\n                The participants were screened from older persons, aged 65 and above, in a long-term care institution in Taiwan. A total of 34 participants (age: 65-89, Hz: 15-20) were randomly assigned into BBM group or control group, with approximately matching of age, gender, marital status, and number of visits from family. The BBM group listened to BB music for 20 min and control group listened to the same music without BB for 20 min in three sessions (Monday to Friday) for 2 weeks. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were used to evaluate sleep quality and depression status, while the HRV analyzer was used to calculate the five markers of HRV. Comparing with the control group, participants in the BBM group showed significant improvement in the total score and seven markers of PSQI, except its subjective item. Besides, the BBM group reported significantly higher depression scores than control group after the two-week intervention. No significant difference of HRV was found between the two groups.\n                This study indicates that listening to BBM music for 20 min thrice a week for two weeks improves sleep quality and self-reported depressive symptoms of older persons with poor sleep quality, however, it does not reduce the actual depressive status in them.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMaternal and fetal well-being is an indispensable requirement for the safe and efficacious conduct of surgery around the puerperium. In recent years, regional anaesthesia (RA) is associated with increasing safety, especially in the obstetric population.\nMany drugs were used in RA to combine the anxiolytic, sedative and antidepressant effects with the analgesic effect of local anaesthetics (LA), to improve their quality and safety.\nThe most widely used agent for this combination is a non-selective, \u03b12 adrenergic receptor agonist, dexmedetomidine (DXM).\nClinical studies on neuro-physiological block characteristics of intrathecal dexmedetomidine with bupivacaine after caesarean section, has not been reported in the English literature.\nThe objectives of this study are to compare DXM with neostigmine. This comparison will assess the effect on neuro-physiological block characteristics between the DXM anesthesia group and the neostigmine group. Assessments of the onset and duration of sensory and motor anesthesia, quality of operative field, maternal satisfaction and pain scores were also determined.\nPatients will be randomized to group 1 which will be receiving 10 \u03bcg intrathecal DXM, Group 2 will be receiving 50 \u03bcg intrathecal Neostigmine as an adjuvant to hyperbaric bupivacaine. and Group 3 will be receiving hyperbaric bupivacaine as a control group.\nDXM, a nonselective, \u03b12 adrenergic receptor agonist, is a potent sympatholytic and it has sedative, anxiolytic and analgesic effects. The sympatholytic action of DXM has positive effects on hemodynamics. The incidence of hypotension in patients receiving DXM anesthesia has been significantly reduced.\nNeostigmine is an indirect cholinomimetic agent which acts as an antagonist of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Neostigmine is a reversible competitive inhibitor for AChE. It combines reversibly with AChE by the formation of an ester link between the carbonyl group of neostigmine and the ester site on the AChE molecule. The carbonyl group in the neostigmine molecule is attacked by a serine residue on AChE, breaking the ester bond, but only in the presence of ACh, which provides another moiety which can combine with the AChE molecule, thus displacing the ACh-enzyme complex. At doses of neostigmine routinely used as a neuromuscular blocking agent, the duration of effect is short because of rapid hydrolysis of neostigmine by AChE.\nIn addition, patients and attending anesthetist will be assessed for the onset, duration of sensory and motor block, quality of operative field, maternal satisfaction measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) and post-operative pain scores measured by the same VAS.\nIntra-operative hemodynamic monitoring will include heart rate (HR) (beat per minute [bpm]), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP ) (mean arterial pressure (MAP) ) and pulse oximetry (SpO2) will be also monitored.\nAt the end of surgery, 25 mg Metoclopramid \u00ae will be administered to the spinal anesthetized patients to assess the post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) incidence.\nIt is very important to compare these two adjuvants to bupivacaine to detect their role in improving sensory and motor block, quality of visual field and maternal satisfaction. As the anxiolytic, antidepressant, analgesic efficacy and physiological profile are different the aim of this study is to know which adjuvant can be used safely, easily and better.\n                This study will be carried out as a double-mask prospective randomized study. It will take place in the Department of Anaesthesia. The patient's age will be between 18 to 40 years old. The patient's physical condition is American Association of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II, and patients with ASA III and high risk will be excluded from the study.",

        "summary": "Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by cardiac abnormalities compromising the ability of the heart to provide a blood supply adequate to the metabolic needs of peripheral tissues. ADHF is characterized by systemic and pulmonary fluid retention, with weight gain, peripheral edema, needing diuretic therapy. Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide. The researchers will perform a spontaneous, prospective, randomized trial aiming at investigating the effect of combined furosemide-induced diuresis and automated matched dehydration, compared with standard furosemide administration in ADHF patients with fluid overload.",

The primary treatment for this entity is diuresis. Current standards recommend the use of loop diuretics for this indication.

This technology promises to allow better fluid removal during diuresis therapy while also maintaining optimal blood volume. However, it is not known if the novel technology leads to better outcomes in decompensated heart failure patients compared to standard diuretic therapy. This study proposes the determination of the effects of Matched Dehydration System compared to standard loop diuretic therapy on acute kidney injury episodes and weight loss in decompensated heart failure patients.

Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent.

Psychiatric, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are examples of conditions that impact the health and quality of life of the population. Due to the effects provided by exercise, it can modify the natural course of these diseases. This concept is important to justify the efforts made by government bodies committed to promoting exercise, such as the WHO. However, the habitual practice of physical activity following the primary guidelines may be hampered by some factors, including those that support the physiological repercussions of exercise on the body, such as muscle pain. In this sense, an important complicating factor such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), present in the post-exercise recovery period, can impair adherence and permanence in physical activity programs, thus representing a considerable barrier to exercise promotion. They can also severely impair the performance of high-level athletes. Flavonoids, present in plants, but also in foods of the human diet, are known to have several biological properties, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground/rational: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood disability, with a prevalence of 2.11 per 1000 live births in high-income countries. CP is attributed to non progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain. An advanced treatment option for individuals with severe CP is Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) treatment. This treatment can be considered when other options, such as oral medication, are insufficient or cause side effects. Previous studies have shown mostly low level evidence for the effect of ITB on spasticity in children with spastic CP. For children with dyskinetic CP, The Amsterdam UMC and Maastricht UMC previously conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial, which provides evidence for the effect of ITB on attaining personal treatment goals after three months of ITB treatment. It was furthermore found that after one year of ITB treatment, personal treatment goals were at least partially achieved in 97% of children and adolescents. Not all children showed similar response to ITB: some benefit more than others in attaining treatment goals. The investigators previous research on the effect of ITB in children with dyskinetic CP, found that a higher level of dystonia prior to ITB and reduction of pain during ITB were associated, for a small part, with attainment of treatment goals. Sample size was not sufficient to look at specific factors associated with specific types of treatment goals. For example, goals on the level of personal caring could be influenced by other factors than goals related to sitting or transfers. Long-term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with spastic and dyskinetic CP have not yet been described in literature. Furthermore, knowing which factors influence outcome on the long term, preferably related to specific types of treatment goals, can be used to inform and select children and adolescents with CP better before initiating ITB. In order to accomplish these goals real life data over a long period of time, and from a large cohort are needed. The Netherlands CP register is an innovative register for data collection which was developed between 2016 and 2020 in a unique collaboration between children with CP, their parents, researchers and health care professionals. The overall aim of the register is to provide personalized, value-based care for children with CP. In the Netherlands CP register, a follow-up registration program is combined with treatment registration. Prospective data collection in the treatment registration will allow us to implement standardized assessment protocols in the two academic medical centres in the Netherlands where baclofen pump implantations are performed, the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC) in Amsterdam and Maastricht UMC (MUMC)in Maastricht.\n\nObjectives: The primary research question of this study is: 1. What is the short- (3 months), medium- (1 year) and long-term (2 years) effect of ITB in children with CP on personal treatment goals? Secondary objectives are: What is the association between the effect on personal treatment goals and on spasticity and/or dystonia? Which factors are associated with treatment success of ITB in children with CP?\n\nStudy design: A prospective observational study will be conducted in Amsterdam UMC and the MUMC using the Netherlands CP register to collect data over a period of 4,5 years. It is anticipated that in these centres 15 to 20 pumps will be implanted in children and adolescents annually. Over the total study period of 4,5 years, we aim to include a total of 67 to 90 children.

Although most patients recover within 2 months after NCRT, some may develop chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury. There is no effective method for predicting which patients are prone to chronic bowel injury after NCRT. This study is aimed at investigating whether the predictive model of chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury can be constructed using the biomarkers of acute colitis.\nObjective: The objective of this study is to construct and validate the predictive model of chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury and determine the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of this prediction model.\nThe prospective, observational and confirmatory clinical study will be conducted by the Department of Radiation Oncology, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University located in Guangzhou, China. The expression levels of immune factors including IL-7, IL-12, IFNgamma, and TNF in 200 pathological tissues after TME, as well as clinical information of these patients will be collected. The follow-up results of these 200 patients will be used for model training and validation.\nMethods: Two hundred patients who are diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer and meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited for the study. During NCRT, patients will be routinely monitored for radiation-induced injury. Patients who develop grade 2 or above radiation-induced acute intestinal injury during or within 1 month after NCRT will be enrolled in the study. After the completion of NCRT, multidensity TME will be performed for all patients. The expression levels of IL-7, IL-12, IFNgamma, and TNF will be detected in the paraffin sections of these patients. We will evaluate the association between these levels and the chronicization of RAII. The prediction model will be constructed using these levels and the collected clinical information.\nThe study arm includes radiation therapy and surgery. The patients will receive a total dose of 40-50 Gy in 5-7 fractions of radiotherapy along with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). We will compare the differences in immune factor levels between patients without chronic radiation-induced intestinal injury and patients with this injury, as well as the differences between the levels before and after radiotherapy. The correlation between the immune factor levels and the clinical evaluation of the treatment is also observed.\nThe prediction model will be evaluated by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for the chronicization of RAII.\nThe area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.75 is considered significant in predicting the chronicization.

        "summary": "Schizophrenia represents a significant contributor to the global burden of disease, with this burden disproportionately impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In India, the burden due to schizophrenia is further exacerbated by low access to effective psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting recovery, rehabilitation, and community tenure, as well as inadequate attention to managing co-occurring chronic medical conditions that result in significantly reduced life expectancy among those living with schizophrenia compared to the general population. A major driver of these alarming gaps in access to care for persons with schizophrenia in India is the limited capacity within primary care settings aimed at addressing the complex co-occurring mental health, physical health, and functional needs of this patient population. There now exists strong evidence demonstrating that community programs delivered in primary care and leveraging psychosocial interventions combined with linkage to specialty psychiatric services are effective for supporting treatment and recovery of schizophrenia in low-resource settings. We will leverage our existing collaboration and robust research infrastructure in both rural and urban settings in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, India to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate whether the use of a digital platform offers added clinical benefit and can support integration of this task shared care for schizophrenia into routine primary care settings. We will address the following aims: 1) evaluate whether the use of the mindLAMP digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness of task-shared community-based psychosocial rehabilitation (COPSI) for individuals with schizophrenia, and 2) determine whether the addition of mindLAMP to the delivery of the COPSI program has an impact on implementation metrics when compared to delivery of COPSI alone.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe prevalence of severe mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, is rising in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and this burden disproportionately impacts lower income individuals who primarily access health care services through publicly run facilities. In India, over 3.5 million people live with schizophrenia, and as the population ages and disease burden shifts to chronic conditions. Individuals living with schizophrenia are increasingly impacted by comorbid medical conditions that require attention in the form of medical care. Importantly, psychosocial interventions, focused on rehabilitation and skill-building, engaging in social activities, managing mental health symptoms, and promoting recovery and community reintegration, hold potential to reduce disability and improve mental health and functioning for individuals living with schizophrenia. Furthermore, building on recent compelling evidence from higher-income countries, community-based programs could be augmented with additional content aimed at addressing risk factors for early mortality, such as lifestyle behaviors, tobacco use, and management of co-occurring chronic medical conditions. Therefore, this study seeks to evaluate the use of a digital platform for supporting the clinical effectiveness of a psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for patients with schizophrenia in primary care settings in India. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) determine the overall effectiveness of the COPSI intervention + mindLAMP on disability, symptoms, and quality of life; and 2) determine whether implementation support with a novel mobile application enhances uptake and utilization of COPSI + mindLAMP. The study will enroll 150 participants with schizophrenia in two separate but similar sites in India. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms: 1) COPSI + mindLAMP or 2) COPSI alone. Participants in both study arms will be enrolled in the standard COPSI intervention, which will be delivered to them by trained Community Health Officers over a 12-month period. Participants in the experimental group will have access to an interactive and customizable mobile application (smartphone app), which can be accessed on-demand at any time. Participants in both study arms will be followed for 12 months to evaluate the long-term impact of COPSI and mindLAMP on disability, symptoms, and quality of life of individuals living with schizophrenia.

        "summary": "Approximately 65, 000 hip fractures occur in the United Kingdom (UK) each year, and more than 99% are repaired by surgery. Roughly half of patients receive spinal anaesthesia, where a small amount (usually less than half a teaspoonful) of local anaesthetic is injected into the lower back, around the nerves that go to and from the hip.\nLow blood pressure is very common during surgery (at least > 30%, depending on definition), and appears to be linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery.\nThere are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. National guidelines recommend that lower doses are given, but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately or often enough.\nThe Anaesthesia Sprint Audit of Practice (ASAP) 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.5 mls of spinal anaesthesia is given, and the investigator has been using this amount in Brighton since 2011. Recently, the investigator has reported a way of transferring vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (e.g. in Coroner's investigations: approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery).\nHowever, analyzing such observational data should also allow the investigator to describe accurately how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (e.g. the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, the investigator hopes to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery, potentially improving people's survival and recovery after hip fracture.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHip fracture is a major burden on individuals, the health service, and economy each year. Surgical treatment reduces death and other poor outcomes, but is not benign as many patients die within a month. Low blood pressure (hypotension) is surprisingly common after hip fracture surgery (> 30%) and is independently associated with a higher risk of death (3% relative rise per 5 mmHg fall in systolic blood pressure). UK guidelines recommend that low doses (< 2mls 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine) are given for spinal anaesthesia to prevent hypotension, but this recommendation is based on data from trials > 40 years old involving younger, fitter patients. There is no observational data describing the blood pressure changes after low dose spinal anaesthesia in older, unfit patients. The investigator provides a retrospective, observational study with outcomes defined by deaths within 30 days of surgery. The investigator aims to analyse the blood pressure changes in the older, unfit patients during and after low dose spinal anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery, using anaesthetic data gathered as part of normal clinical practice. The investigator will describe the haemodynamic changes in the cohort using the latest (2017) European guidelines for measuring and describing blood pressure using the standard ASA definition of hypotension. The investigator will also assess the potential value of a new, more sensitive measure of hypotension (hypotension depth x duration product). Finally, the investigator will use statistical tools to assess whether the frequency of hypotension, and/or the depth/duration product are associated with poor outcomes such as death at 30 days and increased length of hospital stay. By describing the haemodynamic events at a population level, the investigator aims to determine whether lower doses administered using a fascia iliaca block + sedation can prevent hypotension and improve outcome after hip fracture surgery in the older, unfit patients most likely to benefit from surgery.",

In the United States, an estimated 7.5 million women and 15.8 million men suffer from OSA [2].\nPolycythemia is characterized by an increase in the proportion of red blood cells, leading to an increase in the proportion of oxygen-transporting hemoglobin [3] which, by altering the blood viscosity, can have deleterious cardiovascular effects [4]. In addition to altering blood viscosity, the increased number and size of red blood cells can promote the development of atherosclerosis [5]. The association of polycythemia with Obstructive sleep apnea has not been extensively studied, although there are case reports and a retrospective report on the prevalence of polycythemia in patients with OSA but not on the possible relationship of treatment with CPAP and the reduction of the polycythemic process in this population.\nIn 2016, it was estimated that 7-8% of the adult population have polycythemia, with this prevalence increasing with age in men and in pre-menopausal women [6,7]. The prevalence of polycythemia is high in primary care [8]. The relationship of sleep apnea and its treatment (continuous positive airway pressure-CPAP) with polycythemia have been rarely addressed.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAmputations lead to the loss of muscle activity from a portion of the limb that is lost during amputation surgery. The residual muscles are then repurposed from producing movement to helping to control a prosthesis. The current main method of prosthesis control is through the decoding of electrical signals (myo-electric signals) from the residual limb. These control signals are decoded from the electro-myogram (EMG) activity, and can be used to control various types of prosthesis components. However, traditional myo-electric prosthesis designs require frequent training with both a physical prosthesis and virtual training environments to be effective, both of which make frequent visits to a medical facility and/or therapist necessary for effective prosthetic use.\nIn our previous research, we demonstrated the feasibility of using virtual reality (VR) for task-specific training in amputees who received a myo-electric prosthesis. The VR training system used a VR headset to provide visual feedback of prosthesis function, and was found to reduce the time for learning to use a new myoelectric prosthesis when compared to the traditional training and a control group.\nOur previous research also demonstrated that myoelectric prosthesis users had difficulty controlling multiple movements (2 DoF or more) with the myoelectric controller, which is necessary in order to effectively control more complex prosthetics (for example, a 7 DoF hand prosthesis). As a result, many users of myoelectric control systems have difficulty picking up and transporting objects effectively. As a result, there is a significant need in clinical practice to develop novel training interventions and interfaces that are specific to controlling more complex prostheses.\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a new virtual prosthesis functional training system (referred to as MyoTrain AR) for the purpose of training novice prosthesis users to control multiple movements during daily tasks (that is, performing multi-joint movements simultaneously over multiple planes including during transport, manipulation, and release of objects). The training system consists of an augmented reality (AR) headset, a desktop computer, and four SteamVR kinematic trackers. The AR headset provides real-time visual feedback of the prosthesis user's performance and allows for the use of more complex training activities and objects.\nUp to 10 participants with a unilateral upper limb trans-radial amputation will be selected to receive the MyoTrain AR training system. They will undergo 5 full training sessions with the MyoTrain AR system over 3 weeks in a laboratory setting. During the 5 sessions, the participants will use the MyoTrain AR system to perform the GaMA Cup Transfer task that involves reaching for, grasping, and transporting cups of various volumes that are placed at different locations and heights.\nPotential participants may be referred to the study by their rehabilitation physician, therapist, or prosthetist. Eligibility assessment and consent discussions will typically occur remotely. Potential participants will then participate in a one-session pre-screen, where they will undergo an assessment of their muscle function as compared to the muscle function of people with similar limb loss patterns. Those participants who are shown to have sufficient muscle activity from their residual limb to control a pattern recognition-based myoelectric system will then be randomized to either the Experimental (MyoTrain AR) group or to the Control group.",

It is a condition that is usually related to colds and flu. This condition is the most recurring in this population. There is a relationship between the increase in the incidence of antibiotics and the lack of immune response due to ageing. It has been recorded that the elderly population is the greatest consumer of antibiotics. Antibiotics have no antiviral efficacy, do not prevent respiratory diseases caused by viruses such as cold and flu, and therefore, in the prevention of respiratory infections for which antibiotics are prescribed, probiotics have proven efficacy in the long term.

During the remission phases, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms can persist in 50% of patients, for which no satisfactory treatment is available yet.\nChitin-glucan is prebiotic, obtained by extraction, isolation and purification from a fungal resource: the mycelium of Aspergillus niger (a microscopic fungus of the Ascomycetes family) of which it composes the cell walls. The biopolymer consists essentially of two types of polysaccharide chains: chitin (poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) and beta-(1,3)-D-glucan (D-glucose units linked essentially via beta-1,3 bonds). Because of its beta bond, human intestinal enzymes cannot digest it, as a result, the majority of chitin-glucan can reach the colon where it can be fermented by the microbiota.\nBy modulating the composition and/or activity of the intestinal microbiota, fermentation of chitin-glucan could have beneficial effects on health.\nThe aim of the RELIEVE study is to assess if BK003 could improve the relief of global symptoms, individual symptoms, stool consistency and frequency of evacuations, quality of life, anxiety, and depression in patients with Crohn's disease in remission without treatment or with stable maintenance therapy and having IBS-like symptoms and to confirm the product's safety.",

According to Park and Folkman's (1997) Meaning-Making Model, the process of meaning making functions as a coping mechanism. It helps individuals adapt challenging experiences into their lives, ultimately assisting in their psychological adjustment to stressful situations. Based on this theoretical model, principles from meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), literature reviews, interviews with breast cancer patients, and expert consultation, an 8-week online individual psychological intervention was developed. It was aimed at facilitating the finding of new meanings in the experience of breast cancer and promoting psychological well-being. It includes psycho-educational, cognitive, existential, and behavioral components explicitly focusing on the meaning-making process. This intervention is called the Meaning Centered Coping Program (MCCP). The main purpose of this study was to test whether the MCCP was an effective intervention program for women diagnosed with breast cancer. For this purpose, the study sample consisted of women with stage I, II, and III breast cancer. Then, participants were randomly assigned to the MCCP group and the wait-list control group.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is primarily a neuromotor disorder that affects the development of movement, muscle tone and posture. The underlying pathophysiology is an injury to the developing brain in the prenatal through neonatal period. Although the initial neuro pathologic lesion is non-progressive, children with cerebral palsy may develop a range of secondary conditions over time that will variably affect their functional abilities. The prevalence of CP varies between 1.5 to more than 4 cases per 1,000 live births worldwide. The motor impairments associated with CP can range from mild to severe, affecting different muscle groups and leading to difficulties in activities of daily living and participation in social and recreational activities. Children with CP often experience motor impairments that affect their gross motor function, leading to limitations in activities and participation. These motor impairments can also have a negative impact on bone health, resulting in reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of skeletal complications. Gross motor function (GMF) refers to the ability to perform coordinated movements using large muscle groups, such as walking, running, and jumping. It is a key aspect of physical ability and independence in daily activities for children with CP. Previous research has shown that gross motor function is closely associated with bone health in this population. However, further investigation is needed to explore the specific nature of this correlation and its implications for intervention strategies. Gross motor function is commonly assessed using standardized tools such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Quality of life is a multidimensional construct that encompasses physical, psychological, and social well-being. In the context of cerebral palsy, understanding the impact of gross motor function on quality of life is crucial for comprehensive care and intervention planning. Children with CP may face limitations in mobility, participation in activities, and social interactions, which can significantly affect their overall quality of life. Exploring the relationship between gross motor function and quality of life can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the holistic well-being of children with CP. The quality of life in children with CP is not only influenced by their motor function but also by their overall health and well-being. Bone health plays a crucial role in maintaining the physical abilities and independence of individuals, as well as their overall quality of life. Impaired bone health in children with CP can lead to limitations in mobility, increased pain, and reduced participation in activities, which can have a significant impact on their overall well-being. Bone mineral density, on the other hand, is an important measure of bone strength and overall skeletal health. Children with CP often exhibit lower BMD compared to typically developing peers due to factors such as reduced weight-bearing activities, muscle weakness, altered biomechanics, limited mobility, and hormonal imbalances. This reduced BMD increases their susceptibility to fractures and skeletal deformities, further impacting their functional abilities and quality of life.\n\nOfficial Title: Relation Between Bone Mineral Density, Gross Motor Function and Quality of Life In Children With Cerebral Palsy\n\nConditions: Cerebral Palsy, Bone Density, Low, Gross Motor Development Delay\n\nIntervention / Treatment: * Other: Group 1\n* Other: Group 2\n\n\nParticipation Criteria:\n=================\nEligibility Criteria: \nInclusion Criteria: Children with CP (spastic diplegia and quadriplegia).

        "summary": "Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism can have multiple causes; most patients suffer from primary autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma, or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease occur. Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCurrent laboratory guidelines recommend measuring serum TSH levels to monitor thyroid hormone status in hypothyroid patients using levothyroxine. This is a widely used indicator to determine the dosage and efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy. However, the interpretation of TSH results in a large group of patients using levothyroxine causes difficulty for their physicians. For hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, it is advised to have TSH values within the reference interval; for patients with hypothyroidism due to total thyroidectomy, a suppressed TSH is required. In patients with hypothyroidism due to Graves' disease, the TSH concentration must be slightly suppressed with a suppressed TSH (i.e. at low concentrations). Despite these different requirements for TSH, fT4 concentrations are often measured in a majority of the patients to ensure treatment efficacy. A higher fT4 level is also seen in the majority of the patients using levothyroxine. These high fT4 levels will only cause treatment problems in patients in which a TSH-guided treatment is impossible (e.g. in patients with hypothyroidism due to central disease). This study investigates whether the treatment efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy can be monitored by measuring other thyroid hormone markers and ratios of these markers. Thyroid hormone markers as total T4 (TT4), total T3 (TT3), rT3, SHBG, acylcarnitines and several amino acids will be assessed and compared to outcomes in healthy controls.

        "summary": "After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion.

Parents of these infants report lower self-efficacy and worse mental health when compared to parents of term infants. There is an urgent need to use effective ways to improve parental self-efficacy and associated parent psychosocial and infant health outcomes. To improve parent and baby outcomes, the investigators will build on an existing eHealth solution to create Chez NICU Home+ (CNH+), which offers web-based, parent-targeted, interactive educational tools, virtual communication, and text message support during a baby's NICU stay. We will evaluate whether Chez NICU Home+ improves parental self-efficacy (primary outcome), parent psychosocial, and infant health outcomes in parents of babies requiring a NICU stay, and the implementation (ease and uptake) of Chez NICU Home+ in multiple sites. This study will be a multicentre implementation study, with a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial across four Canadian NICUs. At the beginning of the study, data regarding current care will be collected from all sites to determine a baseline. Following baseline data collection, every five months one of the sites will start using the Chez NICU Home+ solution. A total of 800 parents and their babies, who are expected to stay at least 5 days in the NICU, will be recruited. Parents will complete a survey on psychosocial adjustment and infant outcomes when the study begins, as well as at 14 and 21 days after enrollment, at infant discharge from the NICU, and at 6 months post-discharge. Infant health and development outcomes will be collected at discharge, 6 and 18 months post-discharge via health records.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCerebral autoregulation (CA) is the ability of the brain to maintain a stable level of cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite changes in systemic blood pressure (BP). There are two main cerebral autoregulation pathways that have a significant impact on CBF: the myogenic pathway, which acts through the endothelium and smooth muscle of cerebral arteries, and the metabolic pathway, which acts through local CO2 levels and extracellular fluid.\nThe mechanisms of CA have been studied in the cerebral artery by using techniques such as transcranial Doppler (TCD), transcranial near-infrared spectroscopy (TNS), laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These techniques have demonstrated that the myogenic and metabolic autoregulation pathways have opposite response patterns during acute BP changes, which means that the myogenic pathway tends to constrain blood vessels when BP is high, while the metabolic pathway tends to vasodilate blood vessels when BP is low. The metabolic pathway is known to have a rapid response compared to the myogenic pathway, which tends to have a slower response time. CA is also influenced by various diseases and conditions, such as brain tumors, cerebral aneurysms, stroke, trauma, and headache.\nHyperperfusion is an increase in blood flow and pressure associated with a decrease in arteriolar resistance. It is often thought of as an indicator of abnormal autoregulation.\nSome studies have indicated increased incidence of CH in carotid revascularisation. These results are related to incomplete restoration of CA after carotid revascularisation. In most previous studies, the incidence of CH varied between 2.8% and 24.8%. The cause may be due to carotid revascularisation-induced cerebral hemodynamics disorder.\nFor the risk factor that cannot be corrected, the only effective treatment is the early detection and prevention of CA. Therefore, the present study is aimed at improving the early detection and early prevention of CA, thus to reduce the incidence of CH after CAS.\nUnderstanding these mechanisms and determining the most effective autoregulation pathways to regulate CBF, clinicians can optimize cerebral hemodynamics in patients receiving CAS.\nIn this study, we will try to find the risk factor of CH after carotid revascularisation, the early detection of CA in patients undergoing carotid revascularization, thereby reducing the incidence of CH after carotid revascularisation.\nIf you have any questions during this study, you can contact the study organizer or the study manager at any time.",

Initial work conducted with undergraduate samples showed benefit of EW. Since then, EW studies have been conducted across a variety of populations including persons coping with chronic illness. Benefits have ranged from better lung function among asthmatics to fewer physical symptoms among women with breast cancer.

TXA is a synthetic amino acid that blocks plasminogen conversion to plasmin, to stabilize clot formation. The intravenous (IV) efficacy in reducing hematoma rates has been established in implant-based breast reconstruction, as well as in reduction mammaplasty. However, there are currently no studies investigating the use of IV TXA in patients undergoing GAM.\nThe investigators propose a single-center, prospective randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in decreasing hematoma and seroma rates for top surgery patients at UCSF. Patients will be randomized into two groups, an experimental group receiving IV TXA and a control group that will not receive IV TXA.\nPatients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) at a concentration of 1g/10ml over a period of 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction.

        "summary": "The proposed project seeks to achieve four objectives that will, collectively, evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP-1) -a model for a home visitation and case management program for parents who used substances during pregnancy. First, the proposed project aims to estimate the causal impact of PCAP-1 on preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. Second, the project will estimate PCAP-1's effectiveness in achieving other program goals: parent recovery, parent's connection with needed comprehensive community resources, and preventing future children from being exposed to drugs and alcohol prenatally. Third, the project intends to estimate any cost savings from the perspective of the state. Finally, causal evidence of program effectiveness across the prior three objectives would enable PCAP-1 to be rated according to strength of evidence on relevant federal registries (i.e., FFPSA and HOMEVEE). All four objectives will be pursued by leveraging an ongoing randomized control trial (RCT) of PCAP with substantial backing from public and private partners, including the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OK's Title IV-E agency). This quasi-experimental project will recruit 40 new participants to receive PCAP-1 services and will use data on participants from the existing trial for the control group. This extension of the original RCT is efficient and highly feasible, drawing upon and adapting an existing evaluation framework and protocol. This design will facilitate an unbiased estimation of one-year program effectiveness while also enabling a comparison of the differential effectiveness of PCAP-1 and the original three-year PCAP model as a secondary benefit. Moreover, given that the population PCAP serves are disproportionately poor and low-income and PCAP is designed to be culturally competent and relevant, PCAP-1 harbors the potential to address inequities in child welfare outcomes, substance use disorder treatment services, and child and family well- being by improving outcomes for these families. With a strong backing by state agencies and community partners, the evaluation of PCAP-1 will contribute to a knowledge gap in the field for in-home program models serving a highly vulnerable population with high rates of child welfare involvement and use of foster care.",

Rituximab combined with chemotherapy improves outcome (progression-free and overall survival) in patients with follicular lymphoma and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, there is still uncertainty in the management of patients with SMZL, especially in the presence of high-risk features. This is partly due to the fact that the clinical course of SMZL is very heterogeneous. Previous studies in patients with SMZL have reported 5-year overall survival rates between 43-65% in patients with no specific treatment. Zanubrutinib is a potent and selective Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor with high response rates and favourable safety profile in Mantle Cell Lymphoma. BTK has recently been reported to be expressed in SMZL and also identified as the driver kinase of B-cell receptor (B-cell receptor)- mutated non-follicular non-GCB lymphoma, including SMZL.\nThis study will evaluate, in a prospective randomized trial, whether treatment with zanubrutinib (with or without rituximab) results in an improvement in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) compared to treatment with rituximab alone in patients with previously untreated symptomatic splenic marginal zone lymphoma.

        "summary": "Admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is well-recognized to be extremely distressing and stressful for the patient and family. As medical research and technology have advanced more and more children in the PICU are surviving, however in turn incurring new and persistent impairments across physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains of health. This phenomenon is often referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments not only impact the patient but parents have also been found to have poor emotional health outcomes following discharge from the PICU.\nConsistently, parents/caregivers of children admitted to the PICU report their primary concerns to be 1) the overwhelming physical environment of the PICU, 2) uncertainty about the child's survivorship and outcomes, 3) relationships and communication with staff, and 4) feeling helpless. Additionally, research has shown that caregiver-perceived stress during the child's hospitalization positively predicts post-traumatic stress three months after discharge for parents/caregivers (Nelson et al., 2019), which may translate into higher risk and duration of post-traumatic stress in their children. Therefore, providing an in-hospital outlet such as a PICU Journal for patients and families to express their subjective experiences may help bridge the gap between perception and reality as a means of buffering against post-traumatic responses. Conceptually, a semi-structured journal intervention may integrate the therapeutic aspects of journaling while also providing pertinent information and serving as an advocacy and communication tool. Prior research has demonstrated the use of a PICU Journal is feasible for implementation and has been well-received by families of children in the PICU (Herrup et al., 2019).\nTherefore, the aims of this mixed-method study are to 1) examine the relationship between this journaling intervention and the perceived stress, care engagement, symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and the development of PICS in parents of children hospitalized in the PICU, and 2) examine the relationship between parent participation in this intervention and the development of PICS-p in children, and 3) assess the feasibility of this intervention from key stakeholders.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) serves as the frontline of pediatric healthcare, providing life-supporting medical care for seriously ill patients. While this intense care has led to more children surviving critical illness, it leads to a significant number of adverse events, long-term complications, and a period of time when families are not able to engage with or support their ill child. Research studies have shown that these adverse health outcomes can be significantly decreased when parents are actively engaged in care decisions and the emotional experience of their child\u2019s hospitalization.\nHowever, the PICU can be a distressing and overwhelming place for families, and it can be difficult to find ways to engage them in their child\u2019s care. Currently, medical teams do not have a system in place to support parent engagement in their child\u2019s PICU experience. Furthermore, there is a lack of research investigating parent engagement in high-risk, acute care medical settings. The first step in addressing this gap is to work with families during their time in the PICU to create a journal that serves as a tool for parents and pediatric healthcare teams to communicate with one another and support the family's coping, caregiving, and self-care needs.\nObjectives: 1. Identify parental and child needs that can be met within the PICU to support coping, caregiving, and self-care needs.\n2.

An effective treatment for spatial neglect is 10 days of visuomotor training while wearing optical prisms (PAT), however many clinicians [fail to diagnose spatial neglect and use this approach. In this study, the investigators will develop a brain scanning test that could objectively identify the Veterans with spatial neglect after stroke who are the best candidates to receive PAT and recover their ability to function.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nProject Summary/Abstract:\nCognitive deficits after right brain stroke, such as impaired spatial cognition and lack of attention to the left side of space, cause significant functional disability, and can be mistaken for inattention or laziness. The principal goal of cognitive rehabilitation is restoration of function to improve quality of life. This project targets the right brain stroke syndrome of spatial neglect (SN), defined as damaged control of left visual space, which accounts for 12-55% of stroke survivors in inpatient rehabilitation units. Individuals with SN are 50% less likely to return home, and half of SN survivors lose their license after stroke. A personalized approach to SN rehabilitation must balance three factors: i) accurate diagnosis of SN (many stroke survivors do not have this diagnosis), ii) efficient administration of effective treatments, iii) cost-efficient care delivery. There is a pressing need for this personalized approach to restore function and independence for Veterans with SN.\nThe purpose of the research is to determine if a validated clinical predictor of effective SN rehabilitation can be identified from routine clinical data, in order to guide clinical decision-making about which survivors should receive this specialized treatment. The investigators have recently published on the predictive value for recovery of functional independence after rehabilitation of a clinical index (the Existence of Aiming Spatial Neglect) and of neuroimaging, specifically disconnection of dorsolateral frontal and right thalamocortical regions. Here, the researchers have two specific aims. (1) To develop a brain imaging biomarker which indicates the highest likelihood of having SN that affects movement, action and planning, and (2) to determine how these biomarkers can help to predict improvement in daily life function after receiving prism adaptation therapy. Based on our previous work, the investigators predict that this clinical index will be an effective predictor of PAT rehabilitation outcomes, which could translate to improved quality of life after stroke. The investigators have developed PAT for stroke survivors, resulting in the largest collection of PAT outcome data, and have identified a clinical index of PAT outcome prediction based on the presence of Aiming SN. The goal of this proposal is therefore to identify a validated biomarker of the presence of Aiming SN, to determine if including brain imaging biomarkers refines this clinical index of PAT outcome response. The investigators' preliminary findings suggest that subcortical disconnection is the defining attribute of Aiming SN. Thus, the investigators expect to find a strong correlation between Aiming SN and the disconnection of frontal regions with subcortical and parietal regions. These neural biomarkers are needed to support a clinical trial examining the impact of PAT on outcome, to be submitted to the VA National Center for Rehabilitation Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders.",

In traditional open surgery, most surgeons prefer to disconnect the pancreas neck in the center of the pancreas at the beginning of the surgery. However, with the development of laparoscopic surgery, researchers found that removing the center part of the pancreas neck can lead to pancreatic fistula after the surgery. On the other hand, a few surgeons would conduct extended pancreatic neck transection during laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, which was proved to be safe and effective by limited randomized controlled trials. \nMethods/Procedure: 180 patients with benign or resectable malignant tumors were enrolled and randomized into extended transection group or conventional transection group. After operation was accomplished, patients were followed-up for 3 months and 1 year. Pancreatic fistula was defined and graded according to 2008 International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery criteria, and postoperative morbidity was evaluated by the Clavien-Dindo Score. \nMain results: Pancreatic fistula incidence was 26.30% (18/69) in extended transection group, which was similar to the 28.05% (19/68) in conventional transection group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.797). The location of the pancreatic duct in the pancreatic transverse section showed no difference between two groups. No pancreatic anastomotic leakage was found during the operation and the follow-up after 3 months (P\u00a0=\u00a01.000).

In fractures in the lower ribs (8th-12th ribs), intra-abdominal organs injury such as liver, spleen and kidney should be investigated. 11-12. ribs fractures are rare because the ribs are more flexible (floating).\nPain is the most important symptom indicating rib fracture, and it usually increases with coughing, breathing, and movement. Broken rib ends can be felt with palpation with sever tenderness at the site of fracture. Pneumothorax and/or hemothorax may develop as a result of the sharp end of the broken rib causing lung parenchymal damage[2].",

However the utility of the MMST as a viable alternative to the more commonly used Trier social stress test (TSST) to elicit HPA reactivity remains unclear as meaningful increases in saliva cortisol (> 2.5 nmol/l) have been shown to occur in <50% of participants yet the TSST typically elicits meaningful increases in saliva cortisol in >70% of participants; likely as a consequence of the greater social evaluative component in the TSST.\nUsing a randomised between groups design, this study aims to compare psychobiological responses to the MMST and TSST.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThis project will compare acute psychological stress responses to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and the Mannheim Multicomponent stress test (MMST). While the TSST is the most widely used stressor protocol, recent literature reviews have concluded that, due to some methodological limitations, not all physiological responses to the TSST were consistent with the SNS stress paradigm. Therefore, the aim of this project is to improve the validity of acute psychological stress tests by using the MMST, which can better measure the impact of mental stress by specifically targeting the SNS response.\n                Previous studies have reported significant salivary cortisol rise in response to laboratory stressors. This increase is primarily attributed to exposure to social stimulus (e.g., the TSST) accompanied by speech or arithmetic tasks. However, many investigations reported contradictory findings regarding the magnitude of saliva cortisol response induced by these tasks. Therefore, the project will use a standardized laboratory stressor and measure salivary cortisol response from baseline to peak and to recovery, using standard biochemical techniques (ELISA). In addition, we will assess whether differences in acute cortisol response are associated with trait anxiety, as previous studies showed significant links between trait anxiety and physiological response to social stress.\n                Cortisol is a biochemical correlate of the stress response. However, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) can be another biomarker for the acute stress response. It is a human salivary enzyme, whose activity has been used in the diagnosis of pathological stress (such as depression). Previous studies have shown a positive correlation between sAA and salivary cortisol after psychosocial stress tasks. Therefore, the project will examine the association between sAA and salivary cortisol induced by mental stress to clarify the utility of sAA as a biomarker of acute psychological stress.\n                Saliva cortisol and sAA will be used to examine the relationship between psychological stress and the immune response after the stress tests. Some studies showed that an acute psychological stress test can down-regulate the cellular immune response (measuring the natural killer cells activity). However, other studies failed to find significant negative effects of psychological stress on immune function. Therefore, the project will combine two specific immune biomarkers (e.g., natural killer cells activity, cellular proliferation) to examine the long-term (7 days) impact of acute psychological stress on immune function.\n                Furthermore, we aim to examine the long-term impact (7 days) of acute psychological stress on the cortisol metabolism by measuring the cortisol free fraction. The cortisol free fraction is the amount of free cortisol (unbound to cortisol binding globulin) in the blood. This ratio is commonly used as a measure of glucocorticoid (GC) activity since the unbound fraction has direct access to GC receptors in the target tissues. Additionally, we will examine the association between acute psychological stress and plasma oxytocin levels. Oxytocin is known as a hormone of social bonding and plays a key role in social interactions (e.g., during pregnancy and lactation).\n                We hypothesize that participants performing acute psychological stress will exhibit elevated sAA and cortisol levels in response to the tests. However, due to the small number of previous studies, we expect that the association between sAA and/or cortisol and the immune response of cortisol free fraction, natural killer cells activity and cellular proliferation is not clear at this time.",

The majority of evaluations and treatment interventions for acute pediatric elbow pain involve imaging by radiography. While acute elbow pain is often self-limiting and due to either a distal radial fracture or an elbow subluxation, up to one half of all pediatric elbow evaluations will not identify a fracture on radiography, resulting in significant unnecessary radiation exposure. Therefore, it is imperative to be able to differentiate between these two conditions in children as both have different management plans. In addition, acute distal radial fractures have a high probability of being occult (missing on imaging) when visualization is limited by fracture comminution or subtle findings which are seen on a later imaging exam (CT or MRI). Ultrasound has become one of the most commonly utilized imaging techniques due to its cost effectiveness and availability in the ED. Ultrasound has been shown to accurately detect elbow fractures in adults with good sensitivity and specificity. There are currently no studies using ultrasound to address acute distal radius fractures in children.\nDespite the availability of ultrasound in the majority of EDs, there is limited literature on using ultrasound for diagnosing pediatric elbow injuries. The pediatric elbow is a complex area of the body with a small amount of fat between tendons and ligaments and is typically difficult to image with traditional ultrasound techniques. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to determine if a novel pocket-sized ultrasound device called Butterfly IQ is capable of imaging the pediatric elbow and can be used by emergency physicians to detect injury. This study will also determine if pocket-sized ultrasound can be used to differentiate between a distal radial fracture and elbow subluxation. This study will be conducted in an Academic Level 1 Pediatric Hospital Emergency Department. \nAdditionally, after enrollment in an open-label trial, eligible children will receive a pocket-sized ultrasound exam and be followed up 2 weeks later for presence of fracture on subsequent imaging.

A positive HVA angle is defined when the first metatarsal is tilted laterally and the HVA angle is > 15 degrees.

Depending on the extent of the cleft palate, the degree of functional loss varies, but both eating, hearing, speech, bite and appearance can be affected.\nPatients treated for isolated or combined cleft palate may suffer from velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), which means difficulties in closing the passage between the oral and nasal cavities during speech. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is associated with hypernasality, audible nasal air leakage and weak articulation, which might lead to difficulties with communication and social stigmatization.\nThe most common form of speech-improving surgery is a posterior based velopharyngeal flap, creating a bridge between the palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall to more easily compensate for the abnormal airflow through the nose during speech. However, surgical management of VPI is challenging, with variable success rates reported in the literature. In a retrospectively based questionnaire study on patients who underwent surgical treatment of VPI, 30% experienced only a small speech improvement or no improvement at all. In addition, postoperative speech impairment have also been reported, as well as perioperative bleeding and postoperative sleep apnea. Thus, selecting the patients who benefit most from speech-improving surgery is therefore of great importance.\nThe aim with the current study is evaluation of speech function through patient- and parent-response outcome measurements following surgical treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency in children with isolated or combined cleft palate.",

Among potentially life-threatening events, vaginal cuff dehiscence complicates 0.14-1.38% of procedures, and any vaginal cuff complications (dehiscence, hematoma, bleeding, infection) are estimated to affect 4.7-9.8% of patients. In this scenario, any preventive strategy can provide clinically relevant benefits. Regarding colporrhaphy, only the adoption of a laparoscopic approach instead of a vaginal approach is supported by high-quality evidence. Our group demonstrated that the laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff after total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces the incidence of vaginal cuff complications.\nAmong other potentially effective interventions, the use of barbed sutures was associated with a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence than the standard suture. In a recent meta-analysis, the use of barbed sutures has been associated with a pooled incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence of 0.4% versus 2% after a traditional vaginal suture. However, this evidence is limited because most pooled studies were retrospective, and only two were randomized controlled trials. Moreover, these two randomized controlled trials had a very small sample size and were not powered to detect clinically relevant differences. On that basis, despite the promising utility of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the choice of the type of suture is not evidence-based but still guided by personal opinions, as well as by the preference and habits of the operators.\nTherefore, this study aims to investigate whether the laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure with barbed suture determines a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence and complications than conventional sutures after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nGambling addiction has often been conceptualized as the result of reward processing dysfunction in the brain, particularly in the striatum, a key structure of the reward system. Although a number of studies have provided support for this hypothesis, neuroimaging studies have produced inconsistent results, suggesting either hypo- or hyper-reactivity to rewards in gambling addiction. These inconsistencies have been the subject of intense debate, but remain unexplained to this day, hampering our understanding of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction. Objectives Primary objective: This project will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional, respectively. Secondary objective: This project will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nTesting the Interplay of Gambling, Emotion and Reward\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nGambling Addiction\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: fMRI\n* Other: Ecological Momentary Assessment\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: For all participants (gamblers and healthy subjects) Aged between 18 and 65 Fluent French, read and spoken Male and Female Informed consent to take part in the research For gamblers : Number of DSM-5 critera for gambling disorder \u22653 Score \u2265 5 on the Problem Gambling Severity Index questionnaire (PGSI) Have a smartphone For healthy subjects : no DSM-5 criteria for gambling addiction Score \u2264 2 on the Problem Gambling Severity Index questionnaire (PGSI) Exclusion Criteria: For all participants (gamblers and healthy subjects): Contra-indication to MRI Protected Adults Breast feeding or pregnant women Neurological disorder or severe chronic illness (diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease or liver disease, inflammatory disease\u2026.)

        "summary": "Laparoscopy has become an indispensable part of modern surgery. Vision is an important and defining element of laparoscopy and significantly affects the outcome of an operation in regard to time, mistakes and precision. Several new imaging systems have become available for laparoscopic surgery, including three-dimensional (3D) high-definition (HD), and two-dimensional (2D) ultra-high-resolution (4K) monitors. In experimental and clinical settings, several studies have been published in recent years suggesting that 3D systems present a number of potential benefits for surgeons and patients compared to the conventional 2D systems. The 3D HD system significantly reduces operation time and blood loss, and additionally shortens hospital stay. However, the performance of 3D systems against the new, ultra-high-definition 4K systems is barely known and highly controversial. There is a paucity of studies comparing these two imaging systems in clinical settings. The goal of this clinical trial is to compare 2D 4K versus 3D HD imaging systems in a complex bariatric surgery, more precisely a gastric bypass operation. The investigators aim to investigate the hypothesis stating that the use of the 3D HD system yields a significant improvement in operating time compared to a 2D 4K system in bariatric laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, in order to give a comprehensive overview of the comparison of 2D 4K and 3D HD laparoscopy in a clinical setting, the investigators will assess the workload of the surgeon as well as the intraoperative and postoperative complications including the hospitalization time.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nObesity is a multi-factorial chronic disease and an important health problem in developed countries. Worldwide there are more than two billion overweight or obese adults and 35% of the world's population suffer from obesity. The economic burden of obesity is overwhelming, with estimated direct and indirect costs for Germany in 2007 being 33.6 billion euros. The main problem of obesity treatment is the lack of effective therapy. This study investigates the effectiveness of different laparoscopic imaging systems, the Olympus and Leica imaging systems, for bariatric surgery and to analyze the impact of different imaging systems on the clinical outcome of the patient compared to each other.\n2D 4K and 3D HD cameras are currently the most used camera system in minimal invasive surgery; however, they are not equally available and some countries mainly use the 2D 4K camera system while others mainly use the 3D HD camera system. The investigation focuses on comparing the effectiveness of 2D 4K and 3D HD Laparoscopic imaging systems during Bariatric Surgery.\nThe evaluation of the primary outcome should be comprehensive enough to evaluate the impact of the surgical image on each clinical outcome parameter. For this purpose, the operation time has been chosen as the primary outcome parameter. This parameter is also the easiest to measure and determine. The workload of the operating surgeon is another secondary outcome parameter. It is also important to document potential intraoperative and postoperative complications, which have a great impact on the success and outcome of bariatric surgery. Since the choice of imaging systems depends on the available resources, and these imaging systems are costly, there is a growing need for evidence and recommendations for a better use of these resources. In Germany, only a few publications exist, which focus on the assessment of different imaging systems.\nWith the proposed study, a comparison of 2D 4K and 3D HD laparoscopic imaging systems for bariatric surgery will be made using an RCT under real conditions. This will give recommendations for better use of the available resources and provide a comparison between the two imaging systems in a real hospital setting.\n\nInclusion of subjects into the study\nInclusion Criteria:\nPatients with the indication for bariatric surgery (SMOB guidelines: BMI >35,\nAge >18), Cumulative two years of controlled conservative dieting without weight loss\nInformed Consent\nExclusion Criteria:\nPatients with the indication for gastric bypass, BMI >50, Lack of adequate weight loss therapy for two years\nMalignant disease, Liver cirrhosis (Child A), Morbus Crohn, Carcinoma patients,\nSerious mental illness requiring treatment (not attributable to obesity),\nChronic abuse of drugs, Lack of compliance (missed appointments, inability to cooperate),\nLack of understanding of the requirements and conditions of postoperative therapy and treatment (confirmed by the specialist)\nPatient not signing the Informed Consent\nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria are chosen very carefully and are based on international guidelines and experience from bariatric centers.

Secondary outcomes include investigation of the effects of SIBO on ventilator associated pneumonia, as well as ICU length of stay and all-cause in-hospital mortality rate in critically ill patients.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIntroduction: \nSmall intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) remains to this day a syndrome that is not fully understood. Initially, it was considered quite rare, but today there are reports suggesting a SIBO prevalence between 6 to 15% of healthy, asymptomatic people and reaching 80% in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. It is often involved in various disorders, such as diarrhea and malabsorption. It is defined as an increase in the number and/or disturbance in the type of bacteria in the upper part of the intestinal tract. SIBO occurs when the homeostatic mechanisms of the small intestine are disturbed. The two main conditions that favor microbial overgrowth in the small intestine are decreased acid secretion from the stomach and small bowel dyskinesia. The literature is scarce concerning the effects of SIBO on critically ill patients. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the effects of SIBO on mechanically ventilated patients. It is a non-invasive observational study employing a modified technique to obtain exhaled air from the ventilator tubes to perform a standard hydrogen breath test for SIBO diagnosis. Lactulose is used as a substrate. Specifically, each patient is administered 20 g of lactulose diluted in 400 ml of water through the nasogastric tube. Measurements are performed at 0-15-30-45-60-90-120-180 min from lactulose administration. During measurements, a valve attached to a collecting bag at the end of the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit, is kept open and the collecting bag is filled by several patient exhalations. After valve closure and bag isolation, the air is drawn by a 50 ml polyethylene syringe which is connected to the valve system to prevent losses and/or contamination. Then the air is blown into the breath hydrogen monitor and the expired hydrogen measurement is recorded. The hydrogen breath test is repeated at predetermined, protocol-based time intervals for all participants included in the study; 1st/day of admission, 3rd, 5th and 7th day of ICU stay. The 1st day measurement serves as a measure of eligibility, and patients exhibiting abnormal values of hydrogen breath testing at Day 1 are excluded from the study. An increase by more than 20 ppm of eH2 from baseline within 90 min was considered an abnormal measurement suggesting SIBO. Moreover, an increase by more than 12 ppm of eH2 from baseline within the first 30 minutes followed by a second rise within the next 15 minutes (double peak) was also considered an abnormal measurement suggesting SIBO. The primary objective of this study is assessment of the prevalence of SIBO on critically ill mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Secondary outcomes include investigation of the effects of SIBO on ventilator associated pneumonia, as well as ICU length of stay and all-cause in-hospital mortality rate in critically ill patients.\nOfficial Title: \nThe Effects of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome in ICU Patients.

We will also evaluate the dose and time frame of the intervention.\n\nA randomized, comparative trial will be utilized, with the participant group/arm and intervention/treatment being as follows:\n\n1.) Participants in the active intervention group will receive 20cc of subpectoral bupivacaine injected into the fascia following the removal of breast tissue.\n\n2.) Participants in the placebo comparator group will receive 20cc of subpectoral saline injected into the fascia following the removal of breast tissue.\n\nThe primary endpoint for our study is immediate post-operative pain score on a scale of 1-10. This will be recorded by the PACU nurse upon arrival into the PACU and upon discharge from the PACU. Patients in both groups will be prescribed the same narcotic (Tylenol #3) and will fill out a daily pain log. Additionally, we will utilize chart review to record PACU pain scores from the immediate post-operative time period.\n\nThe use of bupivacaine in post-operative pain management in adult procedures has been shown to be effective and our study can help provide insights for pediatric patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty. By examining and comparing the outcomes of the two arms, we can determine if the use of subpectoral bupivacaine can further improve outcomes related to pain management in this population, ultimately addressing the opioid epidemic faced by all patients undergoing surgery.",

        "summary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of combination therapy with liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib in treating patients with sarcoma that has spread from where it first started, to other places in the body (metastatic), or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and for which no known cure is available (advanced). Doxorubicin is in a class of medications called anthracyclines. Doxorubicin damages the cell's DNA and may kill cancer cells. It also blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair. Liposomal doxorubicin is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained inside very tiny, fat-like particles. Liposomal doxorubicin may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of the drug. Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also enhance the activity of chemo- and radiotherapy. There is some pre-clinical evidence in animal models that combining peposertib with liposomal doxorubicin can shrink or stabilize certain types of cancer for longer than either drug alone, but it is not known if this will happen in people. Combination therapy with liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib may be effective in patients with advanced sarcoma.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Ribonucleotide reactivation protein A (RPA) is the most abundantly expressed protein in eukaryotic cells. Among the proteins that bind RPA directly, DNA-PK is unique in that it is regulated on both the DNA and protein replication pathways in response to DNA damage. RPA interacts with a specific domain of DNA-PK called DNA-PKcs and is the cellular protein substrate on which DNA-PKcs is activated. DNA-PK activation is a highly conserved mechanism for controlling DNA damage in response to agents that cause DNA strand breaks including most topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) inhibitors, mitomycin C (MMC), platinum agents, mitotic spindle poison drugs or antimetabolite (chemotherapy) drugs. Recent data suggest that DNA-PKcs is a major target for cancer therapy due to increased activity in many tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) compared to normal tissues. LMS is a distinct histological subtype of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) that is almost exclusively associated with long segment mutations in the high mobility group box-containing gene (HMGB1) which encodes an architectural/structural chromatin-associated protein. Preclinical genetic and pharmacologic studies with DNA-PK inhibitors show that in HMGB1-mutant LMS and GBMs, inhibition of DNA-PK with NU7026, a potent and selective inhibitor of DNA-PKcs, induced DNA damage, apoptosis and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Patients with unselected STS (N=36) treated with the DNA-PKcs inhibitor M3814 (peposertib), an investigational drug that is different than NU7026, showed some signs of anti-tumor activity with less observed adverse events than NU7026 in other tumor types, suggesting the potential benefit/risk profile of this new class of inhibitors that can be further evaluated in specific subsets of STS. Objectives: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the combination of low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (DL) with peposertib (M3814) in patients with STS. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of peposertib when combined with low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The study will include two sequential cohorts: Cohort I = 2 to 6 patients with LMS or selected STS treated with peposertib (M3814) and low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Treatment will start with a single dose of peposertib (M3814) on Day 1. A standard 3 + 3 accrual method and an MTD determination method with dose de-escalation will be used to determine the MTD of this combination, which will be the recommended phase II dose that will be used in a larger cohort of patients with LMS or selected STS in cohort II. Cohort II = 20 patients with LMS or selected STS treated with peposertib (M3814) and low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at the MTD from cohort I. In each patient, if appropriate, the biopsy will be performed before treatment is started and periodically at 1 month interval during study treatment. Optional biopsies can be obtained at 1 month interval during study treatment. At study entry, each patient will undergo a comprehensive assessment through medical history, physical exam, laboratory values, chest X-ray and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Additional imaging studies may be performed depending on patients' symptoms and any abnormal results found during this initial assessment. Patients will be followed until progressive disease is seen or there is an unacceptable level of toxicity. Patients will be also asked to sign a voluntary specimen bank form to allow their stored specimens to be used for future research studies. The overall design of this study enables patients with different subtypes of STS to be treated with a combination of low dose pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib (M3814). Patients in cohort I will be enrolled as the first group of patients who may or may not benefit from this combination therapy",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIntroduction:\nBack pain affects 55 to 60 million Americans every year. Approximately 50% of Americans will experience low back pain in their lives. One study in New York state showed that people with low back pain report about 25% less physical activity on average. A sedentary lifestyle is strongly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Physical activity is safe and can be considered a 'drug' with few side effects. The American College of Physicians guidelines recommend non-pharmacological treatments for treating chronic low back pain. Exercise has been shown to be one of the best strategies for reducing back pain. T'ai chi is one of the simplest and most gentle of all exercise activities and has been shown to be effective in improving low back pain symptoms. It is also effective in reducing symptoms of insomnia. Aims of the study: The aim of this pilot project is to examine the impact (if any) of a 12-week t'ai chi and qigong online exercise program on chronic low back pain and co-morbidities including sleep disturbances and quality of life. Our study offers a free online class taught by a master t'ai chi practitioner. The PI, who is an interventional research fellow at NYMC, has experience using the MindBody Online Program (MBO). The MBO platform allows for classes to be accessed remotely by individuals anywhere in the NYMC service area. Methodology: This study will be conducted in the community to allow easy and convenient access to participants. Participants will be recruited online using NYMC social media platforms and flyers. Interested subjects will complete an initial Survey, then be randomly assigned to either the free t'ai chi and qigong online exercise class held twice weekly or a waitlisted control. Participants who were waitlisted (and who were not injured and could no longer complete the course) received the classes in January 2023 to allow for a cross-over. The study will be a prospective, single-centered, single-blind, parallel design, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Consent for participation in the t'ai chi and qigong exercise (treatment) group and completion of Surveys will be included in the Survey. Participants who were waitlisted received the classes offered on a rolling basis throughout the study. The study will use a pre-post design to track changes within the groups (e.g., Treatment vs. control groups). The PI and the study assistants will remain blinded to the subject assignment, which will be contained on a database protected by a password. The data will be stored on an encrypted, password-protected laptop in a secure space.

Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing quick access to transactions, providing ease of use and sometimes as a status indicator, can pose a risk of addiction when used uncontrolled. Since young people are more intertwined with technology and use smartphones more, they are at greater risk of addiction and the problems that addiction can cause. Poor sleep quality is an important problem that can occur with smartphone addiction and negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Smartphone addiction and the problems it causes are an important public health problem that threatens the whole society, especially young people. In solving this problem, it is among the duties of nurses to teach individuals healthy lifestyle behaviors instead of problematic behaviors. A road map is needed to facilitate the behavior change process. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is widely used today to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which targets interventions appropriate to the individual's stage of change, is used as a guide that facilitates behavioral change. TTM is a model that contributes to change, accelerates it, and supports individuals considering change. In addition to TTM, another method that is more frequently used and contributes to change, especially in addicted individuals, is the motivational interviewing method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and aims to reveal the individual's internal motivation. It is thought that the university years, which are an important period in terms of developing and maintaining health-protective and preventive behaviors, will both increase students' health responsibility and protect them from health-threatening behaviors with the healthy lifestyle behaviors acquired during this period.

The most common cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is respiratory failure due to chronic lung infection and inflammation. CF affects all age groups and is seen from birth to adulthood. 2017/18 saw the emergence of an infectious disease, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by a novel RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2. Early in 2019, COVID-19 spread from the Wuhan region of China to other parts of the world, but from the spring of 2020 in the United Kingdom, the NHS was overwhelmed by COVID-19 resulting in a number of social and economic challenges. COVID-19 disproportionately impacts pwCF. In Italy, there was an estimated 15-20% mortality rate among hospitalised pwCF with COVID-19 with severe respiratory failure. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus which relies on the host's immune system to replicate. Serum antibodies (natural or induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination) against SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to have a correlation with severity of COVID-19 disease and with response to vaccination. The development of antibodies in pwCF is particularly important because the lungs are a target for CF complications, including bacterial infection. There is speculation amongst pwCF and healthcare providers that pwCF have lower levels of antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection and might respond less well to vaccination due to this underlying condition. However, no studies have directly compared natural infection-induced immune response to vaccination-induced immune response in pwCF. These studies will be critical to informing pwCF and their healthcare providers about the level of protection each method provides and to inform the design of CF-specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. To date, there are no studies in the UK that have looked at the antibody responses between natural infection and vaccination, and how this varies over time in pwCF. It is possible that antibody levels from infection and from vaccination will differ between pwCF and the wider population. Understanding the antibody responses will allow healthcare providers to counsel pwCF regarding the level of protection against COVID-19 that they may expect from natural infection and vaccination. This will help to inform vaccination strategies tailored to the needs of pwCF, in particular younger pwCF or those with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for infection and severe disease. The results of this study will help to define the immune response of pwCF to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, and inform future care. Moreover, our study data will help identify important markers of immune dysregulation that can have important clinical implications for pwCF in the future.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is the compression of the left common iliac vein (CIV) at the vena cava confluence, which may result from a narrow right common iliac artery (CIA) in the pelvis. The syndrome can cause symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg. There is no widely accepted guideline for MTS treatment. Diagnosing MTS can be challenging but is necessary to consider endovascular management. Duplex ultrasound is the primary modality used to non-invasively evaluate venous compression and diameter of the left CIV when assessing for MTS. The operator of ultrasound scans and the sonographer acquiring the image are not always the same. The effect of inter- and intra-operator variation of the diameter measurement is unknown. Materials and Methods: All the patients who are referred to Hull Royal Infirmary vascular ultrasound service will be invited to a vascular ultrasound examination. In total, two scans of the left CIV (diameter measurement) will be done. The operator of ultrasound scan will scan one (only operator) and a second sonographer will scan the other (operator with sonographer). The operators will perform the scans separately in real-time. The diameter measurement of the left CIV will be made by both operators at each ultrasound scan. Data Collection: The first operator will complete a case report form (CRF). This includes patient demographics, clinical presentations, the results of diagnostic investigations and the results of ultrasound. The second operator will complete the same CRF after scanning. Data Analysis: All the collected CRFs will be entered into the study's electronic database, and the diameter measurement of the left CIV (mm) will be recorded. The inter- and intra-operator variation of the diameter measurements will be examined by a correlation coefficient (Pearson correlation). Data and Results: The diameter measurement of the left CIV (in mm) of all the patients will be collected and entered into the study database. The correlation coefficients between diameter measurements of the first operator and second operator ultrasound scans for the left CIV will be determined. Statistical Analysis: The data will be entered into a database, checked and validated. The data will be entered into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA; http://www.IBM.com/software/analytics/spss/) for data analysis. The inter- or intra-operator variation between diameter measurements of the left CIV will be assessed using a correlation coefficient (Pearson correlation). The level of significance (P) will be set as <0.05. The analysis of the correlation coefficient will be done by the second operator, who will be blinded to all patient characteristics.",

        "summary": "Neuromuscular electrical Stimulation (NMES) can minimize muscle atrophy and complications related to muscle disuse and help improve neuromuscular performance. Medium and low-frequency currents have been assessed regarding the generation of evoked torque, sensory discomfort, muscle fatigue, and peripheral oxygen extraction. In addition, metabolic stress is also linked to muscle strength gain, an important aspect to be evaluated in addition to NMES physical parameters. Thus, the aim of this study is to compare the effects of different NMES protocols applied to the triceps surae muscle for evoked torque, muscle fatigue, sensory discomfort, and peripheral oxygen extraction in healthy individuals. This is a crossover, experimental, randomized, double-blind trial composed of apparently healthy participants. All NMES protocols will be tested on the same individual with randomization of the sequence of intervention protocols. There will be a total of 5 encounters with seven days between them. Session 1 will evaluate the anthropometric measures, the maximum intensity for each intervention protocol, and the sequence of intervention protocols for each individual will be randomized. Sessions 2, 3, 4, and 5 will be composed equally with the assessment of the maximum voluntary and evoked joint torque of the triceps surae muscle through the isokinetic dynamometer, evaluation of muscle fatigue through the H-reflex, M-wave, fatigue index, time-torque-integral, and recruitment curve, evaluation of peripheral oxygen extraction through NIRS (Near Infrared Spectroscopy), electromyographic signals to assessed the RMS (root mean square) and the median frequency, evaluation of the level of sensory discomfort through the Visual Analog Pain Scale and finally by the NMES protocol.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Currently, the most recommended NMES protocol for evoking torque is the Russian Current with 10% duty cycle. Studies suggest that the Russian Current may be more effective in this context because it produces greater motor recruitment due to a higher affinity between high-frequency stimulation and the properties of motor units. Objectives: The effectiveness of this protocol should be compared to other high frequency and low frequency currents, as well as to the effects of fatigue induced by high frequency stimulation on neuromuscular behavior. Based on the above, the hypothesis is that the Russian Current (10% duty cycle) would present more effectiveness compared to the Aussie Current (10% duty cycle) and pulsed currents (500\u00b5s and 200\u00b5s phase), as well as produce a lower fatigue level. A better neuromuscular activation for a longer time of stimulation, generating higher torque evoked and a higher intracellular muscle perfusion. Methods: This is a crossover, experimental, randomized, double-blind trial composed of apparently healthy participants.

Some patients may harbor multiple EGFR mutations, including those that confer resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Resistance to EGFR-TKIs may be due to alterations in other genes, such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which is encoded by the ERBB2 gene.

The aim of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of videos with different expectations regarding SMT, as delivered through positive, neutral, or negative expectation speech content, on pain intensity, perceived disability, expectations related to spinal manipulative therapy (SMT), and perceived qualities of the therapeutic encounter in CLBP patients.

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide and second leading cause of cancer death. Most CRCs arise from a polyp, developing through two major precursor lesion pathways: the traditional adenoma-carcinoma pathway, and the serrated neoplasia pathway. This provides opportunities to prevent cancer by removing its precursor lesions. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of precancerous polyps with colonoscopy and detection of early-stage CRC, which has been demonstrated to reduce CRC incidence and mortality effectively, making CRC one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer.\nCurrent guidelines in China recommend starting CRC screening uniformly at age 50 in average-risk individuals. However, a one-fits-all approach to determining CRC screening starting age may be not conducive to personalized screening, especially in the developing countries with scarce health resources. The incidence of early-onset CRC (CRC diagnosed before the age of 50) has shown a continuous increasing trend worldwide, spurring the US Preventive Services Task Force to recommend initiating average-risk CRC screening at age 45 instead of 50. Furthermore, different populations may benefit from even earlier screening, and CRC incidence may differ on the basis of population characteristics and CRC risk factors. For individuals younger than 50 years old, earlier screening based on risk factors may address this concern.\nPrevious studies have recommended earlier starting age of CRC screening combined with risk factors such as but not limited to sex, age, family history, lifestyle and comorbidity. Some upper gastrointestinal diseases have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasms, which may be related to the destruction of gastric acid barrier function and long-term use of pump proton inhibitors. Compared with colonoscopy examination, individuals were more willing to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination for gastric cancer screening, especially among the younger, potentially utilizing the EGD to guide earlier colonoscopies for patients at increased risk. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the association between esophagogastric histopathology and colorectal neoplasms in patients under the age of 50 and whether these risks factor could be combined with to guide earlier CRC screening.",

The risk of CRC increases exponentially after 50 years of age. Therefore, CRC screening is suggested to individuals older than 50 years old. However, more and more CRC cases occur in people younger than 50 years old, so it is possible that some individuals younger than 50 years old may have missed opportunities for cancer prevention. Since gastrointestinal diseases such as Helicobacter pylori, atrophic gastritis/intestinal metaplasia, reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and peptic ulcer have been proven to be risk factors for colorectal cancer, colonoscopy can detect colorectal adenomatous polyps, and gastroscopy is valuable for screening for upper gastrointestinal disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of upper gastrointestinal diseases in individuals younger than 50 years old by gastroscopy, to test the hypothesis that these upper gastrointestinal diseases may contribute to the missed opportunities of CRC screening in individuals younger than 50 years old, and to provide guidance for CRC screening in individuals younger than 50 years old.\nInclusion criteria: Patients younger than 50 years old who underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy simultaneously, including patients with normal colonoscopy examination and patients with colorectal polyps diagnosed by colonoscopy (both serrated and non-serrated polyps were analyzed separately).\nExclusion criteria: Patients without a satisfactory bowel preparation (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, BBPS score \u2265 6); incomplete gastroscopy or colonoscopy examinations; partial or total gastrointestinal resection; patients who have been diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer before endoscopy; patients with hereditary polyposis, including Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and patients with familial adenomatous polyposis; a history of inflammatory bowel diseases.\nA total of 1114 gastroscopy-colonoscopy cases (1178 patients) were reviewed.

        "summary": "Under normal conditions, pain arises as a consequence of the activation of nociceptive afferents (small fibers) by an external stimulus with sufficient intensity to potentially cause tissue damage. This peripheral activation is processed as perception of pain by the central nervous system. In order to reliably evaluate the state of the nociceptive system in both clinical and experimental settings, standardized tests are essential. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a set of tests used to measure the intensity of a stimulus that produces a specific sensory perception in a subject. For example, if we gradually apply pressure, the point where the sensation changes from pressure to pain is called the pressure pain threshold. This type of test can be performed with different types of stimuli, including hot and cold stimuli or mechanical stimuli. Although these tests have been shown as reliable in healthy volunteers and pain patients, they are subjective in their nature, since they are based on a conscious evaluation of tested subjects. Likewise, these measures show substantial variability due to differences in the application of the tests by individual examinators. In short, even though the method is quantitative, its methodological characteristics make it subjective and dependent on both the operator and the subject under study. Moreover, contrasting results have been recently found regarding the measurement variability when repeating the QST at intervals of days. Thus, it is essential to investigate and develop new QST alternatives to obtain objective markers that may potentially contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind chronic pain conditions.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe latency of evoked potentials (EPs) is an objective index of the processing of sensory information in the central nervous system. EPs are measurable electrical potentials in the EEG that are generated by afferent excitation of the central nervous system. In particular, the brain has a marked excitatory response to the activation of a subset of fibers that reach the central nervous system (nociceptors), which evokes EPs that are easily recorded through EEG. While nociceptive EPs have been extensively investigated, no systematic study on mechanical stimuli, such as stimulation with pinprick needles, or of high-frequency stimulation, such as radiofrequency (RF) stimulation, has been described. Thus, the purpose of this project is to carry out a systematic study of the effects of intense acute and prolonged mechanical stimuli and RF stimulation on evoked potentials in the brain. This study will allow to identify, based on different neurophysiological indexes, the differences and similarities between the electrical activation of different stimulus modalities, as well as their reproducibility in different individuals. Thus, the proposed protocol involves the evaluation of brain response to the following stimuli under controlled conditions: RF stimuli that are generated from the electrical stimulation of the dorsum of a foot (radiofrequency electrical stimulation, RFES); and pinprick stimuli, that are produced by an automated device consisting of two needles that penetrate the skin. The RFES consists of stimulation of large nerves (sensory nerves of the foot, median and ulnar nerves of the hand, or cervical nerves) with an electric current in a bipolar configuration that heats the surface of the skin. RF stimulation, like contact heat, evokes a clear and reproducible evoked potential in the brain. RF stimulation has the advantage that the stimulus intensity can be controlled through the power supply of the stimulator, thus allowing the investigation and evaluation of different thresholds of the stimulus. Pinprick stimuli consist of brief mechanical stimuli of the forearm and hand that cause a sensation of sharp pain in the subject. The intensity of this stimulus is also varied by adjusting the force and speed of the needle penetration. Unlike heat stimuli, mechanical stimuli are not painful at high intensity, since these stimuli do not evoke an irritant response in the central nervous system. The evaluation of the brain response to pinprick stimuli and the relationship of the parameters of the response to heat perception and sensation pain thresholds will allow to delimit the mechanisms by which the central nervous system generates the sensory experience of pain and touch.\n\nThese measurements will be carried out in healthy subjects and will be carried out in an experimental setting in the Laboratory of Biomedical Signal Processing-Laboratory of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Engineering, National University of Entre R\u00edos. It should be noted that the tests will not cause pain to the subject. Based on these tests, the response latency will be measured. For this purpose, a series of 10 stimuli will be applied at pain threshold intensity, with a single measurement per subject.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nStudy Objectives: We have previously identified a subgroup of trauma victims with mild TBI (MTBI) who have a characteristic finding of enhancement within the outermost layer of the brain's dural covering called the dura mater (meninges) on delayed post gadolinium enhanced MRI (TME). These individuals have been shown to have more complex clinical histories than age- and sex-matched trauma referents without MRI abnormality. MTE affects approximately 15% of MBI patients, and the clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain. The pathogenesis of TME is unknown, and a recent case-control study suggests that TME patients may have an increased risk of subsequent post-concussive problems. It is possible that biomechanical forces experienced by the brain as a result of its natural motion during walking or more common activities of daily living may be a precipitating factor for TME or subsequent post-concussive problems. This project will characterize the local differences in the brain's interaction with its surrounding skull in MTBI patients with and without MTE in order to understand if these biomechanical forces may be a contributing factor to MTE, or its clinical sequelae. We plan to use a technique called magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to non-invasively quantify the relative rigidity and motion characteristics of the brain and skull in MTBI patients.\nHypotheses: The following hypotheses will be tested: In a subgroup of MTBI patients who have MTE, there is increased local mechanical coupling of motion between brain and skull, as quantified using MRE. This may help explain increased risks of developing persistent brain symptoms in TME patients. Increased mechanical coupling of motion between brain and skull is associated with increased symptoms and impaired function at six month follow-up, as measured using standardized neurobehavioral tests. These findings will be compared to patients with MTBI but no TME.\nStudy Population: Sixty (60) adults will be recruited for this study, including 25 subjects with a history of mild TBI but no history of TMI, 25 subjects with a history of mild TBI and TMI (TME-positive), and 35 healthy controls.\nStudy Procedures: Subjects will complete standardized questionnaires regarding demographics, medical history, and prior head trauma injuries. If clinically indicated, they will also undergo a structured neurological exam to determine their medical suitability for MRI. All subjects will then complete standardized neurobehavioral tests to assess their current level of brain function, performed by blinded researchers on a separate day of MRI scanning.\nDuring the MRE portion of the MRI visit, an external device called an MRE driver plate will be placed firmly against the front of the head. The driver plate is attached to the MRI table, which is then vibrated at a precisely controlled frequency. The MRE system uses the MRI scanner to measure the relative motion of brain and skull induced by the vibrations. These measurements can reveal how much the brain and skull move in relation to each other, as well as the timing of that motion in relation to the vibration frequency. In MTBI patients with MTE or controls, the MRE measurements will be used to quantify the local differences in the biomechanical coupling between brain and skull. In MTBI patients with MTE, these measurements will be correlated with clinical history and neurobehavioral test results to determine if differences in biomechanical coupling are associated with the risk for persistent symptoms after TBI.\nOfficial Title: Imaging Characterization of the Biomechanical Coupling of Brain and Skull: An Observational Study\n\nConditions: Traumatic Meningeal Injury (TME), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n\nParticipation Criteria: A person who has been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury following injury with symptoms such as headache, dizziness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.

The pharmacist will follow up with the patient every 4 weeks to review their readings and at 24-weeks the patient will come into the pharmacy for a final follow-up and BP readings. The pharmacist will fax BP readings and suggestions for therapy modification to the patient's prescribing clinician. After 24-weeks patient care is returned to the prescribing clinician with no further pharmacist interventions except for a final post-trial follow-up at week-52 to review ongoing home BP monitor use and BP management by the prescribing clinician.\nControl: Patients will have BP assessed at baseline, 12-, and 24-weeks in the pharmacy by the pharmacist. Patients will not receive a home blood pressure monitor. Pharmacist will provide usual care, education and counselling on BP management. Pharmacists will fax BP readings to the patient's prescribing clinician but will not provide any suggestions for therapy modification. After 24-weeks patients will be offered a home blood pressure monitor with education on its use. They will then be offered to crossover to the intervention group for the next 24-weeks or have their care returned to their prescribing clinician with no pharmacist specific interventions except for a final post-trial follow-up at week-52 to review ongoing home BP monitor use and BP management by the prescribing clinician.\nSample Size: Calculated sample size is 368 participants to achieve 80% power, with 184 patients in the intervention and control groups.\nPrimary Outcome: Difference in change in Systolic Blood Pressure between the home blood pressure monitoring in addition to pharmacist care versus usual care group.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHigh blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major public health issue worldwide. Women are among those who may be at an increased risk of developing hypertension. Hypertension is a common and modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes including stroke, heart attack, kidney disease, heart failure and dementia. Despite evidence that optimal blood pressure (BP) control decreases the risk of these outcomes, many people with hypertension are not reaching their BP target levels. One approach that has shown promise in improving BP control is through the use and integration of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM). Patients who have hypertension can use a home blood pressure monitoring device to measure and record their blood pressure at home on a frequent basis and then input their measurements into an electronic database that is accessible to their community pharmacist. The patient's pharmacist can then review the readings and provide their own suggestions for therapy modification to the patient's prescribing clinician. In the absence of HBPM the patient may only have BP readings taken once every few weeks or only when they come into the pharmacy or doctor's office. This can result in suboptimal management and less therapeutic intervention. This pilot project aims to demonstrate the efficacy of combining HBPM and integrated pharmacist care. In addition, the study will explore barriers and facilitators for women using HBPM.\nPilot project hypothesis: Women patients utilizing HBPM and providing blood pressure readings to their community pharmacists who then provides tailored education to the patient and therapy recommendations to the patient's prescribing clinician will result in greater improvements in blood pressure control. In comparison to usual care.\nTo meet its aim the investigators anticipate recruiting 368 women from Ontario, Canada. In Ontario there are approximately 18 million people and 5000 community pharmacies with approximately 10,000 pharmacists. The investigators plan to implement this pilot project in 50 community pharmacies, aiming to recruit 7-10 women per pharmacy. The sample size of 368 participants will allow for 90% power and allow for a 10% drop-out in participants, thus providing a 23% margin of error.",
        "eval": "Goal Alignment: 1\nThe generated summary correctly identifies the primary goal of evaluating the impact of home blood pressure monitoring in addition to pharmacist care, compared to usual care, in women with elevated blood pressure.
