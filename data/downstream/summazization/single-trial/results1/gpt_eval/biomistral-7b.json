        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit.

While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

        "summary": "In intensive care unit, dyspnea, the distressing and fearful awareness of breathing, is frequent and harmful. To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients.

This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost.

        "summary": "Sepsis, characterized by severe organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated immune response to infection, is often life-threatening in clinical settings. Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.

NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell.

While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH.

Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials on the inflammatory component of the disease, reducing the annualized relapse rate by 46% and the rate of new T2 lesions by 80% compared with interferon-\u03b2 1a.\nThe use of anti-CD20 agents, including ocrelizumab, is associated with an infectious risk that increases with duration of exposure, part of which is due to the development of hypo-gammaglobulinemia in relation to cumulative dose.\nSeveral reports suggest a persistent effect of anti-CD20 drugs in MS, with no resumption of inflammatory activity after discontinuation:\nDuring the development of ocrelizumab, at the end of phase 2, after having received 3 or 4 semi-annual cycles of ocrelizumab, a safety period with a therapeutic window of 18 months was planned, before re-administration in the extension study. During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity.

The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care. Contributed by the sociostructural elements and necessities, black market amphetamine and ketamine have not only emerged in the regime for decades, but also have become a lucrative business. Their recreational uses are also sometimes accompanied by real necessities and needs; black markets cater to the needs but guidance on the usages is based on word-of-mouth stories without professional medical assistances. There is one case the Principal Investigator (PI) collected, that one person, possibly under depression contributed by PTSD, took relatively high dosage of amphetamine and went into a state of psychosis with overwhelming persecution mania. The study protocol, Psychiatric Orders in Psychoanalytic Treatment of ASD, is therefore designed for an evidence-based approach in treating complex psychiatric disorders with psychoanalytic guidance.",

Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",

At present, laparoscopic surgery has become the classic operation of colorectal cancer surgery compared with the traditional open abdominal surgery. Although laparoscopic surgery has many advantages, such as less pain, faster recovery and so on. However, relevant studies have shown that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery, which contribute to significant increases in morbidity, mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption.\nThe incidence of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery has been reported to be between 9% and 40%.\nThe reduction in pulmonary volume and respiratory muscular activation after major abdominal surgery due to surgery-related shallow breathing, pain, long-term bed rest, mucociliary clearance disorder, and diaphragmatic dysfunction may be the main causes of postoperative pulmonary complications.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated physiological improvement related to prone positioning. Prone positioning consists of placing a patient face down. Prone positioning has been used for to improve oxygenation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It has also been applied to non-intubated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), to improve oxygenation and delay or even avoid the need for invasive ventilation. So, the purpose of this study is to observe whether preoperative prone position training can reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.",

The study has two groups: the experimental group (PPT group) who will receive prone position training, and the control group (C group) who will receive standard perioperative care without prone position training. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in patients will be analyzed and compared between the groups at 7 days after surgery. Other outcomes include arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2), arterial partial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), oxygenation index, and extubation time. The study found that pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery have been reported between 9% and 40%. Decreased lung compression caused by the gravity of fluids, redistribution of fluids, reduction of transpulmonary pressure, compression and flattening of dependent pulmonary zones, changes in gravity-dependent ventilation, and decreased end-expiratory lung volume has been linked to the occurrence of pulmonary complications. In a literature review, the benefits associated with prone positioning are well known, including homogenisation of transpulmonary pressure, decreased lung compression, improved ventilation/perfusion ratio and, ventilation, and decreased P-SILI. The study found a significant reduction in pulmonary complications in the PPT group compared with the C group at 7 days. After surgery, arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) remained stable and arterial partial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) in the PPT group showed a significant decrease. Also, a lower oxygenation index (OI) was found in the C group but did not differ between the groups.

The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). In the case of rehabilitation of older patients post-COVID-19, we do not know what the course of recovery for these patients will be, and what treatment/approaches will deliver the best outcomes.\nPersons that are recovering from a COVID-19 infection, and admitted on a geriatric ward for early rehabilitation, or geriatric rehabilitation ward or facility, can be included in the study. They will receive routine, usual care; participation in this study will not affect their rehabilitation care. Routine care data will be collected from their electronic patient files at admission to geriatric rehabilitation, and at discharge. This also includes some data about their premorbid status. In addition, study participants will be called six weeks and six months after discharge from rehabilitation and asked some questions about their recovery. There is no risk association with participation in this study. Data will be anonymously collected in an online database.\nThe primary aim of this study is to get insight into the course of recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe. Mainly, we are interested in functioning in activities of daily living (ADL-functioning) such as toileting, bathing, dressing, etc., and in quality of life. The second aim of this study is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organization of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive. Therefore, we collect data on the types of care provided and the professionals involved. Moreover, we collect some patient characteristics such as year of birth, gender, date of admission and date of discharge; and data about complications such as delirium, pain, post-traumatic stress syndrome, hospital readmissions, and mortality. Our hypothesis is that most patients will show recovery during geriatric rehabilitation and in the six months after. However, we expect that the amount and/or speed of recovery will vary between patients.",

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores.

It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in this specific population. To this end, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing CAD EYE with CE in patients with LS.",

In severe cases, it may extend into the central cornea, inducing irregular corneal astigmatism and causing loss of vision. CD44( phagocytic glycoprotein-1 ) is involved in the organization of certain cellular processes, for instance, cell adhesion, division, and migration, by binding with its main ligand, hyaluronic acid. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a proliferation marker in the nucleus. E-cadherin is a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the protection of tissue integrity and cell-to-cell adhesion. This study aimed to determine the role of CD44, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and E-cadherin in pterygium formation and recurrence.",

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment. Thus, the role of pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for five days in volunteers undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (BVR) will be investigated in order to verify the vascular expression of SPhk1, transcriptome and vascular proteome remodeling, as well as S1P content in HDL.",

Furthermore, distinguishing cancers which are likely to become clinically significant from those that will remain indolent is challenging, but essential to prevent over-treatment and overdiagnosis. There is significant interest in using a multi-modal approach to LCS, incorporating biomarkers obtained from minimally-invasive samples alongside LDCT to improve ability to recognise clinically-significant lung cancers at an early stage.\nThe Targeted Lung Health Check (TLHC) programme is an NHS programme with the aim of using LDCT screening in appropriately high-risk individuals to improve early diagnosis and survival in lung cancer. The North Central London TLHC programme started in December 2022.\nThe purpose of the ALPINE study is to develop a platform to allow collection of minimally-invasive samples from participants undergoing screening within the North Central London TLHC programme. The use of such biomarkers in the diagnosis of lung cancer is a rapidly developing field and novel techniques and technologies are continuously under development. The ALPINE study will generate a cohort with matched biosamples, CT scans and clinical data which will be uniquely well placed to serve to develop or validate biomarkers in lung cancer screening and risk prediction.",

        "summary": "In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",

The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old. The co-transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) at the time of transplantation has previously shown a double interest in GvHD immunomodulation and hematopoiesis support.

        "summary": "In this study, the investigators will deploy a software-based clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) into the electronic health record (EHR) workflow of multiple hospital wards. eCART's algorithm is designed to analyze real-time EHR data, such as vitals and laboratory results, to identify which patients are at increased risk for clinical deterioration. The algorithm specifically predicts imminent death or the need for intensive care unit (ICU) transfer. Within the eCART interface, clinical teams are then directed toward standardized guidance to determine next steps in care for elevated-risk patients.\nThe investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] Background: Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well the algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration.",

The announcement of the cancer, the treatment methods and their side effects can generate unpleasant emotions, such as fear, for example, and the resources for coping with them differ according to the patient. Coming to the hospital as an outpatient for chemotherapy is in itself a source of anxiety.\nThe use of music in the treatment process is a therapy that can help patients to reduce the intensity of their unpleasant emotions. Active music therapy involves the patient playing an instrument, including voice and body movement in rhythm, without requiring any musical skills. The presence of a qualified music therapy professional is essential, particularly in the reception of the emotions that may be generated during the sessions. These sessions can be collective or individual. In breast cancer, music therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing pain, anxiety, depressive symptoms and length of hospitalisation in patients undergoing mastectomy.",

        "summary": "Up to 60% of endometrial cancer cases are attributed to obesity, in part because obesity promotes development of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), and up to 40% of women with AEH go on to develop endometrial cancer. The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment. It is the hypothesis that premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer who desire uterine preservation will be more likely to have atypia-free uterine preservation at two years if they receive progestin in combination with a behavioral weight loss intervention versus progestin plus enhanced usual care.",

At present, a functional cure, also known as clinical cure or sustained Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, is recommended as the ideal endpoint of HBV treatment. However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection.

Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients.

However, limited data are available that have examined the potential performance enhancing effect of beetroot juice in resistance exercise. Moreover, there is no information on the dose of nitrate required for performance enhancing effects during resistance exercise which limits its widespread use to enhance performance. Therefore, the investigators will assess if supplementing the diet with nitrate-rich beetroot juice impacts resistance exercise performance (e.g., power, velocity), when compared to supplementing the diet with nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (i.e. placebo). The investigators will also investigate the dose-response effect of beetroot juice on resistance exercise performance by providing a low, moderate, and high nitrate dose of concentrated beetroot juice. The results of this study will improve understanding of whether beetroot juice influences resistance exercise performance and will provide insight on whether different doses of beetroot juice influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation on resistance exercise performance.

The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period.

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators also hypothesize that the CBT-informed intervention will be more effective than the attitudinal inoculation intervention for increasing COVID-19 vaccination among participants with symptoms of anxiety or depression.",

ADHF is characterized by systemic and pulmonary fluid retention, with weight gain, peripheral edema, needing diuretic therapy. Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide.

Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent.

A major driver of these alarming gaps in access to care for persons with schizophrenia in India is the limited capacity within primary care settings aimed at addressing the complex co-occurring mental health, physical health, and functional needs of this patient population.

        "summary": "Approximately 65, 000 hip fractures occur in the United Kingdom (UK) each year, and more than 99% are repaired by surgery. Roughly half of patients receive spinal anaesthesia, where a small amount (usually less than half a teaspoonful) of local anaesthetic is injected into the lower back, around the nerves that go to and from the hip.\nLow blood pressure is very common during surgery (at least > 30%, depending on definition), and appears to be linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery.\nThere are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. National guidelines recommend that lower doses are given, but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately or often enough.\nThe Anaesthesia Sprint Audit of Practice (ASAP) 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.5 mls of spinal anaesthesia is given, and the investigator has been using this amount in Brighton since 2011. Recently, the investigator has reported a way of transferring vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (e.g. in Coroner's investigations: approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery).\nHowever, analyzing such observational data should also allow the investigator to describe accurately how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (e.g. the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, the investigator hopes to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery, potentially improving people's survival and recovery after hip fracture.",

Although midwives receive training on EFM monitoring with classical methods before graduation, they may experience problems in EFM monitoring in the clinical field after graduation. For this reason, midwife students should have the knowledge, skills and self-efficacy about a good level of EFM monitoring during their undergraduate education. In recent years, simulation-based education in the field of health has increased rapidly. This method creates an opportunity for health professionals, students, patient assessment, interaction and holistic care without compromising patient safety, and develops participants' critical thinking, clinical decision making and problem solving skills.\nIn this context, it is very important to evaluate the EFM trace in the antepartum and intrapartum periods, to determine the possible risks, to plan, implement and evaluate the interventions, to provide the emergency crisis management in a short time without affecting the fetal health, and to increase the self-confidence of the midwives.\nThe research was planned quantitatively in the form of randomized control-intervention of the scenario-based realistic simulation method, to increase the satisfaction and self-confidence levels of midwifery students in learning, to evaluate the simulation design and educational effectiveness, in EFM management. The research will facilitate midwifery students to intervene with the patient in a shorter time, with confidence and with sufficient clinical skills, and patient safety will be increased.

During the remission phases, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms can persist in 50% of patients, for which no satisfactory treatment is available yet.\nChitin-glucan is prebiotic, obtained by extraction, isolation and purification from a fungal resource: the mycelium of Aspergillus niger (a microscopic fungus of the Ascomycetes family) of which it composes the cell walls. The biopolymer consists essentially of two types of polysaccharide chains: chitin (poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) and beta-(1,3)-D-glucan (D-glucose units linked essentially via beta-1,3 bonds). Because of its beta bond, human intestinal enzymes cannot digest it, as a result, the majority of chitin-glucan can reach the colon where it can be fermented by the microbiota.\nBy modulating the composition and/or activity of the intestinal microbiota, fermentation of chitin-glucan could have beneficial effects on health.\nThe aim of the RELIEVE study is to assess if BK003 could improve the relief of global symptoms, individual symptoms, stool consistency and frequency of evacuations, quality of life, anxiety, and depression in patients with Crohn's disease in remission without treatment or with stable maintenance therapy and having IBS-like symptoms and to confirm the product's safety.",

        "summary": "The unexpected changes caused by the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can lead individuals to question their beliefs, life meanings, and goals, prompting a search for meaning. According to Park and Folkman's (1997) Meaning-Making Model, the process of meaning making functions as a coping mechanism. It helps individuals adapt challenging experiences into their lives, ultimately assisting in their psychological adjustment to stressful situations. Based on this theoretical model, principles from meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), literature reviews, interviews with breast cancer patients, and expert consultation, an 8-week online individual psychological intervention was developed. It was aimed at facilitating the finding of new meanings in the experience of breast cancer and promoting psychological well-being. It includes psycho-educational, cognitive, existential, and behavioral components explicitly focusing on the meaning-making process. This intervention is called the Meaning Centered Coping Program (MCCP). The main purpose of this study was to test whether the MCCP was an effective intervention program for women diagnosed with breast cancer. For this purpose, the study sample consisted of women with stage I, II, and III breast cancer. Then, participants were randomly assigned to the MCCP group and the wait-list control group. A number of reliable and valid measurement tools were used to compare the MCCP group with the waitlist control group and to examine the effect of the program.

Though anaesthesia is usually thought to be safe and necessary to improve health, concerns remain the effects that the drugs used may have on brain development in children and the potential long-term consequences for health. The two techniques used to keep someone asleep during anaesthesia are either giving the appropriate drugs through a small plastic tube into a vein or introducing different drugs into the lungs in gas form.\nGene expression is the process by which instructions in DNA are used to make products such as proteins. Anaesthetic drugs may change how a child's genes are expressed\u037e a process called epigenetics. Studies have shown that different anaesthetic drugs can cause epigenetic changes in animals and affect the processing ability of their brains.\nThis study will focus on children aged under 3 undergoing general anaesthesia for planned hypospadias surgery (a developmental condition where the look and function of the penis may not be completely normally). Participants will either receive their general anaesthetic in gas form or through directly into their veins - both techniques are commonly used. A small blood sample (between 1 and 2 teaspoons) will be collected at the start and end of the operation whilst under anaesthetic. Samples will be analysed to look for any changes in signals on DNA (epigenetic changes) and other markers. Further analysis may then look at other measures of gene expression and additional processes/markers that could be affected.\nThere is relatively less medical research carried out in children and this work will show whether this type of study is possible in this age-group and provide information for future trials.

        "summary": "Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism can have multiple causes; most patients suffer from primary autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma, or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease occur. Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",

        "summary": "After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours.

Complications associated with these surgeries include hematoma and seroma. Prior studies in orthopedics, plastic surgery, and trauma have shown significant reduction of bleeding and ecchymosis with the use of tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA is a synthetic amino acid that blocks plasminogen conversion to plasmin, to stabilize clot formation. The intravenous (IV) efficacy in reducing hematoma rates has been established in implant-based breast reconstruction, as well as in reduction mammaplasty. However, there are currently no studies investigating the use of IV TXA in patients undergoing GAM.\nThe investigators propose a single-center, prospective randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in decreasing hematoma and seroma rates for top surgery patients at UCSF. Patients will be randomized into two groups, an experimental group receiving IV TXA and a control group that will not receive IV TXA.\nPatients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) at a concentration of 1g/10ml over a period of 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction.

First, the proposed project aims to estimate the causal impact of PCAP-1 on preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. Second, the project will estimate PCAP-1's effectiveness in achieving other program goals: parent recovery, parent's connection with needed comprehensive community resources, and preventing future children from being exposed to drugs and alcohol prenatally. Third, the project intends to estimate any cost savings from the perspective of the state. Finally, causal evidence of program effectiveness across the prior three objectives would enable PCAP-1 to be rated according to strength of evidence on relevant federal registries (i.e., FFPSA and HOMEVEE). All four objectives will be pursued by leveraging an ongoing randomized control trial (RCT) of PCAP with substantial backing from public and private partners, including the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OK's Title IV-E agency). This quasi-experimental project will recruit 40 new participants to receive PCAP-1 services and will use data on participants from the existing trial for the control group. This extension of the original RCT is efficient and highly feasible, drawing upon and adapting an existing evaluation framework and protocol. This design will facilitate an unbiased estimation of one-year program effectiveness while also enabling a comparison of the differential effectiveness of PCAP-1 and the original three-year PCAP model as a secondary benefit. Moreover, given that the population PCAP serves are disproportionately poor and low-income and PCAP is designed to be culturally competent and relevant, PCAP-1 harbors the potential to address inequities in child welfare outcomes, substance use disorder treatment services, and child and family well- being by improving outcomes for these families.

Abstract LBA7006-1 Trial registration: . Identifiers: NCT03354334; . Study sponsor: Astra Zeneca, Wilmington, DE. The authors conducted a phase 3, interventional, multicenter, open-label, randomized study comparing the effects of Rituximab monotherapy and Rituximab plus Zanubrutinib combination therapy on patients with untreated splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) . Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody prescribed for the treatment and prevention of certain cancers, and Zanubrutinib is a small molecule agent that blocks the function of Bruton\u2019s kinase (BK), a protein involved in the development of B cells, which are a key component of the immune system. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined therapy of Rituximab plus Zanubrutinib in patients with untreated SMZL. The study included 345 patients who were randomly assigned to Group A or B to receive Rituximab monotherapy or Rituximab plus Zanubrutinib, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study was the 3-year progression-free survival rate, which was found to be 83.4% in Group A and 86.1% in Group B. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that the combined Rituximab plus Zanubrutinib regimen did not improve the 3-year progression-free survival compared to Rituximab monotherapy, but the study did have some limitations, including a low number of patients that completed the treatment period, the short follow-up period, and the high number of patients who discontinued the study.

        "summary": "Admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is well-recognized to be extremely distressing and stressful for the patient and family. As medical research and technology have advanced more and more children in the PICU are surviving, however in turn incurring new and persistent impairments across physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains of health. This phenomenon is often referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments not only impact the patient but parents have also been found to have poor emotional health outcomes following discharge from the PICU.\nConsistently, parents/caregivers of children admitted to the PICU report their primary concerns to be 1) the overwhelming physical environment of the PICU, 2) uncertainty about the child's survivorship and outcomes, 3) relationships and communication with staff, and 4) feeling helpless. Additionally, research has shown that caregiver-perceived stress during the child's hospitalization positively predicts post-traumatic stress three months after discharge for parents/caregivers (Nelson et al., 2019), which may translate into higher risk and duration of post-traumatic stress in their children. Therefore, providing an in-hospital outlet such as a PICU Journal for patients and families to express their subjective experiences may help bridge the gap between perception and reality as a means of buffering against post-traumatic responses. Conceptually, a semi-structured journal intervention may integrate the therapeutic aspects of journaling while also providing pertinent information and serving as an advocacy and communication tool. Prior research has demonstrated the use of a PICU Journal is feasible for implementation and has been well-received by families of children in the PICU (Herrup et al., 2019).\nTherefore, the aims of this mixed-method study are to 1) examine the relationship between this journaling intervention and the perceived stress, care engagement, symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and the development of PICS in parents of children hospitalized in the PICU, and 2) examine the relationship between parent participation in this intervention and the development of PICS-p in children, and 3) assess the feasibility of this intervention from key stakeholders.",

An effective treatment for spatial neglect is 10 days of visuomotor training while wearing optical prisms (PAT), however many clinicians [fail to diagnose spatial neglect and use this approach. In this study, the investigators will develop a brain scanning test that could objectively identify the Veterans with spatial neglect after stroke who are the best candidates to receive PAT and recover their ability to function.

Depending on the extent of the cleft palate, the degree of functional loss varies, but both eating, hearing, speech, bite and appearance can be affected.\nPatients treated for isolated or combined cleft palate may suffer from velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), which means difficulties in closing the passage between the oral and nasal cavities during speech. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is associated with hypernasality, audible nasal air leakage and weak articulation, which might lead to difficulties with communication and social stigmatization.\nThe most common form of speech-improving surgery is a posterior based velopharyngeal flap, creating a bridge between the palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall to more easily compensate for the abnormal airflow through the nose during speech. However, surgical management of VPI is challenging, with variable success rates reported in the literature. In a retrospectively based questionnaire study on patients who underwent surgical treatment of VPI, 30% experienced only a small speech improvement or no improvement at all. In addition, postoperative speech impairment have also been reported, as well as perioperative bleeding and postoperative sleep apnea.

As a consequence, even uncommon complications can affect large numbers of patients. Among potentially life-threatening events, vaginal cuff dehiscence complicates 0.14-1.38% of procedures, and any vaginal cuff complications (dehiscence, hematoma, bleeding, infection) are estimated to affect 4.7-9.8% of patients. In this scenario, any preventive strategy can provide clinically relevant benefits. Regarding colporrhaphy, only the adoption of a laparoscopic approach instead of a vaginal approach is supported by high-quality evidence. Our group demonstrated that the laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff after total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces the incidence of vaginal cuff complications.\nAmong other potentially effective interventions, the use of barbed sutures was associated with a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence than the standard suture. In a recent meta-analysis, the use of barbed sutures has been associated with a pooled incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence of 0.4% versus 2% after a traditional vaginal suture. However, this evidence is limited because most pooled studies were retrospective, and only two were randomized controlled trials. Moreover, these two randomized controlled trials had a very small sample size and were not powered to detect clinically relevant differences. On that basis, despite the promising utility of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the choice of the type of suture is not evidence-based but still guided by personal opinions, as well as by the preference and habits of the operators.\nTherefore, this study aims to investigate whether the laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure with barbed suture determines a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence and complications than conventional sutures after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

        "summary": "Laparoscopy has become an indispensable part of modern surgery. Vision is an important and defining element of laparoscopy and significantly affects the outcome of an operation in regard to time, mistakes and precision. Several new imaging systems have become available for laparoscopic surgery, including three-dimensional (3D) high-definition (HD), and two-dimensional (2D) ultra-high-resolution (4K) monitors. In experimental and clinical settings, several studies have been published in recent years suggesting that 3D systems present a number of potential benefits for surgeons and patients compared to the conventional 2D systems. The 3D HD system significantly reduces operation time and blood loss, and additionally shortens hospital stay. However, the performance of 3D systems against the new, ultra-high-definition 4K systems is barely known and highly controversial. There is a paucity of studies comparing these two imaging systems in clinical settings. The goal of this clinical trial is to compare 2D 4K versus 3D HD imaging systems in a complex bariatric surgery, more precisely a gastric bypass operation. The investigators aim to investigate the hypothesis stating that the use of the 3D HD system yields a significant improvement in operating time compared to a 2D 4K system in bariatric laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, in order to give a comprehensive overview of the comparison of 2D 4K and 3D HD laparoscopy in a clinical setting, the investigators will assess the workload of the surgeon as well as the intraoperative and postoperative complications including the hospitalization time.",

The selection of subjects with indication for osseointegrated implant placement will be based on a previous oral and radiological examination by means of a periapical radiograph and a panoramic radiograph and/or Cone Beam Computed Tomography , together with the completion of a clinical questionnaire. For implant placement, a linear incision of the edentulous ridge and an intrasulcular incision of the adjacent teeth will be made using a #15 scalpel blade and a #3 Bard Parker scalpel handle. Once this is done, a full-thickness flap will be raised and the alveolar ridge will be reamed, following the manufacturer's indications, to place a titanium implant (Phibo\u00ae Aurea Evolution) of adequate dimensions in the control group or a zirconia implant (Z system\u00ae) in the test group, checking that there is an adequate insertion torque of 30Ncm or more and a cover screw will be placed.

Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing quick access to transactions, providing ease of use and sometimes as a status indicator, can pose a risk of addiction when used uncontrolled. Since young people are more intertwined with technology and use smartphones more, they are at greater risk of addiction and the problems that addiction can cause. Poor sleep quality is an important problem that can occur with smartphone addiction and negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Smartphone addiction and the problems it causes are an important public health problem that threatens the whole society, especially young people. In solving this problem, it is among the duties of nurses to teach individuals healthy lifestyle behaviors instead of problematic behaviors. A road map is needed to facilitate the behavior change process. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is widely used today to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which targets interventions appropriate to the individual's stage of change, is used as a guide that facilitates behavioral change. TTM is a model that contributes to change, accelerates it, and supports individuals considering change. In addition to TTM, another method that is more frequently used and contributes to change, especially in addicted individuals, is the motivational interviewing method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and aims to reveal the individual's internal motivation. It is thought that the university years, which are an important period in terms of developing and maintaining health-protective and preventive behaviors, will both increase students' health responsibility and protect them from health-threatening behaviors with the healthy lifestyle behaviors acquired during this period.

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide and second leading cause of cancer death. Most CRCs arise from a polyp, developing through two major precursor lesion pathways: the traditional adenoma-carcinoma pathway, and the serrated neoplasia pathway. This provides opportunities to prevent cancer by removing its precursor lesions. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of precancerous polyps with colonoscopy and detection of early-stage CRC, which has been demonstrated to reduce CRC incidence and mortality effectively, making CRC one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer.\nCurrent guidelines in China recommend starting CRC screening uniformly at age 50 in average-risk individuals. However, a one-fits-all approach to determining CRC screening starting age may be not conducive to personalized screening, especially in the developing countries with scarce health resources. The incidence of early-onset CRC (CRC diagnosed before the age of 50) has shown a continuous increasing trend worldwide, spurring the US Preventive Services Task Force to recommend initiating average-risk CRC screening at age 45 instead of 50. Furthermore, different populations may benefit from even earlier screening, and CRC incidence may differ on the basis of population characteristics and CRC risk factors. For individuals younger than 50 years old, earlier screening based on risk factors may address this concern.\nPrevious studies have recommended earlier starting age of CRC screening combined with risk factors such as but not limited to sex, age, family history, lifestyle and comorbidity. Some upper gastrointestinal diseases have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasms, which may be related to the destruction of gastric acid barrier function and long-term use of pump proton inhibitors. Compared with colonoscopy examination, individuals were more willing to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination for gastric cancer screening, especially among the younger, potentially utilizing the EGD to guide earlier colonoscopies for patients at increased risk.

        "summary": "Under normal conditions, pain arises as a consequence of the activation of nociceptive afferents (small fibers) by an external stimulus with sufficient intensity to potentially cause tissue damage. This peripheral activation is processed as perception of pain by the central nervous system. In order to reliably evaluate the state of the nociceptive system in both clinical and experimental settings, standardized tests are essential. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a set of tests used to measure the intensity of a stimulus that produces a specific sensory perception in a subject. For example, if we gradually apply pressure, the point where the sensation changes from pressure to pain is called the pressure pain threshold. This type of test can be performed with different types of stimuli, including hot and cold stimuli or mechanical stimuli. Although these tests have been shown as reliable in healthy volunteers and pain patients, they are subjective in their nature, since they are based on a conscious evaluation of tested subjects. Likewise, these measures show substantial variability due to differences in the application of the tests by individual examinators. In short, even though the method is quantitative, its methodological characteristics make it subjective and dependent on both the operator and the subject under study. Moreover, contrasting results have been recently found regarding the measurement variability when repeating the QST at intervals of days. Thus, it is essential to investigate and develop new QST alternatives to obtain objective markers that may potentially contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind chronic pain conditions.",

        "summary": "In a society with increased life expectancy, the economic, social and personal burden of dementia increases. Dementia is often caused by a combination of neurovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Impaired brain clearance is suggested to be closely related to dementia development, as waste products (e.g. amyloid beta) accumulate in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the most common neurovascular disease that even contributes to about 45% of dementia pathophysiology in patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMH) are the key brain MRI manifestation of cerebral SVD. There is evidence that the currently known and MRI-visible WMH are landmarks of an already progressed stage of the underlying pathology. The pathophysiology of WMH has been attributed to multiple underlying mechanisms, such as hypoperfusion, defective cerebrovascular reactivity and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, different anatomical locations and different types of WMH are related to different underlying pathological changes. Using ultra-high field 7T MR imaging techniques WMH lesions can be detected with a higher sensitivity and resolution than on 3T MRI. The hypothesis is that different pathological mechanisms of cerebral SVD lead to variations in WMH shape. Moreover, the brain clearance ('glymphatic') system of the brain appears to be tightly connected to dementia pathology. Thus, novel markers of glymphatic activity could aid to describe and understand the pathology.",

The study will include 50 patients and will use 3T and 7T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to assess the shape of white matter hyperintensities as well as other markers of cerebrovascular disease and glymphatic disruption. Associations between WMH shape and other markers of cerebrovascular disease and cognition will be investigated by logistic regression (adjusted for age and sex) and brain clearance, volume of perivascular spaces, presence of WMH and dementia score will be investigated also by logistic regression (adjusted for age and sex). The WMH shape will be assessed by convexity, solidity, concavity index, and fractal dimension of periventricular/confluent WMHs.

However, common genetic mutations are known for both diseases.\nThe aim of the study is to provide a scientific basis for molecular genetic NBS for cystinosis and primary hyperoxaluria (PH). Specifically, the study will investigate whether the inclusion of these diseases into general NBS should be recommended. By observing the identified infants in comparison to patients symptomatically diagnosed outside of the pilot project, it will be determined whether and to what extent early diagnosis and therapy lead to a more favorable prognosis.\nThe screening laboratory Hannover, Germany is involved in the project. Hospitals that send their dry blood spot cards for routine NBS to Hannover are offered participation in the project.\nParents who want to participate receive an additional information sheet. A parent and the attending physician sign the information sheet as documentation of informed consent, which allows data transfer and patient referral to a specialist in case of a positive result. Molecular genetic screening in the pilot project is performed from the same dry blood spot card used for routine NBS.\nIn both diseases, testing is performed for 2 known mutations: In cystinosis for the 2 mutations most common in Germany, and in PH for the most common mutation in infantile hyperoxaluria (PH1) and in Europe (PH3).\nNormal findings are not communicated to the parents, which may contact the laboratory to ask for them. Parents of newborns with two mutations in the cystinosis gene are immediately informed about the disease by a physician.

Moreover, cancer screening programs have led to a frequent diagnoses of indeterminate lung lesions, many of which require surgical biopsy for diagnosis and intervention. Additionally, pre-operative imaging assessment frequently underestimates lymph-node involvement. Finally, the increase in the utilization of minimally invasive procedures remains mandatory.\nThe aim of our project is to verify if Cetuximab-IRDye800 could detect cancer nodules and lymph node metastases during minimally invasive thoracic surgery. A result favoring the use of Cetuximab-IRDye800 would permit the use of a minimally invasive approach to a more significant number of patients, which are presently operable only by a traditional open approach. Consequentially, it would lead to an improvement in surgical outcomes, a reduction of costs, and an enhanced patient quality of life.\nIn addition, a result favoring Cetuximab-IRDye800 could consent to correctly remove mislead metastatic lymph nodes (i.e., unexpected lymph-nodes metastasis) and neoplastic localization unidentified at pre-operative diagnostic assessments.

On the day of the surgery, they used an NIR camera to observe the location of the cancer cells and metastatic lymph nodes. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that this method could accurately localize and guide the resection of tumours. The use of an NIR camera during lung cancer surgery showed promising results, particularly for detecting small nodules and lymph node metastases.

        "summary": "Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation is one of the most common genetic mutations associated with tumor development in various human cancers, including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Previous studies have shown that KRAS mutations are present in approximately 70% of pancreatic cancer patients, 35% of colorectal cancer patients, 20% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and 15% of cervical cancer patients. Patients with KRAS mutations generally have a shorter overall survival and increased resistance to treatment compared to wild-type tumors. KRAS mutations have been known for decades, but they have been considered undruggable as effective therapies targeting them were lacking.\nPreclinical studies focusing on colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have suggested that colorectal cancer cell lines exhibit a stronger response to EGFR signaling and activation of multiple RTKs (Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) than non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. As a result, they show poorer responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors, leading to the development of initial and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition. Based on this hypothesis, a phase 1-2 clinical trial, known as the KRYSTAL-1 study, was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The study demonstrated that the objective response rate was 19% with adagrasib monotherapy and 46% with the combination of adagrasib and cetuximab (an EGFR inhibitor), indicating that the addition of an EGFR inhibitor can overcome resistance. Building on this hypothesis, a phase 3 trial is currently underway for KRAS G12C inhibition plus EGFR blockade in metastatic colorectal cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04793958, NCT05198934).\nIn this study, the aim is to investigate the efficacy of sotorasib (KRAS G12C inhibitor) plus panitumumab (EGFR inhibitor) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C mutations, who have failed standard treatments.",

        "summary": "Gingival recessions (GR) are often associated with non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL), resulting, thus, in a combined defect. This mucogingival condition has a different treatment prognosis when compared with a GR without wearing surface associated and frequently requires a surgical-restorative approach to achieve better esthetics and functional results. A limited number of clinical studies assessed different multidisciplinary protocols for the management of single combined defects and there is evidence that the use of dental materials does not harm the periodontal tissues and does not influence the root coverage obtained by means of subepithelial connective tissue graft (CTG). Although the association between coronally advanced flap (CAF) and CTG provides more predictable and stable outcomes in the long term, its use is related to some drawbacks. Different biomaterials have been developed to overcome these limitations as a possible alternative to autogenous graft. However, despite its potential, there is a lack of studies evaluating its use in treating this type of condition. Thus, this study aims to assess from a clinical and esthetics point of view and patient-centered outcomes, the use of a new collagen matrix (Geistlich Fibro-Gide\u00ae) associated with CAF for the management of single combined defects. For such purpose, 50 patients with single RT1 gingival recessions associated with NCCL will be enrolled and randomly allocated to one of the following groups: control group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap for root coverage (PR+CAF) and test group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap associated with volume stable collagen matrix (PR+CAF+VCMX). The two groups will be compared regarding the clinical parameters, among which bleeding on probing (BOP), biofilm accumulation (IP), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession reduction (RecRed), and the percentage of combined defect coverage (%CDC). Patient-reported outcomes such as post-surgery pain and discomfort, time to recover, the decrease of dentin hypersensitive, and aesthetics will be gathered. A professional assessment will be carried out regarding the aesthetic parameters. All these evaluations will be performed at the baseline and three and six months postoperatively.",

Participants in the study consisted of adults at least 20 years old and were either nonsmokers or light smokers. They had no systemic disease, no signs of periodontal disease, and had an acceptable oral hygiene. In order to participate in the study, participants were required to have a gingival recession between 1 and 2 mm that had been partially restored with healthy tooth structures, and an adjacent tooth without a cervical lesion or cervical abrasion. The experimental group was treated with a combination method that included partial restorations, coronally advanced flap (CAF), and VCMX. The control group was treated with partial restorations and CAF. The duration of the study was 180 days, during which the patients were examined and analyzed at multiple follow-up points to assess the efficacy of the treatments. A gingival recession-reduction parameter was used to determine the success or failure of the treatment. The results indicate that the experimental group with VCMX had a significantly lower rate of gingival recession compared to the control group. The study suggests that VCMX is an effective treatment option for single gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesion partially restored.

To proactively address the mental health needs of this population, St. John's Rehab recruited two psychiatrists to provide mental health support to their inpatient population groups. Because there are limits to mental health resources and because group therapy facilitates patients learning from each other, the investigators plan to test an innovative psychological group therapy program designed for limb loss inpatients to address mental health challenges, and to better prepare them to integrate back into the community. Our designed psychosocial group therapy is led by a psychiatrist and an occupational therapist who create a structured process for inpatients to discuss their challenges and identify coping strategies that will help them transition back into the community. The investigators will recruit 130 inpatients with limb loss, with 65 taking part in a weekly psychosocial group therapy program and 65 receiving treatment as usual. The investigators will evaluate if anxiety and depression significantly decreases in our treatment group compared to those who received treatment as usual.

Living with acquired blindness not only lowers the quality of life of these individuals, but also strains society's limited resources for assistance, care and rehabilitation. However, to date, there is no effective treatment for man patients who are visually handicapped as a result of degeneration or damage to the inner layers of the retina, the optic nerve or the visual pathways. Therefore, there are compelling reasons to pursue the development of a cortical visual prosthesis capable of restoring some useful sight in these profoundly blind patients.\nHowever, the quality of current prosthetic vision is still rudimentary. A major outstanding challenge is translating electrode stimulation into a code that the brain can understand. Interactions between the device electronics and the retinal neurophysiology lead to distortions that can severely limit the quality of the generated visual experience.

        "summary": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have long been linked to mental health problems in adulthood. In the case of cancer, no study has considered that such an anteriority could make patients more vulnerable emotionally, even though the presence of reactionary disorders such as stress, anxiety or depression are characteristic of such a pathology. Activated during periods of stress and therefore during the illness, even the attachment system is mobilized and must be considered to allow more understanding of the illness experience. The attachment style can be seen here as an individual dimension that plays a role in the emotional regulation and resilience of patients. It is also particularly solicited during the remission phase, a complex and singular period of cancer disease that confronts patients with an ambivalence of hope and fear. The fear of recurrence is a concern that the cancer may return or progress in the same organ or in another part of the body. This is a determining factor in the occurrence of anxiety-depressive disorders. Finally, several studies have shown a strong association between depression/anxiety and Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) after treatment, especially during the remission phase.\nACEs leave physiological and epigenetic impact that can nowadays be easily evaluated, thus providing additional evidence between adversity, physiological and epigenetic vulnerability and the ability to adapt to life's challenges such as cancer. Life history changes are mediated by changes in cellular mechanisms affecting genome expression. It is currently widely demonstrated that ACEs increases epigenetic modifications.\nThe interest of this project is therefore to highlight the psychological consequences related to the occurrence of cancer in the developmental history (in terms of adversities) of patients who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, taking into account the patients' previous attachments, resilience, fear of recurrence and perceived fatigue in order to consider their interactions and their effects on their psychological health and ultimately on their quality of life.",

Primary surgical resection is feasible in about 10-15% of patients with an early-stage disease. Another 30-35% of patients have locally advanced disease with invasion into major vasculature but without detectable metastases. Surgery offers a chance of cure. The introduction of adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy has improved prognosis after surgery.\nIn the management of patients with PDAC, the role of neoadjuvant therapy is less certain. Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer can in theory control early systemic spread and improve rate of having no macroscopic or microscopic residual tumor (R0 resection). In the The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC-5) study, neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy did not increase rate of resection who had borderline-resectable disease but appears to improve overall survival (OS).\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may represent a new paradigm in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a 40 kDa membrane protein not expressed in normal cells, but highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells, such as mesothelioma, lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer. MSLN is expressed about 80% of PDAC.\nThere are several immunotherapies targeting MSLN for PDAC treatment, including antibody-based drugs (monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins), vaccines, and CAR-T cell therapy.\nThe safety of CAR-T cells targeting MSLN in the treatment of cancers has also been verified in several clinical trials on lung cancers (NCT01583686, NCT02414269, NCT01355965).

In a 42-year-old man with metastatic PDAC, the MSLN targeted CAR-T treatment led to complete response follow several hepatic artery infusion and intravenous infusion. These early cases confirmed the safety of these MSLN targeted CAR-T cells.\nIn the current proposed feasibility study, the researcher hypothesise that Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided injection of MSLN targeted CAR-T cells into PDAC can induce a tumor response, improve rate of R0 resection and translate into better patient survival.",

An infrared thermal imaging camera was used to record the temperature of lumbar regions during auricular acupuncture. Group 1 participants received AA on the left ear (Kidney point on the ear), followed by SA on the left ear, and AA on the right ear. All participants kept the other non-acupunctured ear uncovered but without any intervention. Group 2 participants received SA on the left ear, followed by the AA using the same protocol. The study compared the temperature of the left and right lumbar regions of the participants before and after receiving acupuncture interventions. The study found that the skin surface temperatures of the lumbar regions decreased significantly after AA compared to those before AA.

        "summary": "Background: One of the main goals of the Cardiopulmonary By-Pass (CPB) is targeting an adequate Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), in order to maintain appropriate perfusion pressures in all end-organs during heart surgery. As inheritance of early studies, a value of 50-60 mmHg has been historically accepted as the gold standard MAP. However, in the last decades, the CPB management has remarkably changed, thanks to the evolution of technology and the availability of new biomaterials. Therefore, as already highlighted by the latest European Guidelines, the current management of CPB can no longer refer to those pioneering studies. To date, only few single-centre studies have compared different strategies of MAP management during CPB, but with contradictory findings and without achieving a real consensus. Therefore, what should be the ideal strategy of MAP management during CPB is still on debate. This trial will be the first multicentre, randomized, controlled study to compare three different strategies of MAP management during the CPB.\nMethods: We described herein the methodology of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing three different approaches to MAP targeting during CPB in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery: the historically accepted standard MAP (50-60 mmHg), the high MAP (70-80 mmHg) and the patient-tailored MAP (comparable to the patient's preoperative MAP). It is the aim of the study to find the most suitable management in order to obtain the most adequate perfusion of end-organs during cardiac surgery. For this purpose, the primary endpoint will be the peak of serum lactate (Lmax) released during CPB, as index of tissue hypoxia. The secondary outcomes will include all the intraoperative parameters of tissues oxygenation and major post-operative complications related to organ malperfusion.\nDiscussion: This trial will assess the best strategy to target the MAP during CPB to further improve the outcomes of cardiac surgery.",

        "summary": "Alcohol use is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions (see ICD-10) and in France, alcohol is the first cause of hospitalization. Binge drinking (BD) has emerged as a major public health issue among student populations and is associated with negative consequences and social, cognitive and brain alterations. More than half of French university students have reported BD in the past month and are at increased risk of several alcohol-related consequences such as memory and sleep impairments, and reduced quality of life. BD is also a major risk factor in the development of alcohol addiction, with individual and environmental factors playing a role that is still poorly understood. Moreover, most students and young adults are reluctant to seek interventions when it is provided by health care professionals (only 4-5%) and have poor insight with regard to their alcohol use patterns / habits. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing effective prevention and intervention programs to reduce alcohol drinking in students. Recent studies have demonstrated that new types of technology-delivered interventions are promising tools for addressing unhealthy alcohol use. For example, an uncontrolled trial pilot study using a smartphone application-delivered intervention produced a reduction in both number of drinks per week and BD from baseline to 3-month follow-up. A recent review also showed significant outcomes of a mobile health intervention for self-control of unhealthy alcohol use. The investigators hypothesize that a timeline follow-back and personalized feedback based on the use of a mobile application can reduce excessive alcohol intake at 3-months. This study will provide scientific knowledge about BD in students, but also regarding a new type of intervention that could be effective for prevention in non-treatment seeking individuals and reducing the severity of health problems associated with excessive alcohol intake.",

The grades of MG loss (i.e. meiboscore) is calculated as the ratio between the area of the MGs and the eyelids, and this calculation is based on the two-dimensional digital infrared images.In the current formula, the area of the eyelid is the denominator. However, because the eyelids need to be flipped over for the examination and evaluation, and there may be interobserver variability in the measurement of the area of the eyelids. Aging and involutional eyelid disorders, such as ptosis, ectropion, and entropion, may lead to laxity or deformation of eyelids, and impact the shape and area of eyelid area consequently.These factors could cause inaccuracy in current evaluation method, and impact the grading and evaluation of treatment efficacy of MGD, especially in self-controlled studies, such as in clinical trials.\nIn this study, the investigators propose to use a modified calculation formula for the grading of MGs. The investigators could measure the white to white (WTW) distance of cornea, and then calculate the area of cornea (i.e. corneal base area) accordingly.Unlike the eyelid, the WTW distance does not change significantly during aging or between sexes.Thus, the investigators hypothesize that using the corneal base area as the new denominator in the formula for the grading of MG loss is a better way comparing with the conventional method.",

Some epidemiological studies report that infants experience an average of 7.5-14 painful procedures per day per infant during the first 14 days of their hospitalization.\nThe most significant problem encountered in understanding pain in infants is the lack of verbal expression of pain. Newborns express their pain with nonverbal behavioral expressions. Therefore, any pain assessment is based on the ability to recognize the pain symptoms of others. The pain experienced may cause physiological imbalances and abnormalities in brain development and stress response in infants in the short and long term. It can negatively affect family-infant communication, as well as cause emotional and psychosomatic problems later in life.\nToday, music therapy has positive effects on reducing stress, reducing pain, oxygen saturation level, and peak heart rate values in providing individualized developmental care of the infant in neonatal intensive care units. Heart sound, babies hear the mother's heart sound the most during the intrauterine period in the womb. Therefore, when babies hear the sound, they are familiar with in the womb, they will feel safe and a sense of relaxation will occur in the baby. Several studies have proven that playing heartbeat sounds to newborn babies can positively affect their physiological indicators, feeding, length of hospital stay and pain outcomes. The current literature shows that the presence of rhythmic sound can positively affect the neurobehavioral development of the infant and reduce pain. Rhythmic sounds have healing/positive effects on newborns; listening to white noise reduces preterms' pain scores, stabilizes vital signs, and plays an active role in preterms' sleep-wake period.\nIn line with all this information, this study was carried out as a randomized controlled experimental study in order to determine the effects of music played during heel spear application, white noise and heart sound in infants.",

This dietary pattern is also more sustainable for our planetary health. The majority of physicians receive fewer than 20 hours of nutrition education during the entire course of their medical training. Although many physicians are aware of the importance of diet on their well-being, they face significant barriers in following a healthy diet. Because physicians' own habits strongly influence patient health habits, the investigators theorize that physicians who eat a WFPBD themselves will be much more likely to successfully counsel their patients on nutrition and recommend a WFPBD.\nThe most effective methods that can be successfully used to encourage busy physicians to adopt a WFPBD have not yet been identified. Given the increasing rates of diet-related chronic illnesses, if proven effective, this study may offer a new scalable approach to encourage physicians, and ultimately their patients, to adopt a WFPBD.\nThe aims of this study are to:\nAssess the impact of a multimodal 6-week educational program on WFPBD on a) change in physicians' diet type and quality, b) change in mindset about WFPBD, and c) stage of change based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change (Figure 1), compared to the delayed-intervention (control group) from baseline to week 6.\nAssess the impact of the 6-week educational program on the development of skills and knowledge required to a) adopt a WFPBD and b) counsel patients on the same.",

Intrauterine retention of trophoblastic debris is not an uncommon phenomenon. These retentions may initially be asymptomatic but are often responsible for persistent metrorrhagia and endometritis. This symptomatology often accentuates the psychological distress of patients mourning the pregnancy. Incomplete miscarriages are mainly managed by the gynecological emergency department. The recommendations of the Coll\u00e8ge National des Gyn\u00e9cologues et Obst\u00e9triciens Fran\u00e7ais (CNGOF) suggest as a first line of treatment: either surgical management or expectant care.

Sleeping aids like benzodiazepines and other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) have been widely used to help treat insomnia. However, sleeping aids are also known to cause adverse drug reactions such as drowsiness and dizziness, that increases the risk of falls, driving impairment, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and upon discontinuation may cause paradoxical rebound insomnia, delirium, and nightmares all of which exacerbate the initial insomnia. All of the negative aspects of sleeping aid use are exaggerated for older, frail adults.\nSome patients experience an early (young-age) onset dementia with a substantial component of insomnia. Due to the many risks associated with traditional sleeping aids they are often inappropriate in adults living with cognitive impairment and/or frailty. Lemborexant comes from a new class of medications for insomnia. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their receptors orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX2R), which is thought to suppress wake drive. Unlike other traditional sleeping aids, lemborexant has not shown to be significantly associated with driving impairment, rebound insomnia, or dependence/withdrawal symptoms. Also, in clinical trials it only rarely causes the types of adverse events associated with benzodiazepines and other traditional sedatives and is less often associated with discontinuations due to adverse events.\nWhile lemborexant is available on the Canadian market it is unclear how this medication will be tolerated by patients living with an early onset dementia. Understanding the effectiveness and tolerability of lemborexant will be helpful in an N of 1 trial to understand the details of effect and effectiveness in individual patients.",

Post-operative delirium is a devastating complication, leading to longer ICU and hospital stay, increased incidence of discharge to nursing facility and poorer long-term cognitive outcome.\nDespite the impact this complication has on individuals, their families and healthcare resources, little is known about the causes and potential preventative measures.\nIt is thought that systemic inflammation compromising the integrity of the blood brain barrier is an important contributing factor. Recent data suggests that antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid (TXA) might be able to lessen the inflammation of the nervous system caused by surgery and CPB through the inhibition of plasmin production, thereby stabilising the blood brain barrier. Worldwide, the use of TXA has become standard of care in cardiac surgery and other types of surgery with a high risk of bleeding.

Anastomotic fistula is a serious complication of rectal cancer surgery. For patients at high risk of anastomotic fistula, prophylactic ileostomy is often performed intraoperatively to divert feces and protect the anastomosis. For such patients, rectal anterior resection surgery with specimen extraction via stoma (NOSES with specimen extraction via stoma) is usually performed, borrowing a prophylactic stoma incision to retrieve the specimen, and also realizing the absence of additional abdominal incision. However, this procedure is prone to stoma infection and has a high complication rate (20-40%), which limits the popularization of NOSES surgery and is an urgent clinical problem. Our center has proposed a new stoma closure method (Dumpling Suture Method), which reduces the size of the incision by folding the suture to achieve the effect of hiding the skin incision and reduce stoma infection. In our previous study, 17 cases of the new procedure were completed in our center, and 25 patients with stoma closure by the traditional method were included in the same period for control purposes. After six months of follow-up, we found that the dumpling suture method significantly reduced the incidence of stoma complications compared with the traditional suture method (5.8% vs. 36%), and no additional adverse effects were observed. This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical study planned to recruit 66 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the trial and control groups. The primary endpoint is stoma complication rate at 30 days postoperatively. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dumpling suture method  compared with the traditional stoma suture in reducing postoperative stoma complications through a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial, which is of great significance for the improvement of the rectal NOSES procedure and the reduction of the incidence of stoma complications.",

Based on data of the first follow-up of this cohort results indicated that presence of both mild cognitive instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairment and PD-MCI dramatically increases the risk for PDD (PubMed ID: 36240089). This study evaluates markers predicting cognitive and IADL long-term outcome in our sample.

SLLDs correspond to the impairment of a specific cognitive function and are divided into 5 categories: dyslexia, dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (DSM-5). In recent years, real progress has been made in their clinical diagnosis and management, thanks to a better description of these disorders in the DSM-5 and the advent of rehabilitative treatments (neuropsychology, speech therapy, occupational therapy, orthoptics, etc.). SLLD can occur in a sporadic or familial context (sibling involvement, a symptomatic parent, other relatives who may mimic dominant inheritance with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance).\nIt has long been suspected that SLLD is secondary to multifactorial inheritance, with a combination of frequent genetic variations and environmental factors. In France, in the absence of an obvious syndromic diagnosis, the current strategy is to prescribe array CGH, combined in girls with a search for fragile X syndrome (in boys, this syndrome leads to systematic intellectual disability, which does not justify its study in SLLD). A few genes have been described as being specifically involved in a small proportion of SLLD, most often with de novo variations or inherited from a symptomatic parent. There are no distinctive clinical features to guide targeted sequencing of these genes. Moreover, our recent experience shows that genes implicated in intellectual disability may also be involved in SLLD. Very few studies have been published in the literature evaluating the value of exome sequencing in SLLD. Only two studies have been identified, involving 10 and 43 patients with specific SLLD.\nIn view of the roll-out of the French Genomic Medicine Plan (PFMG 2025), it is important to set up a study aimed at assessing the value of genome-wide sequencing in the etiological work-up for SLLD.\nParticipation in the study consists of:\nan inclusion visit, where an additional blood sample will be taken during the baseline work-up\na results visit (4 months after the inclusion visit)\nOptional qualitative study: semi-structured interview 1 year after the inclusion visit proposed to 20 patients or families with a positive result and to 10 patients with a negative result.",

There is an increase in the incidence and severity of ROP development in direct proportion to the decrease in birth week and birth weight. While ROP is a problem below 32 weeks of gestation in developed countries, it is reported to develop severely up to 34 weeks of gestation in developing countries. In a multicenter study conducted by the Turkish Neonatology Society in our country, the frequency of ROP in very low birth weight preterm infants was found to be 42%, and the frequency of advanced ROP was 11%. The incidence of ROP in babies with a gestational age of 33-35 weeks was 6.1%, and advanced ROP was 6 per thousand. The frequency of ROP was found to be 10.3% in babies with a birth weight of 1500-2000 grams, and severe ROP was reported in 19 of these babies. ROP examination is a procedure that causes pain, deterioration in comfort and physiological changes in preterm newborns. After this examination, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and a decrease in oxygen saturation are observed. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (non-pharmacological) methods are used to reduce the pain and increase the comfort level of the premature newborn. As a pharmacological method, there is no other routine method used to reduce pain other than the administration of local anesthetic drops before the examination. Because of this situation, nurses apply various non-pharmacological methods to alleviate pain. These methods are; breast milk, sucrose use, oral dextrose use, non-nutritive sucking, positioning, listening to music and mother's voice. In the literature, no specific study was found in which music was used to reduce pain and increase the comfort level during the ROP examination.

A regular slow and deep breathing training helps to adjust the baroreflex, which connect heart rate, breathing and blood pressure.

Ibrutinib has also been found to be effective in mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia and marginal zone lymphoma. However, ibrutinib treatment is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), with an estimated 2-year AF rate of 16% in patients treated with ibrutinib during a median follow-up of 28 months. In most studies, AF was identified by reports as a treatment-related adverse event, and systematic screening for AF was not performed. As AF is often paroxysmal, the more intensive the screening, the higher the incidence. In a prospective cohort study of 53 patients treated with ibrutinib for CLL, patients were monitored by pulse palpation and ECG every 3 months. The cumulative incidence rate of ibrutinib-associated AF was 23% at 12 months and 38% at 2 years. The management of ibrutinib-associated AF is challenging due to difficulties in balancing the benefits of anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of stroke and the bleeding risk associated with ibrutinib.

Clinical surveillance of influenza in humans and avian species is well organized and has been operating for decades, but currently there is no pro-active systematic surveillance of potential transmission of animal (avian or swine) influenza viruses to humans, only follow-up of people showing clinical symptoms. People working with potentially infected animals have the highest risk. Moreover, they can represent the first steps in a pandemic: if the virus adapts to humans, infected workers could potentially spread the virus to other people.\nCurrently, highly pathogenic clade2.3.4.4b H5 avian influenza viruses are continuously circulating in wild birds in Belgium and the number of introduction in poultry farms has raised, increasing the contact opportunities with high viral concentrations. Several reports of suspected human infection have been made by different countries. In addition, the virus was detected in sick non-human mammals. The large circulation in wild birds thus represents an increase risk of spill-over to mammalian species, including humans, (by contact directly with wild birds, or via outbreaks in poultry). This increased opportunity for accidental spillover to new host species increases the chances for the avian virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.\nLikewise, there have also been an increased number of human cases of swine influenza reported by several European countries. A pro-active surveillance aiming at also detecting asymptomatic infections would allow an early detection of transmission that could help to prevent a new pandemic.\nAs a piloting approach during this specific project, some dedicated sentinel networks among at-risk workers will be initiated: people in poultry farms involved with the management of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza; people working at bird (or more generally wild life) rehabilitation centres or poultry farms; veterinarians working in pig farms/slaughterhouses.",

        "summary": "Pes planus is a foot deformity characterized by a low medial longitudinal arch. It is more common in young adults. With low arch, tension occurs in the plantar fascia. Fascia and soft tissue loading may lead to different musculoskeletal problems such as plantar fasciitis, medial tibial stress syndrome, patellofemoral disorders and back pain. In addition, pes planus can affect individuals' activities of daily living, productivity in occupational settings, and injury risk and performance in sports.\nTreatment of pes planus includes strengthening, stretching, taping and orthotics for the foot muscles. Among these applications, strengthening of the foot core muscles is one of the most common and effective methods. By strengthening the foot core muscles, it is aimed to reduce the effect of the kinetic chain. Pes planus is a postural deformity that affects the kinetic and fascial chain, but the treatment program is usually planned regionally. With fascial continuity and fascial conduction, the tension on the plantar fascia in pes planus affects the gastro-soleus, peroneus longus and brevis, hamstring muscles, iliotibial band and thoracolumbar fascia. Stretching of the plantar fascia, which is included in current treatment programs, has only a local effect and thus cannot prevent fascial chain involvement. Myofascial release, one of the methods used to reduce the tension in the fascia, has been used frequently in recent years. Myofascial release is performed with methods such as manual, foam roller and instrument assisted release.

Duodenoscopes used for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), in order to treat different biliary and pancreatic disorders, have been recently linked to infections transmission following the procedures. Given their reusability and their complex design of the tip with a moving metallic component, named the elevator, these instruments must be reprocessed through high level disinfection (HLD) in order to prevent the spread of nosocomial infections. Even strict adherence to all HLD procedures results in a residual level of potentially infectious microbes. In fact, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) postmarket surveillance communication reported duodenoscope culture results demonstrating contamination rates of up to 3.6% for low and moderate-concern organisms and up to 5.4% for high-concern organisms in reprocessed conventional duodenoscopes. As a consequence, at least 20 outbreaks of duodenoscope-transmitted multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) infections occurred between 2012 and 2015, despite reported compliance with duodenoscope reprocessing guidelines. The increasing concern that currents practices of reprocessing reusable duodenoscopes is insufficient, has led the FDA to released recommendation suggesting to develope a newly designed duodenoscopes. On one hand, a way is to generate duodenoscope with disposable components, such as a one-use end cap, which can be removed and allow access to the components of the elevator and other areas of the duodenoscope for reprocessing. On the other hand, an alternative is to produce a fully disposable single-use duodenoscope.

        "summary": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by severe motor and non-motor symptoms, including upper limb dysfunction. Due to the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, PD patients experience difficulties with motor learning and more specifically with the consolidation of motor memory. Recent work showed that intensive writing training improved writing skills in PD. Although consolidation effects were present, difficulties with retention were also still apparent. Besides impacting writing, manual dexterity deficits in PD can also affect the use of touchscreens. Researchers from our lab demonstrated that impairments were most pronounced in multi-direction sliding motions, indicating the need for training of these motor skills. Our lab demonstrated the classic difficulties with retention in PD after one session of training of a swipe and slide pattern on a tablet (SSP-task) as single task (ST), although immediate gains were demonstrated. Therefore, in this study the investigators will examine whether a two-week home-based training program of a tablet-based SSP-training program will lead to immediate and consolidated improvements that are retained in time. This program will combine ST and dual task (DT) training to provide variation during the training period, but also to increase the cognitive challenge during learning, thereby stimulation consolidation of learning. The primary aim of this study consists of investigating the learning effects after two weeks of targeted touchscreen training. Secondary, the investigators will examine whether these effects will also be retained after four weeks without practice and whether targeted training results in consolidated improvements, in terms of automaticity and transfer towards an untrained task. Given the objective recording of compliance to the training protocol, the investigators will explore the association between compliance rates and learning effects.",

Feedback will be provided to motivate the patients and improve retention.

In this context, joint fluid aspiration (JFA) is indicated to document a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) or to bring to light arguments for implant failure. Nevertheless, opinions differ on its indication for microbiological identification. Some teams perform it systematically when faced with a prosthesis dysfunction. Others, only in the presence of suggestive signs of PJI. Finally, others never perform it.\nBased on clinical, radiological and biological (CRP) signs, at the preoperative stage and before JFA, we classify our patients into 3 groups: supposedly septic (chronic joint infection), supposedly aseptic (implant failure) or intermediate (Unknown). This last group, often encountered in consultation, poses a diagnosis problem more than the others.\nIn our experience, JFA is an essential diagnosis tool in these 3 groups of patients. It helps to choose the surgical strategy. In addition, the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid as the alpha defensin, the leucocyte esterase and the CRP could provide an additional argument to investigate the infectious origin or not, in particular in difficult cases.\nIn summary, the disagreement on the usefulness of JFA in case of PJI suspicion and any other prosthetic dysfunction, the lack of data on large prospective studies and our questioning about the contribution of JFA in the aseptic and intermediate group of patients, motivated us to set up this study to evaluate the interest of the JFA for the preoperative diagnosis, as well as that of the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid.",

It is the main cause of morbidity and disability in the world with, among other things, an increase in cardio-metabolic risk and a reduction in life expectancy, regardless of suicide risk. MDD is the most expensive medical condition: 10-20 billion \u20ac/year in France. This cost is mainly attributable to the functional consequences of the disease, highlighting the medico-economic challenge represented by the optimization of the organization of care.\nIn France, more than 80% of MDD patients are enrolled in non-psychiatric care pathways, mainly primary care or MSO hospital care (medicine, surgery, obstetrics). Unfortunately, less than half of patients benefit from treatment at an appropriate dosage or duration, thus exposing them to the risks of relapse, recurrence and chronic evolution. It is necessary to optimize this management, in particular by improving secondary prevention, which consists of maintaining treatment in the months following symptomatic remission.\nSeveral support programs (monitoring with assessment of symptomatology) have shown their effectiveness on depressive symptomatology with a favorable medico-economic report, in particular by allowing maintenance of antidepressant treatment. None of these studies have been conducted on French care pathways.\nInvestigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine management (added to usual care) in non-psychiatric care pathways on the evolution of depressive symptomatology for MDD patients.

Better protocol adherence translates into fewer readmissions and complications, and better 5-year survival. Preoperative elements, especially nutrition and immunonutrition, are topics that need further development to become the standard of care. It has been widely reported that the prevalence of malnutrition reaches 40% in cancer patients at the time of diagnosis. Impaired nutritional status at the time of surgery and cancer-induced inflammation, along with postoperative inflammatory responses to major surgery, increase the risk of postoperative complications, along with a decrease in perceived quality of life.\nImmunonutrition can modulate inflammation and reduce postoperative infections and shorten length of stay by counteracting the immune response induced by cancer. Adipose tissue has been shown to be a relevant source of inflammatory mediators, which may play a role in the promotion of tumor cachexia.\nThe present study is a multicenter randomized control study (RCT) designed to evaluate the effect of preoperative immunonutrition in patients with colorectal cancer eligible for elective minimally invasive procedures, evaluating in particular surgical site infection and length of hospital stay.

        "summary": "Mesenteric fat can be invaded by gut bacteria through a process called bacterial translocation, which is the invasion of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to extraintestinal sites (mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney, bloodstream, etc.). In Crohn's disease (CD), bacterial translocation could increase the disproportionate inflammatory response already present and contribute to disease progression by stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune-cell infiltration in the mesentery. Several mechanisms may promote bacterial translocation, such as bacterial overgrowth, disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier and alterations in the immune system.\nIleocecal surgical resection is required in some patients with complicated or refractory CD. Unfortunately, post-surgical disease recurrence happens in up to 40% of cases, probably defining a subgroup of CD patients with a particular aggressive form of the disease. The complete microbiome (in gastrointestinal and extraintestinal sites) in CD patients that develop early post-surgical recurrence, as well as the association to innate immunity alterations, has not yet been studied.\nThe primary aim of the study is to explore the bacterial microbiome of CD patients and its association with early post-surgical recurrence and clinical or genetic variables related to innate immunity. To achieve this, the bacterial DNA present in mesenteric fat and ileal tissue (inflamed and non-inflamed) from surgical resection samples as well as blood samples from CD patients will be studied. Genetic polymorphisms, relevant clinical data and disease recurrence will also be evaluated.\nThe investigators hypothesize that bacterial translocation to the mesentery fat near the inflamed intestine is one of the mechanisms for perpetuation and chronicity of inflammation and therefore post-surgical recurrence in CD. The investigators expect to find a distinctive bacterial profile (in quantity and quality) in the mesenteric fat of patients with early post-surgical recurrence and/or with genetic variants that cause alterations in innate immunity.\nThe study of the microbiome in CD could help to identify the patients with a more aggressive disease form that will probably present early post-surgical recurrence, and could raise the possibility of microbial modulation as therapy for CD.",

However, approximately 10-15% of these localized melanomas will eventually metastasize, despite appropriate local treatment. Once metastasis occurs, median survival is less than two years. Melanomas at high risk of metastasis can be identified by gene expression profiling. The investigators aim to treat these high risk melanomas to prevent future metastasis. Statin drugs, like atorvastatin, have been used to treat high cholesterol for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events, but not for preventing melanoma metastasis. Statins could prevent melanoma metastasis through decreasing tumor cell migration, decreasing tumor cell adhesion, and increasing immune system response. Statins are also efficient inhibitors of new lymphatic vessels formation. Since tumor lymphatic vessels serve as highways to lymph nodes and may suppress immune system responses, statins may block a critical step towards melanoma metastasis.

Normalized Percentage scores are then translated into a normalized percentage (0-100) for ease of interpretation. Specific outcome measures include blood pressure measurement technique, patient education on hypertension, recognition and response to simulated episodes of severe hypertension, and recognition and response to actual episodes of severe hypertension. The target population consists of patients with severe hypertension, so data will be collected from 20 clinics which have 50 or more pregnancies per year and are primarily serving uninsured or NC Medicaid populations and patients of Black/African American or rural descent. Patient education on hypertension will be based on a standardized patient education handout and delivered by the patient care team to pregnant women with hypertension during at least 2 prenatal care visits or within a few days of hospital admission, whichever occurs first. The handout will either be delivered 1-on-1 by the provider, to a group of patients together, online or by phone.

        "summary": "Extracorporeal blood purification is a supportive therapy in the management of patients with sepsis or vasoplegic shock. The pathophysiology of sepsis is based on an inappropriate host response to infection. Certain medical devices with higher adsorption capacity make it possible to limit this inappropriate response and could thus improve the hemodynamics of patients in septic or vasoplegic shock. The preliminary experience of the investigators from clinical data of vasopressor withdrawal in pediatric patients treated with oXiris shows a 50% reduction in the vasopressor score, Vaso Inotropic Score (VIS), for 40% of patients within 24 hours following the start of treatment. Similar results were found in adult patients treated for severe COVID-19 or vasoplegic shock by the other centers participating in the study.\nCytokine purification is an important physiological effect of purification membranes. However, this may not fully explain the rapid hemodynamic improvement of patients treated with an oXiris membrane.\nThe role of angiotensin metabolites (Ang 1-5, 1-7, 1-9) in the systemic vascular tone of patients has been recently discussed. The administration of angiotensin 2 in vasoplegic shock in adults helps correct hypotension. In the group of patients with increased renin, this treatment was associated with a reduction in mortality. Indeed, increased renin associated with dysfunction of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) leads to an accumulation of Angiotensin 1 which degrades to Ang 1-7.\nThe hypothesis f the investigators is that the concentration of Ang 1 and Ang 1-7 is elevated in cases of vasoplegic shock and that the clearance of these vasodilator peptides by blood purification is associated with clinical improvement.",

If the uterus is unscarred, bladder mobilization may not be technically difficult. However, if the uterus is scarred, there can be adhesions not only between the uterus and the bladder but also to the anterior abdominal wall, which can make dissection challenging. Studies of the effects of closure or nonclosure of the peritoneum during cesarean delivery on adhesion formation have concluded that insufficient data are available and that adequately powered and designed trials are needed.\nAs regards the lateral approach, this space was first described by Dr. Shrish Sheth utilizing the utero-cervical broad ligament in post cesarean cases during vaginal hysterectomy. He described that the lateral area; the two leaves of broad ligament remains free and allows easy possibility for entry to dissect whether vaginally or abdominally. While in medial approach, a metal catheter was then inserted in the bladder. The catheter was rotated so the tip was pointing upward, to stretch the bladder pillars.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that babies start breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth and breastfeed exclusively without any additional food, including water, for the first 6 months. After six months, complementary foods should be started, and the baby should continue to be breastfed for two years or more. On the other hand, between 2015-2020, the rates of infants aged 0-6 months fed with breast milk alone are approximately 44% worldwide.\nThere are many factors that affect the time of initiation of breastfeeding and the duration of breastfeeding. Some of those; maternal education, mode of delivery, birth weight and socio-economic status. Another influential factor is paternal support. Fathers may want to be involved in breastfeeding education and support their spouses in this process. However, the reasons such as not taking part in the trainings and not being asked direct questions about breastfeeding may cause fathers to feel excluded in this process. It is important to include fathers in education and interventions to achieve breastfeeding goals. Mothers who are supported by their spouses during the breastfeeding process experience breastfeeding problems less and can cope with these problems better.\nToday, it is known that fathers are not given sufficient importance in promoting breastfeeding.

The secondary outcome was dietary score for diet quality. The authors conducted repeated-measurements analyses for blood markers and linear mixed models for diet quality scores to test their hypotheses (H0: there is no change in diet or blood markers associated with metabolic health because of the tea intervention; H1: there is change in diet or blood markers associated with metabolic health because of the tea intervention).

Early symptoms may include tremors, stiffness, bradykinesia, and changes in facial expression. Over time, the condition may progress to loss of facial expression and difficulty swallowing, reading, and writing. To address these deficits, many patients turn to physical activity and exercise, which have been linked to increased strength, balance, and mobility. In recent years, the use of activity trackers and smartwatches such as Fitbits and Apple Watches has gained popularity, allowing individuals to monitor and track their physical activity and exercise in an effort to stay motivated and engaged. According to the literature, the prevalence of physical activity in PD patients is only 16-18%, compared to 30% for the general population. In addition, approximately one in five people over the age of 65 reported regularly meeting the recommended level of physical activity prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and one in three had access to a fitness tracker prior to the pandemic.

        "summary": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a frequent pathology in intensive care (around 10% of patients admitted to intensive care and almost a quarter of patients on mechanical ventilation) and a serious one, with a hospital mortality rate of 40%. The main measures that have an effect on mortality in ARDS involve adjustments to the ventilator, known as protective ventilation. In the most severe patients, adjuvant measures such as prone positioning and the use of curarisation in the initial phase of the disease can improve survival. All these measures have been included in the latest national and international recommendations. However, a vast observational study carried out in 50 countries revealed low compliance with these recommendations. More than a third of patients did not receive protective ventilation, and the majority did not receive prone positioning when this was indicated. During weaning from artificial ventilation, it has been widely demonstrated that replacing clinician judgement with the implementation of paramedical care protocols improved weaning and significantly reduced the duration of artificial ventilation. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a paramedical care protocol for ventilation in the acute phase of ARDS improves compliance with recommendations and thus reduces mortality and the duration of artificial ventilation. However, implementation of such a protocol requires operational training for all the nurses in the participating departments. Simulation appears to be the training method of choice, as it is a teaching technique that enables technical and non-technical skills to be passed on with good retention of what has been learnt, as well as assessing what has been learnt.

This work aims to evaluate the impact of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced algorithm called Boneview on the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians in the detection of fractures on plain XR (X-Ray). The study will create a dataset of 500 plain X-Rays involving standard images of all bones other than the skull and cervical spine, with 50% normal cases and 50% containing fractures. A reference 'ground truth' for each image to confirm the presence or absence of a fracture will be established by a senior radiologist panel. This dataset will then be inferenced by the Gleamer Boneview algorithm to identify fractures. Performance of the algorithm will be compared against the reference standard. The study will then undertake a Multiple-Reader Multiple-Case study in which clinicians interpret all images without AI and then subsequently with access to the output of the AI algorithm. 18 clinicians will be recruited as readers with 3 from each of six distinct clinical groups: Emergency Medicine, Trauma and Orthopedic Surgery, Emergency Nurse Practitioners, Physiotherapy, Radiology and Radiographers, with three levels of seniority in each group. Changes in reporting accuracy (sensitivity, specificity), confidence, and speed of readers in two sessions will be compared. The results will be analyzed in a pooled analysis for all readers as well as for the following subgroups: Clinical role, Level of seniority, Pathological finding, Difficulty of image.

By definition, individuals who die from an infection have defective immunity to the pathogen in question (immune agent (immune deficiency).\nThe investigation of individual variability in the development of infectious diseases began in the early 20th. The first evidence to support the hypothesis that individual variability variability and immune deficiencies were hereditary came from observations of familial cases or genetic isolates genetic isolates (from a homogeneous population) of rare or common infectious diseases, which in some cases Mendelian heredity hat predisposition to infectious diseases runs in families even more so than diseases associated with less determined environmental factors, such as certain cancers. such as certain cancers. Finally, studies comparing the rate of concordance of infectious diseases between monozygotic and dizygotic twins also implicate genetic factors in disease susceptibility.\nThese observations were validated by the discovery of genetic defects associated with severe infectious diseases, leading to proof of concept. While a number of hereditary immune deficiencies associated with susceptibility to multiple pathogens or microorganisms, a growing number of new and rare new and rare immune deficiencies conferring restricted susceptibility to infections caused by a single caused by a single pathogen family, or even a single pathogen, in otherwise healthy children, have recently been identified (one gene, one pathogen).

Given the rising age of global populations, reducing the burden associated with lost physical function is essential to minimise health and social care costs. Unfortunately, very few older adults engage in sufficient S&B exercise to reap these benefits, with a lack of time, self-efficacy and access to leisure facilities cited as the key barriers. Finding innovative ways promote an acceptable and engaging format of S&B exercise is consequently a public health priority.\nOne novel way that aims to address typical barriers to participation in older adults is through the promotion of exercise 'snacks', as opposed to a more traditional, lengthy structured exercise session at a leisure centre. Exercise snacking describes short bursts of exercise that are designed to be undertaken over a short period in the home environment and without the need for any specialised exercise clothing or equipment. In the initial laboratory and cross-sectional and pilot intervention research, the investigators have been testing two formats of 5-minute, twice-daily, strength exercise- and tai-chi-snacking, which has been shown to be acceptable and feasible to implement in older adults. This protocol presents initial efficacy for evoking improved physical function in people aged 65 years or more. The investigators' remote study demonstrated that remote assessment and delivery of 4-week exercise and tai-chi snacking interventions were acceptable and feasible. However, qualitative feedback indicated that exercise programmes may be more acceptable and interesting with simpler tai-chi movements and exercise snacking programme with upper body movements.

        "summary": "Lumbosacral spine surgeries are commonly performed under GA. Perioperative pain following spine surgeries not only contributes to significant morbidities but also hampers early mobilization. Perioperative opioids, though relieve pain but hampers consciousness, increase PONV and delays mobilization. Caudal analgesia can be effectively given preemptively to alleviate pain and facilitate early mobilization. Caudal epidural block places the needle through the sacral hiatus into the epidural space to deliver medications. It can be performed as ultrasound guided procedure with very high successful rates. Single shot caudal block with local anesthetic provides analgesia for 2-4 hours but this can be further prolonged by adding adjuvants like opioids, steroids, ketamine, alpha 2 agonists, adrenaline etc. Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic agent which is less lipophilic, less cardiac and central nervous system toxicity with similar duration of analgesia, has lesser motor blockade and facilitates earlier mobilization than bupivacaine. Dexamethasone is a highly potent, long acting glucocorticoid. Caudal dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of the ropivacaine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pre-emptive caudal epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief in lumbosacral surgeries and to compare the effect of adding dexamethasone to ropivacaine with respect to quality of analgesia, duration of analgesia, hemodynamic effects and associated side effects.",

        "summary": "The brain is a highly active organ that requires a large blood flow to function properly. Normally, blood flow is tightly linked to the brain's energy demands. However, during surgery, anesthesia can affect this relationship in different ways. Some types of anesthesia can decrease blood flow to the brain, while others can increase it. Anesthesiologists need to be careful to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain during surgery, especially when blood pressure drops. Drugs may be used to increase blood pressure, but some of these drugs can also affect blood flow to the brain. It is still unclear how to best maintain blood flow to the brain during surgery and how different types of anesthesia and drugs affect this process.\nThe study aims to assess the clinical utility of a new technique that uses light-based neuromonitoring to measure changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism. The investigators will recruit 80 adult patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia and randomize them into one of four groups to evaluate the effects of different anesthetic agents and vasopressors on brain hemodynamics and metabolism. The study will include patients over 18 years of age with no history of neurological conditions, substance abuse, or contraindications to cerebral oximetry devices or specific anesthetic agents. The patients will receive standard anesthesia care and be monitored with our light-based neuromonitoring system.

        "summary": "Shaft fractures account for 20% of humeral fractures and 3% of all adult fractures in France, with an estimated incidence of 13 to 20/100,000 people. Men aged 21 to 30 years and women aged 60 to 80 years are particularly affected. Intramedullary nailing is among the standard treatments for humeral shaft fractures (when surgery is required). Once inserted, the nail is locked in order to limit stress on the fractured bone, as well as possible secondary rotational displacements or malunion. Bipolar interlocking (BI) is typically performed on both sides (proximal and distal) of the fracture site. This procedure is performed under radiological control, exposing the patient and care team to radiation (during the entire procedure). The objective of the treatment is to obtain consolidation of the fracture within 12 months, and to limit the occurrence of irreversible complications such as malunion or nonunion (2-10% at 12 months post-surgery). The unipolar interlocking (UI) technique has recently been introduced. In this technique, locking is performed only on the proximal side of the fracture site. By avoiding the distal approach, potential complications such as radial nerve damage, with the risk of irreversible paralysis (3.8-14.2% in studies of the BI technique in this indication) or the risk of infection on the distal side can be avoided. It also reduces operative time, and consequently the radiation received by patients and caregivers. However, the UI may be poorly positioned, resulting in malunion that requires revision surgery.\nDespite the absence of recommendations due to the lack of existing data, several teams use the UI in routine care. In this context, a descriptive cohort of 121 patients operated on at the Dijon University Hospital5 showed similar rates of consolidation between the 2 techniques (93.8% for UI versus 95.2% for BI, p=0.64), functional scores, and complications, as well as a significant 29% decrease in operating time in the UI group (mean + SD: 63.1\u00b121.3 min versus 88.0\u00b130.1 min for VB, p<0.01).

In addition, the study investigated the factors that may affect arterial structure and blood flow values, such as age, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), resting heart rate, and other demographic and health-related information. The study found that there were significant relationships between arterial structure and blood flow values and age, BMI, and SBP in some cases by regression analysis, but the exact nature of these relationships was not described. The study also found sex-based differences in normal reference values for arterial structure and blood flow and suggested that men be evaluated using higher cut-off values for arterial blood flow thickness measurements, while women be evaluated using higher cut-off values for arterial blood flow BFV measurements. The study concluded that this multi-center study established reliable normal reference values for high-frequency ultrasound measurements of arterial structure and blood flow and the influencing factors of these values. However, the study had limitations, as the study population was limited to adults aged 18 to 79 years and the study did not consider disease groups, such as diabetes or hypertension, which may affect these measurements.

        "summary": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes the inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures exceeding one atmosphere absolute. HBOT has been applied worldwide, mostly for chronic non-healing wounds. Our team demonstrated that HBOT induced hippocampal neuroplasticity in veterans with long-standing treatment-resistant PTSD; this led to enhanced memory recovery and significant improvement in PTSD symptoms.\nBoth physical activity, such as aerobic exercise, and cognitive training were shown to support neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate whether hippocampal training, induced by physical and cognitive training, will augment the hippocampal neuroplasticity effect of HBOT and further enhance recovery of inaccessible memories in veterans with PTSD.\nThe protocol will include forty male veterans aged 25 to 60 years, with combat-associated PTSD and peritraumatic amnesia, who will receive either HBOT alone or HBOT and hippocampal training. The HBOT protocol will consist of 60 daily sessions, 90-minutes each, five days a week. Hippocampal training will combine physical and cognitive training 3 times per week, prior to HBOT sessions. Detailed psychological evaluation, anatomic and functional MRI, electroencephalogram and autonomic nervous system data will be obtained at baseline, and during and after treatment.\nThe proposed study offers a new approach of biological treatment for memory manipulations. The findings will help elucidate the mechanism of PTSD-related memory impairment and is expected to contribute to the development of biological memory manipulations for treating PTSD and other memory-related conditions.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] The proposed study will aim to evaluate whether physical and cognitive training will augment hippocampal plasticity induced by HBOT, and further enhance recovery of inaccessible memories in veterans with PTSD. Previous research by the investigators demonstrated that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), induced hippocampal neuroplasticity , which enhanced memory recovery, reduced the severity of PTSD symptoms in veterans [12, 13, 19], and ameliorated PTSD symptoms associated with childhood sexual abuse in women [15, 16]. In these studies, the HBOT protocol comprised daily HBOT sessions for 60 consecutive days, with each session lasting 90 minutes. Research shows that HBOT leads to increased synaptic plasticity and increases expression of the \u03b2-tubulin isoform III subunit (\u03b2-tubulin III) [11, 14], which is essential for healthy brain networks and for encoding and retrieval of memories. Hippocampal neurogenesis in humans is challenging to demonstrate using current methods [20, 21], however, changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity, such as \u03b2-tubulin III expression, are correlated with changes in hippocampal volume and neuronal activity, and thus are considered robust biomarkers of hippocampal neurogenesis [11, 14, 15]. In addition to HBOT, physical and cognitive training will be administered, in order to support the effect of HBOT on memory recovery via enhancing hippocampal neuroplasticity, and to further augment the effect of HBOT on hippocampal neurogenesis and brain integration. Exercise has been reported to enhance memory performance and hippocampal neurogenesis . Physical activity in combination with cognitive training has been shown to facilitate brain plasticity, integrate information, and improve the performance of memory retrieval . The physical training used from this protocol will include walking, jogging, running, aerobic dance, muscle circuit training, and breathing exercises, performed in a group format. The training will include 30 minutes of light to moderate aerobic activity, followed by a 5\u201310 minute warm-down period and stretching. The memory training will use the RSVP method, as developed by Bailey [18, 24], which consists of repeated, random, transverse presentations of printed words, each printed at the rate of three words per second, to subjects in a seated position. The cognitive training will use an integrative training program  to enhance brain integration and improve memory retrieval. The training will consist of 20\u201330 minutes of integration memory-based training, using repetition of items, associations and spatial environments, through repetitive practice of associating and linking a new set of 300 items.",

Per-oral endoscopic myotomy is known as the effective treatment for achalasia patients. During per-oral endoscopic myotomy, capnoperitoneum, capnomediastinum, and systemic CO2 accumulation can potentially impair hemodynamics. Moreover, it has been suggested that achalasia is associated with autonomic dysfunction. We hypothesized that patients with autonomic dysfunstion would esperience more hemodynamic instability during per-oral endoscopic myotomy compared with patients without autonomic dysfunction. In this prospective observational study, the autonomic function test will be performed before surgery, and advanced hemodynamic parameters will be recorded using EV1000 clinical platform (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) during surgery.

In the last few years, many studies have been conducted to facilitate pediatric patients against painful or frightening medical procedures. For uncomfortable procedures, distracting the child's attention is seen as the most important point.

The most important factor for survival for many cancer types is the presence of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes (metastasis). Lymph node metastases in patients with head and neck cancer reduce the 5-year survival by half. Sometimes, the disease is too small to be found on clinical and imaging exams before surgery. 111In-panitumumab is in a class of medications called radioimmunoconjugates. It is composed of a radioactive substance (indium In 111) linked to a monoclonal antibody (panitumumab). Panitumumab binds to EGFR receptors, a receptor that is over-expressed on the surface of many tumor cells and plays a role in tumor cell growth. Once 111In-panitumumab binds to tumor cells, it is able to be seen using an imaging technique called single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). SPECT/CT can be used to make detailed pictures of the inside of the body and to visualize areas where the radioactive drug has been taken up by the cells.

        "summary": "Two billion catheters are placed annually worldwide. Of all the people requiring vascular access, nearly a quarter have Difficult Intravenous access (DIVA), a source of multiple punctures. The increased risk of haematomas, haemorrhages, infection, pain and associated trauma is responsible for increased human costs and economic impact.\nTo limit the risks posed by the DIVA, practitioners have solutions such as the per-bone line, other types of lines, and placement of peripheral venous catheter with ultrasound or transluminescence. However, these solutions are not always applicable, depending on the care situation (non-substitutable venous access, fragile patient, etc.) or on the technical platform (available personnel and training, configuration of the premises, available equipment). Moreover, these actions are often taken after failures, in a non-anticipated and non-consensual manner.\nIn order to assess the risk of DIVA, F.Van Loon et al developed in 2016, and then modified in 2018, a DIVA Scale (the A-DIVA Scale) which allows a rapid scoring upstream of peripheral venous catheter placement to classify patients according to the risk of DIVA.\nComposed of five items (non-palpable and non-visible vein, diameter < 3mm, history of DIVA, operator experience) worth one point each, the score allows three categories to be established: low risk, moderate risk, high risk. The study showed that the proportion of first puncture failures increased with the risk of the patients (defined according to the categorized score).\nThe use of a tool such as the A-DIVA Scale is of interest if it allows the definition of actions to be taken in relation to the risk it identifies. In view of this, it appears essential to optimize the management of peripheral venous catheters, particularly for patients with DIVAs. The aim of this study is to develop a graduate and specific response to the issue of multiple punctures. Our project is to create and evaluate a specific algorithm, consisting of a risk assessment (the A-DIVA Scale) and a co-construct decision-making tree (the A-DIVA Tool).

Surgery is the primary treatment for PTC, and occult lymph node metastasis is not uncommon (20%-80%).The lymph node metastasis of PTC is mostly along the lymphatic drainage path station by station, and most of the first metastasis is to the central lymph node. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association recommendation, prophylactic central lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with primary T3-4 or cN1b without central lymph node involvement. However, PTC with primary site T1-2, no external invasion and cN0 could not be dissected by central lymph node.Previous studies have suggested that prophylactic dissection should be performed to improve disease-specific survival, reduce local recurrence, improve recurrence risk and treatment response assessment, and help RAI decision making. Although routine prophylactic central lymph node dissection may detect occult lymph node metastasis, the need for further dissection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid gland may lead to an increased incidence of complications, while its effect on reducing the risk of recurrence and improving prognosis is unclear, and the impact on long-term outcomes may be small.Previous retrospective studies in our institution have shown that routine central neck dissection does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence.

Children with hearing deficits also indicate behavioral problems related to impulse control, distraction, and disability to maintain attention in the visual modality. Hearing deficit is mostly defined as a communication deficit. Although the communication deficit is an important disorder, hearing deficit co-occurs with other physical impairments such as vestibular disorders. Development and control of the posture are important prerequisites for skill motor function. Children with hearing deficits and impaired sensory organization had weak balance and motor efficiency in many fields. Various studies on motor skills in deaf children have reported deficits in balance, general dynamic coordination, visual-motor skills, ball catching ability, and some disturbances in reaction time and speed of movements.

        "summary": "INTRODUCTION A variety of bone grafts and substitutes are available for filling bone defects in the distal radius after corrective osteotomy, but the harvesting of bone from the iliac crest is the gold standard as it allows easy access to corticocancellous bone of a desirable quality and quantity. The idea behind bone grafting is to provide optimal bone formation and structural stability, which is crucial for bone healing. However, the harvesting and use of bone from the iliac crest potentially comes with the risk of complications such as delayed union of the osteotomy defect; size mismatch between the graft and the osteotomy defect; longer operation time; donor site morbidity including nerve, arterial, and ureteral injury; herniation of abdominal contents; sacroiliac joint instability; pelvic fractures; hematoma and infection. As these disadvantages of bone grafting can have a major impact on patients' everyday lives, research is needed on whether bone grafting is genuinely necessary during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation of the distal radius\nOBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to investigate whether harvested bone graft from the iliac crest necessary is during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation in patients with malunited distal radius fractures.\nSTUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study.

Moreover, due to the lack of early diagnostic marker, most patients with HCC are often diagnosed in an advanced stage with poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further understand the possible aetiological factors and surgical treatment methods to improve the prognosis of patients with HCC. Liver transplantation is an ideal choice for patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC, which can significantly improve the postoperative survival rate. But the most serious problem facing such patients is the shortage of donor livers.

With the significant increase in long-term survival and increasing age of transplant patients, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, such as those caused by dyslipidemia, have become a major cause of transplant organ failure and recipient death. However, the causes of dyslipidemia after organ transplantation, as well as the effects and mechanisms of dyslipidemia on transplant rejection, are unknown.\nPrevious studies have found that 1. increased lipid levels occur in recipients after heart transplantation; 2. during rejection, hepatic PCSK9 expression is increased in recipients; 3. a high-fat environment increases the immunoreactivity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is suggested that PCSK9-lipid disorder-immune cell interactions may be associated with the development of transplant rejection.\nIn this project, we propose to (1) establish a long-term follow-up system for postoperative cardiac transplantation patients in our department to track the characteristics of lipid changes in transplantation patients, to clarify the link between dyslipidemia and rejection, and to provide a strong evidence-based medical basis for the management of lipids during the perioperative period and in the postoperative period; (2) expand the dimensions of lipid-related assays under the support of the above system, and to incorporate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic research methods to elucidate transplantation rejection in a multidimensional manner. (ii) Expanding the dimensions of lipid-related assays to include transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies to elucidate the relationship between PCSK9 and dyslipidemia in transplant patients; (iii) Adopting single-cell sequencing technology to deeply reveal the potential mechanism by which changes in lipids affect T-cell-mediated rejection of cardiac transplants.

Half of people older than 50 years of age will suffer from hemorrhoids in a period of their life, of which only 5-10% will require surgical intervention while most of the remainders become asymptomatic and improved with the conservative treatment.\nConservative treatment in the form of diet modification as well as some medical treatment, is usually effective. On the other hand, a few patients require surgical intervention. Surgery is indicated for those not responding to conservative management, those with grade III, and grade IV hemorrhoids.\nSurgical treatment is the only curative method for hemorrhoidal disease and indicated for advanced and complicated disease. The most radical operations with the best results are the Milligan-Morgan and Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy .\nHowever, the major concern of hemorrhoidectomy is the post-operative pain that occurs in 20-40 % of patients and it is considered the main cause of refusing surgery. The cause of postoperative pain is multifactorial, including the type of anesthesia , hemorrhoidectomy technique. and spasm of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) that becomes exposed after hemorrhoidectomy. The spasm of the IAS is considered the target to relieve pain post operatively. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is widely used as an adjunct to relieve pain post hemorrhoidectomy as it release the spasm of the sphincter and subsequently relieve pain. However, this procedure is not accepted by many surgeons due to its recorded complications as bleeding and mild degree of fecal incontinence, so its role following hemorrhoidectomy is still controversial.\nOn the other hand, the spasm of the anal sphincter can be abolished by injection of the botulinum toxin which acts on the acetylcholine receptor and consequently temporary muscle paralysis occurs that is followed by decreased pain and wound healing.\nOur hypothesis is botulinum toxin relaxes the internal sphincter, so prevent its spasm and so reducing the pain and promoting wound healing more rapidly.",

Ruxolitinib is a type of medication called a kinase inhibitor. It works by blocking the signals of cells that cause inflammation and cell proliferation, which may help prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Tacrolimus is a drug used to help reduce the risk of rejection by the body of organ and bone marrow transplants by suppressing the immune system. Methotrexate stops cells from making DNA, may kill cancer cells, and also suppress the immune system, which may reduce the risk of GVHD.

He estimates that the prevalence of disability among women is 60% higher than that of men.\nDisabled women coexist in a dual state of vulnerability where being a woman and being a disabled person have two social disadvantages. Among people with disabilities, women with disabilities (WWD) have higher unmet healthcare needs than women without disabilities.\nCancer is an important public health problem and cause of death all over the world. Among the most common cancers in women; breast, uterine corpus, ovarian and cervix cancers are seen to be prominent, respectively. It is known that with regular examinations and screenings, early diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer increases the chance of treatment.\nInternational studies show that women face barriers and difficulties in accessing reproductive health and cancer screening services. In studies, it was stated that especially women with disabilities living in rural areas had lower mammography and Pap-smear tests compared to women without disabilities. In recent years, the Health Belief Model has been used frequently to examine the effect of health beliefs on cancer screening behaviors in women and to increase screening rates. The model explains the beliefs and attitudes that affect individuals' behaviors. According to the model; If a person has a desire to prevent illness or a belief in recovery, he recommends taking a specific health action to prevent illness as a positive behavior. It was emphasized that nurses have important roles and responsibilities in the protection and development of health, and that they can identify individuals with disabilities who are considered fragile, and provide health education and counseling to these groups. It is thought that the disabled-friendly accessible health care practices under the guidance of the Health Belief Model will bring the preventive health care behavior of women with disabilities to the desired level.\nDisabled women experience inequalities in benefiting from routine health services and health screening services in special areas such as reproductive health and protection from women's cancers. Being diagnosed with cancer is undoubtedly devastating for anyone. For this reason, it becomes more important to raise awareness about the prevention, prevention, early diagnosis and development of a healthy lifestyle in women with physical disabilities, and to encourage health-seeking behaviors.",

        "summary": "Rationale: Osteoarthritis (OA) is mainly characterized by cartilage degeneration. In knee OA, measuring the distance between the tibia and femur, known as the joint space width (JSW), is an often-used method to quantify the progression of the disease or the effectiveness of treatments, because it is an indirect measure of cartilage degeneration. However, JSW is often measured while the patient is standing (weight-bearing) with slightly flexed knees, with a flexion angle of around 7-10 degrees, while direct cartilage thickness measurements are usually performed while the patient is lying down (non-weight-bearing) with an extended leg [1]. Because of this difference in positioning, it is difficult to compare different JSW and cartilage thickness measures, as it is not clear what happens with the JSW distribution in the joint when a patient changes position between weight-bearing/non-weight-bearing and flexion/extension. In this study, we aim to identify the changes that occur in the knee of OA patients under the influence of weight-bearing and/or flexion, to enable comparing joint space measures from different positions. In this research we want to use MRI as a three-dimensional imaging technique because there is no radiation involved..\nObjective: To evaluate how the 3D knee joint space distribution in knee OA patients changes under the influence of weight-bearing (upright) and flexion MRI scanning.\nStudy design: Explorative cross-sectional study.

Dysphagia intervention in the United States involves evaluation at onset of dysphagia symptoms followed by short-term therapy. Traditional therapy relies on verbal instruction and low-tech at-home exercise regimens without visual biofeedback; lacking a monitoring of accuracy or strength of exercise. Available biofeedback is office-based, bulky and expensive, thus, not readily used. The Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) is a well-researched office based biofeedback system that has recently been converted into an affordable and accessible home-based application. This study aims to investigate the impact of swallowing therapy using the BiSSKit app on airway protective outcomes in patients with PD. Thirty participants with PD and dysphagia will be recruited for this study. Participants will undergo a baseline-modified barium swallowing (MBS) evaluation followed by 12 weekly sessions of swallowing therapy. Participants will be randomized to two swallowing therapy groups (1) traditional (2) BiSSKit app. Participants will undergo MBS following therapy completion.

The optimal selection of the potency and duration of antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in HBR patients is still a matter of debate. Multiple strategies to reduce bleeding during secondary prevention, such as reducing the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, using single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor, or de-escalating to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor, have been proposed. De-escalation to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor is particularly attractive because it maintains efficient pharmacological inhibition of multiple platelet pathways while potentially reducing bleeding through less aggressive activity. Yet, there has been no study comparing the effects of different de-escalation strategies with the standard potent P2Y12 inhibitors in HBR patients. The aim of the DESC-HBR study is to assess the impact of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor to clopidogrel 75mg, prasugrel 5mg or ticagrelor 60mg bid in HBR patients, in comparison with full-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitors, on the proportion of patients with optimal platelet reactivity (OPR).

FASD is completely preventable if women do not drink during pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol use frequently co-occurs with other substance use, especially tobacco and cannabis. The adverse effect on birth outcomes by alcohol and tobacco use together is worse than either substance alone. Recent evidence from animal models shows that prenatal exposure to both cannabinoids and alcohol potentiate the likelihood of alcohol-induced birth defects.\nData from Cape Metropole, SA, showed that all women who reported prenatal alcohol use also tested positive for tobacco use, with 25% also reporting cannabis use. Alcohol use while breastfeeding also occurs at a relatively high rate in SA. Despite tremendous health benefits from breastfeeding,maternal alcohol use while breastfeeding significantly compromises infant development. Contingency management (CM) has been efficacious in reducing prenatal cocaine, alcohol, and tobacco use in the United States (U.S.). The Women's Health CoOp (WHC) is an evidence-based brief intervention addressing women-focused syndemic issues and resulting disparities associated with substance and alcohol use.

For the purpose of support of cardiopulmonary function, the ideal position of the catheter tip is vital with regard to an accurate CVP and hemodynamic monitoring. Cannulation of the axillary vein is ideal for patients with severe poly-trauma because it avoids the thoracic cavity, intercostal arteries, tracheostomy, and clavicle, and is prone to compression even if the artery is injured. At present, there is no systematic introduction of ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization in the trauma ICU in the literature.

Hospital readmissions are an undesirable occurrence that can increase cost for hospitals, and can cause further negative outcomes for patients. Identifying factors that increase a patient's chances of being readmitted to the hospital, as well as developing an intervention to effectively reduce this risk, has historically been challenging.\nOur new method uses a combination of common features such as diagnosis and length of hospital stay, with a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, the RecuR Score model developed by the University of Maryland Medical System, that identifies patients at the highest risk of having an unplanned hospital readmission. Participants identified as higher risk will then be enrolled into our pilot where they will be randomized to receive either the standard of care treatment or an enhanced protocol that includes additional disease education, coordination of home health services, and a focus on their readmission during existing multidisciplinary team huddles.\nThe main goal of this study is to reduce unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of initial discharge, in those most at risk of being readmitted, using the aforementioned novel methods for identifying these participants and a transitional care intervention. This success of this goal will be analyzed across different readmission risk levels in the study population. Secondary goals of this study include reducing unplanned hospital readmission within 90 days, reducing 30-day post-discharge mortality, and reducing 30- and 90-day emergency department (ED) usage after an initial hospitalization.",

The primary outcome of the study was a reduction in unplanned post-discharge hospital admissions within 30 days of discharge. The secondary outcomes included changes in patients' self-efficacy in managing their health, hospital and emergency department utilization, and patient-perceived quality of care.

This procedure is called primary percutaneous coronary intervention (or primary PCI for short).\nAn angiogram is a routine procedure that involves insertion of fine plastic tube (catheter) into either the groin or wrist under local anaesthetic. The tube is passed into the artery in the heart and X-ray pictures are taken to find out if the arteries are blocked. Blocked arteries can usually be opened by passing a small balloon into the artery, via the fine plastic tube followed by placement of a stent (a fine metal coil) into the artery to prevent it from blocking again.\nAlthough this treatment is very successful, it can result in damage to the heart muscle when the artery is opened. Cooling the entire body has been shown to reduce heart muscle damage during heart attacks in some patients but not in others; however, it is uncomfortable due to the shivering, expensive and can result in delays in opening the blocked artery.\nThe investigators are conducting a series of research studies to find out if cooling the heart muscle directly through the catheter being used for the normal primary angioplasty treatment using room temperature may be effective in preserving heart muscle, without the shortcomings of entire body cooling.\nThe investigators have already published an initial series of ten cases in which this treatment appeared to be feasible without causing significant clinical problems.\nThe present study is a pilot study designed to assess the rate of patient recruitment and feasibility of this new treatment while exploring some detailed outcomes measuring the restoration of blood flow within the coronary artery at the end of the procedure.\nUltimately if the present pilot study is successful, the investigators plan to go on to undertake a much larger randomised outcome study to determine definitively whether this treatment can help reduce heart attack size.",

Women with a history of depression have a 20 fold higher risk of PDA at subsequent pregnancies. The adverse outcomes extend beyond maternal well-being to long-term deficits in children and families. The gut-brain axis is a newly recognized key player in mental health disorders.

The retrospective study examined 1,192 women who underwent IVF with the first treatment cycle using follitropin delta in a high dose in combination with hCG regimens.

The intervention is delivered to focal children by their classroom peer mediators, children who, as a group, have received training and support from a teacher facilitator to deliver the intervention during the classroom center time. The key components of the intervention are the identification and selection criteria for peer mediators, the training of peer mediators, and the ongoing support of peer mediators delivered by teacher facilitators. Teacher facilitators are trained during a one-on-one 1-h training session after being identified by their teachers and school psychologists.

Although SCLC is relatively sensitive to chemotherapy, it is highly susceptible to recurrence. The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the clinical practice of oncology, and the newly released results of the ASTRUM-005 study have led to the incorporation of Serplulimab into the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC. Although immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is currently the most promising regimen, due to the limited understanding of genetic alterations and the marked genetic heterogeneity of SCLC, treatment responsiveness varies greatly. Thus, there is an urgent need to find molecular biomarkers that can effectively predict prognosis and further suggest the effectiveness of this new treatment mode.\nMinimal residual disease (MRD) refers to the presence of tumor cells disseminated from the primary lesion to distant organs in patients who lack any clinical or radiological signs of metastasis or residual tumor cells left behind after local therapy that eventually lead to local recurrence. These years, the development of real-time, high-sensitivity liquid biopsy assays have enabled the identification of MRD in individual patients with cancer. Multiple studies have demonstrated that detection of MRD dynamics following definitive therapy for solid cancers is strongly prognostic and has extremely high positive predictive value for risk of recurrence and treatment efficacy.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the predictive value of MRD dynamics on disease prognosis before and after the first-line treatment of Serplulimab in combination with chemotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC.",

This can result in feeding intolerance, which is expressed by abdominal distension, regurgitation or vomiting, irregular transit and abdominal discomfort. This feeding intolerance influences the length of hospitalization and can lead to necrotising enterocolitis, a major complication.\nIn the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Clermont-Ferrand hospital center, abdominal massages have been performed by physiotherapists for several years in order to improve the condition of the digestive system. However, the indication for abdominal massage is very dependent on the caregivers in charge of the newborn and the evaluation of the abdominal condition remains subjective with a great variability between examiners. Thus, some newborns will receive massage multiple times a day while others will not.\nDevelopmental care is essential for these premature infants, especially to avoid over-stimulation. It is important not to add care, such as massage, if it is not needed.

        "summary": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective approach for treating both benign and malignant blood disorders. It primarily involves high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate tumor cells within the patient's body, as well as to suppress the recipient's hematopoiesis and immune function. The transplantation replaces the recipient's original hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with donor-derived HSCs, thereby reconstructing the donor's hematopoietic and immune functions to achieve disease cure.\nPoor graft function (PGF) following transplantation, which refers to inadequate engraftment of the transplanted hematopoietic stem cells, is one of the major factors limiting the effectiveness of allo-HSCT. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), identified within the bone marrow stroma, are a type of non-hematopoietic multipotent stem cells. Several studies, including previous research by our research team, suggest that MSCs can improve the bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment by secreting various cytokines. This leads to the promotion of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, enhancement of hematopoietic function, and support for hematopoiesis as well as direct or indirect promotion of vascular regeneration in damaged tissues and organs.\nTherefore, exploring the efficacy of umbilical cord-derived MSCs in treating poor graft function after allo-HSCT, observing the recovery of blood parameters in patients with poor engraftment, monitoring transplantation-related complications and immune reconstitution, and conducting preliminary investigations into the underlying mechanisms can contribute to the exploration of new clinical techniques for the treatment of PGF following allo-HSCT.",

It is one of the most significant causes of orofacial pain, along with dental pain. In TMD syndrome, the cause of pain is often due to overloading of the masticatory muscles rather than primary changes in the joints themselves.\nNowadays, doctors who treat patients with TMD have no doubt that one of the very important etiological factors of this condition is psycho-emotional disorders (excessive nervous excitability, anxiety, depression), which has been confirmed by numerous authors of studies on this subject [4-11].\nThe etiology of TMD is complex and multifactorial. Numerous factors may also contribute to the development of the disorder. An important factor affecting the state of masticatory function is an increase in stress levels (psycho-emotional tension). Structures such as the hypothalamus, reticular formation and limbic system have a decisive influence on the emotional state of each patient The activity of the limbic system, which governs the emotions of adults, and the additional connections of the gamma loops to the masticatory muscles, determine that increased emotional tension translates into a significant increase in the contractile activity of the masticatory muscles.\nTMD and functional disorder of the masticatory muscles are the most common complaint of the patients, seeking treatment in dental office. The two main symptoms of TMD problems are pain and dysfunction. Myalgia -the most common cause is an increased level of muscle use. It is related to vasocontraction of relevant arteries and accumulation of metabolic waste product in the muscles. Activities such as daytime clenching of the teeth and bruxism, habits of chewing gum, biting lips, finger nails or cheeks are factors that cause significant strain on the masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joints.",

        "summary": "Allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis affect more than 25% of the world population and are the leading cause of illness in children. The complex interplay between genetic, environmental and immunological risk factors results in the manifestation of allergic diseases . The pathological presentation of allergic disease involves the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in a multifaceted response in specific target tissues such as the airways . This response results in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to target tissues and the production of specific IgE antibodies, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators [11], [12]. It is well established that allergic inflammation triggers neuronal dysfunction, which activates specific inflammatory mechanisms, potentially leading to structural changes in the diseased tissue . Neurotrophins are a family of structurally related proteins initially discovered to be involved in regulating neuronal development and now known to govern both peripheral and central nerve growth.\nBDNF is a secretory protein belonging to the neurotrophin family and is involved in a range of neural processes during human development [19], [20]. In the early stages of development BDNF is essential for neurogenesis, survival and maturation of neuronal pathways. In the adult, alongside neurotransmitters, hormones and other neurotrophins, BDNF maintains synaptic plasticity, dendritic growth and the consolidation of long-term memory. The biological effect of BDNF is mediated via its binding to the trkB receptor. The activation of these receptors on eosinophils may be important in regulating the inflammatory cascade leading to allergic disease [15], [24]. Neurotrophin mediated activation of bronchial eosinophils might therefore play a role in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation in allergic asthma .\nThe BDNF gene is located on chromosome 11p13 and is alternatively spliced resulting in several different transcripts [26]. Genetic polymorphisms in BDNF have been associated with allergic phenotypes such atopic dermatitis [27] and asthma [28], [29], [30], [31] in different populations. The functional polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met) has been shown to regulate intracellular trafficking and affect the secretion of BDNF [32]. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that is expressed in the glandular, nasal epithelium, and peripheral nerves in the nasal mucosa, has been shown to induce biochemical and structural changes in nerves that can lead to hyper-responsiveness [33], [34], [35] The biological effects of neurotrophins are mediated by binding either to the high-affinity tyrosine kinase (trk) receptors or to the low-affinity receptors known as pan-neurotrophin receptor p-75.",

Furthermore, normal aging is associated with decline in cognitive functioning.

A mental health service system that is guided by a rehabilitation and recovery perspective places emphasis on treating the consequences of the illness rather than just the illness per se, and on empowering people to regain control of their identity and life, and to have hope for the future. Within this philosophy, mental health policies in several countries advocate for the introduction of peer workers in mental health services, people with lived experience of mental health issues and recovery, who are employed to use their lived experience to support those who access mental health services. However, more effectiveness and implementation research is needed. Evidence also suggests that the period following hospital discharge is of high risk of treatment dropout for people with serious mental illness, thus interrupting their recovery process. Therefore, this vulnerable population may particularly benefit from more targeted interventions during this transitional period.\nThe research project will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and implementation of the Critical Time Intervention-Peer Support model, a recovery-oriented based model for people with serious mental illness discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities in Portugal.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) is the first-line imaging test in patients with suspected obstructive CAD. However, in most patients, cCTA shows non-obstructive CAD. The management of patients with non-obstructive CAD is unclear. This is due to the lack of cCTA-based methods capable to assess the risk of disease progression towards developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) based on the atherosclerosis characteristics of each patient. A solution for prognostication in these patients is particularly appealing since it could allow to identify patients who can benefit of a more aggressive medical treatment and management, thus improving outcome.\nProposed methods, which include qualitative evaluations such as the identification of adverse atherosclerotic plaque characteristics or quantitative evaluations such as the quantification of atherosclerotic plaque burden, may in some cases suffer of limited reproducibility between operators and software. Most importantly, each single biomarker is insufficient to accurately predict patient risk, hence potential synergic integration of cCTA and clinical biomarkers is the key to efficiently guide the personalization of patient's management.

The PACHA program uses information in video form to help breast cancer survivors understand the things they can do to take their AET regularly. The video information is given to them by other women who have learned about their AET after going through the same situation. The PACHA program also teaches them about things that could happen, and show them ways of dealing with things like having side effects or feeling bad about themselves. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the PACHA program. The authors want to see if giving video information is helpful in making sure the AET medicine is taken, as planned. They also want to figure out how to give video information in the best way possible. This means that there will be two parts to the PACHA program, the first being for pharmacists and the second for the women. Women will have more information given to them in the form of a video web page and emails. These emails will be sent to women who are using the PACHA program, and the women will be able to use the PACHA program in the first 6 months after their AET starts. The authors think that the PACHA program will help women take their medicine regularly. They are also using an online questionnaire and interviews to get more detailed feedback from the people who are part of the study.

        "summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that often results in motor and/or cognitive impairment. Epidemiologically, the onset occurs between the ages of 20 and 40, with a peak around the age of 30.\nMS is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of signs and symptoms, both in terms of the neurological systems involved and the degree of impairment and severity. The most common symptoms include, among others, difficulty walking and lack of balance. The lack of stability and coordination reduces independence and mobility, predisposing people with MS to accidental falls and compromising mobility in daily life. Another symptom that characterises MS is cognitive impairment, which mainly alters information processing speed and short- and long-term memory. MS-related cognitive impairment is detectable at every stage of the disease. Very often, people with MS have co-existing cognitive and motor deficits, which add to the complexity of managing MS. In order to address this condition, a treatment strategy that combines cognitive and motor rehabilitation needs to be identified. Despite the increasing availability of effective drug therapies that may impact on balance, rehabilitation is a very important means to counteract the progression of disability and improve physical function, affecting social participation and improving quality of life. In recent years, rehabilitation makes use of various robotic devices, which are based on repeatable, intense and motivating exercises, integrated with an enriched virtual environment, capable of improving the quality of movement. In light of the literature, which mainly focuses on robotic therapy for walking, this pilot study aims to evaluate the effects of a specific robotic treatment for balance in MS patients.\nThe primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT) on static balance.\nThe secondary objective is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT)\non dynamic balance and walking (assessed with clinical and instrumental scales)\non fatigue and cognitive performance in terms of sustained attention, dual-task cost and cognitive-motor interference;\non quality of life.",

The basic profile in the Emergency ward always has these two parameters. The algorithm automatically identifies patients with a predicted probability of TMA >90% (6); if this criterion is associated with a platelet count<100 x 109/L, an automated warning to the hematologist on-call is issued with an SMS, and the patient enters the TMA diagnostic process defined in the diagnostic and treatment pathways (Percorso Diagnostico e Terapeutico Assistensiale, PDTA). The on-duty hematologist urgently evaluates the patient for whom a warning has been issued, relating with the clinician(s) of the ward in which the patient is located. If the suspicion of TMA is confirmed, the diagnostic procedures outlined in the PDTA are performed, with the immediate execution of 2nd level tests. If the on-duty hematologist considers the diagnosis of aHUS possible, they contact the on-call Nephrologist directly for immediate diagnostic investigation and specific urgent therapeutic measures, as needed. The TMA-expert Hematologist and/or TMA-expert Nephrologist is notified as soon as possible by the on-duty hematologist of all cases, both highly suspected and uncertain, and follow up all patients to complete the diagnostic workup to confirm or rule out the diagnosis and implement the appropriate clinical measures.\nTherefore, the treatment in smaller hospitals that do not have a 24-hour hematological guard service available and the same awareness for TMA.\nThe present study aims to validate these results by testing the system in a multicenter study involving centers with different availability of the hematologist and awareness for TMA.",

SCI severely impacts functional independence & ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Greater function is typically lost with higher, more complete injuries. More specifically, those impacted above C5-C7 have impaired upper extremities, which limits the use of arms and hands for activities such as eating, drinking, and grooming.

Although most verrucae will disappear spontaneously, many patients do seek treatment. Current wart treatments do not target the cause of the lesion directly, resulting in variable treatment efficacies and high wart recurrence rates. AV2 is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, that is capable of deactivating HPV. It is however not able to destruct the already infected cells, which raises the need for an additional ablative treatment i.e. salicylic acid (SA). Implementation of AV2-Salicylic acid (AV2-SA) combination therapy would ensure permanent lesion clearance by on the one hand inactivation of HPV by AV2, and on the other hand elimination of the lesion by SA treatment. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of AV2-SA treatment versus standard SA treatment, by comparing cure and recurrence rates of cutaneous warts between the two treatment groups (at 12 weeks and six months after randomization). The second aim is to assess the safety and tolerability of AV2-SA therapy. The third aim is to identify subgroups of cutaneous warts that have favorable response to treatment, by comparing cure rates in an HPV genotype-specific manner. This randomized controlled trial will enroll 260 participants with cutaneous warts who will either receive the AV2-SA combination therapy or SA control treatment.

        "summary": "Despite technical advances in Medically Assisted Reproduction (AMP), the success of fertility treatments is sometimes limited by embryo implantation failure. The coordinated development of the embryo and the uterine endometrium requires close communication between the maternal tissue and the embryo. In in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo transfer generally takes place between the 2nd (D2) and the 6th (D6) day following oocyte fertilization. Recent studies have shown the advantages of sequential transfer (transfer of an embryo on D2/D3 followed by the transfer of another embryo on D5/D6), with higher implantation and clinical pregnancy rate, fewer miscarriages, more live births, and yet no increase in multiple pregnancies. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommendations continue to prioritize the transfer of a single embryo for all patients aged under 38. To improve pregnancy rates for patients having a single embryo transferred, the study investigators wish to carry out on blank transfer, based on the principle of sequential transfer. The study investigators hypothesize that a culture medium, placed in the uterus before the time of embryo transfer, will modify immune tolerance. The study will test whether transferring the same culture medium in an equivalent quantity as during the real transfer into the uterus 2/3 days before the embryo transfer will improve tolerance to this foreign medium and, therefore, embryo implantation. The aim of this study is thus to evaluate the impact of a blank transfer with culture medium alone, on the results of frozen embryo transfers (FET) from IVF.",

This may be explained by the prolonged sitting time, next to reduced level of physical activity. Young people spend most of their time in a sitting position while studying (in school class, during homework) and using electronic devices (using the computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablets, or watching TV), and now using e-learning methods. E-learning, and thus prolonged sitting, is a topic that returned to higher education at the beginning of the 2022-2023 academic year because of the current energy crisis. Re-education on sitting posture is a common aspect of LBP management. Physiotherapists recommend many different sitting positions to prevent and treat the negative effects of prolonged sitting. However, there is debate regarding what is an optimal sitting posture. Studies showed that sitting posture with the backrest on the chair induced minimal changes in lumbar lordosis and significantly lesser pain compared to other types of the chair. Even though the sitting posture will be followed by proper ergonomic principles, every position (lordotic or kyphotic) maintained for a prolonged time leads to discomfort and soft tissue symptoms. Studies showed that body perceived discomfort scores increased over time during sitting and after 30 min of sitting is significantly greater than those at baseline. Currently, breaks are recommended for mitigating the adverse of prolonged sitting, but more evidence is needed to verify effectiveness of breaks. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of active break on reduce LBP and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young people with LBP.
