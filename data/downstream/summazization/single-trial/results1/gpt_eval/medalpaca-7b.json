        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",

A group I and group II of 30 patients each were formed from the sampled patients. For the patients in group I, a bed with a cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was used. For the patients in group II, a viscoelastic mattress was used. The data of the study were collected with the ''Patient Identification Form'', ''Braden Scale'', ''Pressure Wound Observation Form'' and ''Wound Measurement Chart''. Number-percentage distributions, Chi-square, Fisher's Exact Probability Test and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to evaluate the data.\nImplications for Clinical Practice: It was determined that the support surface used affected the pressure sore size and the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature created smaller sized wounds in the sacrum, trochanter, malleolus and heel regions.

Affecting approximately 2.5 million individuals around the world and seen mostly in young adults, MS can cause different levels of disability in functional activities, cause limitations in social and professional life, and impair quality of life. Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that develops on the basis of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Nutritional habits and physical activity are important environmental factors. These can be effective in the course of MS and change the quality of life. Compatibility of nutrition with the Mediterranean diet and providing adequate physical activity may be beneficial in increasing physical and mental well-being in general, and therefore the quality of life of the person.\nIn our country, there is not enough information about the ongoing nutritional habits and physical activity levels of MS patients in their daily lives, and quality of life studies are limited. Our limited knowledge on these issues narrows the possibility of movement in an area that can be corrected in MS patients and thus have a positive impact on their quality of life.

The prevalence of OAB with bothersome complaints is around 11% in women and 9% in men with an increasing incidence with age. OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed. Depending on the patient's characteristics and the physician's preference intravesical injections of Botox or the implantation of a sacral neuromodulator (SNM) can be considered.\nBoth options are equal and effective, but many individual differences exist in preference. Regarding outcome, some factors have been described to prefer one therapy above the other, for example in case of concomitant fecal incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections,\u2026 The personal preference of doctors and patients has been investigated, but currently no study has focused on therapy preference in a culturally and linguistic divers (CALD) population. The latter broadly describes a population with ethnical, cultural, religious and/or language characteristics and is a general accepted measure of diversity.\nIn the current study, the investigators aim to describe the different (dis)advantages of both second line treatments for OAB in a discrete choice experiment. The study population will consist of a diverse group of patients with OAB from different hospitals. The goal is to investigate if CALD patients make a different choice in treatment and what factors contribute to that decision in order to provide more tailored information regarding the treatment options in the future. Taking a patient's context into account in the shared decision making between a patient and physician increases therapy compliance and satisfaction of the chosen treatment.\nThe total questionnaire will consist out of general demographic info, the EQ-5D, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)-OAB and the discrete choice questionnaire in which patients make a choice between two fictional treatment options consisting of a combination of different therapy characteristics.

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

But this was also statistically insignificant. However, no major difference in the overall results between the Mishra and Millard rotationadvancement repairs. Thus, either technique could be used for unilateral clefts, as the goal of cleft lip repair is making a symmetrical lip with minimal scar restoring the normal appearance of the face and functional anatomy Anthropometric Measurement of surgical outcome evaluates the surgical technique used and helps to compare between cleft and non-cleft side showing the degree of deformity and we used Subjective assessment to analyse facial aesthetics and appearance impairment as the harmony of a person's face is as Important as measurements, so they should be used together in our opinion.",

        "summary": "Diverticular disease is a common condition in western countries with relatively uncommon complications[1]. Fistulae complicating diverticulitis are the result of a localized perforation into adjacent viscera, and occur in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease[2]. The types of fistulae include colovesical, colovaginal, colotubal, coloenteric, and colocutaneous fistulae[3]. Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely, accounting for 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease[4]. Herein we describe a case of a fistula connecting the sigmoid colon with the left flank-lower lumbar area, due to diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon[5].\nA new over-the-scope clip system, called OTSC (Ovesco Endoscopy, T\u00fcbingen, Germany), appeared on the market about 3 years ago[6]. The system consists of a nitinol clip loaded at the tip of the endoscope that can capture a large amount of tissue and compress the lesion until healed[7]. Results from animal models and initial clinical use support the efficacy of OTSC closure in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding; its role in the management of iatrogenic perforations in humans is less defined, and reports on its use in treating colorectal postsurgical leaks and fistulas are anecdotal [8]. Here we report on the use of OTSC in the endoscopic treatment of colo-cutaneous fistula as acomplication of acute diverticultis .",

Because these patients generally have favorable outcomes no matter the kind of treatment, reducing side effects should be a priority when choosing their treatment.\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate whether a new blood test called a Circulating Tumor DNA test (ctDNA test) can decrease the number of people that require radiation after surgery. This blood test is often elevated in people when they are diagnosed with head and neck cancer. There are studies that show that cancer most often returns when this blood test is positive after treatment. This study will test patients' blood before and after surgery. In cases where the test is negative after surgery, people on the study will not receive radiation unless they are considered high risk based on surgery findings.

        "summary": "In intensive care unit, dyspnea, the distressing and fearful awareness of breathing, is frequent and harmful. To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

        "summary": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the commonest nerve compression syndrome in the upper limbs, and carpal tunnel decompression is one of the most prevalent upper limb surgical interventions. Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients. That is why we conducted the present study to present our experience with the modified mini-incision technique and compare its outcomes to the conventional open approach.",

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine",

Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH.

During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

Around 80% of the patients who present with a colon cancer and is in a condition where surgery is possible will be offered resection of the tumor. A part of the colon is always removed together with the lymph nodes in order to ensure that cancer cells are not left behind. The risk of lymph node metastasis is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. The overall risk of lymph node metastases is less than 20 % in patients with early colon cancer. This indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer have no benefit of additional resection besides local tumor excision. The alternative to resecting a larger part of the bowel is to make more focused surgery only resecting a small part of the bowel part through a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. This new organ sparing approach is called Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS). The investigators aimed to examinate the hypothesis that organ preserving approach (CELS) provides superior quality of recovery in elderly frail patients with small colon cancers when compared with standard surgery in RCT.",

The study is open-label as both participants and researchers are aware of the treatment, necessary due to the differing tastes of the solutions. Two centers, Royal Brompton Hospital in London and Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham, will conduct the research.\nBefore starting the treatment, participants will undergo various assessments, including questionnaires to measure quality of life and treatment satisfaction, sputum/throat swab collection, lung clearance index, forced oscillation technique, electrical impedance tomography, and lung ultrasound. Once these assessments are completed, participants will take the assigned treatment at home, administered twice daily for 12 months, with monthly follow-ups regarding difficulties and chest infections. After 12 months, the treatment will cease, and participants will repeat the assessments.\nSignificance: This research will provide valuable insights into the efficacy of nebulised hypertonic saline for individuals with neuromuscular disease or cerebral palsy, potentially aiding both patients and doctors in making informed treatment decisions.\nDissemination: The study's findings will be shared through publication in scientific journals and presentation at conferences.",

        "summary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",

To do this, the tracheal cannula is first unblocked, so that patients no longer breathe in and out through the cannula, but (at least partially) passing the cannula by the natural route. In the presence of tracheal stenosis there is increased breathing effort, possibly restlessness and stridor. This constellation of symptoms suggests the suspicion of tracheal stenosis, so in the next step a tracheoscopy is performed to confirm or exclude tracheal stenosis. In case of symptomatic tracheal stenosis and at least 30-50% stenosis of the trachea (clinical symptoms can be expected from a 30-50% stenosis) then appropriate therapy (here: cryotherapy, other techniques only in exceptional cases) is planned. The goal is to be able to remove the tracheal cannula (long term) after successful therapy, so that patients do not have to be permanently provided with a tracheal cannula. There is no definitive/evidence-based standard therapy for the treatment of tracheal stenosis.

Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.\nThe research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.\nThe study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care.

The CHI SJC program has not been studied to determine program effectiveness. The investigators intend to follow families and their children until the children in the study graduate from high-school or turn 19 years of age.\nThe study, as a template, uses the eight outcome domains listed and described in the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness website (http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/outcomes.aspx). These eight domains are:\nChild development and school readiness\nFamily economic self-sufficiency\nMaternal health\nReductions in child maltreatment\nChild health\nLinkages and referrals\nPositive parenting practices\nReductions in juvenile delinquency, family violence, and crime\nThe investigators expect to observe significant differences among the two groups with respect to the primary outcome domains listed.

        "summary": "Malaria is a major public health problem. There were around 240 million cases of malaria and 627,000 deaths worldwide in 2020. Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

        "summary": "Background: Following acute brain injury (ABI), patients are monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) where providers rely on frequent neurological examinations (neurochecks) to assess for neurodeterioration. Serial neurochecks are part of guideline recommendations, but there is equipoise between hourly (Q1) and every-other-hour (Q2) evaluation. In the ICU, care-related awakenings occur frequently, but it is unclear if differential neurocheck frequencies result in differential sleep, providing the scientific premise for this proposal.\nPopulation: Twenty-two patients (N=11 per group) who have undergone elective aneurysm coiling will be enrolled. On post-operative day (POD) 0, patients will be screened and approached for informed consent if they do not meet exclusion criteria, e.g., prior intracranial injury, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, mechanical ventilation. Patients with elective aneurysm coiling are being chosen because they require ICU level of care following their intracranial procedure, but do not have structural brain injury or ongoing sedation needs that might impact sleep measurements.\nMethods: Usual care: Patients are monitored every 15-30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-procedure, then Q1 or Q2 for up to 24 hours. If these patients remain stable, they are discharged home on post-operative day (POD) 1. Proposed Intervention: Enrolled patients will be randomized to Q1 or Q2 neurochecks following the institutionally required 6 hours of stable neurological and vascular checks. Once randomized, patients will undergo placement of electroencephalogram (EEG) with video, electrooculogram, and chin lead.

        "summary": "Extranodal extension (ENE) refers to the spread of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) outside the lymph nodes. It is a well-known factor that indicates a poorer prognosis and outcome for patients who have undergone surgical removal of the cancer. In such cases, it is recommended to combine chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery.\nAs the number of cases of HNSCC related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) is increasing, treatment approaches have shifted towards using radiation therapy as the primary treatment method instead of surgery. This raises an important question about the significance of ENE observed through imaging tests (referred to as iENE) and its impact on the prognosis. Unfortunately, this question remains unanswered.\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study across multiple medical institutions. The investigators will gather data including scan results, histopathology reports, and data from patient charts from individuals who have been treated for head and neck cancer. The aim is to analyze and correlate the findings between the pathological evidence of ENE and the imaging results, while also assessing the prognostic value of iENE. Additionally, the investigators will explore the influence of HPV status on these factors.\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, the investigators hope to establish standardized criteria that can assist radiologists in accurately identifying ENE through imaging tests. This research is essential for enhancing our understanding of HNSCC and improving the effectiveness of diagnostic procedures and treatment planning.",

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",

Approaching the different dimensions of PSR calls on a dozen essential components: workload, autonomy, social support, burnout, anxiety, efforts made, rewards, work addiction, investment, etc. a specific questionnaire which usually contains 20 to 30 questions, so that having an overall view of PSR using the current reference questionnaires (Karasek, Siegrist, etc.) represents a total of more than 300 questions. The response time is thus incompatible with current medical practice (passage in the waiting room before the occupational health medical examination) and leads to a majority of non-responses during anonymous questionnaires on the Internet. On the other hand, these validated questionnaires were carried out by different people and are very heterogeneous between them, including in their formulation, so that the respondents have the impression of disorganization and anarchy. There is therefore a need for short, quick and uniform questionnaires. EVAs offer the incredible advantage of meeting these criteria: speed, uniformity, precision. From a data analysis point of view, EVAs also have the advantage of offering a continuous quantitative response, allowing the use of all statistical approaches. If some questionnaires have already been validated in the form of EVA, such as the EVA stress versus the  Perceived Stress Scale  questionnaire (PSS), the EVA workload and EVA autonomy at work versus the Karasek questionnaire, the other reference questionnaires are not yet validated in EVA (burnout, anxiety, efforts / rewards, work addiction, etc.).",

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer is a common digestive tract tumor in China. At present, laparoscopic surgery has become the classic operation of colorectal cancer surgery compared with the traditional open abdominal surgery. Although laparoscopic surgery has many advantages, such as less pain, faster recovery and so on. However, relevant studies have shown that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery, which contribute to significant increases in morbidity, mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption.\nThe incidence of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery has been reported to be between 9% and 40%.\nThe reduction in pulmonary volume and respiratory muscular activation after major abdominal surgery due to surgery-related shallow breathing, pain, long-term bed rest, mucociliary clearance disorder, and diaphragmatic dysfunction may be the main causes of postoperative pulmonary complications.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated physiological improvement related to prone positioning. Prone positioning consists of placing a patient face down. Prone positioning has been used for to improve oxygenation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It has also been applied to non-intubated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), to improve oxygenation and delay or even avoid the need for invasive ventilation. So, the purpose of this study is to observe whether preoperative prone position training can reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.",

However, a number of animal studies have shown that prone positioning can facilitate postoperative ventilation, reduce the pulmonary complications, and shorten the duration of hospital stay.  For laparoscopic colorectal operation, it is well known that abdominal volume compression is a common complication. In previous clinical studies, the lungs compression has been reported in 36.1%~81.5% of patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The purpose of this work is to investigate whether preoperative prone position training can reduce the pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Our main hypothesis is preoperative prone position training can reduce the pulmonary complications after surgery in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

The \u03b2-glucan is identified as a main component of BLEX 404. Not only with therapeutic potential on several types of cancer, BLEX 404 has also shown the potential to improve hematopoiesis, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, and the cytotoxicity activity of immune cells in recent animal studies. Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity. BLEX 404 enhances hematopoiesis by increasing mouse bone marrow cell and human cord blood cell differentiation into granulocytes-macrophages (GMs), granulopoiesis and mobilization of granulocytes, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF production. One related phase I healthy human trial by treating with Maitake D-fraction was examined in Italy. The published data of trial for solid tumor patients was in the year 2003 in Japan, and another for breast cancer patients was in the year 2009 in the United States executed by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).

In the case of rehabilitation of older patients post-COVID-19, we do not know what the course of recovery for these patients will be, and what treatment/approaches will deliver the best outcomes.\nPersons that are recovering from a COVID-19 infection, and admitted on a geriatric ward for early rehabilitation, or geriatric rehabilitation ward or facility, can be included in the study. They will receive routine, usual care; participation in this study will not affect their rehabilitation care. Routine care data will be collected from their electronic patient files at admission to geriatric rehabilitation, and at discharge. This also includes some data about their premorbid status. In addition, study participants will be called six weeks and six months after discharge from rehabilitation and asked some questions about their recovery. There is no risk association with participation in this study. Data will be anonymously collected in an online database.\nThe primary aim of this study is to get insight into the course of recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe. Mainly, we are interested in functioning in activities of daily living (ADL-functioning) such as toileting, bathing, dressing, etc., and in quality of life. The second aim of this study is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organization of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive. Therefore, we collect data on the types of care provided and the professionals involved. Moreover, we collect some patient characteristics such as year of birth, gender, date of admission and date of discharge; and data about complications such as delirium, pain, post-traumatic stress syndrome, hospital readmissions, and mortality. Our hypothesis is that most patients will show recovery during geriatric rehabilitation and in the six months after.

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

These retention systems can be roughly divided into bar-retained implant overdentures, in which multiple implants are splinted and the overdenture is attached through retentive clips, and into retention systems using non-splinted solitary attachments (locators). Evidence on maxillary implant overdenture attachment systems has been mostly short to medium term, non-comparing or retrospective. Even more, 10-years data of comparative studies are lacking.\nMain research question To compare treatment outcomes of fully edentulous patients with maxillary overdentures, supported by four implants, retained by either bars or locators . The primary objective of the study is to analyze marginal bone level changes by radiological assessments at 10-years follow-up. Secondary objectives are implant and overdenture survival, condition of peri- implant mucosa and patients' satisfaction.\nDesign (including population, confounders/outcomes) The study design is an observational study of a group of patients which were treated 10 years ago with dental implants and an overdenture in the maxilla because of problems with retention and stability with their conventional denture. Outcomes: primary outcome is the change in marginal peri-implant bone level 10 years after placing the overdenture.

GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores. Further the modulation of anxiety on the severity of reflux symptoms such as fullness, heartburn and dysphagia is examined.",

It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in this specific population. To this end, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing CAD EYE with CE in patients with LS.",

New and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity.\nThis study looks to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of such a model, using rehabilitation technology to enrich and enhance delivery of rehabilitation within an NHS inpatient stroke unit environment. This model of rehabilitation delivery has already been tested by the research team with community-dwelling participants in the chronic phase of stroke (over a year since stroke) and is known to be feasible and safe. Participants will be recruited from the stroke unit at University Hospital Wishaw during the acute and sub-acute phase of stroke (0-6 months since stroke), if requiring rehabilitation following a stroke and deemed medically fit enough to participate. Participants will be supported to complete activities in a newly dedicated 'technology enriched rehabilitation space' by NHS staff, in addition to their usual treatment. This will enable participants to engage in rehabilitation activities relating to their physical, cognitive, visual, communication and functional goals using equipment such as an adapted treadmill, interactive screens and tablets, upper limb exercise devices, power-assisted gym equipment and virtual reality. All devices are commercially available and known to be safe for use with stroke patients, however the use of such devices within NHS services is currently known to be under-utilised. Data will be obtained through a range of measures to monitor safety (incidence and types of adverse events), adherence (sessions/time attended, movement repetitions) and through interviews with participants, their family/carers, and staff to understand user acceptability.",

Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) is a popular supportive approach among oncology patients and is on the rise. As a response to this demand, there is an understanding that these approaches need to be integrated into cancer care.

In Israel similar trend is observed and 8 integrative oncology services has been established around the country in the majority of oncology centers. Homeopathy is one of the CIM modalities utilized by patients with cancer. It is widely practiced worldwide, especially in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the United States, during the 1990s, sales of homeopathic medicines grew at an annual rate of 20-25%, and in the 2015 US national health statistics report, homeopathy was mentioned as used by over 5 million people.

Boerl (Thymelaeaceae). Proliverenol possesses a hepatoprotective activity via anti-inflammation, DNA repairing, and the antiapoptosis properties. Pre-clinical study of Proliverenol showed that it exerted the hepatoprotective activity through increasing cell survival via: 1) up-regulation of DNA repair enzyme; 2) down-regulation of NF-kB, TNF\u03b1 and caspase-8 expressions, to prevent ALT leakage in HepG2 cells. Proliverenol repressed ALT expression, which could also be significantly important as possible alternative mechanism for increased blood transaminase activities. Caspase-8 pathway seemed to be involved in the molecular pathway rather than directly inducing mitochondrial damage. Taken together, ethanol induced apoptosis through NF-kB-TNF\u03b1-caspase-8 pathway, and Proliverenol protected the cells from the toxicity conditions.",

Besides calendar age, the degree of frailty also associates with increased susceptibility to pneumonia requiring hospitalization.

Recent research has shown Egypt to be the third-largest country globally, with an estimated 52% cesarean sections (3). However, the cesarean section has many serious complications, including the primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (4). During labor, the average blood loss is about 300 to 400 ml. Bleeding postpartum is known as losing over five hundred milliliter of blood following a vaginal birth and losing over one thousand milliliter after the cesarean section (5). The prime cause of maternal death rate is postpartum bleeding, predominately in poor countries, and the estimated mortality number due to postpartum bleeding is one hundred thousand per year (6). Therefore, it is essential to reduce bleeding during and after CS to diminish maternal mortality and morbidity (7). The most successful technique for decreasing PPH is the active third stage labor management, requiring prophylactic uterotonic drugs like oxytocin, ergometrine malate, prostaglandins (E1, E2, and F2\u03b1), and combinations of them, or hemostatic agent as tranexamic acid (Kapron) and Etamsylate (Dicynon) (8, 9).",

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment. Thus, the role of pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for five days in volunteers undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (BVR) will be investigated in order to verify the vascular expression of SPhk1, transcriptome and vascular proteome remodeling, as well as S1P content in HDL.",

Palatoglossal air space shadow error is one of the most common positioning errors and it's due to the tongue not sticking to the roof of the palate. Techniques used to deal with this error might help prevent unnecessary radiation to patients and save them time and money. The study aimed to investigate to investigate the effects of using celluloid matrix and edible tapes (fruit leather and chewing gum) on reducing the palatoglossal air space shadow error in panoramic imaging Methods: In our study, 270 patients referred to the Department of Radiology were randomised into three groups: a control group, a celluloid matrix group, and an edible tapes group. Before panoramic imaging, all patients were instructed to adhere their tongues to the roof of their mouths, with the distinction that for the celluloid matrix and edible tapes groups, patients were asked to place celluloid tapes, fruit leathers, or chewing gums on their tongues before doing so. The routine imaging process was then performed, and the results were compared across groups to evaluate the incidence of palatoglossal air space shadow error.\nResults: *** Conclusion: ***",

        "summary": "Epidemiological studies have shown that OSA is closely related to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases, especially hypertension. At present, there are 66 million patients with moderate to severe OSA in China, and the current diagnosis and treatment of OSA is mainly completed in the sleep center of the hospital, which is time-consuming and laborious, resulting in the delayed diagnosis and treatment of a large number of patients, making about 80% of potential OSA patients have not been diagnosed and treated in time. With the development of the Internet technologies, telemedicine has been increasingly applied to the diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic diseases with its advantages of convenience, interactivity, efficiency, sharing, coherence and breaking through the limitations of time and space. Our center has initially built a remote diagnosis and treatment management model for OSA. Compared with the traditional medical model, the medical and health economic analysis shows that the OSA diagnosis and treatment model based on telemedicine is more cost-effective, but its clinical efficacy needs to be further verified. Hypertension is a common complication in OSA patients, and continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) has a significant hypertensive effect in the treatment of OSA. However, whether clinical management based on remote diagnosis and treatment mode can achieve the same therapeutic effect as traditional face-to-face diagnosis and treatment mode in improving ambulate blood pressure in OSA patients needs to be further clarified. This study will compare the improvement of ambulatory blood pressure management in patients with hypertension under the new telemedicine mode and the traditional medical mode through a single-center randomized controlled trial, so as to optimize the diagnosis and treatment process of OSA patients with hypertension, establish a more convenient and efficient remote diagnosis and treatment mode with reliable clinical outcome, and provide a theoretical basis for subsequent multi-center research and promotion",

        "summary": "Low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer (LCS) has been shown to reduce lung cancer specific mortality in multiple randomised controlled trials. However, although LDCT screening has been demonstrated to reduce cancer- specific mortality, there remain outstanding questions regarding how screening can be implemented. In particular, indeterminate nodules are common, and can be challenging to distinguish from benign nodules on CT appearances alone. Furthermore, distinguishing cancers which are likely to become clinically significant from those that will remain indolent is challenging, but essential to prevent over-treatment and overdiagnosis. There is significant interest in using a multi-modal approach to LCS, incorporating biomarkers obtained from minimally-invasive samples alongside LDCT to improve ability to recognise clinically-significant lung cancers at an early stage.\nThe Targeted Lung Health Check (TLHC) programme is an NHS programme with the aim of using LDCT screening in appropriately high-risk individuals to improve early diagnosis and survival in lung cancer. The North Central London TLHC programme started in December 2022.\nThe purpose of the ALPINE study is to develop a platform to allow collection of minimally-invasive samples from participants undergoing screening within the North Central London TLHC programme. The use of such biomarkers in the diagnosis of lung cancer is a rapidly developing field and novel techniques and technologies are continuously under development.

        "summary": "In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",

Along with the fact that the posterior teeth are subjected to higher occlusal forces than the anterior teeth (Marianne Morand & Tassos Irinakis, 2007). In order to overcome these shortcomings, various procedures have been advocated including open and closed sinus lift (Nkenke E & Stelzle F, 2009; Schropp et al, 2003). The use of short implants is a valid alternative for these procedures (Wallace SS & Froum SJ, 2003) sparing the need of applying augmentation techniques with the associated increased time, morbidity and complexity of such procedures.",

        "summary": "Despite progress in chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still the only curative procedure for some hematological malignancies. The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old. The co-transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) at the time of transplantation has previously shown a double interest in GvHD immunomodulation and hematopoiesis support. Pre-clinical studies (in mice) have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from Wharton's Jelly reduce the incidence of GvHD when the infusions are weekly repeated. We propose a phase I clinical trial to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a weekly infusion of WJ-MSC administered as GvHD prophylaxis and as a support for a faster hematological reconstitution after haplo-identical allo-SCT.",

The announcement of the cancer, the treatment methods and their side effects can generate unpleasant emotions, such as fear, for example, and the resources for coping with them differ according to the patient. Coming to the hospital as an outpatient for chemotherapy is in itself a source of anxiety.\nThe use of music in the treatment process is a therapy that can help patients to reduce the intensity of their unpleasant emotions. Active music therapy involves the patient playing an instrument, including voice and body movement in rhythm, without requiring any musical skills. The presence of a qualified music therapy professional is essential, particularly in the reception of the emotions that may be generated during the sessions. These sessions can be collective or individual. In breast cancer, music therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing pain, anxiety, depressive symptoms and length of hospitalisation in patients undergoing mastectomy.",

The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a music therapy on anxiety in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary objectives are : To evaluate the impact of the music therapy on the quality of life of localized breast cancer patients. To evaluate the quality of the relationship which the breast cancer patients have with their therapist.\n\nMeasures:\nState Trait Anxiety Inventory == Measures of State Anxiety - Measures of Trait Anxiety\n\nClinician rated 11 items, scoring each on 0-2 for a possible total score range of -26 to 56. 20 items, (10 anxiety-related and 10 nonanchors) scoring each on 0-3 for a possible total score range of 20-60.\n\nQuality Of Life Questionnaire: Quality of life is defined as being in accordance with the meaning of life. It includes four topics: physical energy, General mental health, social relationships and future perspective. Each score range from 1 to 4.\n\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale == Measures of anxiety and depression\n\nHADS consists of 14 items, each scored on 5-point scale. Higher scores are indicative of more anxiety or depression.\n\nHADS includes two 7-item scales to measure anxiety and depression. Cronbach \u03b1 coefficient of .79 for anxiety, and .88 for depression subscales.\n\nPractitioner rated. \n\nPsychometric evidence for HADS in breast cancer patients: In breast cancer outpatients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. HADS is a psychometric measure of anxiety and depression among women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In a sample of 64 breast cancer patients currently undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the mean total HADS anxiety score was 3.8 (0-21) and 3.0 (0-13) for depression (median 2.8 (0-19), and 2.0 (0-10), respectively).\n\nWong et al., Br J Cancer. 2001 Oct;85(7):1020-5. Epub 2001 Jan 24. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690210. PubMed PMID: 11157575. Related citations [64] have shown: Cronbach&#39;s alpha values for anxiety and depression were .88 and .81, respectively. All women completed valid and reliable measures. Of the HADS anxiety sub-scale, 10 items loaded on the anxiety factor, and the other 3 items loaded on the depression factor. Of the HADS depression sub-scale, 3 items loaded on the depression factor and 4 items on the anxiety factor. The total scores were based on the sum of all 14 items.\n\nIn conclusion, these data indicate that the HAD has adequate internal consistency in breast cancer outpatients receiving adjuvant therapy. In terms of factor analysis, two three-factor solutions for the anxiety sub-scale and a three-factor (neuroticism/anxiety, depressed affectivity and an unexpected double-factor depression-anxiety) factor analysis for the depression sub-scale can both explain the data; however, a two-factor (anxiety and depression) solution may also provide a reasonable theoretical fit. As both the Anxiety and Depression subscales are suitable for clinical use, both solutions should be considered to be valid measurement models.\n\nCovariance structure for the HAD sub-scales: The correlation matrix for the four- item anxiety sub-scale was 0.73, 0.84, 0.80, and 0.82. The correlation matrix for the five-item sub-scale was 0.82, 0.84, 0.74, 0.87, and 0.84. The correlation matrix for the four-item depression sub-scale was 0.49, 0.46, 0.57, and 0.6",

Color selection in the clinic is a very sensitive process and is affected by environmental factors and operator-related variables. This has led to the development of single-color universal composite resins that aim to facilitate color selection. These materials have a universal opacity and several Vita shades and are recommended by manufacturers to be used in a single color layer that can match different tooth colors. In recent years, monochromatic universal composites have been developed that are supposed to be compatible with all Vita Classic Scale shades from A1 to D4. Manufacturers report that single-color universal composites can be applied to teeth of all colors without using the layering technique using different color composites.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to compare the clinical performance of 2 different single-color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions with the control group (Filtek Z250, 3M), which is a multi-color composite resin material, using modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) and World Dental Federation (FDI) criteria.",

        "summary": "Up to 60% of endometrial cancer cases are attributed to obesity, in part because obesity promotes development of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), and up to 40% of women with AEH go on to develop endometrial cancer. The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment. It is the hypothesis that premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer who desire uterine preservation will be more likely to have atypia-free uterine preservation at two years if they receive progestin in combination with a behavioral weight loss intervention versus progestin plus enhanced usual care.",

The investigators aim to enroll 4 participants with skin tones associated with those of African descent (Group A), 4 of East Asian descent (Group B), and 4 of European descent (Group C). Additionally, the investigators aim to ensure half of group is male, and the other half female. For the duration of the study, two wearable devices will be placed on the participant: a Nonin PureSat pulse oximeter on a forefinger, and the novel wearable pulse oximeter - MABOS - on the other forefinger. Prior to testing, an Ocean HR2 XR Spectrometer will be used to assess the absorbance of three wavelengths of light - 410, 660, 940 nm - on each patient's inner wrist. Following this, the two devices will be placed on the patient, set up, and calibrated for 10 minutes. During the calibration period, MABOS will be used to measure the same three wavelengths of light utilized by the Ocean HR2 XR Spectrometer (410, 660, and 940 nm). After the calibration period, all participants will be asked to perform the following procedure 5 times as part of the testing period: a deep inhalation lasting no longer than 10 seconds, followed by a slow exhalation lasting no longer than 30 seconds. Between each trial, a five-minute break will be required. For the entire testing period, all two devices will be continuously acquiring data. After this testing period, all two devices will continue taking measurements until 90 minutes have elapsed. Skin integrity will be examined before spectrometer use, after spectrometer use, after the calibration period, every 30 minutes after the start of the testing period, and after the testing period. During the study, if the participants report any uncomfortable feeling and/or pain or if a change to the skin at the site of device placement occurs, the measurements will be discontinued, and all the devices placed on the participants will be removed. Questionnaires will be provided after the study period and during follow-up visits approximately 48 hours and 96 hours post the device testing visit for a proof-of-concept evaluation of the safe wearability.",

        "summary": "Sleep of critically ill patients is highly disturbed with a high sleep fragmentation; patients spend most of their sleep in very short sleep episodes, lasting less than 10 minutes. Causes of theses sleep alterations are complex including environmental noise (alarms, beepers, conversations\u2026), continuous light, nurse care and repetitive measures of vital parameters.\nNumerous studies have reported a relationship between severe sleep alterations and a prolonged weaning period and mortality. Improving sleep quality in critically ill patients is a major challenge to promote ICU patient's recovery.\nA very promising treatment is the application of a nocturnal  quiet-time  during which non urgent care, comfort care, systematic measures of vital parameters are delayed and clustered in order to limit room entries. However,  quiet time  procedures have failed to improve sleep quality to date.\nA miniaturized medical device recording one EEG channel and embedding an automated sleep scoring algorithm running in real-time was devised. This device (positioned on forehead, and continuously recording noise and light levels) indicates if the patient is awake or asleep using a tablet positioned at doorstep of the room, so that nurses know if patient is sleeping, without entering the room.\nHypothesis proposes that applying sleep protection procedures (clustering cares, limiting room entries, reducing lights and noise, delaying non urgent care\u2026) when patients are sleeping (= EEG-guided strategies) will increase patients sleep quality.\nThis study will assess the effect of such device on sleep quality in ICU patients. This is a before / after design. The first group (control group), will be recorded but the sleep scoring will not be displayed by the tablet and patient will be expose to standard care. Then, procedure will be established collegially with nurses, nurses assistants and doctors. Then, the second group (treated group) will be recorded with the device displaying the status of the patient (asleep/awake) and all caregivers will be asked to follow the established rules (EEG-guided sleep protection rules)",

        "summary": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health threat in China. At present, a functional cure, also known as clinical cure or sustained Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, is recommended as the ideal endpoint of HBV treatment. However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection. In this study, a large multicenter prospective study will be performed to explore the safety and efficacy of a novel combination strategy involving immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 antibody) and IFN\u03b1 in CHB patients, observe the HBsAg loss rate in NA-treated CHB patients receiving this combination strategy, evaluate the potential of breaking immune tolerance by this strategy, and further assess its efficacy to further improve the clinical cure rate on the basis of New Switch Study. Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients. The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the burden of HBV infection in China and contribute to the goal of global elimination of hepatitis B and C by 2030 (WHO 2030).",

Cancer cells that make too much HER2 may grow more quickly and are more likely to spread to other parts of the body as metastases, including the central nervous system. Trotabresib is part of a family of drugs called BET inhibitors. Trotabresib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Vinorelbine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body.

Not only has their inclusion in treatment trials been limited, but when participating, they are more likely to drop out, and/or lose less weight, compared to their White counterparts. Furthermore, treatment for binge eating is often not available in primary care and community-based settings places where Black women are more likely to receive treatment for their eating and weight-related concerns. Currently, there is scant intervention research to treat binge eating in Black women.

However, limited data are available that have examined the potential performance enhancing effect of beetroot juice in resistance exercise. Moreover, there is no information on the dose of nitrate required for performance enhancing effects during resistance exercise which limits its widespread use to enhance performance. Therefore, the investigators will assess if supplementing the diet with nitrate-rich beetroot juice impacts resistance exercise performance (e.g., power, velocity), when compared to supplementing the diet with nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (i.e. placebo). The investigators will also investigate the dose-response effect of beetroot juice on resistance exercise performance by providing a low, moderate, and high nitrate dose of concentrated beetroot juice. The results of this study will improve understanding of whether beetroot juice influences resistance exercise performance and will provide insight on whether different doses of beetroot juice influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation on resistance exercise performance.

        "summary": "Over 65% of all lung cancer patients experience significant weight loss fuelled by a catabolic state that is represented by enhanced protein breakdown. The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period. The secondary aim is to investigate the feasibility for the subjects to comply with the study protocol. Lastly, the investigators aim to study the feasibility of gathering data on a number of exploratory parameters that may link nutritional intake to clinically relevant outcomes.",

IHNC symptoms cause major changes to basic functions, such as: being unable to talk; severe swallowing problems with a high choking risk; breathing difficulties requiring a hole in the neck (tracheostomy). The manner of death can be highly traumatic and frightening e.g. catastrophic bleeding from the neck. Despite this poor outlook, little is known about patients' needs in the last year of life. However, IHNC patients have more emergency hospital visits compared with other cancer groups. Patients from poorer areas are more likely to die in hospital. Furthermore, head and neck cancer (HNC) units are centralised, with access to specialist services dependent on where the patient lives.\nThe researcher wishes to understand 'stress points' in the patients' journey, where things do not go as planned, identify priorities for change and develop patient-led solutions.\nThere are two main parts to this work, occurring over 21-months across Yorkshire, Northwest and Northeast England.\nA series of up to three interviews with approximately 25 IHNC patients and their families, along with group discussions with healthcare workers involved in IHNC care. These will explore how patients' needs and use of healthcare change over time.\nUsing interview and group discussion findings, the study team will hold a series of workshops with patients, families, clinical service leaders, and healthcare workers.

However, parents with IDDs are not provided with appropriate support, and there is a lack of evidence-based programmes tailored to these parents' needs. Parenting Young Children (PYC) is a home-based parenting programme developed for parents with IDDs. PYC has shown promising clinical results in interview-based studies, but there is no evidence of its effectiveness. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the PYC programme for improving parenting in parents with IDDs where there is risk of child neglect. The study will include a quantitative evaluation, a process evaluation, and a qualitative evaluation of the children's and parents' perspectives on participating in PYC.\nMethods: The quantitative evaluation will have a multi-centre, non-randomised, comparative study design. Eligible for participation are parents with IDDs who have children aged 0-9 years living at home and who are assessed as needing tailored parenting support. Thirty parents receiving PYC and thirty parents receiving treatment as usual (TAU) will be recruited from Swedish municipal social services. Outcome variables will be examined before and after the intervention, with a follow-up 6 months after completing the intervention. The primary outcome will be goal-attainment in parenting skills, and secondary outcomes will be parental self-efficacy and children's wellbeing. Interview methods will be used to explore the perspectives of parents and children in the PYC group.\nDiscussion: This study is motivated by the need for evidence-based support for parents with IDDs, and it focuses on upholding the centrality of child-caregiver relationships and family preservation, as well as children's rights and the rights of people with disabilities. Social services have expressed ethical concerns with employing a randomized design for this vulnerable group, and this study will therefore evaluate PYC in a non-randomized comparative study.",

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",

        "summary": "Healthcare systems in the United States (U.S.) have long faced the considerable challenge of managing budgetary pressures while at the same time helping people with serious mental illness and/or addiction. One potential way to address this challenge is to offer community-based services for individuals who are high-utilizers of expensive emergency and inpatient psychiatric services. Due to the decentralized nature of California governance, responsibility for mental health services falls primarily to the individual counties. The County of Santa Clara, CA invests significantly in community-based services as well as 24-hour care settings. This County adopted an innovative Pay for Performance (PFP) model and contracted with a new care provider to better meet the needs of this patient population and, in turn, reduce demand on the County's 24-hour psychiatric services. Whether this innovative contracting framework will help individuals who thus far have not responded well to mental health services is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the quality of care for these high-need patients was improved and at a sustainable cost. To this end, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted to determine whether this innovative quality improvement initiative, referred to as Partners in Wellness, was successful at reducing the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric care used by enrollees compared to individuals who concurrently received services from the county. Individuals were randomly assigned to the Usual Care (UC) or Pay-For-Performance (PFP) conditions. The primary outcome of this evaluation was reduction in the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services in the target population.\nthe primary outcome of this evaluation was reduction in the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services in the target population.",

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators also hypothesize that the CBT-informed intervention will be more effective than the attitudinal inoculation intervention for increasing COVID-19 vaccination among participants with symptoms of anxiety or depression.",

PFU for Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) services will be established nationally by 2024. Currently, there is a lack of evidence that measures prospectively the impact of PFU on patients and providers.\nIn January 2022, Guys and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust initiated PFU for patients with HNC. For the first 2 years following treatment, patients treated curatively are followed up according to institutional protocol. At 2 years following completion of treatment, patients who remain disease free, have no significant risk factors for recurrence and no severe treatment-related toxicity are referred to the programme and discharged from routine oncology FU. Patients are reviewed in a nurse-led HNC PFU clinic where they receive personalised survivorship, health promotion and education in identifying signs of disease recurrence with information on the pathway to re-present directly to the services at Guy's Cancer.\nThis mixed methods research project will evaluate implementation factors of this new PFU programme whilst prospectively measuring its effectiveness. A hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness study design will be used to determine the value patients and health care providers (HCP). Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with patients and HCP will be undertaken to evaluate barriers and facilitators, safety, acceptability and user experience. Data will be collected over a 24 month period. All patients who are transferred to the PFU pathway will be eligible to participate, alongside HCP involved in delivering the service.",

It produces dose-dependent sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia without respiratory depression. Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase agent, which inhibits the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetyl cholinesterase; administration of Neostigmine through intrathecal route apparently activates the descending pain inhibitory system that relies on spinal cholinergic interneuron.

        "summary": "Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by cardiac abnormalities compromising the ability of the heart to provide a blood supply adequate to the metabolic needs of peripheral tissues. ADHF is characterized by systemic and pulmonary fluid retention, with weight gain, peripheral edema, needing diuretic therapy. Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide.

Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for all adults aged over 60 or 65 years (depending local guidelines) who have never received a pneumococcal vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown. Given their wide application, co-administration of pneumococcal and Covid-19 vaccines may support broad population-wide coverage. However, it is unclear whether the co-administration of the Novavax (NVX) vaccine and a 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) results in lower immunogenicity than the administration of either alone.\nThe investigators will thus conduct a 4-four arm study with the following treatments: NVX plus placebo (NVX arm), PCV20 plus placebo group (PCV20 arm), NVX plus PCV20 (Combination arm), and placebo plus placebo group (Placebo arm). Vaccines and/or placebo will be administered as single doses, given as intramuscular injections on Day 1 (one in each shoulder).

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent. We propose that rintatolimod/durvalumab-combination therapy is feasible and may induce synergistic anti-tumor immune responses in PDAC.",

        "summary": "The potential benefits of exercise for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and pain have been well documented in the scientific literature. Psychiatric, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are examples of conditions that impact the health and quality of life of the population. Due to the effects provided by exercise, it can modify the natural course of these diseases. This concept is important to justify the efforts made by government bodies committed to promoting exercise, such as the WHO. However, the habitual practice of physical activity following the primary guidelines may be hampered by some factors, including those that support the physiological repercussions of exercise on the body, such as muscle pain. In this sense, an important complicating factor such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), present in the post-exercise recovery period, can impair adherence and permanence in physical activity programs, thus representing a considerable barrier to exercise promotion. They can also severely impair the performance of high-level athletes. Flavonoids, present in plants, but also in foods of the human diet, are known to have several biological properties, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Currently, there are still few studies that have evaluated the effects of flavonoids on the development and evolution of DOMS in humans.",

Literature provides some evidence for the effect of ITB, however we notice that not all children benefit equally. Furthermore long term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with CP have not yet been described in literature. To improve selection for ITB physicians need to know which factors influence outcome on the long term. In order to accomplish these goals prospectively, real life data over a long period of time, and from a large cohort are needed.\nThe investigators will therefore conduct a prospective observational cohort study using the Netherlands CP register to collect data over a period of 4,5 years. The Netherlands CP register is an innovative register for data collection which was developed between 2016 and 2020 in a unique collaboration between children with CP, their parents, researchers and health care professionals.\nAll children and adolescents with CP, who start ITB treatment in the Netherlands under the age of 16, diagnosed with spastic or dyskinetic CP, are eligible for inclusion in the study.\nThe primary outcome measure is goal attainment scaling (GAS) in which achievement of individual goals can be quantified. Factors that potentially influence outcome including spasticity, dystonia, scoliosis and complications will be secondary outcome measures.\nMeasurements will be done before initiation of ITB, after 3 months, after 1 year and after 2 years.\nStatistical analysis will include effect size Cohen's d for all outcome measures. To assess which factors are possibly associated with GAS T-score outcome at follow-up multiple regression analysis will be conducted.",

In India, the burden due to schizophrenia is further exacerbated by low access to effective psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting recovery, rehabilitation, and community tenure, as well as inadequate attention to managing co-occurring chronic medical conditions that result in significantly reduced life expectancy among those living with schizophrenia compared to the general population. A major driver of these alarming gaps in access to care for persons with schizophrenia in India is the limited capacity within primary care settings aimed at addressing the complex co-occurring mental health, physical health, and functional needs of this patient population. There now exists strong evidence demonstrating that community programs delivered in primary care and leveraging psychosocial interventions combined with linkage to specialty psychiatric services are effective for supporting treatment and recovery of schizophrenia in low-resource settings. We will leverage our existing collaboration and robust research infrastructure in both rural and urban settings in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, India to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate whether the use of a digital platform offers added clinical benefit and can support integration of this task shared care for schizophrenia into routine primary care settings. We will address the following aims: 1) evaluate whether the use of the mindLAMP digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness of task-shared community-based psychosocial rehabilitation (COPSI) for individuals with schizophrenia, and 2) determine whether the addition of mindLAMP to the delivery of the COPSI program has an impact on implementation metrics when compared to delivery of COPSI alone.",

Thereby restoring the killing function of T cells to tumor cells and reducing the exhaustion of T cells.The hypothesis is the combination of cadonilimab and nab-Paclitaxel will overcome PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-resistance to enhance the response of patients with persistant, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.",

        "summary": "Approximately 65, 000 hip fractures occur in the United Kingdom (UK) each year, and more than 99% are repaired by surgery. Roughly half of patients receive spinal anaesthesia, where a small amount (usually less than half a teaspoonful) of local anaesthetic is injected into the lower back, around the nerves that go to and from the hip.\nLow blood pressure is very common during surgery (at least > 30%, depending on definition), and appears to be linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery.\nThere are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. National guidelines recommend that lower doses are given, but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately or often enough.\nThe Anaesthesia Sprint Audit of Practice (ASAP) 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.5 mls of spinal anaesthesia is given, and the investigator has been using this amount in Brighton since 2011. Recently, the investigator has reported a way of transferring vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (e.g. in Coroner's investigations: approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery).\nHowever, analyzing such observational data should also allow the investigator to describe accurately how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (e.g. the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, the investigator hopes to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery, potentially improving people's survival and recovery after hip fracture.",

In addition to negative impact on patient's quality of life, chronic pancreatitis is also associated with the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. The etiology of recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) can be divided into mechanical obstructive factors (e.g. cholelithiasis, cholestasis), metabolic abnormality and toxic substance factors (e.g. hyperlipidemia and alcoholism), and other or idiopathic factors. At present, the diagnosis and treatment of RAP remains highly challenging. Early identification and intervention on risk factors of recurrence will be effective in reducing incidence and improving prognosis.\nContrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) can not only provide more imaging information and further assess the severity of acute pancreatitis, but also aid in the differentiation of other diseases associated with acute abdominal pain. In addition, radiomics based on raw radiographic data has become a research hotspot in recent years. The purpose of this study is to establish and validate a deep learning model based on high concentration iopromide-enhanced abdominal CT images which is designed to predict the recurrence of pancreatitis in patients with first episode of pancreatitis within the 1-year follow-up period.",

        "summary": "Electro fetal monitor monitoring in the antepartum and intrapartum periods is one of the most important responsibilities of midwives, who have important roles and responsibilities in maintaining and managing the health of women and newborns before, during and after delivery. Although midwives receive training on EFM monitoring with classical methods before graduation, they may experience problems in EFM monitoring in the clinical field after graduation. For this reason, midwife students should have the knowledge, skills and self-efficacy about a good level of EFM monitoring during their undergraduate education. In recent years, simulation-based education in the field of health has increased rapidly. This method creates an opportunity for health professionals, students, patient assessment, interaction and holistic care without compromising patient safety, and develops participants' critical thinking, clinical decision making and problem solving skills.\nIn this context, it is very important to evaluate the EFM trace in the antepartum and intrapartum periods, to determine the possible risks, to plan, implement and evaluate the interventions, to provide the emergency crisis management in a short time without affecting the fetal health, and to increase the self-confidence of the midwives.\nThe research was planned quantitatively in the form of randomized control-intervention of the scenario-based realistic simulation method, to increase the satisfaction and self-confidence levels of midwifery students in learning, to evaluate the simulation design and educational effectiveness, in EFM management. The research will facilitate midwifery students to intervene with the patient in a shorter time, with confidence and with sufficient clinical skills, and patient safety will be increased. It will also allow for the reduction of erroneous clinical practices and malpractices.\nThis research aims to evaluate the effect of high-fidelity simulation teaching method on knowledge, satisfaction and self-efficacy of midwifery students in EFM follow-up.",

        "summary": "Crohn's disease is a chronic and complex inflammatory bowel disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract, causing symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue. While its exact cause is unclear, it involves genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Crohn's disease can lead to nutrient deficiencies and has unpredictable flare-ups and remission periods. During the remission phases, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms can persist in 50% of patients, for which no satisfactory treatment is available yet.\nChitin-glucan is prebiotic, obtained by extraction, isolation and purification from a fungal resource: the mycelium of Aspergillus niger (a microscopic fungus of the Ascomycetes family) of which it composes the cell walls. The biopolymer consists essentially of two types of polysaccharide chains: chitin (poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) and beta-(1,3)-D-glucan (D-glucose units linked essentially via beta-1,3 bonds). Because of its beta bond, human intestinal enzymes cannot digest it, as a result, the majority of chitin-glucan can reach the colon where it can be fermented by the microbiota.\nBy modulating the composition and/or activity of the intestinal microbiota, fermentation of chitin-glucan could have beneficial effects on health.\nThe aim of the RELIEVE study is to assess if BK003 could improve the relief of global symptoms, individual symptoms, stool consistency and frequency of evacuations, quality of life, anxiety, and depression in patients with Crohn's disease in remission without treatment or with stable maintenance therapy and having IBS-like symptoms and to confirm the product's safety.",

The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases. The same junction clones from pre-post-RT serums and surgical tissues will be confirmed and the copy number changes of vh-DNA be correlated with RT response and disease-control status.\nThe investigators plan to identify HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR as personalized biomarkers from the same-patient serum samples. The investigators will further correlate clinical response and recurrence/metastasis with serial changes of vh-DNA copy numbers. The investigators have been prospectively collecting plasma samples from HBV-related HCC patients before/after RT, at 1, 4, 7 months, and at recurrence/metastasis. The investigators plan to confirm the viable role of pre-/post-RT changes of plasma vh-DNA copies of the same junction clone in post-RT response and prognosis. Moreover, The investigators will explore the recurrent/metastatic tumors arising from the original or a de novo one by identifying their clonality with HBV integration patterns. The true value of this novel HBV chimera vh-DNA will be revealed.

        "summary": "The unexpected changes caused by the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can lead individuals to question their beliefs, life meanings, and goals, prompting a search for meaning. According to Park and Folkman's (1997) Meaning-Making Model, the process of meaning making functions as a coping mechanism. It helps individuals adapt challenging experiences into their lives, ultimately assisting in their psychological adjustment to stressful situations. Based on this theoretical model, principles from meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), literature reviews, interviews with breast cancer patients, and expert consultation, an 8-week online individual psychological intervention was developed. It was aimed at facilitating the finding of new meanings in the experience of breast cancer and promoting psychological well-being. It includes psycho-educational, cognitive, existential, and behavioral components explicitly focusing on the meaning-making process. This intervention is called the Meaning Centered Coping Program (MCCP). The main purpose of this study was to test whether the MCCP was an effective intervention program for women diagnosed with breast cancer. For this purpose, the study sample consisted of women with stage I, II, and III breast cancer. Then, participants were randomly assigned to the MCCP group and the wait-list control group. A number of reliable and valid measurement tools were used to compare the MCCP group with the waitlist control group and to examine the effect of the program. Compared with the control group, significant improvements were expected in the level of meaning in life, post-traumatic growth, situational meanings, psychological inflexibility, and psychological well-being in the MCCP group.",

However, it also increases the risk of ischemic complications in patients. The current standard dual antiplatelet regimen is considered crucial in reducing thrombotic events. Nevertheless, some patients exhibit resistance to antiplatelet drugs, which puts them at a higher risk of thrombotic events. In clinical practice, there is a lack of standardized platelet function testing and consensus on adjusting antiplatelet drug programs. This study conducted a multi-center, prospective cluster randomized controlled trial to investigate whether antiplatelet adjustment therapy guided by light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) detection can decrease the occurrence of ischemic events after stent implantation in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

The secondary objective is to assess the degree to which the effects of D2 receptor action vary as a function of proxy measures of baseline dopamine levels.\nStudy design: A double-blind placebo controlled within-subject design will be employed, in which young healthy participants are tested twice, once on placebo, and once on a low oral dose (400mg) of the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride. This design and drug dose is commonly used in our lab without side effects (previously approved CMO protocols 2011/204, 2008/078 & 2016/2646).\nStudy population: Healthy human participants, 18 - 45 yr old. We will recruit 46 participants.\nIntervention: Participants will receive both 400 mg sulpiride and placebo, in separate sessions in a counterbalanced order.\nMain study parameters/endpoints: BOLD signal measured with fMRI, and behavioural performance on cognitive tasks.\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Participants will attend 3 study sessions: A screening session and 2 pharmaco-fMRI sessions (sulpiride and placebo). Participants will complete a baseline battery of tasks and questionnaires, a structural MRI scan, as well as a battery of tasks both in and outside the scanner. On the day preceding each pharmaco-fMRI session, participants will have to adhere to some simple restrictions with respect to medication, alcohol and drug intake. On the day of testing participants will have to refrain from smoking and stimulant-containing drinks. Sulpiride can be administered safely without any relevant risk of serious adverse events and has been approved for clinical use in the Netherlands.",

        "summary": "More than half a million children have an anaesthetic each year in the UK. Though anaesthesia is usually thought to be safe and necessary to improve health, concerns remain the effects that the drugs used may have on brain development in children and the potential long-term consequences for health. The two techniques used to keep someone asleep during anaesthesia are either giving the appropriate drugs through a small plastic tube into a vein or introducing different drugs into the lungs in gas form.\nGene expression is the process by which instructions in DNA are used to make products such as proteins. Anaesthetic drugs may change how a child's genes are expressed\u037e a process called epigenetics. Studies have shown that different anaesthetic drugs can cause epigenetic changes in animals and affect the processing ability of their brains.\nThis study will focus on children aged under 3 undergoing general anaesthesia for planned hypospadias surgery (a developmental condition where the look and function of the penis may not be completely normally). Participants will either receive their general anaesthetic in gas form or through directly into their veins - both techniques are commonly used. A small blood sample (between 1 and 2 teaspoons) will be collected at the start and end of the operation whilst under anaesthetic. Samples will be analysed to look for any changes in signals on DNA (epigenetic changes) and other markers. Further analysis may then look at other measures of gene expression and additional processes/markers that could be affected.\nThere is relatively less medical research carried out in children and this work will show whether this type of study is possible in this age-group and provide information for future trials. It will help towards improving our understanding of the effects of anaesthesia ultimately help doctors and families make better informed decisions.",

        "summary": "Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism can have multiple causes; most patients suffer from primary autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma, or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease occur. Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",

        "summary": "After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma.",

In severe rapidly progressive SSc, we and others demonstrated that autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is the only treatment so far allowing improvement in overall and event free survival up to 7 years after AHSCT.\nAs soon as vaccines were available on January 1st, 2021 and following the French Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (HAS) and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Francophone de Greffe de Moelle et de Th\u00e9rapie Cellulaire (SFGM-TC) good clinical practices (GCP) guidelines, the ad hoc COVID19 vaccinations were proposed to all SSc patients in France, including those previously treated by AHSCT and followed at Maladies Auto Immunes et Th\u00e9rapie Cellulaire (MATHEC) Center of Reference for stem cell therapy at St-Louis hospital. In July 2021, the Autoimmune Diseases Working Party (ADWP) and the European society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) guidelines recommended vaccination against SARS-CoV2 as early as 3 months after HSCT for autoimmune diseases.\nOnly one Israeli study so far has analyzed the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination after autologous HSCT (AHSCT) in SSc patients..\nWe therefore designed the present case control study retrospective study to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of this vaccination program in SSc patients treated by AHSCT as compared to other fragile SSc individuals.\nThe Primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing the anti-SARS-CoV2 vaccination program according to the French GCP for COVID-19 prophylaxis in SSc fragile patients, in terms of risk of asymptomatic or symptomatic COVID-19 infection, among SSc patients treated by AHSCT compared to 1:1 matched non transplant SSc controls.",
