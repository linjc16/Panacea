| Braden Scale | A tool used to assess the risk of developing a pressure ulcer. It is a 6-point scale, with 1 being the lowest risk and 6 being the highest. The scale assesses the patient's risk of developing a pressure ulcer based on factors such as moisture, activity, mobility, friction and shear, nutrition, and sensory perception. | 
| Pressure Ulcer Observation Form | A tool used to assess the presence and severity of pressure ulcers. It is a 6-point scale, with 1 being no pressure ulcer and 6 being a full-thickness pressure ulcer. The form assesses the pressure ulcer based on the area of the ulcer, the depth of the ulcer, the presence of tissue damage, and the presence of necrotic tissue. | 
| Pressure Measurement Ruler | A tool used to measure the pressure in a pressure ulcer. It is a ruler with a pressure-sensitive adhesive on one side. The ruler is placed on the skin over the pressure ulcer, and the pressure in the ulcer is measured in Newtons. |

The main questions it aims to answer are: What are the differences in changes in heart rate variability modulation between chronic renal patients who undergo conventional physical exercise before and during hemodialysis sessions, and those who engage in virtual environment exercise? How does the virtual environment influence changes in heart rate variability modulation compared to conventional exercise in chronic renal patients before and during hemodialysis sessions? Group A will participate in 10 interventions, each intervention consisting of playing 3 rounds of a Virtual Reality game lasting 5 minutes, totaling 15 minutes of exercise. Group B will participate in 10 interventions, each intervention consisting of 15 minutes of physical exercise on a cycle ergometer, referred to here as conventional exercise. After the initial 10 interventions,there will be a 1-week washout period and the groups will switch.

Detailed Description: [/DD]

Background: Gallstone disease affects 10-15% of people in the United Kingdom (UK) and over 65,000 patients undergoing cholecystectomy each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) over 110 million. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without (including reduced diversity, decreased prevalence of beneficial and increased prevalence of pathogenic bacteria) but there are only a handful of small scale studies exploring the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. Hypothesis and Objectives: This pilot study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including: Patients who develop complications of gallstone disease(including but not limited to biliary colic, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis and gallstone ileus) following diagnosis and Patients who develop post-operative complications including short (hospital stay, wound healing etc) and intermediate (development of post-cholecystectomy diarrhoea) outcomes. Design and Methods: A prospective cohort design will be used to collect data from 75 adult patients presenting to East Kent University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Hospitals with newly diagnosed gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging investigations. Data will be collected from electronic patient records including clinical history and diagnostic investigations, anthropometry, blood and imaging results (if taken as part of routine clinical care) for the initial presentation and subsequent readmissions/planned follow-up timepoints. Stool samples will be collected from patients either during admission or at home at each timepoint. Patients will also be asked to provide a 3 day food diary card Patients will have a sample collected at time of diagnosis and then at 6 monthly intervals whilst awaiting cholecystectomy. A pre-operative sample will be required within 6 weeks of any surgical intervention. Following cholecystectomy an immediate post-operative sample (within the first week) will be collected as well as a sample at"

This is a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided sacral erector spinae plane block in postoperative pain management after lumbar discectomy surgery."
38,"[/INST] The investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a practical and inexpensive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain, which shows sensitivity to change in relation to treatment. Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as tight muscle bands, trigger points, and thoracolumbar fascia motion dysfunction, along with poor tissue elasticity. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose to study: 1. The echogenicity of latent and active trigger points, 2. The dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation quantified by strain tensors (compression, extension, and shear) in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, 3. The viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. In the R61 Phase (year 1 to 3) the investigators will use deep learning to integrate these measurements into a predictive biomarker and use established validation methods to test its ability to predict MP. The investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker to classify the myofascial components of pain, as well as the response to treatment (a diagnostic and predictive marker)."

Detailed Description
[/INST]
Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques have been used in various contexts, including education. Some educators and practitioners believe that NLP can help children develop their communication skills, self-confidence, and self-awareness and improve their learning outcomes. Some NLP techniques adapted for children include: (1) Anchoring involves linking a particular emotional or sensory state with a physical stimulus, such as a touch or a visual cue. For example, a teacher might use a specific gesture or word to help a child feel more confident before a test. (2) Reframing: This technique involves helping a child see a situation or problem differently. For example, a teacher might help a child reframe a difficult math problem as a fun challenge. And (3) Meta-modeling: This technique involves helping children become more aware of their language patterns and the language patterns of others, which can improve communication skills and self-awareness."

Study Overview
-----------------
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. Characterize how the metabolic aMRI parameter kᵢₒ*V differs in the tumor versus (vs) normal brain. Researchers will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, ¹⁸FDG PET. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Post-gadolinium (Gd) T1 MRI will be used to distinguish the contrast-enhancing ring region indicating the metabolically active tumor periphery from the less viable and/or necrotic tumor core. The utility of aMRI to differentially assess the metabolically active tumor periphery and necrotic core regions will be determined and compared to that of ¹⁸FDG PET (SUVmax). II. Characterize how the metabolic aMRI parameter kᵢₒ*V differs in the various normal appearing brain sub-regions unaffected by tumor, in comparison to ¹⁸FDG PET. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE: I. To compare how the aMRI metabolic parameter kᵢₒ*V within disease lesions changes with different disease types, their disease stage, and their treatment status. OUTLINE: Patients receive ¹⁸FDG IV, then 60 minutes later undergo simultaneous MRI and PET scanning. During this scanning period, patients will receive gadoterate meglumine IV to obtain post-contrast MRI. Total scanning time will take 45-60 minutes."

Input Text: Tecarterapy on the Performance of Amateur Athletes.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical therapy has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet therapy is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissue, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this type of physical therapy are based on the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this type of physical therapy are based on the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. Some of these rehabilitation processes have been used in physical rehabilitation, in some cases, combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specific aims to improve the muscle tissue, in which the muscle tissue, ligament and tendon healing, in which the muscle tissue, ligament and tendon.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing on the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics by general practitioners.
The study is based on a randomized controlled trial, with a control group receiving a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing report and an intervention group receiving a selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing.
The primary endpoint will be the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing, defined as the number of urine cultures associated with a prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, fluoroquinolone, third-generation cephalosporin) prescribed by GPs in the same practice over a period from 3 days before to 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing. This period of interest corresponds to the period of empirical antibiotic therapy (=within 3 days before report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing) and the period of directed antibiotic therapy (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing). A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out by varying the time window for broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing around the date of the antibiotic susceptibility testing result, up to a maximum of 7 days before and 14 days after.
The secondary endpoints will include the rate of directed broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing as a function of the number of selective antibiotic susceptibility testings received per practice, and the characteristics of the GPs.
The study will also include the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing GPs, antibiogram, and antibiogram, and narrow-spectrum, and antibiogram, and treatment.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the acute effect of kinesio taping and extracorporeal shock wave therapy on pain severity and lower extremity functionality in plantar fasciitis.


Input Text: Effect of Kinesio Taping and Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Plantar Fasciitis

Detailed Description
-----------------
Plantar fasciitis is a common disease in athletes and the sedentary population, accompanied by pain and limitation of foot function. Hot-cold tampon application, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, heel cushion, night splint, plantar fascia and Achilles stretching exercise, kinesio taping (CT), ultrasound, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy are the methods used in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. The aim of this study is to compare the acute effect on pain level, lower extremity functionality and plantar fascia flexibility in patients with plantar fasciitis receiving ESWT, patients with plantar fasciitis receiving Kinesiotape in addition to ESWT, and patients with plantar fasciitis receiving placebo ESWT. Age (years), height (cm) and body weight (kg) measured with an adult scale with a mechanical height measure, occupation, and dominant side of patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis will be recorded. Patients will be divided into three groups: ESWT (Group 1), ESWT and Kinesiotape (Group 2), and Placebo/Sham (Group 3) application groups. ESWT (BTL-6000SWT, UK); A single session will be applied at 10 Hz frequency, 2.5 Barr energy and 2000 shocks/session. For Kinesiotape application, a tape consisting of 96% cotton, 4% lycra, water-resistant, porous and adhesive, 5 cm wide and 0.5 mm thick will be used. Taping will be done after the ESWT session and"

This is a pilot study to evaluate the potential of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect changes in the brain metabolism of gliomas. Gliomas are tumors of the brain or spinal cord that are difficult to treat. The 1p19q codeletion is a genetic mutation that is present in a subset of these tumors and is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of MRS to detect changes in the brain metabolism of these tumors and to correlate these changes with the 1p19q codeletion status and the response to treatment."

Study Overview
-----------------
Introduction and Aims Most patients prefer to discharge from the hospital to their own home, but 11% of all hospitalized patients-and 22.4% of patients with Medicare-require discharge to a post-acute care facility. Hospital systems are increasingly incentivized to facilitate discharge home since a post-acute care facility stay is costly. Post-acute care is most often necessitated by a patient's functional decline during hospitalization. Physical therapists, whose primary treatment objective is generally to improve functional independence, could therefore play a crucial role in promoting improvements in functional status sufficient to enable a greater number of discharges to home. In current practice, however, physical therapists in acute care hospitals do not generally address patients' function-related deficits. They do not generally have the opportunity to do so, since the Inpatient Prospective Payment System incentivizes short hospital stays. Nor have they needed to, since post-acute care facilities have become the primary setting for patients to regain functional independence. In this environment, physical therapists-a constrained resource in most hospitals primarily play a consultative role in which they evaluate functional status during a single visit in order to provide a recommendation for appropriate post-acute rehabilitation needs. With greater focus on ensuring value across the care continuum, healthcare systems are now striving to maintain short hospital stays, but also limit post-acute care utilization. This will require patients to achieve greater functional independence as quickly as possible within their hospital stay. Thus, the role of physical therapists in acute care hospitals must evolve. Intervention Despite the need to evolve, the fact that physical therapists are a constrained resource in most hospitals prompts the need for care prioritization that is optimally targeted. It is currently unclear which patients need physical therapist intervention in the hospital, and how much physical therapy is necessary, in order to achieve a functional status that is adequate to discharge home. We have developed a patient-level clinical decision support tool to guide optimal treatment frequency. This tool-the Physical Therapy Frequency Clinical Decision Support Tool, or PT-PENCIL, is based on a statistical model that predicts"

166,"[/INST] The elbow being a highly constrained synovial hinge joint has a high propensity for degeneration and stiffness. There could be functional losses seen with even less severe loss of range of motion (ROM) at the elbow. The stiff or contracted elbow is defined as an elbow with a reduction in extension greater than 30 degrees, and/or a flexion less than 120 degrees. Although supination and pronation are often reduced as well, this will not be considered further as contracture of the elbow is not related to forearm rotation. The elbow is more prone to stiffness because Brachialis muscle lies directly over the anterior capsule, the anterior capsule tends to tear more frequently than posterior, all 3 elbow articulations exist in 1 capsule, the elbow is prone to development of Heterotrophic Ossification. Loss of terminal extension is less disabling than loss of the same degree of terminal flexion. It was a randomized, controlled trial, conducted among post-traumatic stiff elbow patients. Sample size was 32 by using G Power Calculator. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group after a baseline assessment with a lottery ticket and an opaque envelope. All participants in both groups were evaluated on two occasions: (i) baseline (ii) After 4 weeks of intervention"

The main questions it aims to answer are: Is there an improve of memory performance through performing the controlled yoga-based breathing styles ? Is there a relevant reduction of the subjective stress level through performing the controlled yoga-based breathing styles Participants will complete a memory test while performing controlled nasal and oral breathing. They will complete a two-week training period after the test with daily nasal or mouth breathing. Researchers will compare the nasal breathing group to the mouth breathing and the comparison group to see if the nasal breathing results in a significant improvement of the memory capacity."

 Drug: DEXMEDETOMIDINE<br>* DXM is a nonselective α2 agonist. Alpha2 adrenoreceptors, the overall response to α2 adrenoreceptors agonists is related to the stimulation of α2 adrenoreceptors located in the CNS and spinal cord. These receptors are involved in the sympatholysis, sedation, and antinociception effects of α2 adrenoreceptors. DEXMEDETOMIDINE (DXM) DXM shows a high ratio of specificity for the α2 receptor (α2/α11600: 1) compared with clonidine (α2/α1 200: 1), making it a complete α2 agonist. (76) DXM belongs to the imidazole subclass of α2 receptor agonists, similar to clonidine. It is freely soluble in water.<br>

 Drug: Neostigmine<br>* Neostigmine is an indirect cholinomimetic agent. It produces its primary effects by inhibiting the action of AChe, which hydrolyzes acetylcholine (ACh) to choline and acetic acid. By inhibiting AChe, the indirect-acting drug increases the concentration of spinal endogenous ACh. It combines reversibly with AChe by the formation of an ester linkage, which lasts about 30 minutes. The pharmacokinetic of neostigmine administered by bolus injection is linear with respect to bolus injection.

 Drug: Bupivacaine<br>* The onset of sensory blockade following spinal block with bupivacaine is very rapid (within one minute); maximum motor blockade and maximum dermatome level are achieved within 15 minutes in most cases. The conduction of nerve impulses along nerve fibers is related to changes in the electrical gradient across the nerve membrane and movement of predominantly sodium ions (but also potassium ions) from intracellular to extracellular"

The objective of this study is to compare the effects of integrated and isolated resisted exercise on strength, power and endurance in gym beginner.Resistance training is one of the most popular training approaches adopted by coaches professionals. Due to the limited number of literature on athletes, it's forever a challenge for physiotherapists in to enhance functional performance in players by implementing these techniques. The basic purpose of this research is to find and compare the effects of integrated and isolated training on strength, power and endurance in gym beginner. The study can help coaches and trainers to identify the most effective training methods for improving strength, power and endurance.Previous literature show that resisted exercises play effective role in gym trainer for strengthening, power and endurance. But there is a limited literature on comparing the effects of integrated and isolated resisted exercise so our focus is to measure the role of these techniques for strength, power and endurance in gym beginners."

Study Overview
-----------------
Detailed Description

Background: Improving diet quality is an essential component for the treatment of adolescent obesity. Pediatric providers are recommended to incorporate nutrition recommendations as part of adolescent obesity treatment, but time and knowledge are barriers. Digital-based interventions have been shown to improve fruit and vegetable intake in adolescents. However, it is unknown if a digital-based diet quality intervention is feasible or effective for adolescents with overweight or obesity. Objectives: (primary and important secondary objectives) The overarching objective of this pilot study is to demonstrate if a digital-based diet quality intervention for adolescents with overweight or obesity is feasible and if there is preliminary effectiveness that diet quality and meal timing traits improves as assessed by 24-hr dietary recalls, a novel urine biomarker, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Study Design: A two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the treatment of adolescent obesity.

The investigators will analyze the blood samples of patients with brain lesions compatible with a glioma in order to detect the circulating free DNA of tumor cells. These fragments are expelled into the bloodstream by the death of tumor cells, and their detection allows the team to confirm the presence of a glioma, and to know its classification as astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma."

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Surgical technique All robotic surgical procedures were performed by a single highly experienced robotic surgeon (AM) alternated with the other fellow-members. The Da Vinci Si system, (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), in a four-arm conﬁguration with a 0/30° laparoscope was used for all cases. As previously described (4), patients are positioned in 30° Trendelenburg with a standard six-port transperitoneal approach for the demolitive part and then reduced to 20° to facilitate bowel handling and urethro-neobladder anastomosis. After the isolation of 45-50 cm of ileum, the urethro-ileal anastomosis is performed obtaining an asymmetrical 'U'-shape (25-30 cm distally and 20 cm proximally to anastomosis). Ileum is then sectioned by endo- GIA 60 mm Echelon Powered Endopath Stapler (Ethicon Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) and the intestinal continuity is then restored with an intracorporeal side-to-side anastomosis with one longitudinal fire. The two transversal holes are closed by a double layer 3-0 Stratafix running suture. The asymmetrical 'U'-shape segment is then distalized by suturing the posterior plate to the anterior one with a 5-0 running suture. Neobladder neck configuration was performed by suturing a tract of 2-5 cm longitudinally from the 12 o'clock position of the anastomosis. Then, the posterior plate was folded anteriorly, distally, roughly 5 cm right from the proximal edge of the posterior closure with the goal of creating two symmetrical segments. Ureteral reimplantation After a careful isolation of the ureters avoiding iatrogenic blood supply damages, the ureteric stumps were sectioned and adequately spatulated. Bilateral u"

376,"[/INST] This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) that involves the repeated serial sampling of participants. This study design was chosen to provide comprehensive information on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence changes over time and the subsequent clinical impact on pwCF. The study will be conducted at participating CF centers over a 3-year period. Study participants will include pediatric and adult pwCF. For the UK section of the study, UK investigators in the European Cystic Fibrosis Society-Clinical Trials Network (ECFS-CTN) will be invited to participate. Participating investigators can enroll all eligible pwCF over a 12-month period. Participants are then followed up for 24 months. Participants will donate blood samples at their routine clinic visits. Blood samples will be collected at Day 0 (baseline), at Months 6, 12, 18, and 24 (to coincide with routine clinical reviews). Additional blood samples will be taken opportunistically every time the participant visits the clinic for blood draws. These blood samples could be related to, routine care, annual review visits, CF complications, or when initiating new treatments (e.g. CFTR modulators). Serum from blood samples will be shipped to a central laboratory (Queen's University Belfast) for standardized measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Alongside the blood samples, the investigators will also collect clinical data from the patient's health records and will input this data into the case report form (CRF). Clinical data will be collected in conjunction with routine care visits, according to local clinical care. Investigators will collect data elements from information routinely recorded in the patient's medical records. Data will be collected at baseline, months 6, 12, 18, and 24 as per the study schedule, and at additional blood sampling time points as previously explained above. Data collection will include routine data available from CF clinic follow-ups including background demographic information, CF medical history, medications, exacerbation information, CF clinical and lung function parameters.

Objectives
-----------------
To characterize the safety profile of CAR19 therapy in people living with HIV disease To characterize the efficacy of CAR19 therapy in people living with HIV disease To characterize the durability of CAR19 therapy in people living with HIV disease

Rationale
-----------------
CAR19 therapy has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of B-cell lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in people without HIV disease. However, no data exists on the safety and efficacy of CAR19 therapy in people living with HIV disease. This study will characterize the safety and efficacy of CAR19 therapy in people living with HIV disease.

Expected Results
-----------------
The results of this study will be the first to characterize the safety and efficacy of CAR19 therapy in people living with HIV disease."

This is a UK-based observational study that aims to discover novel predictive biomarkers with the potential to guide treatment decision making and prolong PFS and OS in patients with advanced TNBC. Patients will undergo a mandatory, study-specific core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration of the breast tumour or metastasis before commencing their next line of systemic therapy. The research sample will be run on Pear Bio's test. The treating oncologist will be blinded to the test results. The study aims to establish the positive predictive value of Pear Bio's test in predicting patient response to systemic therapy. The study will also assess the test's ability to predict PFS and OS."

Detailed Description
-----------------
The overarching goal of this project is to develop a dementia care intervention for PLWD and their caregivers, Dementia Care Quality at Home, and test the feasibility of implementing the intervention in two HBPC practices to ultimately improve outcomes of PLWD and their caregivers. The investigators will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity in implementing HBPC Dementia Care Quality at Home in two practices for persons living with dementia and their caregivers through an open pilot. Hypothesis: HBPC Dementia Care Quality at Home will meet benchmarks of feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity by the HBPC practices implementing it and by caregivers of PLWD who experience the intervention. The investigators will assess feasibility of caregivers of PLWD to engage with the intervention, the acceptability of the intervention to caregivers, and the impact of the intervention on caregiver well-being by surveying caregivers at the conclusion of the pilot. In addition, the investigators will assess feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of the intervention in the practices.

| Experimental: Treatment Group<br>EVLP + HDF | Device: hemodiafiltration (HDF)<br>* Hemodiafiltration (HDF) is a variation of conventional HD. By the addition of a substitution solution, convection forces are significantly increased. This substitution solution is added to the blood and is completely removed again in the dialyzer. This increases the negative pressure on the dialysate side and the removal of toxins through convection. The substitution solution can be added in a pre-dilution (before the dialyzer) or post-dilution (after the dialyzer) manner. Pre-dilution is associated with longer run times, less filter clotting, but is also less effective in removing toxins. Post-dilution offers a better toxin clearance capacity, but is associated with an increased risk of filter clotting. Several studies have shown that HDF provides higher clearance rates for both small and middle molecule solutes. Moreover, effective cytokine removal has been shown in HDF both in acute and chronic renal disease patients.<"

Study Overview
-----------------
Among patients with carotid stenosis (according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial classification) enlisted to undergo carotid endarterectomy for extracranial high-grade (>70%) internal carotid artery stenosis, the investigators will enroll 300 consecutive patients with asymptomatic disease. All patients will undergo a baseline clinical examination, with computed tomography or MRI to assess cerebral lesions, and health records will be collected. Clinical variables will be measured with standard procedures after overnight fasting. Patients with evidence of heart failure, valvular defects, malignant neoplasms, or secondary causes of hypertension will be excluded. Specimens of the portion of carotid bifurcation that showed maximum disease will be obtained from atherectomy and will be cut in two halves and frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in in 10% buffered formalin for subsequent analyses. Plaque specimens will be then used to assess the presence and the amount of volatile organic compounds and microplastics through pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To corroborate these findings, plaque specimens will be also observed with transmission electron microscopy to visually identify microplastics within the atheroma and obtain further evidence and structural insights. Plaques will be also analysed through immunohistochemistry, ELISAs, and Western Blot to quantify inflammatory, i.e. NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, NF-kB, and CD68, and plaque stability markers, i.e. MMP-9 and collagen, in order to explore whether the presence of microplastics is associated with a poorer plaque phenotype. The groups (composed post-hoc) of patients with polluted plaques vs non-polluted plaques will be compared for the expression of all these markers. After carotid endarterectomy, patients will be followed-up and monitored for the incidence of a composite outcome constituted"

Input Text: Clinical Evaluation of Chemically Cured Conventional Glass Ionomer After Light Emitting Diode Radiant Heat Enhancement

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Introduction: Glass ionomer cements (GICs) are widely used in clinical dentistry due to their advantageous properties. However, they present inferior physical and mechanical properties compared to resin composites. Various techniques have been suggested to improve properties of conventional GICs such as radiant heat transfer by Light Emitting Diode (LED) or lasers, ultrasonic energy transfer also using of (CaCl2) solution. Aim: Clinical evaluation of chemically cured conventional glass ionomer after light-emitting diode radiant heat enhancement. . Methodology: Eighteen healthy patients with 36-second molar teeth will be selected where each patient should have two oclusso- mesial cavities. Standardized oclusso- mesial cavities will be prepared for all the selected teeth, for each patient the first tooth will be restored with chemically cured conventional GICs without any enhancement (M1 group). Meanwhile, the second tooth will be restored by chemically cured conventional GICs that enhanced with radiant heat (LED) (M2 group). functional and biological criteria of each restoration will be clinically evaluated immediately after restoration (T0), six months later (T1), and after 12 months (T2) using Federation Dentaire International (FDI) criteria for assessment of dental restorations.

Contrast-enhanced stereotactic biopsy (CESB) is an emerging breast imaging modality that is based on dual-energy mammography and the injection of iodinated contrast agent. A typical CEM study consists of a low-energy image (equal to a FFDM image) and a recombined image (in which areas of contrast enhancement can be appreciated). However, the situation can occur that lesions are visible only on the recombined (contrast) images (in this protocol defined as 'recombined-only lesions' or ROLs). In these cases, we need to perform 'contrast-enhanced stereotactic biopsy' (CESB), in which CEM is used as a targeting modality. However, experiences with CESB are still limited and one of the most urgent questions that need to be answered is the amount of tissue sampling that is required to reach a final diagnosis. We aim to study where the cut off will be in terms of tissue sampling volume needed (i.e., number of biopsies) for a reliable diagnosis."

Study Overview
-----------------
Detailed Description
-----------------
Frostbite injury has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for as long as humans have experienced cold winters. When frostbite occurs, there are two primary mechanisms through which tissue damage occurs, though the main mechanism focused on here is systemic cooling. As the body cools, blood is shunted from the extremities to the core to maintain heat in the vital organs. During this shunting, there is extensive vasospasm in the extremities and the tissue becomes ischemic. Upon further cooling, tissue ice crystals form within the cells and interstitial spaces causing desiccation and cell destruction. This occurs in the soft tissues and also affects the endothelium of the micro- and macro-vasculature. Clots form in the microvasculature, worsening the ischemia. All ischemic tissues release pro-inflammatory factors, which increase inflammation and worsen clotting. Upon rewarming of the frozen tissues, the reperfusion can worsen the inflammatory state as these factors released by the ischemic tissue are now able to circulate. Rapid rewarming is used as a tool to mitigate this reperfusion injury as it does not eliminate the damage. After rapid rewarming, the tissue is assessed for the extent of damage to determine next treatment steps. Diagnosis varies by institution, but the main goal of all diagnostic modalities is to determine if there is a vascular cutoff causing tissue ischemia. At Regions Hospital, the main diagnostic method that has been used for over 20 years is conventional angiography. This clearly demonstrates the microvasculature of the tissues and allows the intra-arterial catheter directed sheaths to be placed to start thrombolytics, heparin, and vasodilators to treat the tissue ischemia. Other diagnostic modalities used elsewhere include Technetium 99 triple phase bone scans, SPECT imaging, and indocyanine green (ICG) microangiography. All of these imaging modalities demonstrate the perfusion of the affected tissue but do"

612,"[/INST] This is a study to improve the way of deciding whether a lump in soft tissue such as fat or muscle is a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma, or if it is benign using artificial intelligence (AI). Soft tissue sarcomas are a type of cancer that can appear anywhere in the body where there is soft tissue such as muscle or fat. While sarcomas are rare, benign lumps in soft tissue are common and it is currently very difficult to tell the difference between the two using imaging. This means many patients with benign masses are referred for painful biopsies and waiting lists for biopsies are long due to the large diagnostic workload. This research aims to develop an AI algorithm that can differentiate between benign and malignant soft tissue masses. While an algorithm can be developed using existing routine data the researchers would like to investigate if adding quantitative MR images could make it more accurate. Patients who are already having a scan for sarcoma will be asked if they consent to extra MR images being acquired. These images will be used to provide extra information to the AI. The extra images will add a maximum of 10 minutes to the patients' standard MRI scan, meaning patients will not need to make an extra trip or undergo any extra procedures. Study participants will not need to receive MR contrast as part of this research. The extra images will not be used to make a diagnosis during this research. A small subset of patients will be asked if they would be willing to come for a second scan so that the researchers can see how reliable the measurements are, but this will be entirely optional."

618,"[/INST] The incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men significantly increases with age and is estimated to impact over 80% of men 70 to 80 years of age. HoLEP is one of many treatments for BPH and associated lower urinary tract symptoms. Compared to other minimally invasive surgical techniques for treatment of BPH, HoLEP has been found to have superior outcomes and is a prostate size-independent procedure with excellent durability, high efficacy, and low complications rates. However, transient stress urinary incontinence (SUI) following HoLEP may last for several months after surgery and can lead to diminished patient quality of life during the recovery period. Measures to prevent or reduce post-operative SUI following HoLEP, including PFPT, may improve patient outcomes. SUI is also commonly documented after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. The mechanism for incontinence in both RP and HoLEP is thought to at least partially be related to temporary weakness of the external urinary sphincter, which is part of the pelvic floor musculature. While it is unclear if post-operative PFPT alone reduces SUI for patients who have undergone RP, there is evidence that PFPT started pre-operatively and continued post-operatively can decrease SUI following RP. To date, only one study has demonstrated evidence that PFPT prior to HoLEP may improve continence at 3 months. However, the study included patients with a BMI significantly lower than average in the United States, utilized an unclear PFPT program, and had a relatively small median prostate size ( 60 mL), which is important as studies have shown that prostate size can affect post-operative incontinence. We propose a prospective randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of standardized pre-operative PFPT in reducing SUI and improving patient QoL following HoLEP. This study will help determine the role of pre-operative PFPT in the management of HoLEP associated SUI."

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Low levels of physical activity (PA) among youth remain a significant public health problem, with most U.S. children falling short on the recommended 60 minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Research shows that this gap disproportionately affects population subgroups, particularly children who are female, overweight/obese, or from low socioeconomic areas. Interventions are needed that can equitably increase children's PA. To address this gap, there has been a focus in the U.S. and abroad on increasing children's physical literacy (PL), which can be defined as the ability, confidence, and motivation to be physically active for life. While PL-focused interventions hold promise in concept, there is little empirical evidence of effectiveness and differential effects by subgroups are not understood. Thus, the overall objective is to increase children's PA through a multilevel, comprehensive PL-focused program that will reach children both at school and at home. The overarching hypothesis is that the PL-focused program will have positive effects on elementary schoolchildren's PL and, in turn, PA. Aims include testing the multilevel Rising New York Road Runners (RNYRR) program using a 2-arm, group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with n=400 3rd-5th grade students from low-income schools receiving either the multilevel RNYRR program or delayed-intervention control. Aim 3: To evaluate the impact of the RNYRR program on children's physical literacy (PL) and physical activity (PA) (total daily volume and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA)) over one school year. Hypothesis: Children who attend schools with the RNYRR programming will increase PL and PA relative to children in control schools. Aim 3a: To examine whether RNYRR program effects on children's PL and PA differ by sex or weight status. Aim 3b: To test whether changes in PL and PL subdomains (e.g. ability, confidence, motivation) mediate changes in daily total PA volume or MVPA."

713,"[/INST] Remote Ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a non-pharmacological treatment that has been shown to reduce the risk of ischemic complications in patients at risk of ischemic events. The investigators believe that RIC is ideally suited to be tested as a therapy for progression in MS. Recent clinical trials in vascular disease have shown that daily RIC can be performed for up to a year and suggested an all-cause mortality benefit. In a recent (RICAMIS trial, 2022) multicenter, randomized trial of people with acute ischemic stroke (> 1,000 participants), 14-day RIC treatment led to improved functional outcomes at 6-months. No serious side effects were reported, and tolerability was good. This important study was the first phase III trial to find a protective effect for RIC in neurological disease, and highlights the timeliness and re-purposing RIC as a therapy for MS. In this trial, the investigators will investigate whether RIC treatment can prevent disability worsening in people with Primary Progressive MS (PPMS). The primary endpoint in this study will be the worsening of disability, defined as an increase by 20% or more in the timed 25-foot walk (average of two trials) at 12-months follow-up compared to baseline."

This was a retrospective observational study on tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) primary repair in National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita between January 2020 until December 2022. The preoperative demographic data included were patients' gender, age, weight, oxygen saturation, and associated diagnosis other than ToF. The preoperative data of complete blood count and differential count must be tested from the most recent peripheral blood samples taken no later than 14 days before the surgery. The data obtained were the number of days of the most recent blood test including the leukocyte count, percentage neutrophil, percentage and absolute lymphocyte count, thrombocyte count, as well as the derived variables such as neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ratio and thrombocyte lymphocyte ratio (TLR). The intraoperative data included were the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), CPB time, aortic cross-clamp (AOX) time, and the total duration of surgery. Patients were evaluated and followed up for any complications and postoperative mortality during the same hospital stay until discharge. Patients were then followed up for any cause of mortality within 30 days postoperative.

Study Overview
-----------------
This is a low-risk, single-center, interventional study, assessing whether capillary screening for an early staging of the most prevalent chronic metabolic, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases is feasible at a population-based level. The study will enroll volunteers from Cantalupo, a locality of 3095 inhabitants belonging to the Municipality of Cerro Maggiore (Milan). The main purpose is to assess feasibility and acceptability of using this public intervention. Secondary outcomes are: (i) measurement of the specific disease markers; (ii) estimation of the prevalence of the identified diseases within the population; (iii) estimation of the prevalence of the identified diseases across age classes; (iv) correlation of study disease indicators with demographics, anthropometrics and clinical data of the population , v) multiparametric risk assessment. Participants will be offered to undergo a capillary blood sampling to test blood glucose levels, glycated haemoglobin, total cholesterol , HDL-c, LDL-c, triglycerides, Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GADA), Insulinoma-Associated-2/Tyrosine Phosphatase (IA-2A), Insulin (IAA), Zinc Transporter-8 Autoantibodies (ZnT8A) for type I diabetes and tissue transglutaminase antibodies for celiac disease. Glucose and lipid blood levels will be detected at the time of the screening. The results of autoantibodies research for celiac disease and type 1 diabetes will be available within a few days. In case a participant screens positive for type I diabetes and/or celiac disease, they will be subsequently invited to undergo a new confirmatory blood draw on venous blood. Blood pressure will be also measured for each participant.

Study Overview
-----------------
Cardiac involvement is considered a serious condition and a frequent cause of death in patients with sarcoidosis. 18F-FDG PET/CT is currently used as part of the diagnostic work-up for cardiac sarcoidosis. Elaborate preparations are required for patients including either a low-carbohydrate diet followed by long fasting or heparin loading before FDG-PET. In heparin loading, the rare adverse effect of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be considered. Therefore, it is of interest to find a PET/CT tracer that displays high sensitivity and specificity without requiring thorough patient preparation and minimizing any adverse effects. A potential tracer is the somatostatin-based tracer 64Cu-DOTATATE, which is routinely used for the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac sarcoidosis due to its high specificity for somatostatin receptors. Inflammatory cells, including macrophages that are found in sarcoid granulomas, are expressed somatostatin receptor-positive macrophages. A detailed description of the clinical trial is provided below.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Many physical changes, as well as emotional disturbance, occur during pregnancy. In addition to external physical changes, some mental health problems such as depression, sleep and psychosis significantly increase during pregnancy. Subtle changes experienced by pregnant women can transform their ability to carry out their normal roles and may affect their quality of life, even if the pregnancy is normal. Aerobic exercises during pregnancy in primigravida females has a positive effect on depression and sleep as a primary and secondary preventive strategy. Indeed, exercise has many advantages that may make it a suitable treatment for depression in pregnancy. Pilates is considered a major exercise for improving physical, psychological, and motor functions in pregnancy. This exercise includes a series of low-pressure exercise that build strength and flexibility throughout the body. The study will be a randomized clinical trial and will be conducted in children hospital sheikhupura and Mehmooda hospital sheikhupura. This study will be completed in time duration of ten months after the approval of synopsis and convenient sampling technique will be used. Total foury two subjects will be assigned randomly by using lottery method into two groups. Group A will receive Aerobic exercises and Group B will receive Pilate exercises. Warm up (walking) and cool down period of ten minutes will be performed by both groups. Data will be collected from all participants at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment by using CES-D and PSQI questionnaire. After assessing the data will be analyzed by using parametric or non-parametric test by using SPSS-25."

812,"[/INST] This is a prospective cohort study of women > 18 years of age with symptoms of stress urinary incontinence, recruited via an online recruitment tool. After screening, patients meeting inclusion criteria will be given instructions on how to indicate desire to participate in the study. The patient will then be contacted for study participation, including explanation of study and details and completion of Informed Consent. Participants will then complete a pre-treatment urinary incontinence symptom questionnaire(ICIQ). After completion of the above, the participants will then be randomized to one of three arms: Pelex Upp (study device) only Pelvic floor physical therapy + Pelex Upp(device under study) Pelvic floor physical therapy only For those given a Pelex Upp, they will also receive educational materials on use of the device, and a treatment schedule. For those participants given a Pelex Upp, a standardized biofeedback-mediated pelvic floor muscle training program with the study device 10 minutes a day, four times a week, will be performed. There will be a mid-study check in to assure all devices are functioning appropriately. At the end of the study, participants will complete a post-treatment urinary incontinence symptom questionnaire(ICIQ). Endpoint of the study will be change in stress urinary incontinence symptoms as measured by the ICIQ. The ICIQ will be collected at 2 time points: before study entry, and at study close."

821,"[/INST] The effects of climate change on population health have considerably increased as the planet warms and is thus subjected to more heat waves, extreme weather events and food insecurity. Paradoxically, healthcare systems are major contributors to carbon emissions. Within the field of respirology, choice of inhaler is a low-hanging fruit to address this issue. Metered dose inhalers (MDI) contain potent greenhouse gases and have been shown to have a significantly larger carbon footprint than dry powder inhalers (DPI). Studies from the United Kingdom have revealed that although patient awareness of the discrepancy in climate impact of inhalers is low, their willingness to change inhalers after being educated on the subject is high. An example of inhaler change is to use the Bricanyl Turbuhaler (terbutaline) instead of Ventolin (salbutamol) as a rescue medication in asthma. They are both short-acting bronchodilators (SABA) and have similar pharmacodynamics. However, use of Bricanyl for one year produces 7,183 kgCO2e or the equivalent of 59.9km by car, whereas use of Ventolin for one year produces 411,720 kgCO2e, the equivalent of 3,431 km by car. The goal of the study is to assess asthma patients' willingness to change inhalers for environmental reasons as well as prescribers' willingness to prescribe a different inhaler for environmental reasons at the patient's request. The study will also be assessing patient awareness of the climate impact of inhalers and the importance that they attribute to this issue as well as other issues (cost and ease of use)."

Study Overview

Detailed Description
-----------------
Primary dysmenorrhea is a Greek term which means difficult flow and the term describe pain. Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common type of gynecological disorder among females worldwide. Some females may feel some associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting diarrhea, headache, dizziness and in severe conditions syncope. Primary dysmenorrhea is the pain which occurs just before menses. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs 6-12 months after the onset of ovulation cycle. Primary dysmenorrhea can be distinguished from secondary dysmenorrhea on the basis of symptoms and other pelvic or reproductive organ disorders. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, in secondary dysmenorrhea pain starts few days before the onset of menstrual cycles and may last longer than the cycle. The chances of secondary dysmenorrhea are more prevalent in females above the age of 20. A complete pelvic examination should be performed in females who are sexually active and have dysmenorrhea and those who are suspected to have endometriosis. In general population the prevalence of Primary dysmenorrhea is about 47-80%. Seventy five to eighty five percent of female have said to be experiencing mild to moderate pain. Primary dysmenorrhea is not life threatening and does not cause any disabilities but some researches have said that most young girls are reported to be absent from school/college and not being able to perform any activity due to the severity of pain. Some evidence shows the link between dysmenorrhea and prostaglandin, the level of prostaglandin is said to be increased and leads to uterine contraction and ischemia. The release of prostaglandin leads to excessive uterine contraction and the constriction of small endometrial blood vessels leads to ischemia and thus pain. The amount of prostaglandin is said to be increased during premenstrual phase in which progesterone level decreases and the level of prostaglandin increases in endometrial cells by the action of memb"

Study Overview
-----------------
Many children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are not identified and thus do not receive treatment. In a previous study, the investigators found that a clinical decision support system helped primary care providers identify children with OSA. In this system, parents of children report on possible OSA symptoms (e.g., snoring, apnea) in their child before the visit. If the child has OSA symptoms, the PCP receives an alert recommending further evaluation and a possible referral for a sleep study or to see a specialist. While this system helped increase the number of children with OSA symptoms who received a referral, many children remained unidentified. The goal of this study is to see whether involving parents in the system can identify even more children. In this study, the investigators propose to test the impact of a health communication message, designed to educate and activate parents about their child's risk for OSA. This message is an infographic that helps parents recognize nighttime symptoms of OSA and how these nighttime symptoms may be impacting their child. If a child has OSA symptoms, parents will view this infographic before their child's PCP visit and can discuss OSA with their child's PCP. For children with OSA symptoms, parents will be randomized to: 1) view the health communication message, or; 2) usual care, in which parents are not given any additional information about OSA or their child's risk for OSA. In both cases, PCPs will receive a prompt indicating that the child is at risk for OSA.

This is a study of the effectiveness of the Critical Time Intervention-Peer Support (CTI-PS) model for persons with serious mental illness discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities. The CTI-PS model is a time-limited, 9-month long intervention, provided at the critical time when a person is discharged from an inpatient psychiatric treatment facility. The intervention is designed to help individuals to collaborate with their peers to develop durable connections to support systems, including both formal and informal supports. The intervention focuses on areas identified as crucial for strengthening the individual's continuum of services and forming enduring links with their community supports. The phases of CTI are Initiation, Try-Out, and Transfer of Care. The PSW-CMHW will collaborate with the participants to identify barriers to their recovery and develop a sustainable plan to engage in and use community supports and resources during and after CTI. They will also use their knowledge to increase participants' autonomy, strengthen their connection to health services, and expand their support networks."

Study Overview
-----------------
The global aim of this research program is to identify technical, attitudinal, and motivational obstacles and solutions for people with PD for adopting technology to improve gait and to quantify changes in gait biomechanics that will make participants better and safer walkers, ultimately improving physical function, physical activity, motivation, and quality of life. Specific objective: Among members of the PQ who meet the criteria for technology readiness and have sufficient walking capacity to use the Heel2ToeTM sensor, the objectives are to estimate the extent to which they: (1) require support from the technology and rehabilitation team to optimize use; (2) use the sensor; (3) and change gait pattern, walking behaviours, motivation and functional and quality of life indicators over a period of 3 months. Design: An individualized, blocked, stepped-wedge design will be used, a design favoured for implementation science questions 63,64 and applicable here as the team does not have the resources to implement the technology to all participants all at once. Parkinson Quebec has provided funds to provide sensors for 100 people. Variable size clusters of people will be formed and randomized to receive the Heel2Toe sensor, training, and remote supervised use, at intervals of 3 weeks. The cluster size will be randomly determined ranging from 4 to 10. As everyone selected for the implementation has already filled out the survey, there is a common data set at project entry. This assessment will be repeated prior to being entered into the Heel2Toe phase and then 3 months later."

Study 1: Social Engage Coaching R61 Phase

Detailed Description
-----------------
The R61 phase is a single-arm trial of S-ENG plus eCAU (n=30) with 1 week of smartphone-based target assessment at baseline, 8-weeks and 16-weeks. Participants are 30 adults age 60 and older who report clinically significant loneliness and suicide ideation and reside in a senior living community (SLC). We will use ambulatory assessment via smartphones, including both active self-report (ecological momentary assessment, EMA) and passive sensing (audio recordings & GPS) to comprehensively assess indices of social connection. Subjects will complete EMA recordings using a smartphone daily following 3 personally-selected times for prompts (to enhance recall and ease of completion of assessments) for 10-days prior to starting study interventions, beginning the day after the baseline visit. Each EMA instance takes approximately 2-5 minutes to complete. EMA will be integrated with other smartphone technology to passively capture social behavior. The Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) will passively measure social behavior (i.e., conversation frequency, duration, and valence). GPS- will track time outside the home. Subjects will be given a study smartphone designed for older adults to use during assessment periods. All subjects who successfully complete the smartphone assessment protocol at baseline will be assigned to S-ENG. S-ENG involves 10 individual coaching sessions over (up to) 4 months. S-ENG is a stepped, modular intervention that addresses barriers to action plan implementation and challenges in processing positive outcomes when exposed to socially rewarding activities. Psychoeducation addresses the importance of social connection. Coaches are instructed to focus action plans on activities that foster social connection. The follow-up assessments at 8- and 16-weeks include baseline measures and smartphone measures."

This study aims to measure the effect of urolithin A supplementation on endothelial function, cerebral blood flow regulation, and serum biomarkers of NO bioavailability and mitochondrial function in middle-aged adults with obesity. Briefly, 54 adults aged 40-64 years of age with a body mass index equal to or greater than 30 kg/m2 will be recruited to participate in a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel study for 4 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Those in the intervention group will consume 1,000 mg of urolithin A daily in the form of softgel capsules, whereas those in the control group will consume a placebo. Data collection will occur at baseline (day 0) and endpoint (day 28). The investigators will compare outcomes between control and intervention group. Researchers expect that urolithin A supplementation in middle-aged adults with obesity improves endothelial function and cerebral blood flow regulation, and that this improvement is accompanied by changes in biomarkers of NO bioavailability and mitochondrial function."

The role of serum amyloid A in clinical decision-making concerning sarcoidosis patients

 Objectives: [O]

Primary objective: [P]

- To determine the correlation of mean serum concentration of serum amyloid A (SAA) in patients, newly diagnosed with intrathoracic sarcoidosis to mean value in healthy controls.

 Secondary objectives: [SO]

- To determine the correlation of serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis to serum concentrations of other biomarkers of granulomatous inflammation and pulmonary interstitial disease.
- To determine the correlation of serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis to pulmonary function test results.
- To determine the correlation of serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis to radiologic extent of disease.
- To determine the correlation of serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis to changes in lung function tests after 3 years of follow-up.
- To determine the correlation of serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis to changes in HRCT disease extent after 3 years of follow-up.
- To determine the correlation of serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis to the need for recent/ongoing therapy in patients, assessed at a 3-year follow-up.

 Hypothesis: [H]

It is hypothesized that serum concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA) at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis are lower in patients than in healthy controls.

 [H] is not expected to be confirmed.

 [H] is not expected to be refuted.
