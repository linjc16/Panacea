        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",

        "eval": "Goal Alignment: 0\nThe groundtruth summary discusses the aims of studying psychosocial factors and their associations with chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia, chronic migraine, and vulvodynia. The generated summary, however, focuses solely on the administration of self-report questionnaires and does not mention the study's goals or aims.\n\nPatient Recruiting Method: 0\nThe groundtruth summary mentions that patients will be recruited from several Italian centers specializing in the mentioned clinical conditions. The generated summary does not provide any information about patient recruitment methods.\n\nStudy Arm Consistency: 1\nBoth summaries mention the administration of self-report questionnaires, with the generated summary providing more details about the questionnaire protocol being divided into two parts (main and optional). There is some overlap in the description of the study arms, although the groundtruth summary does not provide these specific details.\n\nConclusion Similarity: 0\nThe groundtruth summary does not explicitly state a conclusion, as it is focused on describing the study aims and methods. The generated summary does not provide any conclusions either.\n\nSummary:\nGoal Alignment: 0\nPatient Recruiting Method: 0\nStudy Arm Consistency: 1\nConclusion Similarity: 0"
