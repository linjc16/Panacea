The study included 100 patients and was conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of SALD, which was defined as ALT or AST\u226520 folds upper limit of normal level or TBIL\u22652.0 mg/dL. The study found that elevated initial APRI value was associated with an increased risk of SALD.\n\nThe study used a retrospective design and included patients from the MIMIC IV database. The study excluded patients with chronic liver disease, viral hepatitis, primary acute cholangiopathies, cholecystitis, hepatic infarction, liver necrosis, liver trauma, and length of ICU stay < 24 hours. The study also excluded patients without simultaneous AST and PLT data in the first 24 hours after ICU admission.\n\nThe study found that the incidence of SALD was 20% in the non-SALD group and 40% in the SALD group. The study also found that the mean APRI value was significantly higher in the SALD group than in the non-SALD group. The study concluded that elevated initial APRI value was associated with an increased risk of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for the early detection and management of sepsis-associated liver dysfunction in adult patients with sepsis. The study suggests that monitoring APRI values in these patients may help identify those at risk of developing SALD and guide early interventions to prevent or manage the condition."

Additionally, the contrast group had a shorter hospital length of stay compared to the no contrast group (4.3 \u00b1 3.5 days vs 6.4 \u00b1 4.7 days, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in adverse events related to contrast administration between the two groups."

Please note that per Lawrence Hall policy, youth are selected by Lawrence Hall staff to participate in the Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy program while in residence. A group of closely-matched youth will also be selected by Lawrence Hall staff to serve as the waitlist control (treatment-as-usual) group. The Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy intervention is a 1.25 hour structured curriculum that will occur weekly across a period of 6 weeks. The program will be delivered by the Canine Therapy Corps (CTCorps). Youth will work with CTC-affiliate staff, including trained dog-handler teams, a canine behavior expert, and a clinical supervisor to engage in a series of structured activities progress throughout the intervention. Week 1 is a meet-and-greet session where youth are introduced to all dog-handler teams participating in the program and will be asked to select a team to work with for the following sessions. Each youth is assigned their own dog-handler team. Weeks 2 cover activities regarding dog obedience, building from mastering basic commands which the dog already knows (such as sit, stay') to the introduction of new tricks that the dog has not yet learned. In Weeks 3, youth will continue to work on mastering the new tricks with their dog-handler team and will also begin dog agility training. The agility training session progress in terms of complexity of number and types of obstacles. Week 4 is for proofing all skills (obedience, trick, agility) learned in previous sessions. Week 5 continues proofing all skills and is discussion of the graduation structure and dress rehearsal, and Week 6 is a graduation ceremony where family and friends are invited to observe the progress each youth has made with their dog-handler team.

Therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate.\n- Correctness: The information presented in the model summary is generally correct with minor inaccuracies. For example, it states that the study aims to identify patients at high risk of recurrent colorectal lesions, when in fact it aims to identify patients at high risk of metachronous lesions.

Overall, the model summary demonstrates a good understanding of the target summary, warranting a score of 2.\n- Conciseness: The model summary is reasonably concise but could be more succinct. It includes most of the important information in a concise manner, but there are some areas where it could be more condensed. For example, it repeats the phrase \"mutation profile\" multiple times. However, it does not contain unnecessary content and effectively presents the main points of the study. Therefore, a score of 1 is appropriate.",

The study will use pupillometry to measure pupil size in response to different light stimuli and will randomize participants to one of 8 different light stimuli within the pupillometry. The study will also measure melatonin levels from saliva collection during night 1 light box red light exposure and compare blue/green light exposure on night 2 to determine hormone response during blue/green light to that during red light on night 1. The study will include participants aged 18-85 years old and will accept healthy volunteers. The study will be conducted in a single group assignment with no masking. The study will measure primary outcome measures such as pupil size, melatonin levels for circadian timing assessment, and melatonin levels for hormone response.

The study will measure the primary outcome of serum hepcidin concentration and secondary outcomes including serum iron concentration, ferritin concentration, blood reticulocytes percentage, soluble transferrin receptor concentration, hemoglobin concentration, C-reactive protein concentration, leptin concentration, interleukin-6 concentration, lipopolysaccharides concentration, malondialdehyde concentration, trolox equivalents concentration, faecal microbiota composition, total cholesterol concentration, LDL cholesterol concentration, triglycerides concentration, aspartate aminotransferase concentration, alanine aminotransferase concentration, glucose concentration, body weight, fat mass percentage, waist circumference, lean mass percentage, and skeletal muscle mass percentage.\n\nThe study will provide valuable insights into the impact of weight loss on hepcidin levels and iron status in individuals with obesity, which can help inform the development of effective weight loss strategies for improving iron status in this population."
