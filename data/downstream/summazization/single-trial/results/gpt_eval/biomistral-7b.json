        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] The study aims to identify specific psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific to the onset and maintenance of chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia. The hypothesis is that specific psychological factors (clusters of high number of early traumatic events, high levels of central sensitization, and specific traits and defense mechanisms) characterize FM, CM, and VU groups compared to controls.",
        "eval": "Goal Alignment: 1\nThe generated summary correctly captures the primary goal of identifying specific psychosocial clusters of variables associated with chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia.\n\nPatient Recruiting Method: 1\nBoth summaries mention that patients will be recruited from specialized centers in Italy, although the generated summary does not provide specific details about the involvement of the research team from the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies.\n\nStudy Arm Consistency: 1\nThe generated summary mentions comparing the conditions of interest (chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia) with a control group of subjects with other types of chronic pain, which is consistent with the groundtruth summary.\n\nConclusion Similarity: 0\nThe generated summary does not provide any conclusions, while the groundtruth summary discusses the potential implications of the study findings for tailoring psychological treatments for these conditions.\n\nSummary of scores:\nGoal Alignment: 1, Patient Recruiting Method: 1, Study Arm Consistency: 1, Conclusion Similarity: 0"
