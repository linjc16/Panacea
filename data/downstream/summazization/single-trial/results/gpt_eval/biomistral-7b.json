The experimental group was told how to apply skin-to-skin contact. Skin-to-skin contact was initiated within the first minutes of normal delivery and skin-to-skin contact was applied to the mothers for a minimum of 15 minutes. The maternal attachment scale was completed 1 month after birth by telephone interview. The control group received standard midwifery practices and labor follow-up. The results of the study showed that skin-to-skin contact had a positive effect on maternal attachment and traumatic birth perception."

Clinical and radiographic examination of all the patients will be used to obtain baseline values (T0) and values 6 months post-treatment (T1). The presence and size of apical lesion will be assessed at T0 and T1, the percentage reduction of the lesion will be calculated and the PAI index will be used as a scoring system to assess the lesion. The success rate will be assessed for each group 6 months after completion of the treatment. Disinfection of the root canals will be assessed by analysis of colony formation (ufc/ml); biological samples will be taken with paper cones inserted into the root canals to the apical region at two moments: Baseline (before treatment, T0); after instrumentation with PDT (experimental groups) and without PDT (placebo group). Adverse events will be analysed; a serious adverse event for this study is any unfavourable odontological event that the investigators believe to bear a causal relation with the experimental intervention."

The secondary and tertiary aims are to evaluate client engagement with Horyzons and attrition as part of clinical care and assess the change in clients' psychological measures across in addition to their use of state-funded services (e.g., emergency department and social services) across the 12-month intervention. The study will recruit 20 clinicians and/or peer specialists from the FEP clinics and 50 individuals with FEP (i.e., first episode of a schizophrenia spectrum and other unspecified psychotic disorders). The study will assess the primary outcome measure, which is a qualitative summary of provider and peer support specialists (PSSs) participant feedback in post-treatment interview, and the secondary outcome measure, which is a quantitative summary of provider and PSS participant experience in post-treatment feedback. The study will also assess changes in engagement with Horyzons, changes in use of emergency and social services, and psychological measures across the 12-month intervention. The study will be conducted over a period of 12 months."

Lactulose is used as a substrate. Specifically, each patient is administered 20 g of lactulose diluted in 400 ml of water through the nasogastric tube. Measurements are performed at 0-15-30-45-60-90-120-180 min from lactulose administration. During measurements, a valve attached to a collecting bag at the end of the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit, is kept open and the collecting bag is filled by several patient exhalations. After valve closure and bag isolation, the air is drawn by a 50 ml polyethylene syringe which is connected to the valve system to prevent losses and/or contamination. Then the air is blown into the breath hydrogen monitor and the expired hydrogen measurement is recorded. The hydrogen breath test is repeated at predetermined, protocol-based time intervals for all participants included in the study; 1st/day of admission, 3rd, 5th and 7th day of ICU stay. The 1st day measurement serves as a measure of eligibility, and patients exhibiting abnormal values of hydrogen breath testing at Day 1 are excluded from the study. An increase by more than 20 ppm of eH2 from baseline within 90 min was considered an abnormal measurement suggesting SIBO. Moreover, an increase by more than 12 ppm of eH2 from baseline within the first 30 minutes followed by a second rise within the next 15 minutes (double peak) was also considered an abnormal measurement suggesting SIBO. The primary objective of this study is assessment of the prevalence of SIBO on critically ill mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Secondary outcomes include investigation of the effects of SIBO on ventilator associated pneumonia, as well as ICU length of stay and all-cause in-hospital mortality rate in critically ill patients."

        "model_output": "[/INST] The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensory stimulation in retinopathy examination on premature infants. Retinopathy is a common eye disorder among premature infants that can lead to long-term visual impairments if left untreated. Therefore, finding effective interventions for retinopathy examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. A randomized controlled experimental design was employed, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensory stimulation group. The white noise group received auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensory stimulation group received additional visual and tactile stimuli during the retinopathy examination. Several outcome measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. These measures included physiological responses (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), behavioral indicators (e.g., eye movement, crying), and overall examination success rate. The examination success rate was defined as the ability to complete the retinopathy examination without disturbances caused by infant distress or movement. The study employed trained healthcare professionals who performed retinopathy examinations using standardized procedures. Data collection was conducted in a controlled environment to ensure consistency across three groups. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and chi-square tests, were employed to compare the outcomes between the three groups. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated retinopathy examination protocols for premature infants. By comparing the effects of white noise and multisensory stimulation, the study aims to provide insights into the most suitable intervention that can optimize the examination process, improve examination success rates, and minimize potential discomfort or distress experienced by infants. It is anticipated that the results of this study will inform healthcare professionals and researchers about the benefits of auditory stimulation (white noise) and the additional advantages of multisensory stimulation during retinopathy examinations. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the overall quality of care provided to premature infants, leading to improved visual outcomes and long-term well-being for this vulnerable population."

The study evaluated the pain scores of all shoulder, neck, back, temporal, and herpes zoster pain. The pain scale is a tool that doctors use to help assess patients' pain. Each patient rated their pain on a scale of 0 to 10. 0 means no pain and 10 means the most painful. The study found that the 35kDa Hyaluronan fragment was effective in reducing pain in patients with shoulder, neck, back, and temporal pain and herpes zoster pain."

The study aims to investigate the etiology of persistent velopharyngeal insufficiency in children with operated velopalatine clefts by analyzing velopharyngeal motor skills in static and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study will include 20 children aged 7 to 12 years with isolated cleft lip, isolated velopalatal cleft without a diagnosis of syndromic cleft or Pierre Robin sequence, and operated with a cheiloplasty (for cleft lip) or an intravelar veloplasty (according to Sommerlad) at the Amiens University Hospital. The study will use dynamic and static MRI to assess velopharyngeal motor skills and will compare the results to those of a control group of children with normal velar anatomy and soft VPI. The study will also assess the ratio between the diameter of the pharynx at rest and during phonation, the closure distance between the velar knee and the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the distance between the velar knee and the posterior pharyngeal wall. The study will be conducted at the Amiens University Hospital and will use a 3T TX DStream Philips\u00ae and a 33 channels head and neck coil for MRI. An elastic strap will be fixed to the forehead to limit movement during the scan, and a headset will be used to cancel the loud MRI noise and to communicate with the subjects.
