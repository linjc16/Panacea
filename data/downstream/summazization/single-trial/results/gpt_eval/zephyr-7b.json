        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

Because these patients generally have favorable outcomes no matter the kind of treatment, reducing side effects should be a priority when choosing their treatment.\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate whether a new blood test called a Circulating Tumor DNA test (ctDNA test) can decrease the number of people that require radiation after surgery. This blood test is often elevated in people when they are diagnosed with head and neck cancer. There are studies that show that cancer most often returns when this blood test is positive after treatment. This study will test patients' blood before and after surgery. In cases where the test is negative after surgery, people on the study will not receive radiation unless they are considered high risk based on surgery findings.

To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them.

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine",

Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH.

This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

The study is open-label as both participants and researchers are aware of the treatment, necessary due to the differing tastes of the solutions. Two centers, Royal Brompton Hospital in London and Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham, will conduct the research.\nBefore starting the treatment, participants will undergo various assessments, including questionnaires to measure quality of life and treatment satisfaction, sputum/throat swab collection, lung clearance index, forced oscillation technique, electrical impedance tomography, and lung ultrasound. Once these assessments are completed, participants will take the assigned treatment at home, administered twice daily for 12 months, with monthly follow-ups regarding difficulties and chest infections.

        "summary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",

The primary objective of the trial is to dynamically assess circulating alterations associated with resistance to Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (as second line treatment), including changes of the HER2 status by a novel approach named HER2-2D that simultaneously assesses HER2 amplification and (over)expression in blood. The primary endpoint is the concordance between the clinical evaluation (progressive disease versus not progressive disease) based on RECIST criteria and the evaluation of liquid biopsy, (appearance of a new mutation and/or increasing of an existing one). Secondary objectives include: 1) molecular stratification of patients (dynamic approach by liquid biopsy); 2) lead time (anticipation of progression) assessment by liquid biopsy; 2) HER2-2D: use of a non-invasive liquid biopsy method to non-invasively and objectively assess HER2 status and to select patients displaying a HER2-low status.

This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

        "summary": "Extranodal extension (ENE) refers to the spread of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) outside the lymph nodes. It is a well-known factor that indicates a poorer prognosis and outcome for patients who have undergone surgical removal of the cancer. In such cases, it is recommended to combine chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery.\nAs the number of cases of HNSCC related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) is increasing, treatment approaches have shifted towards using radiation therapy as the primary treatment method instead of surgery. This raises an important question about the significance of ENE observed through imaging tests (referred to as iENE) and its impact on the prognosis. Unfortunately, this question remains unanswered.\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study across multiple medical institutions. The investigators will gather data including scan results, histopathology reports, and data from patient charts from individuals who have been treated for head and neck cancer. The aim is to analyze and correlate the findings between the pathological evidence of ENE and the imaging results, while also assessing the prognostic value of iENE. Additionally, the investigators will explore the influence of HPV status on these factors.\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, the investigators hope to establish standardized criteria that can assist radiologists in accurately identifying ENE through imaging tests. This research is essential for enhancing our understanding of HNSCC and improving the effectiveness of diagnostic procedures and treatment planning.",

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",

Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity. BLEX 404 enhances hematopoiesis by increasing mouse bone marrow cell and human cord blood cell differentiation into granulocytes-macrophages (GMs), granulopoiesis and mobilization of granulocytes, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF production. One related phase I healthy human trial by treating with Maitake D-fraction was examined in Italy. The published data of trial for solid tumor patients was in the year 2003 in Japan, and another for breast cancer patients was in the year 2009 in the United States executed by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Lately, same team amended IND for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) human trial. All those human experiences are the fundamental of developing BLEX 404 Oral Liquid.",

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

        "summary": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common gastroenterological disorders with a reported prevalence of 10% to 20% percent in Europe and the USA and less than 5% in Asia. GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores.

It is characterized by a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (path_MMR) MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or a deletion in the 3' region of the Epcam gene. Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS.

Recent research has shown Egypt to be the third-largest country globally, with an estimated 52% cesarean sections (3). However, the cesarean section has many serious complications, including the primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (4). During labor, the average blood loss is about 300 to 400 ml. Bleeding postpartum is known as losing over five hundred milliliter of blood following a vaginal birth and losing over one thousand milliliter after the cesarean section (5). The prime cause of maternal death rate is postpartum bleeding, predominately in poor countries, and the estimated mortality number due to postpartum bleeding is one hundred thousand per year (6). Therefore, it is essential to reduce bleeding during and after CS to diminish maternal mortality and morbidity (7). The most successful technique for decreasing PPH is the active third stage labor management, requiring prophylactic uterotonic drugs like oxytocin, ergometrine malate, prostaglandins (E1, E2, and F2\u03b1), and combinations of them, or hemostatic agent as tranexamic acid (Kapron) and Etamsylate (Dicynon) (8, 9).",

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment. Thus, the role of pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for five days in volunteers undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (BVR) will be investigated in order to verify the vascular expression of SPhk1, transcriptome and vascular proteome remodeling, as well as S1P content in HDL.",

        "summary": "In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",

        "summary": "Despite progress in chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still the only curative procedure for some hematological malignancies. The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old. The co-transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) at the time of transplantation has previously shown a double interest in GvHD immunomodulation and hematopoiesis support. Pre-clinical studies (in mice) have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from Wharton's Jelly reduce the incidence of GvHD when the infusions are weekly repeated.

The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility.

Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment.

At present, a functional cure, also known as clinical cure or sustained Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, is recommended as the ideal endpoint of HBV treatment. However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection. In this study, a large multicenter prospective study will be performed to explore the safety and efficacy of a novel combination strategy involving immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 antibody) and IFN\u03b1 in CHB patients, observe the HBsAg loss rate in NA-treated CHB patients receiving this combination strategy, evaluate the potential of breaking immune tolerance by this strategy, and further assess its efficacy to further improve the clinical cure rate on the basis of New Switch Study. Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients.

Cancer cells that make too much HER2 may grow more quickly and are more likely to spread to other parts of the body as metastases, including the central nervous system. Trotabresib is part of a family of drugs called BET inhibitors. Trotabresib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Vinorelbine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells in your body.

        "summary": "Over 65% of all lung cancer patients experience significant weight loss fuelled by a catabolic state that is represented by enhanced protein breakdown. The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period. The secondary aim is to investigate the feasibility for the subjects to comply with the study protocol. Lastly, the investigators aim to study the feasibility of gathering data on a number of exploratory parameters that may link nutritional intake to clinically relevant outcomes.",

According to statistics, the incidence of nerve root injury under spinal endoscope is 1.8-2.5%. Damage to nerve roots may lead to postoperative sensory retardation and motor weakness, thereby impairing the physical function of patients. A real-time auxiliary intraoperative nerve identification technology is necessary.\nIn this prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel controlled trial, 40 patients who undergo endoscopic spinal surgery are included. Subjects are randomly divided into control group and low, medium and high Indocyanine green(ICG) preoperative administration experimental group. Standard endoscopic spinal surgery is performed in the control group. Patients in the experimental group received an intravenous injection of ICG before surgery, and a standard endoscopic spinal surgery is performed with the use of a fluoroscopic endoscopic surgical imaging system to assist the surgeon in identifying and protecting the nerve roots.\nThe main objectives of this experiment are (i) to explore the safety and feasibility of ICG fluorescence imaging to assist in nerve root identification during endoscopic spinal surgery and (ii) the effectiveness of this technique for endoscopic search for nerve roots.

        "summary": "Background: Parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) have a tendency to provide insufficient caregiving and often need parenting support to prevent neglect and child removal. However, parents with IDDs are not provided with appropriate support, and there is a lack of evidence-based programmes tailored to these parents' needs. Parenting Young Children (PYC) is a home-based parenting programme developed for parents with IDDs. PYC has shown promising clinical results in interview-based studies, but there is no evidence of its effectiveness. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the PYC programme for improving parenting in parents with IDDs where there is risk of child neglect. The study will include a quantitative evaluation, a process evaluation, and a qualitative evaluation of the children's and parents' perspectives on participating in PYC.\nMethods: The quantitative evaluation will have a multi-centre, non-randomised, comparative study design. Eligible for participation are parents with IDDs who have children aged 0-9 years living at home and who are assessed as needing tailored parenting support. Thirty parents receiving PYC and thirty parents receiving treatment as usual (TAU) will be recruited from Swedish municipal social services. Outcome variables will be examined before and after the intervention, with a follow-up 6 months after completing the intervention. The primary outcome will be goal-attainment in parenting skills, and secondary outcomes will be parental self-efficacy and children's wellbeing. Interview methods will be used to explore the perspectives of parents and children in the PYC group.\nDiscussion: This study is motivated by the need for evidence-based support for parents with IDDs, and it focuses on upholding the centrality of child-caregiver relationships and family preservation, as well as children's rights and the rights of people with disabilities. Social services have expressed ethical concerns with employing a randomized design for this vulnerable group, and this study will therefore evaluate PYC in a non-randomized comparative study.",

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",

One potential way to address this challenge is to offer community-based services for individuals who are high-utilizers of expensive emergency and inpatient psychiatric services. Due to the decentralized nature of California governance, responsibility for mental health services falls primarily to the individual counties. The County of Santa Clara, CA invests significantly in community-based services as well as 24-hour care settings. This County adopted an innovative Pay for Performance (PFP) model and contracted with a new care provider to better meet the needs of this patient population and, in turn, reduce demand on the County's 24-hour psychiatric services. Whether this innovative contracting framework will help individuals who thus far have not responded well to mental health services is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the quality of care for these high-need patients was improved and at a sustainable cost. To this end, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted to determine whether this innovative quality improvement initiative, referred to as Partners in Wellness, was successful at reducing the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric care used by enrollees compared to individuals who concurrently received services from the county. Individuals were randomly assigned to the Usual Care (UC) or Pay-For-Performance (PFP) conditions.

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators also hypothesize that the CBT-informed intervention will be more effective than the attitudinal inoculation intervention for increasing COVID-19 vaccination among participants with symptoms of anxiety or depression.",

Personalised Follow-Up (PFU) focuses on the tailored needs of patients who have completed cancer treatment and PFU programmes have been established nationally for patients with breast and colorectal cancer. PFU for Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) services will be established nationally by 2024. Currently, there is a lack of evidence that measures prospectively the impact of PFU on patients and providers.\nIn January 2022, Guys and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust initiated PFU for patients with HNC. For the first 2 years following treatment, patients treated curatively are followed up according to institutional protocol. At 2 years following completion of treatment, patients who remain disease free, have no significant risk factors for recurrence and no severe treatment-related toxicity are referred to the programme and discharged from routine oncology FU. Patients are reviewed in a nurse-led HNC PFU clinic where they receive personalised survivorship, health promotion and education in identifying signs of disease recurrence with information on the pathway to re-present directly to the services at Guy's Cancer.\nThis mixed methods research project will evaluate implementation factors of this new PFU programme whilst prospectively measuring its effectiveness. A hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness study design will be used to determine the value patients and health care providers (HCP). Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with patients and HCP will be undertaken to evaluate barriers and facilitators, safety, acceptability and user experience.

It produces dose-dependent sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia without respiratory depression. Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase agent, which inhibits the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by competing with acetylcholine for attachment to acetyl cholinesterase; administration of Neostigmine through intrathecal route apparently activates the descending pain inhibitory system that relies on spinal cholinergic interneuron. Study conducted to evaluate whether neostigmine given by intrathecal route with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia can provide prolongation of sensory blockade duration as effective as dexmedetomidine given by the same route and in compination with same drug with lower cost, more stable hemodynamics and comparable side effects.

Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide. The researchers will perform a spontaneous, prospective, randomized trial aiming at investigating the effect of combined furosemide-induced diuresis and automated matched dehydration, compared with standard furosemide administration in ADHF patients with fluid overload.",

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent.

Psychiatric, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are examples of conditions that impact the health and quality of life of the population. Due to the effects provided by exercise, it can modify the natural course of these diseases. This concept is important to justify the efforts made by government bodies committed to promoting exercise, such as the WHO. However, the habitual practice of physical activity following the primary guidelines may be hampered by some factors, including those that support the physiological repercussions of exercise on the body, such as muscle pain. In this sense, an important complicating factor such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), present in the post-exercise recovery period, can impair adherence and permanence in physical activity programs, thus representing a considerable barrier to exercise promotion. They can also severely impair the performance of high-level athletes. Flavonoids, present in plants, but also in foods of the human diet, are known to have several biological properties, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects.

Therefore, we want to run a pilot study to test specific psychotherapeutic interventions for patients with psychosis on acute psychiatric wards.\nThe method of Motivational Interviewing is a well-known and established interviewing technique, which originally comes from the treatment of addictive disorders. In our study, it is used to strengthen the therapeutic alliance between patient and practitioner already in the acute phase of the disease, to increase adherence, and thus to achieve the overall goal of better integrating patients with pronounced positive symptoms into treatment.

        "summary": "Approximately 65, 000 hip fractures occur in the United Kingdom (UK) each year, and more than 99% are repaired by surgery. Roughly half of patients receive spinal anaesthesia, where a small amount (usually less than half a teaspoonful) of local anaesthetic is injected into the lower back, around the nerves that go to and from the hip.\nLow blood pressure is very common during surgery (at least > 30%, depending on definition), and appears to be linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery.\nThere are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. National guidelines recommend that lower doses are given, but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately or often enough.\nThe Anaesthesia Sprint Audit of Practice (ASAP) 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.5 mls of spinal anaesthesia is given, and the investigator has been using this amount in Brighton since 2011. Recently, the investigator has reported a way of transferring vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (e.g. in Coroner's investigations: approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery).\nHowever, analyzing such observational data should also allow the investigator to describe accurately how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (e.g. the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, the investigator hopes to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery, potentially improving people's survival and recovery after hip fracture.",

        "summary": "Electro fetal monitor monitoring in the antepartum and intrapartum periods is one of the most important responsibilities of midwives, who have important roles and responsibilities in maintaining and managing the health of women and newborns before, during and after delivery. Although midwives receive training on EFM monitoring with classical methods before graduation, they may experience problems in EFM monitoring in the clinical field after graduation. For this reason, midwife students should have the knowledge, skills and self-efficacy about a good level of EFM monitoring during their undergraduate education. In recent years, simulation-based education in the field of health has increased rapidly. This method creates an opportunity for health professionals, students, patient assessment, interaction and holistic care without compromising patient safety, and develops participants' critical thinking, clinical decision making and problem solving skills.\nIn this context, it is very important to evaluate the EFM trace in the antepartum and intrapartum periods, to determine the possible risks, to plan, implement and evaluate the interventions, to provide the emergency crisis management in a short time without affecting the fetal health, and to increase the self-confidence of the midwives.\nThe research was planned quantitatively in the form of randomized control-intervention of the scenario-based realistic simulation method, to increase the satisfaction and self-confidence levels of midwifery students in learning, to evaluate the simulation design and educational effectiveness, in EFM management. The research will facilitate midwifery students to intervene with the patient in a shorter time, with confidence and with sufficient clinical skills, and patient safety will be increased. It will also allow for the reduction of erroneous clinical practices and malpractices.\nThis research aims to evaluate the effect of high-fidelity simulation teaching method on knowledge, satisfaction and self-efficacy of midwifery students in EFM follow-up.",

Crohn's disease can lead to nutrient deficiencies and has unpredictable flare-ups and remission periods. During the remission phases, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms can persist in 50% of patients, for which no satisfactory treatment is available yet.\nChitin-glucan is prebiotic, obtained by extraction, isolation and purification from a fungal resource: the mycelium of Aspergillus niger (a microscopic fungus of the Ascomycetes family) of which it composes the cell walls. The biopolymer consists essentially of two types of polysaccharide chains: chitin (poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) and beta-(1,3)-D-glucan (D-glucose units linked essentially via beta-1,3 bonds). Because of its beta bond, human intestinal enzymes cannot digest it, as a result, the majority of chitin-glucan can reach the colon where it can be fermented by the microbiota.\nBy modulating the composition and/or activity of the intestinal microbiota, fermentation of chitin-glucan could have beneficial effects on health.\nThe aim of the RELIEVE study is to assess if BK003 could improve the relief of global symptoms, individual symptoms, stool consistency and frequency of evacuations, quality of life, anxiety, and depression in patients with Crohn's disease in remission without treatment or with stable maintenance therapy and having IBS-like symptoms and to confirm the product's safety.",

        "summary": "The unexpected changes caused by the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can lead individuals to question their beliefs, life meanings, and goals, prompting a search for meaning. According to Park and Folkman's (1997) Meaning-Making Model, the process of meaning making functions as a coping mechanism. It helps individuals adapt challenging experiences into their lives, ultimately assisting in their psychological adjustment to stressful situations. Based on this theoretical model, principles from meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), literature reviews, interviews with breast cancer patients, and expert consultation, an 8-week online individual psychological intervention was developed. It was aimed at facilitating the finding of new meanings in the experience of breast cancer and promoting psychological well-being. It includes psycho-educational, cognitive, existential, and behavioral components explicitly focusing on the meaning-making process. This intervention is called the Meaning Centered Coping Program (MCCP). The main purpose of this study was to test whether the MCCP was an effective intervention program for women diagnosed with breast cancer. For this purpose, the study sample consisted of women with stage I, II, and III breast cancer. Then, participants were randomly assigned to the MCCP group and the wait-list control group. A number of reliable and valid measurement tools were used to compare the MCCP group with the waitlist control group and to examine the effect of the program. Compared with the control group, significant improvements were expected in the level of meaning in life, post-traumatic growth, situational meanings, psychological inflexibility, and psychological well-being in the MCCP group.",

Anaesthetic drugs may change how a child's genes are expressed\u037e a process called epigenetics. Studies have shown that different anaesthetic drugs can cause epigenetic changes in animals and affect the processing ability of their brains.\nThis study will focus on children aged under 3 undergoing general anaesthesia for planned hypospadias surgery (a developmental condition where the look and function of the penis may not be completely normally). Participants will either receive their general anaesthetic in gas form or through directly into their veins - both techniques are commonly used.

        "summary": "Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism can have multiple causes; most patients suffer from primary autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma, or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease occur. Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",

The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours.

        "summary": "Preterm infants, 1 in 12 Canadian births, are at a significant increased risk of poor health outcomes, resulting in high healthcare burden. Parents of these infants report lower self-efficacy and worse mental health when compared to parents of term infants. There is an urgent need to use effective ways to improve parental self-efficacy and associated parent psychosocial and infant health outcomes. To improve parent and baby outcomes, the investigators will build on an existing eHealth solution to create Chez NICU Home+ (CNH+), which offers web-based, parent-targeted, interactive educational tools, virtual communication, and text message support during a baby's NICU stay. We will evaluate whether Chez NICU Home+ improves parental self-efficacy (primary outcome), parent psychosocial, and infant health outcomes in parents of babies requiring a NICU stay, and the implementation (ease and uptake) of Chez NICU Home+ in multiple sites. This study will be a multicentre implementation study, with a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial across four Canadian NICUs. At the beginning of the study, data regarding current care will be collected from all sites to determine a baseline. Following baseline data collection, every five months one of the sites will start using the Chez NICU Home+ solution. A total of 800 parents and their babies, who are expected to stay at least 5 days in the NICU, will be recruited. Parents will complete a survey on psychosocial adjustment and infant outcomes when the study begins, as well as at 14 and 21 days after enrollment, at infant discharge from the NICU, and at 6 months post-discharge. Infant health and development outcomes will be collected at discharge, 6 and 18 months post-discharge via health records. The investigators predict that Chez NICU Home+ will be a positive, interactive care option, combining virtual parent education, tailored communication, and support, which will improve parental self-efficacy and parent psychosocial and infant health outcomes, and have long-term benefits for families.",

Complications associated with these surgeries include hematoma and seroma. Prior studies in orthopedics, plastic surgery, and trauma have shown significant reduction of bleeding and ecchymosis with the use of tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA is a synthetic amino acid that blocks plasminogen conversion to plasmin, to stabilize clot formation. The intravenous (IV) efficacy in reducing hematoma rates has been established in implant-based breast reconstruction, as well as in reduction mammaplasty.

        "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effects of shorter chemotherapy (chemo)-immunotherapy without anthracyclines to usual chemo-immunotherapy for the treatment of early-stage triple negative breast cancer. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy drug that damages DNA and may kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Shorter treatment without anthracycline chemotherapy may work the same as the usual anthracycline chemotherapy treatment for early-stage triple negative breast cancer.",

        "summary": "The proposed project seeks to achieve four objectives that will, collectively, evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP-1) -a model for a home visitation and case management program for parents who used substances during pregnancy. First, the proposed project aims to estimate the causal impact of PCAP-1 on preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. Second, the project will estimate PCAP-1's effectiveness in achieving other program goals: parent recovery, parent's connection with needed comprehensive community resources, and preventing future children from being exposed to drugs and alcohol prenatally. Third, the project intends to estimate any cost savings from the perspective of the state. Finally, causal evidence of program effectiveness across the prior three objectives would enable PCAP-1 to be rated according to strength of evidence on relevant federal registries (i.e., FFPSA and HOMEVEE). All four objectives will be pursued by leveraging an ongoing randomized control trial (RCT) of PCAP with substantial backing from public and private partners, including the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OK's Title IV-E agency). This quasi-experimental project will recruit 40 new participants to receive PCAP-1 services and will use data on participants from the existing trial for the control group. This extension of the original RCT is efficient and highly feasible, drawing upon and adapting an existing evaluation framework and protocol. This design will facilitate an unbiased estimation of one-year program effectiveness while also enabling a comparison of the differential effectiveness of PCAP-1 and the original three-year PCAP model as a secondary benefit. Moreover, given that the population PCAP serves are disproportionately poor and low-income and PCAP is designed to be culturally competent and relevant, PCAP-1 harbors the potential to address inequities in child welfare outcomes, substance use disorder treatment services, and child and family well- being by improving outcomes for these families. With a strong backing by state agencies and community partners, the evaluation of PCAP-1 will contribute to a knowledge gap in the field for in-home program models serving a highly vulnerable population with high rates of child welfare involvement and use of foster care.",

As medical research and technology have advanced more and more children in the PICU are surviving, however in turn incurring new and persistent impairments across physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains of health. This phenomenon is often referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments not only impact the patient but parents have also been found to have poor emotional health outcomes following discharge from the PICU.\nConsistently, parents/caregivers of children admitted to the PICU report their primary concerns to be 1) the overwhelming physical environment of the PICU, 2) uncertainty about the child's survivorship and outcomes, 3) relationships and communication with staff, and 4) feeling helpless. Additionally, research has shown that caregiver-perceived stress during the child's hospitalization positively predicts post-traumatic stress three months after discharge for parents/caregivers (Nelson et al., 2019), which may translate into higher risk and duration of post-traumatic stress in their children. Therefore, providing an in-hospital outlet such as a PICU Journal for patients and families to express their subjective experiences may help bridge the gap between perception and reality as a means of buffering against post-traumatic responses. Conceptually, a semi-structured journal intervention may integrate the therapeutic aspects of journaling while also providing pertinent information and serving as an advocacy and communication tool. Prior research has demonstrated the use of a PICU Journal is feasible for implementation and has been well-received by families of children in the PICU (Herrup et al., 2019).\nTherefore, the aims of this mixed-method study are to 1) examine the relationship between this journaling intervention and the perceived stress, care engagement, symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and the development of PICS in parents of children hospitalized in the PICU, and 2) examine the relationship between parent participation in this intervention and the development of PICS-p in children, and 3) assess the feasibility of this intervention from key stakeholders.",

Depending on the extent of the cleft palate, the degree of functional loss varies, but both eating, hearing, speech, bite and appearance can be affected.\nPatients treated for isolated or combined cleft palate may suffer from velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), which means difficulties in closing the passage between the oral and nasal cavities during speech. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is associated with hypernasality, audible nasal air leakage and weak articulation, which might lead to difficulties with communication and social stigmatization.\nThe most common form of speech-improving surgery is a posterior based velopharyngeal flap, creating a bridge between the palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall to more easily compensate for the abnormal airflow through the nose during speech. However, surgical management of VPI is challenging, with variable success rates reported in the literature. In a retrospectively based questionnaire study on patients who underwent surgical treatment of VPI, 30% experienced only a small speech improvement or no improvement at all. In addition, postoperative speech impairment have also been reported, as well as perioperative bleeding and postoperative sleep apnea.

As a consequence, even uncommon complications can affect large numbers of patients. Among potentially life-threatening events, vaginal cuff dehiscence complicates 0.14-1.38% of procedures, and any vaginal cuff complications (dehiscence, hematoma, bleeding, infection) are estimated to affect 4.7-9.8% of patients. In this scenario, any preventive strategy can provide clinically relevant benefits. Regarding colporrhaphy, only the adoption of a laparoscopic approach instead of a vaginal approach is supported by high-quality evidence. Our group demonstrated that the laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff after total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces the incidence of vaginal cuff complications.\nAmong other potentially effective interventions, the use of barbed sutures was associated with a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence than the standard suture. In a recent meta-analysis, the use of barbed sutures has been associated with a pooled incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence of 0.4% versus 2% after a traditional vaginal suture. However, this evidence is limited because most pooled studies were retrospective, and only two were randomized controlled trials. Moreover, these two randomized controlled trials had a very small sample size and were not powered to detect clinically relevant differences. On that basis, despite the promising utility of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the choice of the type of suture is not evidence-based but still guided by personal opinions, as well as by the preference and habits of the operators.\nTherefore, this study aims to investigate whether the laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure with barbed suture determines a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence and complications than conventional sutures after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing quick access to transactions, providing ease of use and sometimes as a status indicator, can pose a risk of addiction when used uncontrolled. Since young people are more intertwined with technology and use smartphones more, they are at greater risk of addiction and the problems that addiction can cause. Poor sleep quality is an important problem that can occur with smartphone addiction and negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Smartphone addiction and the problems it causes are an important public health problem that threatens the whole society, especially young people. In solving this problem, it is among the duties of nurses to teach individuals healthy lifestyle behaviors instead of problematic behaviors. A road map is needed to facilitate the behavior change process. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is widely used today to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which targets interventions appropriate to the individual's stage of change, is used as a guide that facilitates behavioral change. TTM is a model that contributes to change, accelerates it, and supports individuals considering change. In addition to TTM, another method that is more frequently used and contributes to change, especially in addicted individuals, is the motivational interviewing method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and aims to reveal the individual's internal motivation. It is thought that the university years, which are an important period in terms of developing and maintaining health-protective and preventive behaviors, will both increase students' health responsibility and protect them from health-threatening behaviors with the healthy lifestyle behaviors acquired during this period.

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide and second leading cause of cancer death. Most CRCs arise from a polyp, developing through two major precursor lesion pathways: the traditional adenoma-carcinoma pathway, and the serrated neoplasia pathway. This provides opportunities to prevent cancer by removing its precursor lesions. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of precancerous polyps with colonoscopy and detection of early-stage CRC, which has been demonstrated to reduce CRC incidence and mortality effectively, making CRC one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer.\nCurrent guidelines in China recommend starting CRC screening uniformly at age 50 in average-risk individuals. However, a one-fits-all approach to determining CRC screening starting age may be not conducive to personalized screening, especially in the developing countries with scarce health resources. The incidence of early-onset CRC (CRC diagnosed before the age of 50) has shown a continuous increasing trend worldwide, spurring the US Preventive Services Task Force to recommend initiating average-risk CRC screening at age 45 instead of 50. Furthermore, different populations may benefit from even earlier screening, and CRC incidence may differ on the basis of population characteristics and CRC risk factors. For individuals younger than 50 years old, earlier screening based on risk factors may address this concern.\nPrevious studies have recommended earlier starting age of CRC screening combined with risk factors such as but not limited to sex, age, family history, lifestyle and comorbidity. Some upper gastrointestinal diseases have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasms, which may be related to the destruction of gastric acid barrier function and long-term use of pump proton inhibitors. Compared with colonoscopy examination, individuals were more willing to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination for gastric cancer screening, especially among the younger, potentially utilizing the EGD to guide earlier colonoscopies for patients at increased risk.

        "summary": "Under normal conditions, pain arises as a consequence of the activation of nociceptive afferents (small fibers) by an external stimulus with sufficient intensity to potentially cause tissue damage. This peripheral activation is processed as perception of pain by the central nervous system. In order to reliably evaluate the state of the nociceptive system in both clinical and experimental settings, standardized tests are essential. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a set of tests used to measure the intensity of a stimulus that produces a specific sensory perception in a subject. For example, if we gradually apply pressure, the point where the sensation changes from pressure to pain is called the pressure pain threshold. This type of test can be performed with different types of stimuli, including hot and cold stimuli or mechanical stimuli. Although these tests have been shown as reliable in healthy volunteers and pain patients, they are subjective in their nature, since they are based on a conscious evaluation of tested subjects. Likewise, these measures show substantial variability due to differences in the application of the tests by individual examinators. In short, even though the method is quantitative, its methodological characteristics make it subjective and dependent on both the operator and the subject under study. Moreover, contrasting results have been recently found regarding the measurement variability when repeating the QST at intervals of days. Thus, it is essential to investigate and develop new QST alternatives to obtain objective markers that may potentially contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind chronic pain conditions.",

        "summary": "In a society with increased life expectancy, the economic, social and personal burden of dementia increases. Dementia is often caused by a combination of neurovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Impaired brain clearance is suggested to be closely related to dementia development, as waste products (e.g. amyloid beta) accumulate in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the most common neurovascular disease that even contributes to about 45% of dementia pathophysiology in patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMH) are the key brain MRI manifestation of cerebral SVD. There is evidence that the currently known and MRI-visible WMH are landmarks of an already progressed stage of the underlying pathology. The pathophysiology of WMH has been attributed to multiple underlying mechanisms, such as hypoperfusion, defective cerebrovascular reactivity and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, different anatomical locations and different types of WMH are related to different underlying pathological changes. Using ultra-high field 7T MR imaging techniques WMH lesions can be detected with a higher sensitivity and resolution than on 3T MRI. The hypothesis is that different pathological mechanisms of cerebral SVD lead to variations in WMH shape. Moreover, the brain clearance ('glymphatic') system of the brain appears to be tightly connected to dementia pathology. Thus, novel markers of glymphatic activity could aid to describe and understand the pathology.",

In this perspective, the SeDeN project aims to fully assess the social acceptability of these issues by measuring the diversity and consistency of expectations of French health professionals, parents and public policy makers.\nThe SeDeN-p3 Study focuses on the opinions of parents. It aims to analyze the perception of parents in different situations: birth, early childhood, child screened in the framework of the national neonatal screening program, etc. The objective of this part is to study the understanding and expectations of parents in France regarding the extension of newborn screening as well as their preferences regarding its conditions (information, types of pathologies, screening methods, etc.).",

However, common genetic mutations are known for both diseases.\nThe aim of the study is to provide a scientific basis for molecular genetic NBS for cystinosis and primary hyperoxaluria (PH). Specifically, the study will investigate whether the inclusion of these diseases into general NBS should be recommended. By observing the identified infants in comparison to patients symptomatically diagnosed outside of the pilot project, it will be determined whether and to what extent early diagnosis and therapy lead to a more favorable prognosis.\nThe screening laboratory Hannover, Germany is involved in the project. Hospitals that send their dry blood spot cards for routine NBS to Hannover are offered participation in the project.\nParents who want to participate receive an additional information sheet. A parent and the attending physician sign the information sheet as documentation of informed consent, which allows data transfer and patient referral to a specialist in case of a positive result. Molecular genetic screening in the pilot project is performed from the same dry blood spot card used for routine NBS.\nIn both diseases, testing is performed for 2 known mutations: In cystinosis for the 2 mutations most common in Germany, and in PH for the most common mutation in infantile hyperoxaluria (PH1) and in Europe (PH3).\nNormal findings are not communicated to the parents, which may contact the laboratory to ask for them. Parents of newborns with two mutations in the cystinosis gene are immediately informed about the disease by a physician. Further diagnostics to confirm the disease are organized close to home.\nIn contrast, parents of newborns with only one mutation in one of the two hyperoxaluria genes are informed.

        "summary": "Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation is one of the most common genetic mutations associated with tumor development in various human cancers, including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Previous studies have shown that KRAS mutations are present in approximately 70% of pancreatic cancer patients, 35% of colorectal cancer patients, 20% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and 15% of cervical cancer patients. Patients with KRAS mutations generally have a shorter overall survival and increased resistance to treatment compared to wild-type tumors. KRAS mutations have been known for decades, but they have been considered undruggable as effective therapies targeting them were lacking.\nPreclinical studies focusing on colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have suggested that colorectal cancer cell lines exhibit a stronger response to EGFR signaling and activation of multiple RTKs (Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) than non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. As a result, they show poorer responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors, leading to the development of initial and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition. Based on this hypothesis, a phase 1-2 clinical trial, known as the KRYSTAL-1 study, was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The study demonstrated that the objective response rate was 19% with adagrasib monotherapy and 46% with the combination of adagrasib and cetuximab (an EGFR inhibitor), indicating that the addition of an EGFR inhibitor can overcome resistance. Building on this hypothesis, a phase 3 trial is currently underway for KRAS G12C inhibition plus EGFR blockade in metastatic colorectal cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04793958, NCT05198934).\nIn this study, the aim is to investigate the efficacy of sotorasib (KRAS G12C inhibitor) plus panitumumab (EGFR inhibitor) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C mutations, who have failed standard treatments.",

        "summary": "Gingival recessions (GR) are often associated with non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL), resulting, thus, in a combined defect. This mucogingival condition has a different treatment prognosis when compared with a GR without wearing surface associated and frequently requires a surgical-restorative approach to achieve better esthetics and functional results. A limited number of clinical studies assessed different multidisciplinary protocols for the management of single combined defects and there is evidence that the use of dental materials does not harm the periodontal tissues and does not influence the root coverage obtained by means of subepithelial connective tissue graft (CTG). Although the association between coronally advanced flap (CAF) and CTG provides more predictable and stable outcomes in the long term, its use is related to some drawbacks. Different biomaterials have been developed to overcome these limitations as a possible alternative to autogenous graft. However, despite its potential, there is a lack of studies evaluating its use in treating this type of condition. Thus, this study aims to assess from a clinical and esthetics point of view and patient-centered outcomes, the use of a new collagen matrix (Geistlich Fibro-Gide\u00ae) associated with CAF for the management of single combined defects. For such purpose, 50 patients with single RT1 gingival recessions associated with NCCL will be enrolled and randomly allocated to one of the following groups: control group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap for root coverage (PR+CAF) and test group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap associated with volume stable collagen matrix (PR+CAF+VCMX). The two groups will be compared regarding the clinical parameters, among which bleeding on probing (BOP), biofilm accumulation (IP), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession reduction (RecRed), and the percentage of combined defect coverage (%CDC). Patient-reported outcomes such as post-surgery pain and discomfort, time to recover, the decrease of dentin hypersensitive, and aesthetics will be gathered.

The morbidity is high, both digestive and neurological. ECUN can lead to complications at short-term (death, intestinal stenosis) and at long-term (neuro-cognitive disorders).

Living with acquired blindness not only lowers the quality of life of these individuals, but also strains society's limited resources for assistance, care and rehabilitation. However, to date, there is no effective treatment for man patients who are visually handicapped as a result of degeneration or damage to the inner layers of the retina, the optic nerve or the visual pathways. Therefore, there are compelling reasons to pursue the development of a cortical visual prosthesis capable of restoring some useful sight in these profoundly blind patients.\nHowever, the quality of current prosthetic vision is still rudimentary. A major outstanding challenge is translating electrode stimulation into a code that the brain can understand. Interactions between the device electronics and the retinal neurophysiology lead to distortions that can severely limit the quality of the generated visual experience.

        "summary": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have long been linked to mental health problems in adulthood. In the case of cancer, no study has considered that such an anteriority could make patients more vulnerable emotionally, even though the presence of reactionary disorders such as stress, anxiety or depression are characteristic of such a pathology. Activated during periods of stress and therefore during the illness, even the attachment system is mobilized and must be considered to allow more understanding of the illness experience. The attachment style can be seen here as an individual dimension that plays a role in the emotional regulation and resilience of patients. It is also particularly solicited during the remission phase, a complex and singular period of cancer disease that confronts patients with an ambivalence of hope and fear. The fear of recurrence is a concern that the cancer may return or progress in the same organ or in another part of the body. This is a determining factor in the occurrence of anxiety-depressive disorders. Finally, several studies have shown a strong association between depression/anxiety and Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) after treatment, especially during the remission phase.\nACEs leave physiological and epigenetic impact that can nowadays be easily evaluated, thus providing additional evidence between adversity, physiological and epigenetic vulnerability and the ability to adapt to life's challenges such as cancer. Life history changes are mediated by changes in cellular mechanisms affecting genome expression. It is currently widely demonstrated that ACEs increases epigenetic modifications.\nThe interest of this project is therefore to highlight the psychological consequences related to the occurrence of cancer in the developmental history (in terms of adversities) of patients who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, taking into account the patients' previous attachments, resilience, fear of recurrence and perceived fatigue in order to consider their interactions and their effects on their psychological health and ultimately on their quality of life.",

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a cancer of grave prognosis, with only about 10% of patients alive at 5 years after diagnosis. Primary surgical resection is feasible in about 10-15% of patients with an early-stage disease. Another 30-35% of patients have locally advanced disease with invasion into major vasculature but without detectable metastases. Surgery offers a chance of cure. The introduction of adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy has improved prognosis after surgery.\nIn the management of patients with PDAC, the role of neoadjuvant therapy is less certain. Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer can in theory control early systemic spread and improve rate of having no macroscopic or microscopic residual tumor (R0 resection). In the The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC-5) study, neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy did not increase rate of resection who had borderline-resectable disease but appears to improve overall survival (OS).\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may represent a new paradigm in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a 40 kDa membrane protein not expressed in normal cells, but highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells, such as mesothelioma, lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer. MSLN is expressed about 80% of PDAC.\nThere are several immunotherapies targeting MSLN for PDAC treatment, including antibody-based drugs (monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins), vaccines, and CAR-T cell therapy.\nThe safety of CAR-T cells targeting MSLN in the treatment of cancers has also been verified in several clinical trials on lung cancers (NCT01583686, NCT02414269, NCT01355965). Professor Li Peng's group at the Chinese Academy of Science designed third generation CAR-T cells targeting MSLN and validated their use in both human PDAC cell lines, animal models, and in 4 patients with advanced malignancies. In a 42-year-old man with metastatic PDAC, the MSLN targeted CAR-T treatment led to complete response follow several hepatic artery infusion and intravenous infusion. These early cases confirmed the safety of these MSLN targeted CAR-T cells.\nIn the current proposed feasibility study, the researcher hypothesise that Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided injection of MSLN targeted CAR-T cells into PDAC can induce a tumor response, improve rate of R0 resection and translate into better patient survival.",

As inheritance of early studies, a value of 50-60 mmHg has been historically accepted as the gold standard MAP. However, in the last decades, the CPB management has remarkably changed, thanks to the evolution of technology and the availability of new biomaterials. Therefore, as already highlighted by the latest European Guidelines, the current management of CPB can no longer refer to those pioneering studies. To date, only few single-centre studies have compared different strategies of MAP management during CPB, but with contradictory findings and without achieving a real consensus. Therefore, what should be the ideal strategy of MAP management during CPB is still on debate. This trial will be the first multicentre, randomized, controlled study to compare three different strategies of MAP management during the CPB.\nMethods: We described herein the methodology of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing three different approaches to MAP targeting during CPB in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery: the historically accepted standard MAP (50-60 mmHg), the high MAP (70-80 mmHg) and the patient-tailored MAP (comparable to the patient's preoperative MAP). It is the aim of the study to find the most suitable management in order to obtain the most adequate perfusion of end-organs during cardiac surgery. For this purpose, the primary endpoint will be the peak of serum lactate (Lmax) released during CPB, as index of tissue hypoxia.

        "summary": "Alcohol use is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions (see ICD-10) and in France, alcohol is the first cause of hospitalization. Binge drinking (BD) has emerged as a major public health issue among student populations and is associated with negative consequences and social, cognitive and brain alterations. More than half of French university students have reported BD in the past month and are at increased risk of several alcohol-related consequences such as memory and sleep impairments, and reduced quality of life. BD is also a major risk factor in the development of alcohol addiction, with individual and environmental factors playing a role that is still poorly understood. Moreover, most students and young adults are reluctant to seek interventions when it is provided by health care professionals (only 4-5%) and have poor insight with regard to their alcohol use patterns / habits. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing effective prevention and intervention programs to reduce alcohol drinking in students. Recent studies have demonstrated that new types of technology-delivered interventions are promising tools for addressing unhealthy alcohol use. For example, an uncontrolled trial pilot study using a smartphone application-delivered intervention produced a reduction in both number of drinks per week and BD from baseline to 3-month follow-up. A recent review also showed significant outcomes of a mobile health intervention for self-control of unhealthy alcohol use. The investigators hypothesize that a timeline follow-back and personalized feedback based on the use of a mobile application can reduce excessive alcohol intake at 3-months. This study will provide scientific knowledge about BD in students, but also regarding a new type of intervention that could be effective for prevention in non-treatment seeking individuals and reducing the severity of health problems associated with excessive alcohol intake.",

Leuprolide acetate is in a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. It works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body. Exemestane is in a class of medications called aromatase inhibitors which has anti-estrogen and anticancer activities. Exemestane binds to and inhibits the enzyme aromatase, thereby blocking the conversion of androgens to estrogens.

The grades of MG loss (i.e. meiboscore) is calculated as the ratio between the area of the MGs and the eyelids, and this calculation is based on the two-dimensional digital infrared images.In the current formula, the area of the eyelid is the denominator. However, because the eyelids need to be flipped over for the examination and evaluation, and there may be interobserver variability in the measurement of the area of the eyelids. Aging and involutional eyelid disorders, such as ptosis, ectropion, and entropion, may lead to laxity or deformation of eyelids, and impact the shape and area of eyelid area consequently.These factors could cause inaccuracy in current evaluation method, and impact the grading and evaluation of treatment efficacy of MGD, especially in self-controlled studies, such as in clinical trials.\nIn this study, the investigators propose to use a modified calculation formula for the grading of MGs. The investigators could measure the white to white (WTW) distance of cornea, and then calculate the area of cornea (i.e. corneal base area) accordingly.Unlike the eyelid, the WTW distance does not change significantly during aging or between sexes.Thus, the investigators hypothesize that using the corneal base area as the new denominator in the formula for the grading of MG loss is a better way comparing with the conventional method.",

Some epidemiological studies report that infants experience an average of 7.5-14 painful procedures per day per infant during the first 14 days of their hospitalization.\nThe most significant problem encountered in understanding pain in infants is the lack of verbal expression of pain. Newborns express their pain with nonverbal behavioral expressions. Therefore, any pain assessment is based on the ability to recognize the pain symptoms of others. The pain experienced may cause physiological imbalances and abnormalities in brain development and stress response in infants in the short and long term. It can negatively affect family-infant communication, as well as cause emotional and psychosomatic problems later in life.\nToday, music therapy has positive effects on reducing stress, reducing pain, oxygen saturation level, and peak heart rate values in providing individualized developmental care of the infant in neonatal intensive care units. Heart sound, babies hear the mother's heart sound the most during the intrauterine period in the womb. Therefore, when babies hear the sound, they are familiar with in the womb, they will feel safe and a sense of relaxation will occur in the baby.

Advances in burn treatment, such as improved resuscitation management, rapid excision of burns, skin grafting, regular dressings, and improved metabolic support, have reduced the morbidity and mortality of severe burns. However, significant challenges remain.\nThe hand is the most frequently involved area in burns and is affected in 90% of severe burns.

Intrauterine retention of trophoblastic debris is not an uncommon phenomenon. These retentions may initially be asymptomatic but are often responsible for persistent metrorrhagia and endometritis.

Sleeping aids like benzodiazepines and other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) have been widely used to help treat insomnia. However, sleeping aids are also known to cause adverse drug reactions such as drowsiness and dizziness, that increases the risk of falls, driving impairment, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and upon discontinuation may cause paradoxical rebound insomnia, delirium, and nightmares all of which exacerbate the initial insomnia. All of the negative aspects of sleeping aid use are exaggerated for older, frail adults.\nSome patients experience an early (young-age) onset dementia with a substantial component of insomnia. Due to the many risks associated with traditional sleeping aids they are often inappropriate in adults living with cognitive impairment and/or frailty. Lemborexant comes from a new class of medications for insomnia. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their receptors orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX2R), which is thought to suppress wake drive. Unlike other traditional sleeping aids, lemborexant has not shown to be significantly associated with driving impairment, rebound insomnia, or dependence/withdrawal symptoms. Also, in clinical trials it only rarely causes the types of adverse events associated with benzodiazepines and other traditional sedatives and is less often associated with discontinuations due to adverse events.\nWhile lemborexant is available on the Canadian market it is unclear how this medication will be tolerated by patients living with an early onset dementia.

Post-operative delirium is a devastating complication, leading to longer ICU and hospital stay, increased incidence of discharge to nursing facility and poorer long-term cognitive outcome.\nDespite the impact this complication has on individuals, their families and healthcare resources, little is known about the causes and potential preventative measures.\nIt is thought that systemic inflammation compromising the integrity of the blood brain barrier is an important contributing factor. Recent data suggests that antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid (TXA) might be able to lessen the inflammation of the nervous system caused by surgery and CPB through the inhibition of plasmin production, thereby stabilising the blood brain barrier. Worldwide, the use of TXA has become standard of care in cardiac surgery and other types of surgery with a high risk of bleeding. It has been shown to reduce bleeding by 25% and significantly reduce the rate of transfusion in cardiac and noncardiac surgery.\nAt Royal Papworth hospital it is routine practice to administer 2g of TXA before commencing CPB irrespective of patients' body weight. We are hypothesising that there is a weight-based effect of TXA on neurological outcomes after cardiac surgery, showing a signal that a higher dose per kg bodyweight will lead to less delirium measured with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score (RASS). We intend to analyse 4 years' worth of patient data (05/2018 - 08/2022)\u037e the necessary information is routinely collected on using the hospital anaesthetic and ICU record.",

The primary outcome measure is the Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) up to 48 hours after surgery, while the secondary outcome measure is 30-day mortality. The study is significant as recent preliminary data suggests that TXA may reduce the inflammatory reaction of the nervous system caused by surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), potentially stabilising the blood brain barrier. However, as giving TXA is considered standard of care in cardiac surgery, a prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing different TXA dosing regimens is not currently feasible.

        "summary": "Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction Surgery (NOSES), which involves obtaining specimens from the abdominal cavity without any incisions, has attracted much attention in recent years, and it has been widely popularized in the treatment of rectal cancer because of its postoperative non-incision, advantages of less trauma, quicker recovery, and postoperative aesthetics. Anastomotic fistula is a serious complication of rectal cancer surgery. For patients at high risk of anastomotic fistula, prophylactic ileostomy is often performed intraoperatively to divert feces and protect the anastomosis. For such patients, rectal anterior resection surgery with specimen extraction via stoma (NOSES with specimen extraction via stoma) is usually performed, borrowing a prophylactic stoma incision to retrieve the specimen, and also realizing the absence of additional abdominal incision. However, this procedure is prone to stoma infection and has a high complication rate (20-40%), which limits the popularization of NOSES surgery and is an urgent clinical problem. Our center has proposed a new stoma closure method (Dumpling Suture Method), which reduces the size of the incision by folding the suture to achieve the effect of hiding the skin incision and reduce stoma infection. In our previous study, 17 cases of the new procedure were completed in our center, and 25 patients with stoma closure by the traditional method were included in the same period for control purposes. After six months of follow-up, we found that the dumpling suture method significantly reduced the incidence of stoma complications compared with the traditional suture method (5.8% vs. 36%), and no additional adverse effects were observed. This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical study planned to recruit 66 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the trial and control groups. The primary endpoint is stoma complication rate at 30 days postoperatively. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dumpling suture method  compared with the traditional stoma suture in reducing postoperative stoma complications through a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial, which is of great significance for the improvement of the rectal NOSES procedure and the reduction of the incidence of stoma complications.",

A recent meta-analysis found that, on average, 31% of patients with PD-MCI converted to PDD within seven years; however, 24% of patients with PD-MCI reverted back to normal cognitive function. Consequently, the false positive rate for predicting PDD among patients with PD-MCI is high, and better predictive markers to define patients at high risk for PDD development are urgently needed. Therefore, a combination of different markers, including clinical, genetic, and other biomarker data, are proposed to increase ability to predict cognitive worsening and dementia.

        "summary": "Specific language and learning disorders (SLLD) affect around 5-10% of school-aged children, or 1-2 child(ren) per class. SLLDs correspond to the impairment of a specific cognitive function and are divided into 5 categories: dyslexia, dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (DSM-5). In recent years, real progress has been made in their clinical diagnosis and management, thanks to a better description of these disorders in the DSM-5 and the advent of rehabilitative treatments (neuropsychology, speech therapy, occupational therapy, orthoptics, etc.). SLLD can occur in a sporadic or familial context (sibling involvement, a symptomatic parent, other relatives who may mimic dominant inheritance with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance).\nIt has long been suspected that SLLD is secondary to multifactorial inheritance, with a combination of frequent genetic variations and environmental factors. In France, in the absence of an obvious syndromic diagnosis, the current strategy is to prescribe array CGH, combined in girls with a search for fragile X syndrome (in boys, this syndrome leads to systematic intellectual disability, which does not justify its study in SLLD). A few genes have been described as being specifically involved in a small proportion of SLLD, most often with de novo variations or inherited from a symptomatic parent. There are no distinctive clinical features to guide targeted sequencing of these genes. Moreover, our recent experience shows that genes implicated in intellectual disability may also be involved in SLLD. Very few studies have been published in the literature evaluating the value of exome sequencing in SLLD. Only two studies have been identified, involving 10 and 43 patients with specific SLLD.\nIn view of the roll-out of the French Genomic Medicine Plan (PFMG 2025), it is important to set up a study aimed at assessing the value of genome-wide sequencing in the etiological work-up for SLLD.\nParticipation in the study consists of:\nan inclusion visit, where an additional blood sample will be taken during the baseline work-up\na results visit (4 months after the inclusion visit)\nOptional qualitative study: semi-structured interview 1 year after the inclusion visit proposed to 20 patients or families with a positive result and to 10 patients with a negative result.",

While ROP is a problem below 32 weeks of gestation in developed countries, it is reported to develop severely up to 34 weeks of gestation in developing countries. In a multicenter study conducted by the Turkish Neonatology Society in our country, the frequency of ROP in very low birth weight preterm infants was found to be 42%, and the frequency of advanced ROP was 11%. The incidence of ROP in babies with a gestational age of 33-35 weeks was 6.1%, and advanced ROP was 6 per thousand. The frequency of ROP was found to be 10.3% in babies with a birth weight of 1500-2000 grams, and severe ROP was reported in 19 of these babies. ROP examination is a procedure that causes pain, deterioration in comfort and physiological changes in preterm newborns. After this examination, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and a decrease in oxygen saturation are observed. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (non-pharmacological) methods are used to reduce the pain and increase the comfort level of the premature newborn.

Long COVID can affects any type of patient and has polymorphic and fluctuating symptoms over time.\nThe Reunion Island is a French overseas department located in the Indian Ocean accounting more than 860,000 inhabitants. It has recorded since March 11, 2020, nearly 491,825 cases of COVID-19 and 961 deaths of hospitalized patients. Reunion's population is multi-ethnic and younger than the metropolitan France's one. It also has a higher prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, two serious form factors of COVID-19. This specific context makes this island a particular study site for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Long COVID.\nIn addition, some studies have confirmed the involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the symptomatology of Long COVID and demonstrated that patients with a Long COVID present a dysfunction of their ANS which is objectified by a reduced Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The regulation of heart rate by the ANS is strongly favored by respiration. A regular slow and deep breathing training helps to adjust the baroreflex, which connect heart rate, breathing and blood pressure. The result of this training is an induced state called cardiac coherence (CC).\nThe investigator therefore hypothesize that respiratory training to CC could re-educate the ANS and durably improve the symptomatology of patients with Long COVID.",

Ibrutinib has also been found to be effective in mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia and marginal zone lymphoma. However, ibrutinib treatment is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), with an estimated 2-year AF rate of 16% in patients treated with ibrutinib during a median follow-up of 28 months. In most studies, AF was identified by reports as a treatment-related adverse event, and systematic screening for AF was not performed. As AF is often paroxysmal, the more intensive the screening, the higher the incidence. In a prospective cohort study of 53 patients treated with ibrutinib for CLL, patients were monitored by pulse palpation and ECG every 3 months. The cumulative incidence rate of ibrutinib-associated AF was 23% at 12 months and 38% at 2 years. The management of ibrutinib-associated AF is challenging due to difficulties in balancing the benefits of anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of stroke and the bleeding risk associated with ibrutinib. AF is a frequent reason for discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy, and can result in significant morbidity.\nIn addition to this arrhythmogenic effect, ibrutinib is also significantly associated with the onset or worsening of arterial hypertension. Finally, an increased risk of serious ventricular rhythm disorders has also been suggested by pharmacovigilance databases, but not yet confirmed by prospective clinical studies.\nThe study proposes a comprehensive cardiovascular approach, at baseline and during follow-up of patients on Ibrutinib, using innovative markers to anticipate patients most at risk of developing these cardiovascular effects, but also to detect them as early as possible in order to avoid the complications they may generate.",

The blood test for PSA is regularly monitored as standard of care.\nAdditionally, the impact of apalutamide on fatigue, cognitive function, patients reported outcomes, health related quality of life will be evaluated using patient questionnaires answered at defined timepoints. The questionnaires will be sent either electronically or via post at week 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 104 weeks after commencement of apalutamide.\nCurrently, the majority of data regarding tolerability and biochemical response to apalutamide has been from large phase III trials, where there are strict eligibility criteria. Real-world data as from the ADAPT study can provide valuable complementary data to randomised controlled trials, which can be used to address the 'generalizability' limitations of randomised control trials and can provide evidence on the external validity of their findings.

Clinical surveillance of influenza in humans and avian species is well organized and has been operating for decades, but currently there is no pro-active systematic surveillance of potential transmission of animal (avian or swine) influenza viruses to humans, only follow-up of people showing clinical symptoms. People working with potentially infected animals have the highest risk. Moreover, they can represent the first steps in a pandemic: if the virus adapts to humans, infected workers could potentially spread the virus to other people.\nCurrently, highly pathogenic clade2.3.4.4b H5 avian influenza viruses are continuously circulating in wild birds in Belgium and the number of introduction in poultry farms has raised, increasing the contact opportunities with high viral concentrations. Several reports of suspected human infection have been made by different countries. In addition, the virus was detected in sick non-human mammals. The large circulation in wild birds thus represents an increase risk of spill-over to mammalian species, including humans, (by contact directly with wild birds, or via outbreaks in poultry). This increased opportunity for accidental spillover to new host species increases the chances for the avian virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.\nLikewise, there have also been an increased number of human cases of swine influenza reported by several European countries. A pro-active surveillance aiming at also detecting asymptomatic infections would allow an early detection of transmission that could help to prevent a new pandemic.\nAs a piloting approach during this specific project, some dedicated sentinel networks among at-risk workers will be initiated: people in poultry farms involved with the management of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza; people working at bird (or more generally wild life) rehabilitation centres or poultry farms; veterinarians working in pig farms/slaughterhouses.",

        "summary": "Pes planus is a foot deformity characterized by a low medial longitudinal arch. It is more common in young adults. With low arch, tension occurs in the plantar fascia. Fascia and soft tissue loading may lead to different musculoskeletal problems such as plantar fasciitis, medial tibial stress syndrome, patellofemoral disorders and back pain. In addition, pes planus can affect individuals' activities of daily living, productivity in occupational settings, and injury risk and performance in sports.\nTreatment of pes planus includes strengthening, stretching, taping and orthotics for the foot muscles. Among these applications, strengthening of the foot core muscles is one of the most common and effective methods. By strengthening the foot core muscles, it is aimed to reduce the effect of the kinetic chain. Pes planus is a postural deformity that affects the kinetic and fascial chain, but the treatment program is usually planned regionally. With fascial continuity and fascial conduction, the tension on the plantar fascia in pes planus affects the gastro-soleus, peroneus longus and brevis, hamstring muscles, iliotibial band and thoracolumbar fascia. Stretching of the plantar fascia, which is included in current treatment programs, has only a local effect and thus cannot prevent fascial chain involvement. Myofascial release, one of the methods used to reduce the tension in the fascia, has been used frequently in recent years. Myofascial release is performed with methods such as manual, foam roller and instrument assisted release. Foam roller (cylinder foam) is a practical myofascial release method that can be self-applied by the individual.\nIn addition to strengthening the intrinsic muscles of the foot in individuals with pes planus, it has been reported that fascial chain involvement should also be taken into consideration due to the tension in the plantar fascia with low arch. This study was planned to investigate the effect of myofascial release methods on lower extremity performance in addition to foot core exercises used effectively in the treatment of pes planus.",

Duodenoscopes used for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), in order to treat different biliary and pancreatic disorders, have been recently linked to infections transmission following the procedures. Given their reusability and their complex design of the tip with a moving metallic component, named the elevator, these instruments must be reprocessed through high level disinfection (HLD) in order to prevent the spread of nosocomial infections. Even strict adherence to all HLD procedures results in a residual level of potentially infectious microbes. In fact, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) postmarket surveillance communication reported duodenoscope culture results demonstrating contamination rates of up to 3.6% for low and moderate-concern organisms and up to 5.4% for high-concern organisms in reprocessed conventional duodenoscopes. As a consequence, at least 20 outbreaks of duodenoscope-transmitted multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) infections occurred between 2012 and 2015, despite reported compliance with duodenoscope reprocessing guidelines. The increasing concern that currents practices of reprocessing reusable duodenoscopes is insufficient, has led the FDA to released recommendation suggesting to develope a newly designed duodenoscopes. On one hand, a way is to generate duodenoscope with disposable components, such as a one-use end cap, which can be removed and allow access to the components of the elevator and other areas of the duodenoscope for reprocessing. On the other hand, an alternative is to produce a fully disposable single-use duodenoscope.

        "summary": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by severe motor and non-motor symptoms, including upper limb dysfunction. Due to the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, PD patients experience difficulties with motor learning and more specifically with the consolidation of motor memory. Recent work showed that intensive writing training improved writing skills in PD. Although consolidation effects were present, difficulties with retention were also still apparent. Besides impacting writing, manual dexterity deficits in PD can also affect the use of touchscreens. Researchers from our lab demonstrated that impairments were most pronounced in multi-direction sliding motions, indicating the need for training of these motor skills. Our lab demonstrated the classic difficulties with retention in PD after one session of training of a swipe and slide pattern on a tablet (SSP-task) as single task (ST), although immediate gains were demonstrated. Therefore, in this study the investigators will examine whether a two-week home-based training program of a tablet-based SSP-training program will lead to immediate and consolidated improvements that are retained in time. This program will combine ST and dual task (DT) training to provide variation during the training period, but also to increase the cognitive challenge during learning, thereby stimulation consolidation of learning. The primary aim of this study consists of investigating the learning effects after two weeks of targeted touchscreen training. Secondary, the investigators will examine whether these effects will also be retained after four weeks without practice and whether targeted training results in consolidated improvements, in terms of automaticity and transfer towards an untrained task. Given the objective recording of compliance to the training protocol, the investigators will explore the association between compliance rates and learning effects.",

        "summary": "Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common source of knee pain in the physically active population, predominantly in women. The incidence rate of PFPS among athletes is 25 percent, which is higher than that of general population. PFPS is caused by repetitive stress and aggravated in athletes by cycling and running. These symptoms are caused by structural or biomechanical changes of the joint, which becomes exacerbated by activities such as going up and down stairs, sit for a prolonged period, squatting or kneeling, resulting in increased compressive forces in the joint patellofemoral. It is characterized by defused pain in front of knee. Other signs also present are the patellar crepitus, swelling, and joint blockage despite being deemed a multifactorial condition with no single cure, PFPS is commonly attributed to muscular dysfunction, for which conservative rehabilitation is the treatment of choice. Historically, PFPS has been linked to impairments of the quadriceps muscle.",

        "summary": "After a hip, knee or shoulder arthroplasty, the evolution is not always favorable. It can be marked by an infectious or non-infectious complication, most often implant failure. In this context, joint fluid aspiration (JFA) is indicated to document a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) or to bring to light arguments for implant failure. Nevertheless, opinions differ on its indication for microbiological identification. Some teams perform it systematically when faced with a prosthesis dysfunction. Others, only in the presence of suggestive signs of PJI. Finally, others never perform it.\nBased on clinical, radiological and biological (CRP) signs, at the preoperative stage and before JFA, we classify our patients into 3 groups: supposedly septic (chronic joint infection), supposedly aseptic (implant failure) or intermediate (Unknown). This last group, often encountered in consultation, poses a diagnosis problem more than the others.\nIn our experience, JFA is an essential diagnosis tool in these 3 groups of patients. It helps to choose the surgical strategy. In addition, the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid as the alpha defensin, the leucocyte esterase and the CRP could provide an additional argument to investigate the infectious origin or not, in particular in difficult cases.\nIn summary, the disagreement on the usefulness of JFA in case of PJI suspicion and any other prosthetic dysfunction, the lack of data on large prospective studies and our questioning about the contribution of JFA in the aseptic and intermediate group of patients, motivated us to set up this study to evaluate the interest of the JFA for the preoperative diagnosis, as well as that of the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid.",

It is the main cause of morbidity and disability in the world with, among other things, an increase in cardio-metabolic risk and a reduction in life expectancy, regardless of suicide risk. MDD is the most expensive medical condition: 10-20 billion \u20ac/year in France. This cost is mainly attributable to the functional consequences of the disease, highlighting the medico-economic challenge represented by the optimization of the organization of care.\nIn France, more than 80% of MDD patients are enrolled in non-psychiatric care pathways, mainly primary care or MSO hospital care (medicine, surgery, obstetrics). Unfortunately, less than half of patients benefit from treatment at an appropriate dosage or duration, thus exposing them to the risks of relapse, recurrence and chronic evolution. It is necessary to optimize this management, in particular by improving secondary prevention, which consists of maintaining treatment in the months following symptomatic remission.\nSeveral support programs (monitoring with assessment of symptomatology) have shown their effectiveness on depressive symptomatology with a favorable medico-economic report, in particular by allowing maintenance of antidepressant treatment. None of these studies have been conducted on French care pathways.\nInvestigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine management (added to usual care) in non-psychiatric care pathways on the evolution of depressive symptomatology for MDD patients. Investigators hypothesize that telemedicine monitoring downstream of MSO hospitalization will increase the response rate to antidepressants at 6 months and reduce the costs attributed to depressive symptoms compared to usual care, in particular by optimizing secondary prevention strategies by maintaining treatment.\nThe main objective of the research is to assess the efficacy of telemedicine monitoring on depressive symptoms and treatments, added to the out-of-hospital downstream care pathways for patients initially hospitalized in MSO (medicine-surgery-obstetrics), compared to usual care.",

Better protocol adherence translates into fewer readmissions and complications, and better 5-year survival. Preoperative elements, especially nutrition and immunonutrition, are topics that need further development to become the standard of care. It has been widely reported that the prevalence of malnutrition reaches 40% in cancer patients at the time of diagnosis. Impaired nutritional status at the time of surgery and cancer-induced inflammation, along with postoperative inflammatory responses to major surgery, increase the risk of postoperative complications, along with a decrease in perceived quality of life.\nImmunonutrition can modulate inflammation and reduce postoperative infections and shorten length of stay by counteracting the immune response induced by cancer. Adipose tissue has been shown to be a relevant source of inflammatory mediators, which may play a role in the promotion of tumor cachexia.\nThe present study is a multicenter randomized control study (RCT) designed to evaluate the effect of preoperative immunonutrition in patients with colorectal cancer eligible for elective minimally invasive procedures, evaluating in particular surgical site infection and length of hospital stay.

In Crohn's disease (CD), bacterial translocation could increase the disproportionate inflammatory response already present and contribute to disease progression by stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune-cell infiltration in the mesentery. Several mechanisms may promote bacterial translocation, such as bacterial overgrowth, disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier and alterations in the immune system.\nIleocecal surgical resection is required in some patients with complicated or refractory CD. Unfortunately, post-surgical disease recurrence happens in up to 40% of cases, probably defining a subgroup of CD patients with a particular aggressive form of the disease.

To achieve this, the bacterial DNA present in mesenteric fat and ileal tissue (inflamed and non-inflamed) from surgical resection samples as well as blood samples from CD patients will be studied.

        "summary": "Open renal surgeries are associated with substantial postoperative pain, pain relief in patients undergoing this procedure is usually provided either by thoracic epidural analgesia (EA) or by systemic analgesics. EA is a very useful option for the management of postoperative pain in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries, but the risks and contraindications linked to EA like hypotension, headache, nerve damage or infection may limit its use. Systemic analgesics in the form of opioid analgesics may give rise to side effects like nausea ,vomiting , constipation , allergy or drowsiness and often provide insufficient analgesia. Hence, other methods of postoperative pain management are desired. Sensory level target according to the incision site Flank (T9-T11) , Thoraco-abdominal (T7-T12 ) and Trans-abdominal (T6-T10). Ultrasound (US) guided erector spinae plane (ESP) block is one of the interfascial plane blocks that target the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerves. Although there is no sufficient evidence for the spread of local anesthetic to the ventral rami, recent reports demonstrated effective postoperative analgesia after thoracic and lumbar surgeries affecting both the ventral and dorsal rami. Paravertebral block (PVB) is a technique where a local anesthetic is deposited into a space found on both sides of the spine, called the paravertebral space. It is a block with a dermatomal distribution of pain relief depending on the level of the spine at which the block is sited and the quantity and type of deposited local anesthetic.\nPVB is effective for pain relief in the thoracic, abdominal and limb regions. primary aim was to compare postoperative opioid consumption rates at 24 h.

This breathing machine is called noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV). The use of NiPPV has been shown to improve quality of life and survival in children. Before it is used, NiPPV must first be tested to see what the correct 'machine settings' are for each child. This is usually done in the sleep laboratory at the hospital during a one-night stay. However, sleep studies in the hospital are disruptive and hard for CMC and their families because of the new environment and limited access to the equipment, supplies, comfort items and the routine their child has at home. Patients and families would prefer to start NiPPV at home but there needs to be more research on this to make sure it is possible and safe. This study will evaluate a new model of care to start NiPPV in the home. CMC aged 5-17 years old and starting NiPPV will be assigned at random, like a coin toss, to start NiPPV in the home or to start NiPPV in the sleep laboratory. The investigators will assess the feasibility and safety of the two ways to start NiPPV. This study will be the first step towards developing a study to evaluate if home NiPPV starts are effective.

        "summary": "This clinical trial tests whether atorvastatin prevents metastasis of resected high-risk stage IIA melanoma.The vast majority of melanomas are diagnosed at an early, localized stage. However, approximately 10-15% of these localized melanomas will eventually metastasize, despite appropriate local treatment. Once metastasis occurs, median survival is less than two years. Melanomas at high risk of metastasis can be identified by gene expression profiling. The investigators aim to treat these high risk melanomas to prevent future metastasis. Statin drugs, like atorvastatin, have been used to treat high cholesterol for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events, but not for preventing melanoma metastasis. Statins could prevent melanoma metastasis through decreasing tumor cell migration, decreasing tumor cell adhesion, and increasing immune system response. Statins are also efficient inhibitors of new lymphatic vessels formation. Since tumor lymphatic vessels serve as highways to lymph nodes and may suppress immune system responses, statins may block a critical step towards melanoma metastasis. Using atorvastatin may have the potential to prevent metastasis and improve outcomes in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.",

CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack tumor cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's tumor cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. Some solid tumor cells have an L1CAM protein on their surface, and T cells can be modified with a receptor, called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), to help recognize this protein and kill these tumor cells. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers.

The pathophysiology of sepsis is based on an inappropriate host response to infection. Certain medical devices with higher adsorption capacity make it possible to limit this inappropriate response and could thus improve the hemodynamics of patients in septic or vasoplegic shock. The preliminary experience of the investigators from clinical data of vasopressor withdrawal in pediatric patients treated with oXiris shows a 50% reduction in the vasopressor score, Vaso Inotropic Score (VIS), for 40% of patients within 24 hours following the start of treatment. Similar results were found in adult patients treated for severe COVID-19 or vasoplegic shock by the other centers participating in the study.\nCytokine purification is an important physiological effect of purification membranes. However, this may not fully explain the rapid hemodynamic improvement of patients treated with an oXiris membrane.\nThe role of angiotensin metabolites (Ang 1-5, 1-7, 1-9) in the systemic vascular tone of patients has been recently discussed. The administration of angiotensin 2 in vasoplegic shock in adults helps correct hypotension.

        "summary": "Mobilization of the urinary bladder off of the cervix is an important step in total laparoscopic hysterectomy, and is always performed before dealing with the uterine pedicle. If the uterus is unscarred, bladder mobilization may not be technically difficult. However, if the uterus is scarred, there can be adhesions not only between the uterus and the bladder but also to the anterior abdominal wall, which can make dissection challenging. Studies of the effects of closure or nonclosure of the peritoneum during cesarean delivery on adhesion formation have concluded that insufficient data are available and that adequately powered and designed trials are needed.\nAs regards the lateral approach, this space was first described by Dr. Shrish Sheth utilizing the utero-cervical broad ligament in post cesarean cases during vaginal hysterectomy. He described that the lateral area; the two leaves of broad ligament remains free and allows easy possibility for entry to dissect whether vaginally or abdominally. While in medial approach, a metal catheter was then inserted in the bladder. The catheter was rotated so the tip was pointing upward, to stretch the bladder pillars. The bladder was dissected with monopolar scissors with the catheter in place.",

        "summary": "The most suitable food for babies is breast milk. It is known that breastfeeding, beyond providing nutrition, has many health benefits for the baby and the mother. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that babies start breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth and breastfeed exclusively without any additional food, including water, for the first 6 months. After six months, complementary foods should be started, and the baby should continue to be breastfed for two years or more. On the other hand, between 2015-2020, the rates of infants aged 0-6 months fed with breast milk alone are approximately 44% worldwide.\nThere are many factors that affect the time of initiation of breastfeeding and the duration of breastfeeding. Some of those; maternal education, mode of delivery, birth weight and socio-economic status. Another influential factor is paternal support. Fathers may want to be involved in breastfeeding education and support their spouses in this process. However, the reasons such as not taking part in the trainings and not being asked direct questions about breastfeeding may cause fathers to feel excluded in this process. It is important to include fathers in education and interventions to achieve breastfeeding goals. Mothers who are supported by their spouses during the breastfeeding process experience breastfeeding problems less and can cope with these problems better.\nToday, it is known that fathers are not given sufficient importance in promoting breastfeeding. Including fathers in breastfeeding education can increase the rate and duration of breastfeeding of infants. This study was planned to determine the effect of breastfeeding education given to mothers and/or fathers in the postnatal period on breastfeeding, parent-infant attachment and breastfeeding self-efficacy.

These satellite chemotherapy infusion centers, typically community-based treatment locations at community hospitals/facilities, freestanding clinics, or mobile units, are reported to be well liked by patients who utilize their services and reduce their travel times and expenses. In these studies patients still remained in the care of their current provider and site and are required to travel to the site for clinical visits and other appointments. It is currently unknown if patients are willing to transfer their care to a different provider to alleviate travel burden. In addition, although increased travel burden has been lower quality of life in cross-sectional studies, no data exists suggesting that these reducing travel burden can improve these outcomes intra-patient, to the knowledge of the investigators.\nThe patient roles of the multiple myeloma clinical providers at the Siteman primary location have grown in recent years.

Based on our previous mutation analyses of 120 patients with high-risk adenoma removed by enbloc resection with subsequent colonoscopy after 1 year, there is a correlation between mutation in exon 7 of the TP53 gene and risk of early metachronous lesions development. The results also indicate that mutation phenotype (mutation profile and burden) of all lesions detected on index colonoscopy can determine risk of metachronous lesions. As not all synchronous lesions were analyzed and the surveillance colonoscopy interval was less than 3 years, this assumption could not be confirmed. In this study it is planned to perform mutation analysis of all synchronous lesions in 200 patients and correlate the data with appearance of metachronous lesions after 1, 3 and 5 years. Moreover, the mutation profile of all metachronous lesions developed during the 5 years of surveillance will be determinated and compared with mutation profile of index lesions from the same localization to verify their common biological origin. This all could help personalize the surveillance program in terms of reduction of the burden on the patient and endoscopic workplaces and risk of developing colorectal cancer in a particular patient.",

Fortunately, stroke that occurs during non-cardiac surgery is most commonly caused by inadequate blood flow to the brain and is, therefore, preventable if it can be detected early. Current clinical tools used to monitor the brain during surgery do not have the accuracy nor the spatial coverage - they only monitor one small region of the brain. In this study, the investigators plan to apply a cutting-edge optical device, tr-fNIRS, to monitor the whole brain during shoulder surgery. The primary aim is to determine any regional differences in cerebral oxygenation (ScO2) and cerebral autoregulation (CA)between brain regions during surgery and especially during various physiological challenges, such as hypotension. The investigators hypothesize that certain brain regions are more likely to develop cerebral desaturation and impaired CA, and are more prone to brain injury than the frontal lobe region which is the traditional monitoring site.

        "summary": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a frequent pathology in intensive care (around 10% of patients admitted to intensive care and almost a quarter of patients on mechanical ventilation) and a serious one, with a hospital mortality rate of 40%. The main measures that have an effect on mortality in ARDS involve adjustments to the ventilator, known as protective ventilation. In the most severe patients, adjuvant measures such as prone positioning and the use of curarisation in the initial phase of the disease can improve survival. All these measures have been included in the latest national and international recommendations. However, a vast observational study carried out in 50 countries revealed low compliance with these recommendations. More than a third of patients did not receive protective ventilation, and the majority did not receive prone positioning when this was indicated. During weaning from artificial ventilation, it has been widely demonstrated that replacing clinician judgement with the implementation of paramedical care protocols improved weaning and significantly reduced the duration of artificial ventilation. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a paramedical care protocol for ventilation in the acute phase of ARDS improves compliance with recommendations and thus reduces mortality and the duration of artificial ventilation. However, implementation of such a protocol requires operational training for all the nurses in the participating departments. Simulation appears to be the training method of choice, as it is a teaching technique that enables technical and non-technical skills to be passed on with good retention of what has been learnt, as well as assessing what has been learnt.

This work aims to evaluate the impact of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced algorithm called Boneview on the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians in the detection of fractures on plain XR (X-Ray). The study will create a dataset of 500 plain X-Rays involving standard images of all bones other than the skull and cervical spine, with 50% normal cases and 50% containing fractures. A reference 'ground truth' for each image to confirm the presence or absence of a fracture will be established by a senior radiologist panel. This dataset will then be inferenced by the Gleamer Boneview algorithm to identify fractures. Performance of the algorithm will be compared against the reference standard. The study will then undertake a Multiple-Reader Multiple-Case study in which clinicians interpret all images without AI and then subsequently with access to the output of the AI algorithm. 18 clinicians will be recruited as readers with 3 from each of six distinct clinical groups: Emergency Medicine, Trauma and Orthopedic Surgery, Emergency Nurse Practitioners, Physiotherapy, Radiology and Radiographers, with three levels of seniority in each group. Changes in reporting accuracy (sensitivity, specificity), confidence, and speed of readers in two sessions will be compared. The results will be analyzed in a pooled analysis for all readers as well as for the following subgroups: Clinical role, Level of seniority, Pathological finding, Difficulty of image. The study will demonstrate the impact of an AI interpretation as compared with interpretation by clinicians, and as compared with clinicians using the AI as an adjunct to their interpretation. The study will represent a range of professional backgrounds and levels of experience among the clinical element. The study will use plain film x-rays that will represent a range of anatomical views and pathological presentations, however x-rays will present equal numbers of pathological and non-pathological x-rays, giving equal weight to assessment of specificity and sensitivity.

        "summary": "Plantar fasciitis (PF), a degenerative injury of the connective tissue in the foot, results in pain-related disability in Service Members and contributes to decreased physical activity and excessive healthcare costs. Even if effective, current treatment protocols may require 6-12 months of therapy to return individuals to pain-free activity. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) uses non-ionizing light to elicit biological changes in tissues resulting in beneficial therapeutic outcomes. Evidence supports use of PBM for other degenerative connective tissue conditions, such as achilles tendinopathy and epicondylitis. A previous pilot study was completed in an active-duty military and civilian population, which demonstrated a positive effect of two PBM dose parameters on function and pain levels in participants with chronic PF when combined with stretching and ice. These positive findings from the aforementioned study are promising in the treatment of this common and debilitating issue, but require the addition of a sham comparison to rigorously eliminate any potential placebo effect of the treatment protocol, and further refine the treatment protocol in order to make evidence-based clinical recommendations. As such, proposing a follow-up study and the addition of an objective outcome measure will strengthen the impact of the study.\nSPECIFIC AIM 1: To assess the clinical effectiveness of photobiomodulation compared to sham photobiomodulation to improve function and decrease pain.\nSPECIFIC AIM 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of photobiomodulation compared to sham photobiomodulation to resolve plantar fascial thickening. DESIGN: A prospective randomized sham-controlled trial to meet the aims of the study.\nMETHOD: A sample of up to 100 active-duty military members will be randomly assigned to the Sham-PBMT or PBMT group. At baseline, during the treatment protocol, and at long-term (3 and 6 months) follow-up, measures of foot function, pain, and plantar fascial thickness will be collected for analysis. The proposed methods will allow the study team to establish if PBMT is clinically effective to accelerate recovery compared to Sham-PBMT and result in resolution of fascial thickening, decrease in pain, and improved function.\nLONG-TERM GOAL: The long-term goals of the research include developing PBMT protocols for broad application to other painful and duty-limiting conditions.",

This poses crucial limitations to understanding how the brain works, and how it is affected by numerous diseases.\nThe central goal of this project is to expand currently available tools for non-invasive human brain imaging, to bridge critical gaps in the neuroimaging puzzle. New methodologies will be developed, focused on ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF MRI) and its combination with electroencephalography (EEG). New contrast mechanisms and technological advances enabled by UHF MRI and EEG will be explored to allow unprecedented views into the microstructure of brain regions like the thalamus, and to capture the activity of large-scale neuronal networks in the brain with high sensitivity, temporal and spatial specificity. These advances will be directly applied to address open questions in the diagnosis and treatment of essential tremor, and psychosis.\nIn general, improved brain imaging techniques are critical for a deeper understanding of how the brain works, and to detect and characterize diseases more effectively, thereby improving clinical management and leading to a healthier population.

Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain iron deficiency secondary to obesity. Among the most studied is the deficit in dietary iron intake or the increase in blood volume that increases the need for the metal. However, one of the most plausible mechanisms linking obesity and iron deficiency is low-grade systemic inflammation, through the iron metabolism intermediate known as hepcidin. The investigators objective is to evaluate the effect of weight loss by caloric restriction on hepcidin and serum iron concentration in people living with obesity and iron deficiency. The study will be divided into two phases: Phase 1: A cross-sectional study (cases and controls) to compare hepcidin levels, iron status and inflammatory markers in people living with and without obesity. The second phase consists of an open-label randomized controlled clinical trial. Individuals living with obesity who are iron deficient will be recruited and randomized to one of 2 dietary intervention groups with 60-day follow-up. The intervention groups will be: diet with caloric restriction rich in protein (with red meat) and diet with caloric restriction rich in protein (without red meat). Hepcidin levels, iron status and inflammatory markers will be determined at the beginning and end of the intervention.

        "summary": "Background: Few large randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence to guide surgical repair of primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair. The purpose of this factorial, single-blind, randomized controlled trial is to analyze and compare the surgical outcomes, functional visual outcomes, complications, and quality of life associated with RRD repair using (A) pars plana vitrectomy only (PPV) or PPV with scleral buckle (PPV-SB) and (B) sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF6) or perfluoropropane gas (C3F8) tamponade.\nMethods: Eligible patients with moderately complex RRD will be randomized 1:1 to PPV or PPV-SB and 1:1 to SF6 or C3F8 gas tamponade. Approximately 560 patients will be recruited to be able to detect a difference of around 10% in SSAS rate between groups. Patients will be followed using multimodal imaging and quality of life questionnaires before and after the surgical repair until 1 year postoperative. The primary outcome will be single surgery anatomic success (SSAS), defined as absence of reoperation for recurrent RRD in the operating room. Secondary outcomes will be pinhole visual acuity (PHVA) at 8-10 weeks and 6 months, final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), final retina status (i.e., attached or detached), time to onset of RRD recurrence, severity and number of complications, and questionnaire results.\nDiscussion: This will be the first 2 \u00d7 2 factorial randomized controlled trial examining repair techniques in primary RRD. It will also be the first randomized controlled trial to compare gas tamponade between the two most common agents. Notably, it will be adequately powered to detect a clinically significant effect size. The use of multimodal imaging will also be a novel aspect of this study, allowing us to compare head-to-head the impact of adding an SB to the retina's recovery after RRD repair and of differing gas tamponades. Until now, the treatment of RRD has been largely guided by pragmatic retrospective cohort studies. There is a lack of strong evidence guiding therapeutic decisions and this trial will address (1) whether supplemental SB is justified and (2) whether longer duration gas tamponade with C3F8 is necessary.",

        "summary": "Engaging in muscle strength and balance (S&B) exercises and has numerous health benefits for older adults, promoting greater mobility, reducing risk of falling, and overall improved health and wellbeing. Given the rising age of global populations, reducing the burden associated with lost physical function is essential to minimise health and social care costs. Unfortunately, very few older adults engage in sufficient S&B exercise to reap these benefits, with a lack of time, self-efficacy and access to leisure facilities cited as the key barriers. Finding innovative ways promote an acceptable and engaging format of S&B exercise is consequently a public health priority.\nOne novel way that aims to address typical barriers to participation in older adults is through the promotion of exercise 'snacks', as opposed to a more traditional, lengthy structured exercise session at a leisure centre. Exercise snacking describes short bursts of exercise that are designed to be undertaken over a short period in the home environment and without the need for any specialised exercise clothing or equipment. In the initial laboratory and cross-sectional and pilot intervention research, the investigators have been testing two formats of 5-minute, twice-daily, strength exercise- and tai-chi-snacking, which has been shown to be acceptable and feasible to implement in older adults. This protocol presents initial efficacy for evoking improved physical function in people aged 65 years or more. The investigators' remote study demonstrated that remote assessment and delivery of 4-week exercise and tai-chi snacking interventions were acceptable and feasible. However, qualitative feedback indicated that exercise programmes may be more acceptable and interesting with simpler tai-chi movements and exercise snacking programme with upper body movements. Nevertheless, the investigators only recruited healthy older adults, doing short-term interventions in previous studies. This study aims to test the effectiveness of progressive S&B interventions over a sustained period in pre-frail older adults.",

        "summary": "Lumbosacral spine surgeries are commonly performed under GA. Perioperative pain following spine surgeries not only contributes to significant morbidities but also hampers early mobilization. Perioperative opioids, though relieve pain but hampers consciousness, increase PONV and delays mobilization. Caudal analgesia can be effectively given preemptively to alleviate pain and facilitate early mobilization. Caudal epidural block places the needle through the sacral hiatus into the epidural space to deliver medications. It can be performed as ultrasound guided procedure with very high successful rates. Single shot caudal block with local anesthetic provides analgesia for 2-4 hours but this can be further prolonged by adding adjuvants like opioids, steroids, ketamine, alpha 2 agonists, adrenaline etc. Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic agent which is less lipophilic, less cardiac and central nervous system toxicity with similar duration of analgesia, has lesser motor blockade and facilitates earlier mobilization than bupivacaine. Dexamethasone is a highly potent, long acting glucocorticoid. Caudal dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of the ropivacaine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pre-emptive caudal epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief in lumbosacral surgeries and to compare the effect of adding dexamethasone to ropivacaine with respect to quality of analgesia, duration of analgesia, hemodynamic effects and associated side effects.",

Anesthesiologists need to be careful to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain during surgery, especially when blood pressure drops. Drugs may be used to increase blood pressure, but some of these drugs can also affect blood flow to the brain.

        "summary": "Shaft fractures account for 20% of humeral fractures and 3% of all adult fractures in France, with an estimated incidence of 13 to 20/100,000 people. Men aged 21 to 30 years and women aged 60 to 80 years are particularly affected. Intramedullary nailing is among the standard treatments for humeral shaft fractures (when surgery is required). Once inserted, the nail is locked in order to limit stress on the fractured bone, as well as possible secondary rotational displacements or malunion. Bipolar interlocking (BI) is typically performed on both sides (proximal and distal) of the fracture site. This procedure is performed under radiological control, exposing the patient and care team to radiation (during the entire procedure). The objective of the treatment is to obtain consolidation of the fracture within 12 months, and to limit the occurrence of irreversible complications such as malunion or nonunion (2-10% at 12 months post-surgery). The unipolar interlocking (UI) technique has recently been introduced. In this technique, locking is performed only on the proximal side of the fracture site. By avoiding the distal approach, potential complications such as radial nerve damage, with the risk of irreversible paralysis (3.8-14.2% in studies of the BI technique in this indication) or the risk of infection on the distal side can be avoided. It also reduces operative time, and consequently the radiation received by patients and caregivers. However, the UI may be poorly positioned, resulting in malunion that requires revision surgery.\nDespite the absence of recommendations due to the lack of existing data, several teams use the UI in routine care. In this context, a descriptive cohort of 121 patients operated on at the Dijon University Hospital5 showed similar rates of consolidation between the 2 techniques (93.8% for UI versus 95.2% for BI, p=0.64), functional scores, and complications, as well as a significant 29% decrease in operating time in the UI group (mean + SD: 63.1\u00b121.3 min versus 88.0\u00b130.1 min for VB, p<0.01).

Once completed people are prescribed regular exercises and asked to exercise to a level of intensity using a measure called Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). However, these measurements may not be reliable. We are carrying out a study to assess if another waking test (modified Rockport test) and asking patients to exercise to a target heart rate are better measures of assessing baseline fitness and exercise intensity.\nAll participants will receive weekly telephone calls to check their progress and be provided with a wrist worn fitness tracker (Fitbit). Participants will be randomised to one of two groups. The only difference between the groups will be the way the exercise is prescribed. In one group participants will be asked to complete the exercises to an exercise level they find somewhat hard. The other group will be asked to complete the exercises to maintain a set heart rate.\nAll participants will be asked to complete an activity log (submitted weekly) as an online form.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of hepatocellular carcinoma patients suffer from advanced unresectable or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Currently targeted therapy alone, or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist, is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.\nOn the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that radiation therapy (external or internal) with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce or even augment abscopal effect in which the tumours away from the radiation field also show significant tumour shrinkage. The underlying mechanism of eliciting abscopal effect includes the increased antigen presentation by the myeloid cells within the tumour stroma leading to enhanced tumour cell killing. Previous case reports showed that radiation therapy alone can induce abscopal effect in mice and human models. However, a robust and concrete evidence of abscopal effect with combinational immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation or external radiation therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still lacking.\nThis study investigates the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation as first-line treatment for previously untreated metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Peri-implantitis is thought to be a disease analogous to periodontitis with a prevalence reaching 22%. Though peri-implantitis is readily recognized as a part of modern dentistry, the exact etiology or an effective treatment regimen hasn't been established yet. Thus, contemporary research is orientating toward acknowledging the aetiologic and risk factors of the disease and of course establishing prognostic markers for disease prevention. Microbiota residing in the subgingival plaque are considered the main etiologic factor of the disease, however, current literature has not concluded on the exact microbial composition of peri-implant lesions. In addition, genetic predisposition has been recognized as a risk factor for disease initiation and progression and several observational studies have addressed the potential association between various gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of peri-implantitis.

The most important factor for survival for many cancer types is the presence of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes (metastasis). Lymph node metastases in patients with head and neck cancer reduce the 5-year survival by half. Sometimes, the disease is too small to be found on clinical and imaging exams before surgery. 111In-panitumumab is in a class of medications called radioimmunoconjugates. It is composed of a radioactive substance (indium In 111) linked to a monoclonal antibody (panitumumab). Panitumumab binds to EGFR receptors, a receptor that is over-expressed on the surface of many tumor cells and plays a role in tumor cell growth. Once 111In-panitumumab binds to tumor cells, it is able to be seen using an imaging technique called single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). SPECT/CT can be used to make detailed pictures of the inside of the body and to visualize areas where the radioactive drug has been taken up by the cells.

        "summary": "Two billion catheters are placed annually worldwide. Of all the people requiring vascular access, nearly a quarter have Difficult Intravenous access (DIVA), a source of multiple punctures. The increased risk of haematomas, haemorrhages, infection, pain and associated trauma is responsible for increased human costs and economic impact.\nTo limit the risks posed by the DIVA, practitioners have solutions such as the per-bone line, other types of lines, and placement of peripheral venous catheter with ultrasound or transluminescence. However, these solutions are not always applicable, depending on the care situation (non-substitutable venous access, fragile patient, etc.) or on the technical platform (available personnel and training, configuration of the premises, available equipment). Moreover, these actions are often taken after failures, in a non-anticipated and non-consensual manner.\nIn order to assess the risk of DIVA, F.Van Loon et al developed in 2016, and then modified in 2018, a DIVA Scale (the A-DIVA Scale) which allows a rapid scoring upstream of peripheral venous catheter placement to classify patients according to the risk of DIVA.\nComposed of five items (non-palpable and non-visible vein, diameter < 3mm, history of DIVA, operator experience) worth one point each, the score allows three categories to be established: low risk, moderate risk, high risk. The study showed that the proportion of first puncture failures increased with the risk of the patients (defined according to the categorized score).\nThe use of a tool such as the A-DIVA Scale is of interest if it allows the definition of actions to be taken in relation to the risk it identifies. In view of this, it appears essential to optimize the management of peripheral venous catheters, particularly for patients with DIVAs. The aim of this study is to develop a graduate and specific response to the issue of multiple punctures. Our project is to create and evaluate a specific algorithm, consisting of a risk assessment (the A-DIVA Scale) and a co-construct decision-making tree (the A-DIVA Tool). Built on the basis of objective clinical data collection and adapted to the possibilities and competencies, this new tool would bring real benefits to the patient in terms of safety (reduction of risks) and comfort (reduction of pain and duration of management), as well as a medico-economic benefit for the institutions.

        "summary": "papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid cancer and has a good prognosis. Surgery is the primary treatment for PTC, and occult lymph node metastasis is not uncommon (20%-80%).The lymph node metastasis of PTC is mostly along the lymphatic drainage path station by station, and most of the first metastasis is to the central lymph node. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association recommendation, prophylactic central lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with primary T3-4 or cN1b without central lymph node involvement. However, PTC with primary site T1-2, no external invasion and cN0 could not be dissected by central lymph node.Previous studies have suggested that prophylactic dissection should be performed to improve disease-specific survival, reduce local recurrence, improve recurrence risk and treatment response assessment, and help RAI decision making. Although routine prophylactic central lymph node dissection may detect occult lymph node metastasis, the need for further dissection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid gland may lead to an increased incidence of complications, while its effect on reducing the risk of recurrence and improving prognosis is unclear, and the impact on long-term outcomes may be small.Previous retrospective studies in our institution have shown that routine central neck dissection does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence. This study was designed to evaluate the benefits and risks of prophylactic central lymph node dissection in cT1b-T2N0 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.

If the prostate moves more than 2mm (about 0.08 in) from its intended position during the treatment, then the radiotherapy team are alerted, and the treatment halted until the prostate moves back into the correct position. The ability to understand exactly where the prostate is throughout the treatment ensures the intended dose hits the cancer and does not accidentally increase the dose to the nearby bladder and rectum.

        "summary": "Balance and weak postural control are most common in children with severe to profound hearing deficits. Children with hearing deficits also indicate behavioral problems related to impulse control, distraction, and disability to maintain attention in the visual modality. Hearing deficit is mostly defined as a communication deficit. Although the communication deficit is an important disorder, hearing deficit co-occurs with other physical impairments such as vestibular disorders. Development and control of the posture are important prerequisites for skill motor function. Children with hearing deficits and impaired sensory organization had weak balance and motor efficiency in many fields. Various studies on motor skills in deaf children have reported deficits in balance, general dynamic coordination, visual-motor skills, ball catching ability, and some disturbances in reaction time and speed of movements. Teachers of children with hearing impairment often complain of non-coordination, clumsiness, and balance deficit in such children, preventing the child from the desired function. So the aim of the study is to determine the effects of Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises on Balance and quality of life in children with hearing deficit It will be a Randomized Controlled Trial and children fulfilling exclusion-inclusion criteria will participate in the study. They will be divided randomly into two groups, using computer generated randomization, into control group and experimental group.

        "summary": "INTRODUCTION A variety of bone grafts and substitutes are available for filling bone defects in the distal radius after corrective osteotomy, but the harvesting of bone from the iliac crest is the gold standard as it allows easy access to corticocancellous bone of a desirable quality and quantity. The idea behind bone grafting is to provide optimal bone formation and structural stability, which is crucial for bone healing. However, the harvesting and use of bone from the iliac crest potentially comes with the risk of complications such as delayed union of the osteotomy defect; size mismatch between the graft and the osteotomy defect; longer operation time; donor site morbidity including nerve, arterial, and ureteral injury; herniation of abdominal contents; sacroiliac joint instability; pelvic fractures; hematoma and infection. As these disadvantages of bone grafting can have a major impact on patients' everyday lives, research is needed on whether bone grafting is genuinely necessary during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation of the distal radius\nOBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to investigate whether harvested bone graft from the iliac crest necessary is during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation in patients with malunited distal radius fractures.\nSTUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study. Patients will undergo the following examinations once before the operation and five times afterwards: 1) the patients will fill out three questionnaires, 2) complications will be noted, 3) the wrist function will be measured, and 4) radiographs/CT scans will be made.\nSTUDY POPULATION All patients over the age of 18 years who have a symptomatic malunion after distal radius fracture and are eligible for surgical correction.\nINTERVENTION Surgical correction in the form of open wedge corrective osteotomy and plate fixation without bone grafting.\nUSUAL CARE Open wedge corrective osteotomy and plate fixation with harvesting bone from the iliac crest.\nOUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes: complications and quality of life.

With the significant increase in long-term survival and increasing age of transplant patients, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, such as those caused by dyslipidemia, have become a major cause of transplant organ failure and recipient death. However, the causes of dyslipidemia after organ transplantation, as well as the effects and mechanisms of dyslipidemia on transplant rejection, are unknown.\nPrevious studies have found that 1. increased lipid levels occur in recipients after heart transplantation; 2. during rejection, hepatic PCSK9 expression is increased in recipients; 3. a high-fat environment increases the immunoreactivity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is suggested that PCSK9-lipid disorder-immune cell interactions may be associated with the development of transplant rejection.\nIn this project, we propose to (1) establish a long-term follow-up system for postoperative cardiac transplantation patients in our department to track the characteristics of lipid changes in transplantation patients, to clarify the link between dyslipidemia and rejection, and to provide a strong evidence-based medical basis for the management of lipids during the perioperative period and in the postoperative period; (2) expand the dimensions of lipid-related assays under the support of the above system, and to incorporate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic research methods to elucidate transplantation rejection in a multidimensional manner. (ii) Expanding the dimensions of lipid-related assays to include transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies to elucidate the relationship between PCSK9 and dyslipidemia in transplant patients; (iii) Adopting single-cell sequencing technology to deeply reveal the potential mechanism by which changes in lipids affect T-cell-mediated rejection of cardiac transplants.

The most radical operations with the best results are the Milligan-Morgan and Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy .\nHowever, the major concern of hemorrhoidectomy is the post-operative pain that occurs in 20-40 % of patients and it is considered the main cause of refusing surgery. The cause of postoperative pain is multifactorial, including the type of anesthesia , hemorrhoidectomy technique. and spasm of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) that becomes exposed after hemorrhoidectomy.

Ruxolitinib is a type of medication called a kinase inhibitor. It works by blocking the signals of cells that cause inflammation and cell proliferation, which may help prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Tacrolimus is a drug used to help reduce the risk of rejection by the body of organ and bone marrow transplants by suppressing the immune system. Methotrexate stops cells from making DNA, may kill cancer cells, and also suppress the immune system, which may reduce the risk of GVHD.

He estimates that the prevalence of disability among women is 60% higher than that of men.\nDisabled women coexist in a dual state of vulnerability where being a woman and being a disabled person have two social disadvantages. Among people with disabilities, women with disabilities (WWD) have higher unmet healthcare needs than women without disabilities.\nCancer is an important public health problem and cause of death all over the world. Among the most common cancers in women; breast, uterine corpus, ovarian and cervix cancers are seen to be prominent, respectively. It is known that with regular examinations and screenings, early diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer increases the chance of treatment.\nInternational studies show that women face barriers and difficulties in accessing reproductive health and cancer screening services. In studies, it was stated that especially women with disabilities living in rural areas had lower mammography and Pap-smear tests compared to women without disabilities. In recent years, the Health Belief Model has been used frequently to examine the effect of health beliefs on cancer screening behaviors in women and to increase screening rates. The model explains the beliefs and attitudes that affect individuals' behaviors. According to the model; If a person has a desire to prevent illness or a belief in recovery, he recommends taking a specific health action to prevent illness as a positive behavior. It was emphasized that nurses have important roles and responsibilities in the protection and development of health, and that they can identify individuals with disabilities who are considered fragile, and provide health education and counseling to these groups. It is thought that the disabled-friendly accessible health care practices under the guidance of the Health Belief Model will bring the preventive health care behavior of women with disabilities to the desired level.\nDisabled women experience inequalities in benefiting from routine health services and health screening services in special areas such as reproductive health and protection from women's cancers.

        "summary": "Cognitive impairment is one of the commonly reported Long COVID symptoms, mainly in terms of memory, attention, and executive function. The cognitive symptoms of Long COVID are similar to brain fog or chemo brain, manifested as low energy, disorientation, difficulties in attention and communication which are common conditions in cancer patients after chemotherapy. Given the negative impact of such cognitive impairment in daily living and working, it is important to develop effective treatment and self-management techniques to enhance cognitive functions in COVID-19 survivors. Acupuncture, acupressure, dantian breathing, and qigong are promising treatment and self-management techniques to remedy the cognitive impairment in people with Long COVID. Since acupressure, dantian breathing, and qigong are feasible for self-practice, they can be trained to promote a healthy lifestyle. The present study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture, lifestyle management (including dantian breathing, qigong, and acupressure), and acupuncture + lifestyle management to improve general cognitive function of people with Long COVID symptoms, compared with wait-list control. We will recruit 100 COVID-19 survivors who experience at least mild cognitive impairment and/or self-complaint of cognitive difficulty for at least 12 weeks after clinical recovery from COVID-19 infection. They will be randomly assigned to the following groups: (1) Acupuncture Group; (2) Lifestyle Management Group; (3) Acupuncture + Lifestyle Management Group; and (4) Waitlist Control Group. Acupuncture and lifestyle management will each take 8 weeks, with two 50-min sessions per week. Primary outcome is general cognitive function.

In knee OA, measuring the distance between the tibia and femur, known as the joint space width (JSW), is an often-used method to quantify the progression of the disease or the effectiveness of treatments, because it is an indirect measure of cartilage degeneration. However, JSW is often measured while the patient is standing (weight-bearing) with slightly flexed knees, with a flexion angle of around 7-10 degrees, while direct cartilage thickness measurements are usually performed while the patient is lying down (non-weight-bearing) with an extended leg [1]. Because of this difference in positioning, it is difficult to compare different JSW and cartilage thickness measures, as it is not clear what happens with the JSW distribution in the joint when a patient changes position between weight-bearing/non-weight-bearing and flexion/extension. In this study, we aim to identify the changes that occur in the knee of OA patients under the influence of weight-bearing and/or flexion, to enable comparing joint space measures from different positions.

The optimal selection of the potency and duration of antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in HBR patients is still a matter of debate. Multiple strategies to reduce bleeding during secondary prevention, such as reducing the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, using single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor, or de-escalating to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor, have been proposed.

This increases the risk of stroke through clot formation in the atrium, but also of heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is a major cause of stroke, accounting for more than 25% of all strokes. In addition, a quarter of ischemic strokes remain without an obvious cause at the end of hospitalization, and it is recommended that atrial fibrillation be detected intensively with long-term heart rhythm recording. Implantable loop recorders can detect 30% of atrial fibrillation cases over the 3-year battery life of these devices, after a stroke of undetermined origin. However, these devices require a small operation to implant them under the skin, and they are expensive.\nThe hypothesis of this study is that MRI imaging of the left atrium would enable better selection of patients to receive an implantable loop recorder. MRI can quantify the proportion of the left atrium with scar tissue, which is likely to favour the onset of atrial fibrillation. If the results confirm this hypothesis, the number of patients requiring an implantable loop recorder could be reduced, and perhaps an anticoagulation strategy based on MRI data could be introduced.\nIn addition to the usual follow-up by cardiologists and neurologists, participation in this study involves a cardiac MRI (with contrast agent) within 3 months of the stroke.",

Hospital readmissions are an undesirable occurrence that can increase cost for hospitals, and can cause further negative outcomes for patients. Identifying factors that increase a patient's chances of being readmitted to the hospital, as well as developing an intervention to effectively reduce this risk, has historically been challenging.\nOur new method uses a combination of common features such as diagnosis and length of hospital stay, with a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, the RecuR Score model developed by the University of Maryland Medical System, that identifies patients at the highest risk of having an unplanned hospital readmission. Participants identified as higher risk will then be enrolled into our pilot where they will be randomized to receive either the standard of care treatment or an enhanced protocol that includes additional disease education, coordination of home health services, and a focus on their readmission during existing multidisciplinary team huddles.\nThe main goal of this study is to reduce unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of initial discharge, in those most at risk of being readmitted, using the aforementioned novel methods for identifying these participants and a transitional care intervention. This success of this goal will be analyzed across different readmission risk levels in the study population.

This procedure is called primary percutaneous coronary intervention (or primary PCI for short).\nAn angiogram is a routine procedure that involves insertion of fine plastic tube (catheter) into either the groin or wrist under local anaesthetic.

The investigators implement a peer-mediated intervention in inclusive preschool classrooms, randomly assigned to treatment (n=12) or control (n=13) conditions. A focal child is identified in each classroom, representing a child with LI (3 to 5 years of age) who exhibits the poorest pragmatic-language skills and highest level of social exclusion in the classroom. Over a 12-week period, the focal children will receive peer-mediated intervention from identified peers, who use strategies to engage the focal child socially during center time, as supported by a classroom facilitator (teacher, aide). Outcomes of interest include the overarching classroom social network and its embedded socialization processes (e.g., frequency of child-to-child interaction), the focal child's interactions with peers and exposure to peer talk, and the focal child's social, behavioral, and linguistic skills. The study employs state-of-the-art social network analyses to represent the classroom network at the child, dyad, and network level and is dynamically modeled over the academic year using advanced location-tracking technologies and voice-activated recorders to capture incoming and outgoing peer talk for the focal child. The investigators anticipate the results of this study to yield significant theoretical and scientific impact.

        "summary": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive lung cancer subtypes, accounting for approximately 15-20% of total lung cancer cases. Although SCLC is relatively sensitive to chemotherapy, it is highly susceptible to recurrence. The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the clinical practice of oncology, and the newly released results of the ASTRUM-005 study have led to the incorporation of Serplulimab into the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC. Although immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is currently the most promising regimen, due to the limited understanding of genetic alterations and the marked genetic heterogeneity of SCLC, treatment responsiveness varies greatly. Thus, there is an urgent need to find molecular biomarkers that can effectively predict prognosis and further suggest the effectiveness of this new treatment mode.\nMinimal residual disease (MRD) refers to the presence of tumor cells disseminated from the primary lesion to distant organs in patients who lack any clinical or radiological signs of metastasis or residual tumor cells left behind after local therapy that eventually lead to local recurrence. These years, the development of real-time, high-sensitivity liquid biopsy assays have enabled the identification of MRD in individual patients with cancer. Multiple studies have demonstrated that detection of MRD dynamics following definitive therapy for solid cancers is strongly prognostic and has extremely high positive predictive value for risk of recurrence and treatment efficacy.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the predictive value of MRD dynamics on disease prognosis before and after the first-line treatment of Serplulimab in combination with chemotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC.",

This can result in feeding intolerance, which is expressed by abdominal distension, regurgitation or vomiting, irregular transit and abdominal discomfort. This feeding intolerance influences the length of hospitalization and can lead to necrotising enterocolitis, a major complication.\nIn the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Clermont-Ferrand hospital center, abdominal massages have been performed by physiotherapists for several years in order to improve the condition of the digestive system. However, the indication for abdominal massage is very dependent on the caregivers in charge of the newborn and the evaluation of the abdominal condition remains subjective with a great variability between examiners. Thus, some newborns will receive massage multiple times a day while others will not.\nDevelopmental care is essential for these premature infants, especially to avoid over-stimulation. It is important not to add care, such as massage, if it is not needed. It is therefore essential to properly assess the digestive status of premature babies in order to determine whether they have feeding intolerance and whether they require treatment with abdominal massage.\nTo date, the investigators have not found measurable criteria or existing scales that can describe the digestive status of newborns.

        "summary": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective approach for treating both benign and malignant blood disorders. It primarily involves high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate tumor cells within the patient's body, as well as to suppress the recipient's hematopoiesis and immune function. The transplantation replaces the recipient's original hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with donor-derived HSCs, thereby reconstructing the donor's hematopoietic and immune functions to achieve disease cure.\nPoor graft function (PGF) following transplantation, which refers to inadequate engraftment of the transplanted hematopoietic stem cells, is one of the major factors limiting the effectiveness of allo-HSCT. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), identified within the bone marrow stroma, are a type of non-hematopoietic multipotent stem cells. Several studies, including previous research by our research team, suggest that MSCs can improve the bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment by secreting various cytokines. This leads to the promotion of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, enhancement of hematopoietic function, and support for hematopoiesis as well as direct or indirect promotion of vascular regeneration in damaged tissues and organs.\nTherefore, exploring the efficacy of umbilical cord-derived MSCs in treating poor graft function after allo-HSCT, observing the recovery of blood parameters in patients with poor engraftment, monitoring transplantation-related complications and immune reconstitution, and conducting preliminary investigations into the underlying mechanisms can contribute to the exploration of new clinical techniques for the treatment of PGF following allo-HSCT.",

Taken together, these effects explain why PP improves oxygenation, limits the occurrence of ventilator-induced lung injury and improves survival.\nProne position is simple to perform in infants and in some neonatal and pediatric intensive care units is already commonly accomplished. However, a detailed analysis of the respective effects of high PEEP and prone position is lacking in infants/children with ARDS, while these two tools may interfere and/or act coherently. A recent multicenter, retrospective analysis of patients with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) describes how patients managed with lower PEEP relative to FIO2 than recommended by the ARDSNet model had higher mortality, suggesting that future clinical trials targeting PEEP management in PARDS are needed.

Subepithelial connective tissue graft (sCTG) is considered the gold standard in root coverage. However, over the years, several materials have been attempted to accelerate wound healing and to decrease the post-operative patient discomfort and pain, which are considered the most common disadvantages of tissue harvesting from the palate. Reharvesting from the same region could be necessary in some complicated gingical recessions. For this reason, patients may face long treatment times due to recovery periods of the palate between surgeries.\nPlatelet-rich fibrin (PRF) which has 3-dimensional fibrin matrix structure contributes to regeneration of surgical wounds by releasing growth factors for 10-14 days and showing angiogenic properties.\nIn medicine and dentistry, ultrasonography (USG) method can be used to measure tissue thickness, vascularization, elasticity and blood flow. USG, as a non-invasive method, can provide objective data in evaluating the effects of surgical techniques and biomaterials used on soft tissue healing dynamics and tissue perfusion.\nThe investigators hypothesised that leukocyte rich PRF (L-PRF) application to the palatal area after sCTG harvesting could increase palatal tissue thickness and vascularity throughout 3-month follow-up period compared to the controls. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of the L-PRF membrane on soft tissue donor site healing after harvesting sCTG in terms of wound healing dynamics using USG method.",

It is one of the most significant causes of orofacial pain, along with dental pain. In TMD syndrome, the cause of pain is often due to overloading of the masticatory muscles rather than primary changes in the joints themselves.\nNowadays, doctors who treat patients with TMD have no doubt that one of the very important etiological factors of this condition is psycho-emotional disorders (excessive nervous excitability, anxiety, depression), which has been confirmed by numerous authors of studies on this subject [4-11].\nThe etiology of TMD is complex and multifactorial. Numerous factors may also contribute to the development of the disorder. An important factor affecting the state of masticatory function is an increase in stress levels (psycho-emotional tension). Structures such as the hypothalamus, reticular formation and limbic system have a decisive influence on the emotional state of each patient The activity of the limbic system, which governs the emotions of adults, and the additional connections of the gamma loops to the masticatory muscles, determine that increased emotional tension translates into a significant increase in the contractile activity of the masticatory muscles.\nTMD and functional disorder of the masticatory muscles are the most common complaint of the patients, seeking treatment in dental office. The two main symptoms of TMD problems are pain and dysfunction. Myalgia -the most common cause is an increased level of muscle use. It is related to vasocontraction of relevant arteries and accumulation of metabolic waste product in the muscles.

        "summary": "Allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis affect more than 25% of the world population and are the leading cause of illness in children. The complex interplay between genetic, environmental and immunological risk factors results in the manifestation of allergic diseases . The pathological presentation of allergic disease involves the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in a multifaceted response in specific target tissues such as the airways . This response results in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to target tissues and the production of specific IgE antibodies, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators [11], [12]. It is well established that allergic inflammation triggers neuronal dysfunction, which activates specific inflammatory mechanisms, potentially leading to structural changes in the diseased tissue . Neurotrophins are a family of structurally related proteins initially discovered to be involved in regulating neuronal development and now known to govern both peripheral and central nerve growth.\nBDNF is a secretory protein belonging to the neurotrophin family and is involved in a range of neural processes during human development [19], [20]. In the early stages of development BDNF is essential for neurogenesis, survival and maturation of neuronal pathways. In the adult, alongside neurotransmitters, hormones and other neurotrophins, BDNF maintains synaptic plasticity, dendritic growth and the consolidation of long-term memory. The biological effect of BDNF is mediated via its binding to the trkB receptor. The activation of these receptors on eosinophils may be important in regulating the inflammatory cascade leading to allergic disease [15], [24]. Neurotrophin mediated activation of bronchial eosinophils might therefore play a role in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation in allergic asthma .\nThe BDNF gene is located on chromosome 11p13 and is alternatively spliced resulting in several different transcripts [26]. Genetic polymorphisms in BDNF have been associated with allergic phenotypes such atopic dermatitis [27] and asthma [28], [29], [30], [31] in different populations. The functional polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met) has been shown to regulate intracellular trafficking and affect the secretion of BDNF [32]. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that is expressed in the glandular, nasal epithelium, and peripheral nerves in the nasal mucosa, has been shown to induce biochemical and structural changes in nerves that can lead to hyper-responsiveness [33], [34], [35] The biological effects of neurotrophins are mediated by binding either to the high-affinity tyrosine kinase (trk) receptors or to the low-affinity receptors known as pan-neurotrophin receptor p-75.",

Up to 10% of community dwelling older adults have depressive symptoms in Europe. Older adults are also subject to chronic illnesses which further exacerbate psychological symptoms. Furthermore, normal aging is associated with decline in cognitive functioning. Given the prevalence of mental health problems and cognitive difficulties in older adults, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) could be helpful in this population. Accordingly, a growing number of studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions in the elderly have beneficial effects on psychological health (decrease in depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and increase in general mood and positive affect) and cognition (enhanced attention, executive functions).\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique which can be useful to study the neurophysiological correlates of mindfulness, and give neurobiological evidence of its beneficial effect in the elderly.

A combination of low intensity resistance exercise and blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy has been shown to elicit responses similar to high intensity resistance exercise with reduced risk. We hypothesize that chronic low intensity resistance exercise combined with BFR will improve muscular strength, reduce skeletal muscle atrophy, and will enhance recovery.\nTherefore, the specific aims of this study are as follows:\nDetermine if BFR added to standard post-operative rehab will prevent skeletal muscle atrophy and promote skeletal muscle growth during 12-weeks of rehab training compared to traditional rehab alone. The working hypothesis, founded on previous literature, is that combined rehab and BFR will enhance skeletal muscle growth and prevent atrophy to a greater extent than rehab alone.\nDetermine if BFR added to standard post-operative rehab will improve muscular strength following surgery compared to traditional rehab alone. Because strength can be attributed to skeletal muscle mass, the working hypothesis, founded on previous literature, is that combined rehab and BFR will enhance skeletal muscle strength and fatigue resistance to a greater extent than rehab alone.\nDetermine if BFR added to standard post-operative rehab will improve functional outcomes following surgery compared to traditional rehab alone.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) is the first-line imaging test in patients with suspected obstructive CAD. However, in most patients, cCTA shows non-obstructive CAD. The management of patients with non-obstructive CAD is unclear. This is due to the lack of cCTA-based methods capable to assess the risk of disease progression towards developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) based on the atherosclerosis characteristics of each patient. A solution for prognostication in these patients is particularly appealing since it could allow to identify patients who can benefit of a more aggressive medical treatment and management, thus improving outcome.\nProposed methods, which include qualitative evaluations such as the identification of adverse atherosclerotic plaque characteristics or quantitative evaluations such as the quantification of atherosclerotic plaque burden, may in some cases suffer of limited reproducibility between operators and software. Most importantly, each single biomarker is insufficient to accurately predict patient risk, hence potential synergic integration of cCTA and clinical biomarkers is the key to efficiently guide the personalization of patient's management.

To improve survival, researchers need to find ways to identify returning disease earlier.\nObjective:\nTo find out if the radiotracer 18F-fluciclovine (a substance injected into the blood during imaging scans) is better at detecting MM than the one (18F-FDG) currently used for this purpose.\nEligibility:\nAdults aged 18 years or older with MM. The MM may be newly diagnosed (NDMM); or it may have returned or failed to respond after at least 1 prior line of treatment (RRMM).\nDesign:\nParticipants will be screened. They will have blood tests. They will have a positron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (CT) scan using 18F-FDG. The radiotracer will be injected into a vein. Then participants will lie on a table while the PET/CT scan takes images of their body.\nAll participants will have 3 study visits. During each visit they will have:\nTwo PET/CT scans. One with 18F-FDG, one with 18F-fluciclovine.\nAn optional magnetic resonance imaging scan.\nA bone marrow biopsy.

        "summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that often results in motor and/or cognitive impairment. Epidemiologically, the onset occurs between the ages of 20 and 40, with a peak around the age of 30.\nMS is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of signs and symptoms, both in terms of the neurological systems involved and the degree of impairment and severity. The most common symptoms include, among others, difficulty walking and lack of balance. The lack of stability and coordination reduces independence and mobility, predisposing people with MS to accidental falls and compromising mobility in daily life. Another symptom that characterises MS is cognitive impairment, which mainly alters information processing speed and short- and long-term memory. MS-related cognitive impairment is detectable at every stage of the disease. Very often, people with MS have co-existing cognitive and motor deficits, which add to the complexity of managing MS. In order to address this condition, a treatment strategy that combines cognitive and motor rehabilitation needs to be identified. Despite the increasing availability of effective drug therapies that may impact on balance, rehabilitation is a very important means to counteract the progression of disability and improve physical function, affecting social participation and improving quality of life. In recent years, rehabilitation makes use of various robotic devices, which are based on repeatable, intense and motivating exercises, integrated with an enriched virtual environment, capable of improving the quality of movement. In light of the literature, which mainly focuses on robotic therapy for walking, this pilot study aims to evaluate the effects of a specific robotic treatment for balance in MS patients.\nThe primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT) on static balance.\nThe secondary objective is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT)\non dynamic balance and walking (assessed with clinical and instrumental scales)\non fatigue and cognitive performance in terms of sustained attention, dual-task cost and cognitive-motor interference;\non quality of life.",

The basic profile in the Emergency ward always has these two parameters. The algorithm automatically identifies patients with a predicted probability of TMA >90% (6); if this criterion is associated with a platelet count<100 x 109/L, an automated warning to the hematologist on-call is issued with an SMS, and the patient enters the TMA diagnostic process defined in the diagnostic and treatment pathways (Percorso Diagnostico e Terapeutico Assistensiale, PDTA).

Current wart treatments do not target the cause of the lesion directly, resulting in variable treatment efficacies and high wart recurrence rates. AV2 is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, that is capable of deactivating HPV. It is however not able to destruct the already infected cells, which raises the need for an additional ablative treatment i.e. salicylic acid (SA). Implementation of AV2-Salicylic acid (AV2-SA) combination therapy would ensure permanent lesion clearance by on the one hand inactivation of HPV by AV2, and on the other hand elimination of the lesion by SA treatment. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of AV2-SA treatment versus standard SA treatment, by comparing cure and recurrence rates of cutaneous warts between the two treatment groups (at 12 weeks and six months after randomization).

        "summary": "Despite technical advances in Medically Assisted Reproduction (AMP), the success of fertility treatments is sometimes limited by embryo implantation failure. The coordinated development of the embryo and the uterine endometrium requires close communication between the maternal tissue and the embryo. In in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo transfer generally takes place between the 2nd (D2) and the 6th (D6) day following oocyte fertilization. Recent studies have shown the advantages of sequential transfer (transfer of an embryo on D2/D3 followed by the transfer of another embryo on D5/D6), with higher implantation and clinical pregnancy rate, fewer miscarriages, more live births, and yet no increase in multiple pregnancies. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommendations continue to prioritize the transfer of a single embryo for all patients aged under 38. To improve pregnancy rates for patients having a single embryo transferred, the study investigators wish to carry out on blank transfer, based on the principle of sequential transfer. The study investigators hypothesize that a culture medium, placed in the uterus before the time of embryo transfer, will modify immune tolerance. The study will test whether transferring the same culture medium in an equivalent quantity as during the real transfer into the uterus 2/3 days before the embryo transfer will improve tolerance to this foreign medium and, therefore, embryo implantation.

MN can be fabricated from a variety of materials, preferably biocompatible polymers. Maltose, a natural carbohydrate, is a safe and biocompatible product that can be fabricated into MNs that are biodegradable and soluble within several minutes. Besides, local anaesthetic agents such as lignocaine can be impregnated within the MN matrix, facilitating its transdermal delivery more efficiently which results in enhanced efficacy. So far, maltose MN efficacy in enhancing the transdermal drug delivery (TDD) of lignocaine and thus reducing the pain experienced by healthy patients requiring intravenous cannulation prior to routine eye surgeries (phacoemulsification, trabeculectomy etc) has not been extensively studied. Hence, the objectives of this research are: 1) To evaluate the safety profile of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch as a means of pain reduction in adult patients requiring routine vein-puncturing procedures; 2) To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of lignocaine in the systemic circulation when the transdermal lignocaine delivery is enhanced through microneedle usage; 3) To compare the efficacy of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch with standard 5% Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) dermal patch for pain reduction during venepuncture procedure based on mean changes in VAS scores and skin algesimeter index (pharmacodynamic (PD) study).",

This may be explained by the prolonged sitting time, next to reduced level of physical activity. Young people spend most of their time in a sitting position while studying (in school class, during homework) and using electronic devices (using the computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablets, or watching TV), and now using e-learning methods. E-learning, and thus prolonged sitting, is a topic that returned to higher education at the beginning of the 2022-2023 academic year because of the current energy crisis. Re-education on sitting posture is a common aspect of LBP management. Physiotherapists recommend many different sitting positions to prevent and treat the negative effects of prolonged sitting. However, there is debate regarding what is an optimal sitting posture. Studies showed that sitting posture with the backrest on the chair induced minimal changes in lumbar lordosis and significantly lesser pain compared to other types of the chair. Even though the sitting posture will be followed by proper ergonomic principles, every position (lordotic or kyphotic) maintained for a prolonged time leads to discomfort and soft tissue symptoms. Studies showed that body perceived discomfort scores increased over time during sitting and after 30 min of sitting is significantly greater than those at baseline. Currently, breaks are recommended for mitigating the adverse of prolonged sitting, but more evidence is needed to verify effectiveness of breaks. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of active break on reduce LBP and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young people with LBP. Optimal combination of sitting and breaks will help to develop ergonomic recommendations for young people. Main research outcomes - exercise protocol and intervention - will be developed to match the needs of young people with LBP and the possibilities of the environment, in order to reduce LBP and musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting, and consequently, maintain health and quality of life.

Oxygen saturation has great importance in determining the triage status of patients admitted to the hospital with dyspnea and planning the emergency treatment [2].\nPeripheral perfusion index (PI), which shows tissue oxygenation is a noninvasive way of demonstrating tissue perfusion in critically ill patients. Studies have shown that PI is an accurate, fast and reliable pulse oximetry-based indicator of tissue perfusion [3-5]. PI shows the perfusion status of the tissue in the applied area for an instant and a certain time interval. The PI value ranges from 0.02% (very weak) to 20% (strong) [6].\nTriage scales are used to distinguish emergency and non-emergency patients. The emergency triage system is used to quickly determine the care priorities of patients during admission to the emergency department[7,8].\nIt is important to make the triage classification for dyspnea in emergency services quickly and accurately to start the treatment protocols as early as. In this study, the investigators aimed to determine the relationship between perfusion index and the emergency triage classification in patients admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea.",
