This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients. This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram.\n\nOfficial Title\n=================\nMultidisciplinary Approach for High Risk Patients Leading to Early Diagnosis of Canadians\n\nConditions\n=================\nHeart Failure\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n=================\n* Diagnostic Test: NT-proB"

Clinicians stratified based on practice specialty, location, and pharmacist referral habits will be permuted block randomized to achieve 45%/45%/10% proportional distribution across the following arms respectively: (1) usual care, (2) multi-prong CDS inclusive of a patient portal message about GDMT, an interruptive advisory upon chart entry as a notification to clinicians on GDMT consideration and a Best Practice Advisory (BPA) that includes a GDMT order set, and (3) multi-prong CDS as in #2 but replacement of GDMT order set with referral to integrated clinical pharmacist co-management. Secondarily, each of the 5 clinical practice sites of roughly equal HFrEF patient loads were assigned to receive either an early or delayed education rollout. Exploratory analyses will look to determine the independent and incremental benefits of education with other interventional approaches.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nEvaluating Strategies to Improve Guideline Directed Medical Therapy: The GDMT Research, Education & Assist Trial for Heart Failure Care (GREAT-HF Care)\n\nConditions\n=================\nMinimum Age: 18 Years\n\nSexes Eligible: All\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers: No\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\nHow is the study designed?\n-----------------\n\nDesign Details\n\nPrimary Purpose: Health Services Research\nAllocation: Randomized\nIntervention Model: Parallel Assignment\nInterventional"

Based on this framework, Holt et al. developed and validated the Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale, which covers three interrelated aspects of counseling quality: information exchange, interpersonal relationship, and disrespect and abuse . The scale comprehensively measures aspects of the counseling process related not only to information receipt but also individuals' experiences having the opportunity to participate in the method selection process and the degree to which they had positive and trusting experiences with the provider . Associations between quality of contraceptive counseling and characteristics of clients, such as age, education, and reproductive status, could represent significant health disparities and indicate the need for research. This study will seek to understand quality of family planning counseling utilizing the validated and client-centered based QCC Scale as experienced by reproductive aged women in El-Dakhla District, New Valley. Furthermore, it will investigate their associated factors either client, provider, or visit factors. Data collection tool Data will be collected through a semi-structured interview administered questionnaire which includes: Socio-demographic characteristics of women such as age, education, occupation, religion, residence, husband's education, husband's occupation. Family planning practice: This will include number of living children, current use of FP method and its type, and suggested causes of discontinuation of FP, previous contraceptive use, and reason for the visit 3-Facility factors such as gender of providers, qualification of providers, type of the health facility (mobile clinics???) 4-Quality of contraceptive counseling (QCC) scale: it is a 22-item scale which measures the quality of care"

In dermatology, BoNT is commonly used for treatment of facial rhytides and is by far the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in recent years. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of BoNT for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although, BoNT has shown excellent safety profile for the treatment of glabellar lines, injection methods vary widely between practitioners and no standardized method for the depth of injection has been established. The most common treatment area is the glabellar complex, which consists of bilateral corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi. With increasing age and repetitive contraction of the glabellar complex, particularly the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus, the formation of prominent dynamic glabellar lines and static, etched-in glabellar lines can form and lead to the appearance a more severe frown. In a study using ultrasonographic imaging and the three-dimensional scanning Cho et al. determined that the corrugator supercilii muscle rested at a depth of 5.7 +/-1.4 mm medially and 6.6 +/-1.4mm laterally and recommended BoTN injections at the depth of 4mm. However, no in vivo studies have been performed to validate this as the optimal depth of injection. In a split face study evaluating the depth of"

Specific objectives: Evaluate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin reduces muscle pain induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol; Evaluate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin reduces systemic (serum) levels of total creatine phosphokinase (CFQ) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity) induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol; Evaluate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin is capable of improving the reduction in muscular performance and impairment of balance induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol. The present project will be carried out through a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study. A total of approximately 40 female athletes pertaining to the Londrina Esporte Clube (name in Portuguese of the team) women's five-a-side soccer will be recruited for the study. The choice of exclusively women individuals is due to sexual dimorphism in pain perception, thus contributing to the results being more homogeneous and reliable. The criteria for inclusion of volunteer participants in the project will be to be between 16 and 35 years old, and to be able to perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol. Exclusion criteria will include locomotor system dysfunctions or use of analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication at the time of recruitment, as well as being on a calorie-restricted diet or ergogenic supplementation.

Their early clinical symptoms lack specificity, and they are often found in late stage with poor prognosis. CIN results from errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. It will generate genomic heterogeneity that acts as a substrate for natural selection. Furthermore, it is proved that tumors with aneuploidies and polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with metastasis, treatment resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that 60%-80% of human tumors exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN. CIN positively correlates with tumor stage and is enriched in relapsed as well as metastatic tumor specimens. Due to the ubiquity of CIN in cancer cells, it is a potentially way to detect CIN in the cast-off cells from the bile samples for diagnosing and monitoring biliary tract carcinoma patients. BileCAD is a new method to detecting CIN in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting DNA from bile, analyzing DNA by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by bio-information techniques, and finally optimizing the management of biliary tract carcinoma patients.The investigators intended to conduct a prospective study by analyzing bile samples from gallbladder cancers and cholangiocarcinoma patients and control groups that without any tumor in the Bile duct and gallbladder or other organs to compare the specificity and sensitivity of BileCAD test for diagnosing biliary tract carcinoma to other modal"

On the other hand, these conditions and deficiency of micronutrients may decrease the acquisition and longevity of Ab responses and memory B cells. To test these hypotheses, up to 200 symptomatic subjects (index cases) will be enrolled when they seek diagnosis for their symptoms of COVID-19 and have their SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed. All their household contacts (anticipated 700) aged 5-75 years who provide consent (participants) will be examined for infection through two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Venous blood will be collected at that time. For AZ vaccinees, at their 2nd vaccine dose, about 90 days after the 1st dose, they will be given a stool sample container. JJ vaccinees will receive the stool sample container when they receive the first vaccine dose. Two weeks after completion of the primary regimen (2nd dose of the AZ [M3.5] and 1st dose of the JJ vaccines [M0.5]), venous blood draws will be repeated and stool containers will be collected. Subsequent visits/procedures will happen at one month thereafter (M4.5 for AZ and M1.5 for JJ), and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the primary regimen.

In particular, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, DAPT is initiated during the index event and maintained for up to 12 months to prevent stent-related complications as well as ischemic recurrences in non-treated coronary segments. Three oral P2Y12 inhibitors are currently recommended in this setting: clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. However, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel based on results of large-scale clinical trials showing their superior reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. Nevertheless, such ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of increased bleeding. These observations are attributed to the greater antiplatelet potency of prasugrel and ticagrelor over clopidogrel. Importantly, accruing evidence support that bleeding complications carry significant prognostic implications, including increased mortality, underscoring the need to define antiplatelet strategies associated with reduced bleeding while preserving ischemic efficacy. The notion that most recurrent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, occur early after the index event (i.e., 1-3 months post PCI) has prompted the design of clinical trials assessing antiplatelet treatment regimens consisting in the use of agents with enhanced platelet inhibition during the first months after PCI followed by approaches with reduced platelet inhibition."

Timely detecting residual/recurrence/metastasis and the clonality is required to implement salvage therapies properly. The major unmet needs of radiotherapy to HCC are the difficulties in early evaluating response by images and timely detection of intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis. Thus, an accurate and personalized biomarker for response prediction and disease monitoring is demanded. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA (ctDNA) has garnered attention as a promising biomarker in cancer patients. However, in HCC, the detection rate is low (9-21.2%), mainly due to the limited prevalence of traditional somatic mutations and the difficult separation of ctDNA fragments from normal cells. The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing RT. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of"

Many autism interventions were developed and tested with only White participants, assuming they could be transferable to minority populations. However, research has found that this is not the case and that interventions that are not adapted to an individual's culture and ethnicity do not work as well and are not used as frequently. In this project, we compare two methods of stakeholder engagement, Design Thinking (DT) and Focus Groups (FG), to determine which is better at getting input on the facilitators and barriers to access therapy for autistic children. We focus on Hispanics and Latinos as this is the largest minority group in the US, with one of the fastest-growing groups of autistic children. Our long-term objective is to improve the functional skills and health of Hispanic/Latino autistic children and their families by improving access to an occupational therapy intervention designed to improve daily living skills, socialization, and quality of life. Occupational therapy using Ayres Sensory Integration (OT/ASI) is the only evidence-based intervention that addresses the sensory symptoms in autism. We will use input from these engagement sessions to adapt two versions of the OT/ASI manual: one using DT data and the other using FG data. Outcomes are evaluated following each step. Following the completion of this project, the planned outputs of the study are data on the most effective minority stakeholder engagement method and a culturally adapted OT/ASI manual for Hispanic and Latino autistic children for clinicians and researchers. This information can support future researchers who are engaging Hispanic/Latino"

The purpose of this study is prevention via improving injury risk biomechanics to reduce the risk of future musculoskeletal injury. Participants will complete 2 testing sessions separated by a minimum of 7 days. During the first testing session, participants will complete single-task serial subtraction, single- and dual-task jump landing, and a theta burst stimulation intervention. The jump landing will be completed before and after theta burst stimulation and under single- and dual-task (serial 7s) conditions. During the second testing session, participants will complete the jump landing before and after theta burst stimulation under single- and dual-task (serial 7s) conditions. On both testing sessions, the symptom checklist and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia 11 (TSK-11) will be administered upon arrival to the lab (after informed consent on day 1), and immediately after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The Godin Leisure Activity Questionaire will be administered on both days before the jump landing. The NASA Task Load index will be administered on both days immediately after every cognitive condition during the jump landing on both the experimental and control theta burst stimulation days. The TSK-11 will be analyzed as a continuous variable ranging from 11-44. Higher scores on the TSK-11 indicate a greater fear of movement.\n\nOfficial Title\n=================\nUsing Non-invasive Brain Stimulation to Modulate Injury Risk Biomechanics Among Individuals With and Without a Concussion History\n\nConditions\n=================\nConcussion, Mild\n\nIntervention / Treatment"

Group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), beta-hemolytic streptococci and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacteria causing non-purulent cellulitis. Patients typically present to the emergency department (ED) with pain, redness, swelling and induration (skin hardening due to inflammation) of the affected skin. A minority of patients may have fever or tachycardia. The diagnosis of cellulitis is clinical. Once the diagnosis is made, the emergency physician must decide whether the patient can be treated as an outpatient or requires hospitalization. The emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n\nThe emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n\nThe emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n\nThe emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n\nThe emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n\nThe emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n\nThe emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.\n\nThe emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous ("

Thus, the placebo effect. There is evidence of the effect of positive expectations on the placebo effect. There is no study that investigated the effect of positive expectations on the placebo effect in patients with chronic low back pain.\n\nObjectives: The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of positive expectations on the placebo effect in patients with chronic low back pain.\n\nMethods: This is a randomized clinical trial with three parallel arms. The participants will be randomly allocated to one of the three groups: positive expectation group, neutral expectation group, and negative expectation group. The participants of the positive expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a positive message regarding SMT. The participants of the neutral expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a neutral message regarding SMT. The participants of the negative expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a negative message regarding SMT. The participants of the positive expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a positive message regarding SMT. The participants of the neutral expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a neutral message regarding SMT. The participants of the negative expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a negative message regarding SMT.

Currently available clinical algorithms lack the capacity to continuously track the dynamic evolution of how the primary core progresses to a final infarct, which, however, is a major determinant of stroke progression,8-10 and is associated with functional outcome.9,11,12 Previously studied blood-based biomarkers such as Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL),13 neuron-specific enolase (NSE),14 glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),15,16 and S 100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B)17 either failed to capture the extent of brain injury within the acute phase of stroke or lack specificity. Plasma levels of brain-derived tau (BD-tau) were recently found to show high value for monitoring brain injury in patients with acute ischemic stroke: In 502 patients with acute IS, plasma BD-tau was associated with imaging-based metrics of brain injury upon admission, increased within the first 24 hours in correlation with infarct progression, and at 24 hours was superior to final infarct volume in predicting 90-day functional outcome.18 While informing on the relation of BD-tau with imaging-based metrics of brain injury after onset and to evaluate whether BD-tau plateaus at different time points"

MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Subjects A total of 50 healthy male students will be randomly assigned to one of two groups of 25 subjects each using a computerized randomization method. The trained group will undergo 3 weeks of EEG-NFB training, whereas the control group will not undergo training. Inclusion criteria for study participation will be lack of any neurological disorders and motor or cognitive deficits, lack of neurological incident in the past, age between 20 to 25 years, male sex, and right-handedness (this inclusion criteria will be to avoid an influence of lateralization and gender on psychological tests outcomes). The study was approved by the ethic committee of the University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw and will be carried out in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. 2.2. Experimental procedure TR and CO groups will be each tested twice in the same time periods, i.e., before 3 weeks period of EEG-NFB training (PRE) and after the training period (POST). During the PRE and POST experimental sessions, all subjects will be subjected to the same psychological tests. Before starting each test, subjects will be instructed to concentrate and to make use their maximal attention skills during testing session. For the 12 testing sessions, all participants will be subjected the same psychological tests. The tests will be performed in a quiet room with only one and always the same investigator present. The tests will be performed in the following order: TMT-A, TMT-B, ST-I, and ST-II. The TMT-A and TMT-B will be performed first, followed by the ST-I and ST-II. The TMT-A and TMT-B will be performed first, followed by the ST-I and ST"

Point prevalence ranges from 6% to 22% and up to 38% of the elderly population, while lifetime prevalence ranges from 2% to 71%. For the majority of the neck disorders there is an absence of an identifiable underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. From this perspective .NS-NP is mainly 'diagnosed' on the basis of clinical grounds, provided there are no features to suggest a specific or more serious condition. Chronic nonspecific neck pain is diagnosed as cervical pain without a known pathological basis (e.g., infection, tumor, osteoporosis, fracture, structural deformity). Characteristic of chronic nonspecific neck is heavy pain, worsening with exertion and relieve with rest. The most effective form of exercise as a method of rehabilitation non-specific neck pain patients.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nComparative Effects of Myofascial Decompression and Positional Release Therapies on Pain, Range of Motion and Functional Disability in Chronic Non-specific Neck Pain\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nChronic Non-specific Neck Pain\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Other: Myofascial Decompression Therapy<br>15 minute's moist heat will be given first.

However, it is important to consider the GI bleeding risk when using DAPT and to determine whether Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed to prevent such accidents. DAPT, or aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, complementarily reduce platelet activation and aggregation and consequently reduce the progression of coronary thrombosis. We have reported whether PPI use is associated with ischemic events or mortality in patients with DAPT up to date, but we have shown conflicting results depending on the type of study conducted. Observational studies generally show that PPI increases all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, angina and stroke, while RCT studies show that it does not. This difference can be explained by the selection bias. This is because observational studies attempt to reduce selective bias through correction of basic patient characteristics, but unmeasured differences in underlying variables continue to affect the results. method : Among patients who performed PCI in patients with CAD, enrollment is performed in patients with moderate risk in gastrointestinal risk assessment indicators. After obtaining the consent form, patients are randomly assigned to the gastric acid secretion inhibitor group and the non"
